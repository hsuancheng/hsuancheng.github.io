Production of sterol metabolites (coprostanol, methylcoprostanol, ethylcoprostenol, ethylcoprostanol, and sitostenone) was observed in the transverse colon (TC) and descending colon (DC) vessels in general, from 24 and 48 h, respectively. Microbial activity was assessed through the production of organic acids, mainly  in all colon vessels, lactate in the AC, and butyrate and propionate in the TC and DC. A higher diversity in the microbial community was found in the TC and DC, in accordance with a higher sterol  and organic acid production. Although the prebiotic effect of galactooligosaccharides was not detected, changes in microbiota composition (an increase in the  genus and the Synergistaceae and Lachnospiraceae families) indicated an enhancement of sterol .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590214>Chemical Compositions of Propolis from China and the United States and their Antimicrobial Activities Against .</a></h2><p>The chemical compositions of ethanol extracts of propolis from China (EEP-C) and the United States (EEP-A) and their antifungal activity against  were determined. The result showed that a total of 49 compounds were detected by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, 30 of which were present in samples from two regions. The major compounds of EEP-C and EEP-A were similar, including pinocembrin, pinobanksin-3--, galanin, chrysin, pinobanksin, and pinobanksin-methyl ether, and both of them showed antifungal activity against  with same minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.8 mg·mL. In the presence of propolis, the mycelial growth was inhibited, the hyphae became shriveled and wrinkled, the extracellular conductivities were increased, and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were decreased. In addition, iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of  in response to propolis revealed that a total of 341 proteins were differentially expressed, of which 88 (25.8%) were upregulated and 253 (74.2%) were downregulated. Meanwhile, the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) involved in energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and , and the sterol biosynthetic pathway were identified.

Polyamine  is regulated by enzyme-catalyzed acetylation-deacetylation cycles in a fashion similar to the epigenetic regulation of histone function in eukaryotes. Bacterial polyamine deacetylases are particularly intriguing, because these enzymes share the fold and function of eukaryotic histone deacetylases. Recently, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase from the deep earth halophile  (msAPAH) was described. This Zn-dependent deacetylase shares 53% amino acid sequence identity with the acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase from  (mrAPAH) and 22% amino acid sequence identity with the catalytic domain of histone deacetylase 10 from  (zebrafish; zHDAC10), the eukaryotic polyamine deacetylase. The X-ray crystal structure of msAPAH, determined in complexes with seven different inhibitors as well as the  coproduct, shows how the chemical strategy of Zn-dependent amide hydrolysis and the catalytic specificity for cationic polyamine substrates is conserved in a subterranean halophile. Structural comparisons with mrAPAH reveal that an array of aspartate and glutamate residues unique to msAPAH enable the binding of one or more Mg ions in the active site and elsewhere on the protein surface. Notwithstanding these differences, activity assays with a panel of acetylpolyamine and acetyllysine substrates confirm that msAPAH is a broad-specificity polyamine deacetylase, much like mrAPAH. The broad substrate specificity contrasts with the narrow substrate specificity of zHDAC10, which is highly specific for -acetylspermidine hydrolysis. Notably, quaternary structural features govern the substrate specificity of msAPAH and mrAPAH, whereas tertiary structural features govern the substrate specificity of zHDAC10.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337804>Citrate anion improves chronic dialysis efficacy, reduces systemic inflammation and prevents Chemerin-mediated microvascular injury.</a></h2><p>Systemic inflammation and uremic toxins (UT) determine the increased cardiovascular mortality observed in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. Among UT, the adipokine Chemerin induces vascular dysfunction by targeting both endothelial and vascular smooth muscular cells (EC and VSMC). As Citrate anion modulates oxidative , systemic inflammation and vascular function, we evaluated whether citrate-buffered dialysis improves HD efficiency, inflammatory parameters and chemerin-mediated microvascular injury. 45 patients were treated in sequence with , citrate and, again, -buffered dialysis solution (3 months per interval). At study admission and after each treatment switch, we evaluated dialysis efficacy and circulating levels of chemerin and different inflammatory biomarkers. In vitro, we stimulated EC and VSMC with patients' plasma and we investigated the role of chemerin as UT. Citrate dialysis increased HD efficacy and reduced plasma levels of CRP, fibrinogen, IL6 and chemerin. In vitro, patients' plasma induced EC and VSMC dysfunction. These effects were reduced by citrate-buffered solutions and paralleled by the decrease of chemerin levels. Consistently, chemerin receptor knockdown reduced EC and VSMC dysfunction. In conclusion, Switching from  to citrate improved dialysis efficacy and inflammatory parameters; in vitro, chemerin-induced EC and VSMC injury were decreased by using citrate as dialysis buffer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656995>Epoxidation is the preferred pathway of first-stage  of abiraterone  in brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus).</a></h2><p>Twenty juvenile individuals of brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), average weight 77 g, were fed by abiraterone  prodrug dissolved in olive oil via gastric probe.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid  that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) , mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) . GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386214>Effects of Alcohol and  on Cerebral Blood Flow: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Acute alcohol produces effects on cerebral  and blood flow.

The experiment was a cross-over design with 2 treatments and 2 periods. The 2 treatments were a basal diet containing 60% barley silage, 30% barley straw, and 10% supplement (DM basis) without (control) or with RFE. The enzyme was sprayed onto the barley straw at a rate of 6.6 × 104 IU·kg-1 DM 24 h before feeding. Each period comprised 2 wk of diet adaptation and 1 wk of sampling and data collection. Feed intake and total tract digestibility of DM, OM, NDF, and ADF were unaffected by RFE. Ruminal pH including mean, minimum, maximum, and duration pH <5.8, did not differ between treatments. Total VFA concentration, molar proportion of individual VFA, and -to-propionate ratio were also not affected by RFE. However, ruminal NH3-N concentration (P < 0.06) and endoglucanase activity (P < 0.08) in ruminal fluid tended to be higher with RFE. Nitrogen utilization and microbial protein synthesis were not affected by treatment. These results indicate that XYL10C did not improve fiber digestion in heifers fed a high forage diet, despite the fact that it was specifically selected for this trait in laboratory assays. However, the increased ruminal NH3-N concentration suggests it potentially increased ruminal proteolytic activity.© Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342726>[Study on effect of extract from Tibetan medicine Urtica hyperborean on anti-prostatic hyperplasia].</a></h2><p>In this study,mouse models of benign prostatic hyperplasia induced by subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate was used to investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Urtica hyperborean( UW) extracts on prostate hyperplasia in mice.

Here, we investigated vascular damage in COPD-like and hypertensive rats, which demonstrated the presence of the three related factors of COPD with hypertension. These include elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which are positively correlated with vascular damage in patients. In addition to increases in these three related factors, COPD-like and hypertensive rats exhibited increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and matrix metallopeptidase-9 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and enlargement of alveolar airspaces, recapitulating clinical findings in previous studies of patients. Moreover, the appearance of these related factors was prevented by linalyl . Our results provide novel insight into the potential of LA to prevent vascular damage and elevated SBP, serum MDA and serum LDH in COPD with hypertension, and could lead to an alternative strategy for preventing vascular damage for patients who suffered from COPD with hypertension in a clinical setting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ACR (50 mg/300 ml) was ingested for 40 days (20 doses) in drinking water on alternative days, on 40 day post ingestion the control and treated tissues were collected for GST purification by affinity column and biochemical characterization of GSTs by substrate specificities, and GST expression by immuno dot blots. In the analysis of the purified GSTs, we observed that liver GSTs were resolved in to three bands known as Yc, Yb and Ya; kidney GSTs were resolved in to two bands known as Yc and Ya; testis and brain GSTs were resolved as four bands known as Yc, Yb, Yβ and Yδ on 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS PAGE). In the analysis of biochemical characterization, we observed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the specific activities of liver GST isoforms with the substrates 1-chloro 2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), bromosulfophthalein (BSP), p-nitrophenyl  (pNPA), p-nitrobenzyl chloride (pNBC) and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), but showed no activity with ethacrynic acid (ECA) and significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the specific activities of kidney GST isoforms with the substrates CDNB, pNPA, pNBC and CHP, but showed no activity with BSP and ECA, and a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the specific activities of testis and brain GST isoforms with the substrates CDNB, BSP, pNPA, pNBC, ECA and CHP. In the analysis of immuno dot blots, we observed a decreased expression of liver, kidney, testis and brain GSTs. Through the affinity purification and biochemical characterization, we observed a tissue specific distribution of GSTs that is liver GSTs possess Yc, Yb and Ya sub units known as alpha (α) and mu (μ) class GSTs; kidney GSTs possess Yc and Ya sub units known as (α) alpha class GST; testis and brain GSTs possess Yc, Yb, Yβ and Yδ sub units known as alpha (α), mu (μ) and pi (π) class GSTs.

Symptoms are not observed until the organism colonises the placenta, eventually causing abortion. Infected animals become carriers and will shed the organism in the following oestruses. This process suggests that sex hormones might play an important role in the physiopathology of OEA, affecting the success of chlamydial clearance and also jeopardising the effectiveness of vaccination. However, the mechanisms through which sex hormones are involved in chlamydial pathogenicity remain unclear. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effect of progesterone on the immune response against C. abortus and on the protection conferred by an experimental inactivated vaccine in sheep. Eighteen sheep were ovariectomised and divided into four groups: vaccinated and progesterone-treated (V-PG), vaccinated and non-treated (V-NT), non-vaccinated and non-treated (NV-NT) and non-vaccinated and progesterone-treated sheep (NV-PG). Animals from both PG groups were treated with commercial medroxyprogesterone  impregnated intravaginal sponges before and during the vaccination (V-PG) or just before challenge (NV-PG). The animals from both V groups were subcutaneously immunised with an experimental inactivated vaccine, which was seen to confer high protection in previous studies. All sheep were challenged intratracheally with C. abortus strain AB7 and were sacrificed on day 8 post-infection. Morbidity was measured as the variation in rectal temperature and samples of sera were collected for antibody and cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-10) analysis by commercial ELISA. In addition, lung and lymph node samples were collected for chlamydial detection by qPCR and for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Sheep from the V-PG group showed less severe or no lesions and lower morbidity than the other groups. They also had the highest abundance of regulatory T-cells. The sheep from V-NT also manifested high antibody levels against C. abortus and less severe lesions than those observed in non-vaccinated sheep, which showed high morbidity, low antibody levels and severe lesions, especially in NV-NT. These results confirm the effectiveness of the experimental vaccine employed and suggest that progesterone could enhance the effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Long- and medium-chain fatty acids derived mainly from dietary triglycerides, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbial fermentation of the otherwise indigestible dietary fiber, constitute the major sources of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the  network. Recently, increasing evidence indicates that FFAs serve not only as energy sources but also as natural ligands for a group of orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) termed free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), essentially intertwining  and immunity in multiple ways, such as via inflammation regulation and secretion of peptide hormones. To date, several FFARs that are activated by the FFAs of various chain lengths have been identified and characterized.

We hypothesized that in response to submaximal pharmacologic stress (dobutamine), patients with HFpEF have impairment in left ventricular (LV) myocardial mechanical (external work [EW]), energetic (myocardial O consumption [MVO]), and myocardial blood flow (MBF) reserve. We further assessed whether coupling of MBF to EW is impaired in HFpEF and associated with compensatory increases or pathological decreases in myocardial O extraction. Lastly, we assessed whether coupling of MVO to EW (mechanical efficiency) was impaired in HFpEF.In prospectively enrolled patients with HFpEF (n=19) and age/sex-matched healthy controls (n=19), we performed C- positron emission tomography assessing MVO and MBF at rest and during dobutamine infusion. EW was calculated as stroke volume (echo)×end-systolic pressure×heart rate. At rest, compared with controls, patients with HFpEF had higher LV EW, MVO, and MBF. With dobutamine, LV EW, MVO, and MBF increased in both HFpEF and controls; however, the magnitude of increases was significantly smaller in HFpEF. In both groups, MBF increased in relation to EW, but in HFpEF, the slope of the relationship was significantly smaller than in controls. Myocardial O extraction was increased in HFpEF. Mechanical efficiency was similar in HFpEF and controls. In a post hoc analysis, HFpEF patients with LV hypertrophy (n=10) had significant reductions in LV mechanical efficiency relative to controls.In HFpEF during submaximal dobutamine stress, there is myocardial mechanical-, energetic- and flow-reserve dysfunction with impaired coupling of blood flow to demand and slight increases in myocardial O extraction.

Optimization of the method has led us to perform detection in positive ESI mode using MeOH-ammonium hydroxide (0.1%) (50:50, v/v) as sheath liquid. Moreover, optimal separation has been obtained in less than 9 min after anodic injection, using an ammonium  solution (40 mM, pH 10) as BGE. It was shown that the dilution solvent and the dilution factor to use for sample preparation are critical parameters to avoid peak splitting, to gain in sensitivity and then to obtain an effective analysis method. While a 200-fold factor dilution was shown to be suitable for quantitation of acetaminophen, acetaminophen mercapturate, acetaminophen sulfate and acetaminophen glucuronide, a 20-fold dilution was finally selected for methoxy-acetaminophen and 3-methylthioacetaminophen analysis, thus requiring two successive analyses to be carried out in order to quantify all metabolites. Hyphenation of CE with MS/MS versus UV permits to improve LOQ (10-20-fold factor with respect to previous works for acetaminophen, acetaminophen sulfate and acetaminophen glucuronide). Moreover, use of CE versus HPLC, permits to quantify two additional metabolites, i.e. 3-methylthio-acetaminophen and methoxy-acetaminophen. The method has been validated using the accuracy profile approach with a total error (accuracy) included in the ± 20% range. Thereby, the method allows the quantitation of acetaminophen and acetaminophen mercapturate in the range (0.1-1 mg mL), and of acetaminophen sulfate, methoxy-acetaminophen, acetaminophen glutathione and 3-methylthio-acetaminophen in the ranges (0.5-5 mg mL), (0.025-0.4 mg mL), (9.22-30 mg mL) and (0.073-0.4 mg mL), respectively. The method was finally applied to the analysis of urine samples of eighteen patients belonging to three different inclusion groups of the ongoing clinical trial, demonstrating that the method is suitable to highlight different  profiles. This work will be subsequently extended to the analysis two hundred and seventy urine samples from patients included in a clinical trial dedicated to the study of acetaminophen  changes after hepatic resection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Average fractional dilution rate for all diets was 11.9%/h and was not affected by diets. Fractional passage rate of the solid phase was greater for HF than for LF (4.40 vs. 3.76%/h). The ruminal retention time of solid phase was greater for LF compared with HF diets (27.3 vs. 23.3 h). Fractional passage rate of DDGS was affected by forage × DG interaction, as the highest fractional passage rate of DDGS was observed with cows fed HF18DG diet (7.72%/h). Our results demonstrated that concentrations of forage, DDGS, and their interaction influence ruminal degradation and kinetics of diets fed. Diets formulated at 17% forage NDF at 17% (DM basis) can decrease milk fat concentration compared with diets formulated at 25% forage NDF. Additionally, feeding DDGS at 18% DM basis to lactating dairy cows did not affect milk fat concentration or yield.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy  were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid  disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy  regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation.

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) strongly influences the   of mixotrophic-grown microalgae, however, its role involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis is still not fully understood. In this study, integrative  and physiologic profiles were analyzed in elucidating how C/N affected carbon and nitrogen assimilation and thereby exerted influence on astaxanthin biosynthesis. It was demonstrated that high C/N up-regulated the activities of  kinase by increase of 5.76 folds in early logarithmic phase, leading a significant increase of acetyl-CoA. The increased carbon skeletons were then funneled into astaxanthin biosynthesis. Additionally, high C/N increased the proportion of carotenoid-intermediates in cytoplasm from chloroplast. Finally, a fed-batch cultivation strategy based on C/N gradient was developed. Biomass attained 9.18 g L in 100% type of immotile cyst cells, which presented astaxanthin productivity at 15.45 mg L d afterward, exhibiting a promising paradigm in commercial production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Intraocular pressure was measured weekly by rebound tonometry. RGCs were examined with immunofluorescent staining of BRN3a at week 1, 4, and 8. TM morphology was visualized with electron microscopy. Autophagy was evaluated with immunoblotting in TM tissues. : Dex-Ace rapidly and significantly induced IOP, which peaked at week 4. The absolute increase in IOP in the Dex-Ace-treated mice was 8.1 ± 1.4 mmHg, a 60% induction ( < .0001) compared with that in the vehicle-treated mice. The IOP sustained a higher level in the Dex-Ace group from week 4 to week 8. Dex-Ace treatment decreased the number of RGCs in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that high IOP resulted in optic neuropathy. In addition, Dex-Ace thickened trabecular beams and decreased intertrabecular spaces, with marked accumulation of fibrillar and amorphous granular extracellular material. Moreover, Dex-Ace induced swollen and elongated mitochondria in TM cells.

We selected 4 odorants, 2-furfurylthiol (2-FT), hexanal, benzyl , and methyl raspberry ketone, which are potentially important for designing food flavors. In vitro  assays of odorants with saliva/nasal mucus analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry revealed that human saliva and nasal mucus exhibit the following 3 enzymatic activities: (i) methylation of 2-FT into furfuryl methylsulfide (FMS); (ii) reduction of hexanal into hexanol; and (iii) hydrolysis of benzyl  into benzyl alcohol. However, (iv) demethylation of methyl raspberry ketone was not observed. Real-time in vivo analysis using proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry demonstrated that the application of 2-FT and hexanal through 3 different  via the nostril or through the mouth generated the metabolites FMS and hexanol within a few seconds. The concentration of FMS and hexanol in the exhaled air was above the perception threshold. A cross-adaptation study based on the activation pattern of human odorant receptors suggested that this  affects odor perception. These results suggest that some odorants in food are metabolized in the human nasal mucus/saliva, and the resulting metabolites are perceived as part of the odor quality of the substrates. Our results help improve the understanding of the mechanism of food odor perception and may enable improved design and development of foods in relation to odor.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we describe a salinity-tolerance mechanism mediated by lipid droplets (LDs). In the alga  grown under salt-stress conditions, we observed significant increases in cell size and LD content. LDs that were closely grouped along the plasma membrane shrank as the plasma membrane expanded, and some LDs were engulfed by vacuoles. Transcriptome analysis showed that genes encoding lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) and phospholipase A2 were significantly up-regulated following salt stress. Diacylglycerol kinase and LPLAT were identified in the proteome of salt-induced LDs, alongside vesicle trafficking and plastidial proteins and histone H2B. Analysis of fatty acid composition revealed an enrichment of C18:1 and C18:2 at the expense of C18:3 in response to salt stress. Pulse-chase experiments further suggested that variations of fatty acid composition were associated with LDs.  stimulation research further confirmed a positive role of LDs in cell growth under salt stress. These results suggest that LDs play important roles in salt-stress tolerance, through harboring proteins, participating in cytoplasmic component recycling, and providing materials and enzymes for membrane modification and expansion.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

This study investigated the potential neuroprotective role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) against lead  (PbAc)-induced neurotoxicity. Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups ( = 7) and treated as follows: the control group was injected with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl); the CoQ group was injected with CoQ (10 mg/kg); PbAc group was injected with PbAc (20 mg/kg); PbAc + CoQ group was injected first with PbAc, and after 1 h with CoQ. All groups were injected intraperitoneally for seven days. PbAc significantly increased cortical lipid peroxidation, nitrate/nitrite levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and decreased glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase activity and mRNA expression, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and homoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. PbAc also promoted the secretion of interleukin-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-α, inhibited interleukin-10 production, triggered the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and suppressed anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, PbAc increased the cortical levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate, and decreased the level of ATP. However, treatment with CoQ rescued cortical neurons from PbAc-induced neurotoxicity by restoring the balance between oxidants and antioxidants, activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suppressing inflammation, inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, and modulating cortical neurotransmission and energy . Altogether, our findings indicate that CoQ has beneficial effects against PbAc-induced neuronal damage through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401318>Fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the changes of gut microbiota in rats with kidney-yang deficiency syndrome and the intervention effect of You-gui pill.</a></h2><p>A myriad of evidence have shown that kidney-yang deficiency syndrome (KYDS) is associated with  disorders of the intestinal microbiota, while TCMs can treat KYDS by regulating gut microbiota . However, the specific interplay between KYDS and intestinal microbiota, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of You-gui pill (YGP) on KYDS' gut microbiota remains largely unknown so far.In the present study, fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were used to explore the mutual effect between KYDS and intestinal flora, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of YGP on KYDS's gut microbiota. Rats' feces from control (CON) group, KYDS group and YGP group were collected, and metabolomic analysis was performed using H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis to obtain differential metabolites. Simultaneously, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the stool samples and to screen for the significant altered microbiota at the genus level. After that, MetaboAnalyst database and PICRUSt software were apply to conduct  pathway analysis and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota, respectively. What's more, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on these differential metabolites and gut microbiota.Using fecal metabonomics, KYDS was found to be associated with 21 differential metabolites and seven potential  . These metabolites and   were mainly involved in amino acid , energy , methylamine , bile acid  and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty acid . Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut microbiota were mostly involved in amino acid , energy , nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid , and carbohydrate . Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, , taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various  disorders (amino acid , energy , especially methylamine , bile acid  and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid . nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid , and carbohydrate ).

By studying chromatin modifiers regulated by epithelial growth factor, we identified histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) as an induced gene that enhances proliferation through coordinating histone production, acetylation, and glucose . In addition to its canonical role as a cytoplasmic histone H4 acetyltransferase, we isolated a HAT1-containing complex bound specifically at promoters of H4 genes. HAT1-dependent transcription of H4 genes required an -sensitive promoter element. HAT1 expression was critical for S-phase progression and maintenance of H3 lysine 9 acetylation at proliferation-associated genes, including histone genes. Therefore, these data describe a feedforward circuit whereby HAT1 captures acetyl groups on nascent histones and drives H4 production by chromatin binding to support chromatin replication and acetylation. These findings have important implications for human disease, since high HAT1 levels associate with poor outcomes across multiple cancer types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The organisms that facilitate this process, methanogenic archaea, belong to a large and phylogenetically diverse group that thrives in a wide range of anaerobic environments. Two main subgroups exist within methanogenic archaea: those with and those without cytochromes. Although a variety of metabolisms exist within this group, the reduction of growth substrates to methane using electrons from molecular hydrogen is, in a phylogenetic sense, the most widespread methanogenic pathway. Methanogens without cytochromes typically generate methane by the reduction of CO with electrons derived from H, formate, or secondary alcohols, generating a transmembrane ion gradient for ATP production via an Na-translocating methyltransferase (Mtr). These organisms also conserve energy with a novel flavin-based electron bifurcation mechanism, wherein the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin is facilitated by the exergonic reduction of a disulfide terminal electron acceptor coupled to either H or formate oxidation. Methanogens that utilize cytochromes have a broader substrate range, and can convert  and methylated compounds to methane, in addition to the ability to reduce CO Cytochrome-containing methanogens are able to supplement the ion motive force generated by Mtr with an H-translocating electron transport system. In both groups, enzymes known as hydrogenases, which reversibly interconvert protons and electrons to molecular hydrogen, play a central role in the methanogenic process. This review discusses recent insight into methanogen  and energy conservation mechanisms with a particular focus on the genus .Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421394>Suppression of sweet sensing with glucose, but not aspartame, delays gastric emptying and glycemic response.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that oral stimulation with Gymnema sylvestre (GS), a plant that selectively suppresses sweet taste sensation in humans, delayed gastric emptying and glycemic response during and after oral glucose ingestion. It is unclear whether these responses are triggered by sweet taste sensing per se. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of sweet taste sensing involving a low-energy sweetener, aspartame, alters gastric emptying, blood glucose, and plasma insulin responses during and after the prandial phase. Nine participants rinsed their mouths with either 25 mL of water (control) or a 2.5% GS solution, and then ingested 200 g (50 g × four times) of either 0.09% aspartame or 15% glucose solution containing 100 mg of C-sodium . Gastric emptying was measured with a C breath test. Blood glucose and plasma insulin were measured at baseline as well as during and after ingestion of the sweet solutions. Decreased subjective sweet taste intensity was observed in the GS group for both the aspartame and glucose trials. In the aspartame trial, no measurements showed significant differences between either group. In the glucose trial, gastric emptying was delayed in the GS group compared to controls. In the initial phase, both during and after glucose ingestion in the glucose trial, blood glucose and plasma insulin responses were lower in the GS group than the controls. The presence or absence of sweet taste-sensing involving glucose had a significant effect on gastric emptying and glycemic , both during and after the prandial phase, as opposed to the effects involving aspartame.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Among LA catabolic processes in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, ligation of coenzyme A (CoA) to LA by levulinyl-CoA synthetase (LvaE) is known to be an initial enzymatic step in LA . To identify the genes involved in the first step of LA  in Pseudomonas citronellolis LA18T, RNA-seq-based comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out for LA18T cells during growth on LA and pyruvic acid. The two most highly upregulated genes with LA exhibited amino acid sequence homologies to cation  symporter and 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase from Pseudomonas spp. Potential LA  genes (lva genes) in LA18T that clustered with these two genes and were homologous to lva genes in KT2440 were identified, including lvaE2 of LA18T, which exhibited 35% identity with lvaE of KT2440. Using Escherichia coli cells with the pCold™ expression system, LvaE2 was produced and investigated for its activity toward LA. High performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed that crude extracts of E. coli cells expressing the lvaE2 gene could convert LA to levulinyl-CoA in the presence of both HS-CoA and ATP. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvaE2 and LvaE formed a cluster with medium-chain fatty acid CoA synthetase, but they fell on different branches. Superimposition of LvaE2 and LvaE homology-based model structures suggested that LvaE2 had a larger tunnel for accepting fatty acid substrates than LvaE.

Our results demonstrated that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 50 and 90% of  isolates (MIC and MIC) of the ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction from . ethanol extract were 780 and 1,065 μg/ml, respectively. We further observed that the EtOAc fraction disrupted 24-h biofilm caused cell membrane damage and irregular cell shape. Additionally, the EtOAc fraction showed slight to moderate toxic effects on human epidermal keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. Moreover, the results of the differential proteome revealed that 231 proteins were upregulated, while 61 proteins were downregulated in  after treatment with the EtOAc fraction. The differentially expressed proteins were functionally categorized by the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. These proteins contribute to membrane damage, inhibition of biofilm formation, and changes in energy . Thus, the EtOAc fraction of  ethanol extract, as a natural product, has the potential to be used as an antimicrobial agent to control the clinical isolates of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615062> Affects the Process of Lipid  in Rabbit Liver, Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (a microbial fermentation production in the rabbit gut) have an important role in many physiological processes, which may be related to the reduced body fat of rabbits.

Compared with CLP group, the pathological changes of lung tissue, the degree of ultrastructural damage of lung tissue, the degree of apoptosis of lung capillary endothelial cells in XCT790 group further intensified, the permeability of lung endothelial barrier further increased [the content of EB (μg/g): 116.00±15.46 vs. 60.19±19.79, P < 0.05], and the level of serum cytokines further increased [interleukin-1β (IL-1β, ng/L): 71.38±4.01 vs. 56.58±2.45, interleukin-6 (IL-6, ng/L): 741.62±88.94 vs. 534.22±72.70, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, ng/L): 188.55±7.41 vs. 143.33±11.27, all P < 0.05], the white blood cell count in the BALF increased further (×10/L: 193.79±27.46 vs. 99.34±36.41, P < 0.05).ERRα can aggravate inflammation in sepsis rats, destroy lung tissue and increase pulmonary permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379993>MIG1 Glucose Repression in  Processes of  Genetics to  Engineering.</a></h2><p>Although  has several industrial applications, there are still fundamental problems associated with sequential use of carbon sources. As such, glucose repression effect can direct  of yeast to preferably anaerobic conditions. This leads to higher ethanol production and less efficient production of recombinant products. The general glucose repression system is constituted by , TUP1 and SSN6 factors. The role of  is known in glucose repression but the evaluation of effects on aerobic/anaerobic  by deletion of  and constructing an optimal strain brand remains unclear and an objective to be explored.To find the impact of  in induction of glucose-repression, the Mig1 disruptant strain (Δ) was produced for comparing with its congenic wild-type strain (2805).

The  disruptant strain exhibited 25% glucose utilization, 12% biomass growth rate and 22% protein content over the wild type. The shift to respiratory pathway has been demonstrated by 122.86 and 40% increase of glycerol and pyruvate production, respectively as oxidative metabolites, while the reduction of fermentative metabolites such as  35.48 and ethanol 24%.Results suggest that Δ compared to the wild-type strain can significantly present less effects of glucose repression.The constructed strain has more efficient growth in aerobic cultivations and it can be a potential host for biotechnological recombinant yields and industrial interests.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406688>Comparative transcriptional analysis of flavour-biosynthetic genes of a native  strain fermenting in its natural must environment, vs. a commercial strain and correlation of the genes' activities with the produced flavour compounds.</a></h2><p>During alcoholic fermentation,  synthesizes more than 400 different compounds with higher alcohols,  esters of higher alcohols and ethyl esters of medium-chain fatty acids being the most important products of its , determining the particular flavour profile of each wine. The concentration of the metabolites produced depends to a large extent on the strain used. The use of indigenous strains as starting cultures can lead to the production of wines with excellent organoleptic characteristics and distinct local character, superior in quality when compared to their commercial counterparts. However, the relationship of these wild-type genotypes, linked to specific , with the biosynthetic profiles of flavour metabolites is not completely clarified and understood. To this end, qRT-PCR was employed to examine, for the first time on the transcriptional level, the performance of an indigenous  strain (Z622) in its natural environment (Debina grape must). The expression of genes implicated in higher alcohols and esters formation was correlated with the concentrations of these compounds in the produced wine. Furthermore, by applying the same fermentation conditions, we examined the same parameters in a commercial strain (VL1) and compared its performance with the one of strain Z622.Strain Z622, exhibited lower concentrations of 2-methylbutanol, 3-methylbutanol and 2-phenyl ethanol, than VL1 correlating with the elevated expression levels of transaminase and decarboxylase genes. Furthermore, the significantly high induction of  throughout fermentation of Z622 probably explains the larger population numbers reached by Z622 and reflects the better adaptation of the strain to its natural environment. Regarding  ester biosynthesis, Z622 produced higher concentrations of total  esters, compared with VL1, a fact that is in full agreement with the elevated expression levels of both  and  in strain Z622.This study provides evidence on the transcriptional level that indigenous yeast Z622 is better adapted to its natural environment able to produce wines with desirable characteristics, i.e. lower concentrations of higher alcohol and higher ester, verifying its potential as a valuable starter for the local wine-industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421579>Enhanced degradation of triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) in bioelectrochemical systems: Kinetics, pathway and degradation mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is one of the major organophosphate esters (OPEs) with increasing consumption. Considering its largely distribution and high toxicity in aquatic environment, it is important to explore an efficient treatment for TPHP. This study aimed to investigate the accelerated degradation of TPHP in a three-electrode single chamber bioelectrochemical system (BES). Significant increase of degradation efficiency of TPHP in the BES was observed compared with open circuit and abiotic controls. The one-order degradation rates of TPHP (1.5 mg L) were increased with elevating sodium  concentrations and showed the highest value (0.054 ± 0.010 h) in 1.0 g L of sodium . This result indicated bacterial  of TPHP was enhanced by the application of micro-electrical field and addition  as co-substrates. TPHP could be degraded into diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), hydroxyl triphenyl phosphate (OH-TPHP) and three byproducts. DPHP was the most accumulated degradation product in BES, which accounted more than 35.5% of the initial TPHP. The composition of bacterial community in BES electrode was affected by the acclimation by TPHP, with the most dominant bacteria of Azospirillum, Petrimonas, Pseudomonas and Geobacter at the genera level. Moreover, it was found that the acute toxic effect of TPHP to Vibrio fischeri was largely removed after the treatment, which revealed that BES is a promising technology to remove TPHP threaten in aquatic environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The studies on natural compounds to inhibit this metastasis have been actively performed until now. However, the effect of tomatidine on metastasis remains unclear.The effect of tomatidine on antioxidative activity was measured with DPPH radical assay and reducing power assay. After treatment with tomatidine, the viability of human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080 cells) was evaluated with MTT assay. The effect of tomatidine on the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, gelatinases related to metastasis, was analyzed using gelatin zymography, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Cell invasion assay was used to investigate anti-metastasis activity of tomatidine.Tomatidine showed no DPPH radical scavenging effect and showed 8% of reduction power at 8 μM. Furthermore, tomatidine below 8 μM showed more than 80% of cell viability in MTT assay. The inhibition of tomatidine on MMP-2 activity and its protein expression levels were observed by gelatin zymography, western blot and immunofluorescence. It was observed that tomatidine inhibited not only p38 and ERK but also cell invasion.Above results suggest that tomatidine could use as a potential candidate for cancer prevention and metastasis through the inhibitory effect on gelatinase.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

SCFAs may exert multiple beneficial effects on human lipid and glucose . However, their actions and underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the direct effects of propionate on hepatic glucose and lipid  using human HepG2 hepatocytes. Here, we demonstrate that propionate at a physiologically-relevant concentration effectively suppresses palmitate-enhanced glucose production in HepG2 cells but does not affect intracellular neutral lipid levels. Our results indicated that propionate can decline in gluconeogenesis by down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a major regulator of the hepatic glucose . Mechanistic studies also revealed that propionate-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation can be ascribed to Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the propionate receptor GPR43 prevented propionate-inducible activation of AMPK and abrogates the gluconeogenesis-inhibitory action. Thus, our data indicate that the binding of propionate to hepatic GPR43 elicits CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK through intracellular Ca increase, leading to suppression of gluconeogenesis. The present study suggests the potential efficacy of propionate in preventive and therapeutic management of diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore in year 2007 Croatian guidelines for use of eicosapentaenoic acid and megestrol  in cancer cachexia syndrome were published. Aim of this study was to assess the awareness and implementation of Croatian guidelines for use of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and megestrol  (MA) into clinical practice among Croatian oncologists approximately 10 years after the publication, but also to point out the importance of adequate recognition and treatment of CC.Survey with questions was designed to assess the awareness and implementation of Croatian guidelines for use of EPA and MA into clinical practice and was distributed among all Croatian oncologists in secondary and tertiary hospital centers. Survey was conducted in January 2011 (40 months following release of the guidelines), February 2013 and June 2018, and were formed in a way of yes/no answers. Additional multiple choice questions that focus on the implementation of guidelines were added in June 2018.A total of 128 oncologists completed a questionnaire. There was no statistically significant difference in follow up period (2011-2018) of percentage of oncologists that are familiar with Croatian guidelines for use of EPA and MA in CC, percentage of oncologists in which Croatian national guidelines changed their approach in treating patients with CC syndrome and proportion of oncologists that are using MA, enteral nutrition formulas with EPA or their combination. Most of the oncologists 38% (N = 44) are using >2.2 g of EPA per day. Nutritional support is prescribed in 25-50% of patients by 42% (N = 48) of oncologists and most of the oncologists (35%, N = 41) start with nutritional support when a body mass loss is >5%. Oncologists mostly recommend patients to use nutritional support during 1 year or more (43%, N = 49) or two months to 1 year (42%, N = 48). Compliance of patients with malignant diseases for using nutritional support was mostly evaluated as medium (69%, N = 60).Results have shown that majority of oncologists who filled the questionnaire believe that the Croatian national guidelines for use of EPA and MA in CC syndrome changed their approach in treating patients with CC, but also that there are several targeted issues that can be significantly improved. The awareness of and adherence to national guidelines was maintained at high level even 11 years after the guidelines were published.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and .

Twenty-four Doper × Small Tail Han ewes (6-7 months of age; 29.07 ± 2.28 kg initial body weight) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for a 47 d feeding period. Treatments consisted of the sheep diet supplemented with 0% ABP-control, 10% ABP, or 15% ABP of the diet (dry matter basis). Blood samples were collected on days 0, 15, 30, and 45 of the feeding period. APB supplementation did not affect growth performance and apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, and acid detergent fibre ( > 0.05). However, ether extract digestibility was decreased in the 10% ABP group and increased in the 15% ABP group ( < 0.001), and both 10% ABP and 15% ABP decreased the neutral detergent fibre digestibility (=0.005). Feeding ABP increased rumen pH ( < 0.001) and ammonia N ( < 0.001) and decreased concentrations of  (=0.007) and propionate (=0.001) which resultantly increased the -to-propionate ratio ( < 0.001) in ruminal fluid. There were no interaction effects between treatment and sampling time for plasma metabolites and immunity ( > 0.05). However, inclusion of dietary 10% ABP decreased concentrations of plasma cholesterol (=0.043). Also, plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein decreased on days 30 and 45 (=0.017) of the feeding period. Metabolite concentrations of total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea N, glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and humoral immune indicators were not affected ( > 0.05) by dietary ABP supplementation.

Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile, but an increase in  was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino acids  such as urocanic acid, citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats.

Lead interaction with calcium and zinc-containing metalloproteins broadly affects cellular  since these proteins are related to intracellular ion balance, activation of signaling transduction cascades, and gene expression regulation. In spite of lead being recognized as a neurotoxin, there are gaps in knowledge about the global effect of lead in modulating the transcription of entire cellular systems in neural cells. In order to investigate the effects of lead poisoning in a systemic perspective, we applied the transcriptogram methodology in an RNA-seq dataset of human embryonic-derived neural progenitor cells (ES-NP cells) treated with 30 µM lead  for 26 days. We observed early downregulation of several cellular systems involved with cell differentiation, such as cytoskeleton organization, RNA, and protein biosynthesis. The downregulated cellular systems presented big and tightly connected . For long treatment times (12 to 26 days), it was possible to observe a massive impairment in cell transcription profile. Taking the enriched terms together, we observed interference in all layers of gene expression regulation, from chromatin remodeling to vesicle transport.

However, the characteristics and underlying mechanism of the alkali-induced secretion of organic acids are poorly understood.Oxalate was the main organic acid synthesized and secreted in grapevine (a hybrid of Vitis amurensis, V. berlandieri and V. riparia) roots, while  synthesis and malate secretion were also promoted under NaHCO stress. NaHCO stress enhanced the H efflux rate of grapevine roots, which is related to the plasma membrane H-ATPase activity. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that carbohydrate  was the most significantly altered biological process under NaHCO stress; a total of seven genes related to organic acid  were significantly altered, including two phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinases. Additionally, the expression levels of five ATP-binding cassette transporters, particularly ATP-binding cassette B19, and two Al-activated malate transporter 2 s were substantially upregulated by NaHCO stress. Phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrated that the altered phosphoproteins were primarily related to binding, catalytic activity and transporter activity in the context of their molecular functions. The phosphorylation levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3, two plasma membrane H-ATPases 4 and ATP-binding cassette B19 and pleiotropic drug resistance 12 were significantly increased. Additionally, the inhibition of ethylene synthesis and perception completely blocked NaHCO-induced organic acid secretion, while the inhibition of indoleacetic acid synthesis reduced NaHCO-induced organic acid secretion.Our results demonstrated that oxalate was the main organic acid produced under alkali stress and revealed the necessity of ethylene in mediating organic acid secretion.

To provide insights into its lignocellulose hydrolysate utilization, we performed C-pathway tracing, C-pulse-tracing, transcriptional profiling, biomass composition analysis, and metabolite profiling in conjunction with C- flux analysis (C-MFA) of phenol . We found that 1) phenol is metabolized mainly through the ortho-cleavage pathway; 2) phenol utilization requires a highly active TCA cycle; 3) NADPH is generated mainly via NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; 4) active cataplerotic fluxes increase plasticity in the TCA cycle; and 5) gluconeogenesis occurs partially through the reversed Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP). We also found that phenol-fed R. opacus PD630 generally has lower sugar phosphate concentrations (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) compared to metabolite pools in C-glucose-fed Escherichia coli (set as internal standards), while its TCA metabolites (e.g., malate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate) accumulate intracellularly with measurable succinate secretion. In addition, we found that phenol utilization was inhibited by benzoate, while catabolite repressions by other tested carbon substrates (e.g., glucose and ) were absent in R. opacus PD630. Three adaptively-evolved strains display very different growth rates when fed with phenol as a sole carbon source, but they maintain a conserved flux network.

The antibacterial activity was evaluated by broth microdilution technique as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the antifungal activity was performed by mycelia radial growth technique as the effective concentration causing 50% inhibition of the mycelial growth (EC). The results showed that thymol and α-terpineol were the most potent against E. coli (MIC = 45 and 55 mg/L, respectively) and S. aureus (MIC = 135 and 225 mg/L, respectively). The results also showed that thymol displayed the maximum antifungal action against A. flavus with EC 20 mg/L. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity was determined using N,N-dimethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (DMPD) and the results showed that geraniol were the most potent compound (IC = 19 mg/L). Molecular docking studies indicated that the compounds displayed different binding interactions with the amino acid residues at the catalytic sites of N5-carboxyaminoimidazole synthetase and oxysterol binding protein Osh4 enzymes. Non-covalent interactions including van der Waals, hydrogen bonding as well as hydrophobic were observed between the compounds and the enzymes. A significant relationship was found between the docking score and the biological activity of the tested monoterpenes compared to the ceftriaxone and carbendazim as standard bactericide and fungicide, respectively. In silico ADMET properties were also performed and displayed potential for the development of promising antimicrobial agents. For these reasons, these compounds may be considered as potential ecofriendly alternatives in food preservation to delay or prevent the microbial infection and prolong the shelf life of food products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since asymptomatic bone metastases are not uncommon, early detection, precise assessment, and localization of them are very important. Various imaging modalities have been employed in the setting of diagnosis of bone metastasis, from plain radiography and bone scintigraphy to SPECT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT, MRI. However, each modality showed its own limitation providing accurate diagnostic performance. In this regard, various tumor-targeted radiotracers have been introduced for molecular imaging of bone metastases using modern hybrid modalities. In this article we review the strength of different cancer-specific radiopharmaceuticals in the detection of bone metastases. As shown in the literature, among various tumor-targeted tracers, 68Ga DOTA-conjugated-peptides, 68Ga PSMA, 18F DOPA, 18F galacto-RGD integrin, 18F FDG, 11C/18F , 11C/18F choline, 111In octreotide, 123/131I MIBG, 99mTc MIBI, and 201Tl have acceptable capabilities in detecting bone metastases depending on the cancer type.

However, fast growing phenotypes usually feature secretion of organic compounds. For example, E. coli mainly produced  in fast growing condition such as glucose rich and aerobic condition, which is troublesome for  engineering because  causes acidification of surroundings, growth inhibition and decline of production yield. The overflow  can be alleviated by reducing glucose uptake rate.As glucose transporters or their subunits were knocked out in E. coli, the growth and glucose uptake rates decreased and biomass yield was improved. Alteration of intracellular  caused by the mutations was investigated with transcriptome analysis and C  flux analysis (C MFA). Various transcriptional and  perturbations were identified in the sugar transporter mutants. Transcription of genes related to glycolysis, chemotaxis, and flagella synthesis was downregulated, and that of gluconeogenesis, Krebs cycle, alternative transporters, quorum sensing, and stress induced proteins was upregulated in the sugar transporter mutants. The specific production yields of value-added compounds (enhanced green fluorescent protein, γ-aminobutyrate, lycopene) were improved significantly in the sugar transporter mutants.The elimination of sugar transporter resulted in alteration of global gene expression and redirection of carbon flux distribution, which was purposed to increase energy yield and recycle carbon sources.

To produce awamori, a traditional spirit (distilled alcoholic beverage) with unique flavors made from steamed rice in Okinawa, Japan, it is necessary to optimize yeast strains for a diversity of tastes and flavors with established qualities. Two categories of flavors are characteristic of awamori; initial scented fruity flavors and sweet flavors that arise with aging. Here we isolated a novel strain of  from hibiscus flowers in Okinawa, HC02-5-2, that produces high levels of alcohol. The whole-genome information revealed that strain HC02-5-2 is contiguous to wine yeast strains in a phylogenic tree. This strain also exhibited a high productivity of 4-vinyl guaiacol (4-VG), which is a precursor of vanillin known as a key flavor of aged awamori. Although conventional awamori yeast strain 101-18, which possesses the  pseudogene does not produce 4-VG, strain HC02-5-2, which has the intact  and  genes, has an advantage for use in a novel kind of awamori. To increase the contents of initial scented fruity flavors, such as isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl , we attempted to breed strain HC02-5-2 targeting the L-leucine synthetic pathway by conventional mutagenesis. In mutant strain T25 with L-leucine accumulation, we found a hetero allelic mutation in the  gene encoding the Gly516Ser variant α-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS). IPMS activity of the Gly516Ser variant was less sensitive to feedback inhibition by L-leucine, leading to intracellular L-leucine accumulation. In a laboratory-scale test, awamori brewed with strain T25 showed higher concentrations of isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl  than that brewed with strain HC02-5-2. Such a combinatorial approach to yeast isolation, with whole-genome analysis and -focused breeding, has the potentials to vary the quality of alcoholic beverages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306528>Isolation, Purification, Characterization and Direct Conjugation of the Lipid A-Free Lipopolysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae O139.</a></h2><p>The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Vibrio cholerae O139, strain CIRS245, was isolated conventionally, and the lipid A was removed by mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 m NaOAc buffer containing 1 % SDS, pH 4.2, 95 °C, 8 h).

Previous evidence has suggested that TAMs promote tumorigenesis, growth, invasion and metastasis, thereby affecting tumor . The mechanisms through which they affect the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells remain unclear. The present study investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of TAMs on the proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Human mononuclear leukemia THP-1 cells were induced into TAMs. The morphological changes that occurred during the induction of the THP-1 cells were examined with a light microscope. Successful TAM formation was confirmed via flow cytometry. Proliferation, invasion and migration of the lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were detected by EDU proliferation, scratch wound and Transwell invasion and migration assays, respectively. The expression levels of key proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were detected by western blot analysis. It was identified that treatment with interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and Phorbol-12-myristate-13- successfully induced THP-1 to form TAMs. The indirect coculture model of TAMs was established by Transwell chamber detection, and the proliferation, invasion and migration ability of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were enhanced. Western blot analysis indicated that the expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-PI3K and p-AKT proteins were significantly upregulated in the TAMs coculture group compared with that of the blank control group. In summary, the present study demonstrated that TAMs may promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells , perhaps through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236799>The biotechnological potential of the yeast Dekkera bruxellensis.</a></h2><p>Dekkera bruxellensis is an industrial yeast mainly regarded as a contaminant species in fermentation processes. In winemaking, it is associated with off-flavours that cause wine spoilage, while in bioethanol production this yeast is linked to a reduction of industrial productivity by competing with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the substrate. In spite of that, this point of view is gradually changing, mostly because D. bruxellensis is also able to produce important metabolites, such as ethanol, , fusel alcohols, esters and others. This dual role is likely due to the fact that this yeast presents a set of  traits that might be either industrially attractive or detrimental, depending on how they are faced and explored. Therefore, a proper industrial application for D. bruxellensis depends on the correct assembly of its central  puzzle. In this sense, researchers have addressed issues regarding the physiological and genetic aspects of D. bruxellensis, which have brought to light much of our current knowledge on this yeast. In this review, we shall outline what is presently understood about the main  features of D. bruxellensis and how they might be managed to improve its current or future industrial applications (except for winemaking, in which it is solely regarded as a contaminant).

Very few patients with pituitary metastasis are symptomatic. It is often associated with presence of co-existing metastases to other organs. Isolated pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary malignancy is uncommon.A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of polyuria, increasing thirst and unexplained weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was scheduled as part of the investigation. She was kept nil per os for 10 h prior to EGD, after which she developed alteration of consciousness. Further investigation revealed hypernatremia with sodium level of 161 mmol/L and low urine osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg. Her urine output was 300 mL per hour. Diabetes insipidus (DI) was diagnosed based on evidence of polyuria, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality. Her urine output decreased and urine osmolality increased to 570 mOsm/kg in response to subcutaneous desmopressin , confirming central DI. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous gadolinium enhancing lesion at the sellar and suprasellar regions, measuring 2.4 × 2.6 × 3.9 cm compressing both the hypothalamus bilaterally and the inferior aspect of optic chiasm as well as displacing the residual pituitary gland anteriorly. The posterior pituitary bright spot was absent. These MRI findings suggested pituitary macroadenoma. There were also multiple small gadolinium-enhancing lesions up to 0.7 cm in size with adjacent vasogenic brain edema at the subcortical and subpial regions of the left frontal and parietal areas, raising the concern of brain metastases. Pituitary hormonal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the pituitary tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma, originating from the lung. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was subsequently performed, showing a 2.2-cm soft tissue mass at the proximal part of right bronchus. There was no evidence of distant metastases elsewhere. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung with pituitary metastasis manifesting as panhypopituitarism and central DI. Palliative care along with hormonal replacement therapy was offered to the patient. She died 4 months after diagnosis.Diagnosis of pituitary metastasis is challenging, especially in patients with previously undiagnosed primary cancer.

A modified anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1) was proposed to characterize the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion at the feedstock ratios of waste activated sludge to corn silage 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the modified ADM1 was operated on the platform AQUASIM 2.0 while the kinetic parameter estimation and simulation was implemented on the platform MATLAB 7.0. The Monod maximum specific uptake rate for  (k) was calibrated to 29.0 d, and the half-saturation value for  (k) 0.40 kgCOD/m in the acidification phase while k 35.0 d, Monod maximum specific uptake rate for hydrogen (k) 23.0 d and k 0.70 kgCOD/m in the methanogenic phase in the modified ADM1. The results from the batch tests showed the optimal feedstock ratio of waste activated sludge to corn silage was 2:1. Under this condition, chemical oxygen demand could reach the largest removal at around 51.0%, while Ammonia-nitrogen and total phosphorous increased by the maximal 192.0% and 71.5%. Besides, volatile fatty acids were lowest at about 0.27 kgCOD/m, and the biogas flow was highest at about 47.6 mL/d. The pH values were always maintained at 6.8-7.2. Good agreements could be achieved between the measured data and the simulation with the modified ADM1. Therefore, the optimal and preferable operating factors during two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates could be obtained from the simulation.

To investigate the bioremoval potential of a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter for the removal of NSAIDs, removal of diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NAP) by biofilms on a bench-scaled BAC column operated for 400 days was studied.

Moreover, based on the complete genome sequence of strain DIN-3, 49 related genes encoding the main enzymes involved in DCF, IBU, and NAP biodegradation were identified, including hemE, lpd, yihx, ligC, pobA, and ligA. These results suggested that Pseudoxanthomonas sp. DIN-3 is a potential degrader of DCF, IBU, and NAP, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates the bioremoval of DCF, IBU, and NAP simultaneously by an individual bacterial strain isolated from the environment. However, the bioremoval potential should be evaluated when assessing the applicability of the strain in the environment because of the combined effects of various pharmaceutical contaminants. The obtained results provide a foundation for the use of Pseudoxanthomonas sp. DIN-3 in the bioremoval of polycyclic NSAID-contaminated environments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Strategies that target the interplay between agricultural pests and their symbionts could decrease the burden caused by agricultural pests; however, the lack of comprehensive genomic insights into naturally occurring microbial symbionts presents a significant bottleneck. Here we employed amplicon surveys, genome-resolved metagenomics, and scanning electron microscopy to investigate symbionts of the wheat stem sawfly (), a major pest that causes an estimated $350 million dollars or more in wheat yield losses in the northwestern United States annually. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing of two major haplotypes and life stages of wheat stem sawfly, we show a novel  species is ever-present and predominant, with phylogenomic analyses placing it as a member of the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Using state-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies we were able to reconstruct a 714 Kb, 72.7%-complete  genome, which represents just the second draft genome from the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Functional annotation of the  genome indicated carbohydrate- involved PTS-mediated import of glucose and fructose followed by glycolysis to lactate, , and propionoate. The bacterium also encoded biosynthetic  for essential vitamins B2, B3, and B9. We identified putative  virulence genes: cardiolipin and chitinase. These results identify a previously undescribed symbiosis between wheat stem sawfly and a novel  sp., availing insight into their molecular relationship, and may yield new opportunities for microbially-mediated pest control strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644264>Quantification of dehydroepiandrosterone, 17β-estradiol, testosterone and their sulfates in mouse tissues by LC/MS/MS.</a></h2><p>We report a high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) assay to quantify without derivatizaton dehyroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and their sulfates in serum and tissues. This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous  buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10 and 5 fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white vs brown adipose. In addition, marginal decreases of T in all tissues and considerable increases in DHEA in male iWAT and eWAT in response to high-fat diet further strengthen the inference regarding role of steroid  in adipogenesis. This assay permits detailed studies of interactions between adiposity and sex steroids in serum and tissues, including adipose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244078> Production from Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane via Intracellular Storage Compounds.</a></h2><p>There is great interest in microbial conversion of methane, an abundant resource, into valuable liquid chemicals. While aerobic bioconversion of methane to liquid chemicals has been reported, studies of anaerobic methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals are rare. Here we show that a microbial culture dominated by Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens', an anaerobic methanotrophic archaeon, anaerobically oxidizes methane to produce , indirectly via reaction intermediate(s), when nitrate or nitrite is supplied as an electron acceptor under a rate-limiting condition. Isotopic labeling tests showed that  was produced from certain intracellular storage compounds that originated from methane. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Nile red staining demonstrated that polyhydroxyalkanoate in M. nitroreducens was likely one of the intracellular storage compounds for  production, along with glycogen.  is a common substrate for the production of more valuable chemicals. The microbial conversion discovered in this study potentially enables a new approach to the use of methane as a feedstock for the chemical market.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580513>Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Iminodiacetate Oxidase from Chelativorans sp. BNC1.</a></h2><p>Ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) is the most abundant organic pollutant in surface water because of its extensive usage and the recalcitrance of stable metal-EDTA complexes. A few bacteria including Chelativorans sp. BNC1 can degrade EDTA with a monooxygenase to ethylenediaminediacetate (EDDA) and then use iminodiacetate oxidase (IdaA) to further degrade EDDA into ethylenediamine in a two-step oxidation. To alleviate EDTA pollution into the environment, deciphering the mechanisms of the metabolizing enzymes is an imperative prerequisite for informed EDTA bioremediation. Although IdaA cannot oxidize glycine, the crystal structure of IdaA shows its tertiary and quaternary structures similar to those of glycine oxidases. All confirmed substrates, EDDA, ethylenediaminemonoacetate (EDMA), iminodiacetate, and sarcosine are secondary amines with at least one N-acetyl group. Each substrate was bound at the re-side face of the isoalloxazine ring in a solvent-connected cavity. The carboxyl group of the substrate was bound by Arg and Arg . The catalytic residue, Tyr , is under the hydrogen bond network to facilitate its deprotonation acting as a general base, removing an  group of secondary amines as glyoxylate. Thus, IdaA is a secondary amine oxidase, and our findings improve understanding of molecular mechanism involved in the bioremediation of EDTA and the  of secondary amines.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313134>The Addition of a Pheromone to a Floral Lure Increases Catches of Females of the Click Beetle Agriotes ustulatus (Schaller) (Coleoptera: Elateridae).</a></h2><p>Agriotes ustulatus is an economically important click beetle in Europe. A female-produced pheromone, (E,E)-farnesyl , has been identified and is used for monitoring and detecting males. More recently, a floral lure targeting females with modest, but significant, activity has been described. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesized, that similar to the effects on the congeneric A. brevis, addition of the pheromone to the floral lure should improve female A. ustulatus catches. Also, as click beetles have been reported to respond to white light, we studied possible interactions between visual and chemical cues. In field trials, the addition of the synthetic pheromone to the floral lure resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of females trapped, whereas male catches remained unaffected and equal to those in traps baited with pheromone only. A white visual cue did not influence trap catches. Maximum catches of both sexes of A. ustulatus can be achieved using the pheromone and the floral lure inside the same trap. Furthermore, the compounds can be formulated in a single polyethylene bag dispenser, making handling of the trap easier. Due to a much larger proportion of females in the catch, this improved trap may be a promising tool for semiochemical-based, environmentally sound agricultural practice against this important pest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513345>A simple liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry approach for the simultaneous quantification of thirteen compounds in rats following oral administration of raw and processed Fructus Xanthii: Application in a comparative pharmacokinetic study.</a></h2><p>A simple and sensitive analysis using ultra high performance liquid chromatography with a tandem mass spectrometric system operated in selected reaction monitoring mode was developed for the determination of 11 phenolic acids, atractyloside, and carboxyatractyloside in rat plasma. The two classes of analytes were then separated on a Waters ACQUITY™ UPLC HSS T3 column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm) using gradient elution with a mobile phase of 0.2% formic acid in water containing 10 mM ammonium  and methanol. Detection was accomplished by selected reaction monitoring scanning via an electrospray source operating in negative ionization mode. The calibration curve was linear (R  = 0.990) over a concentration range of 1.20-3500 ng/mL, while the validated lower limit of quantification was 1.20 ng/mL. The precision varied from 0.84 to 4.62%, and the accuracy varied within ±5%. The method proved robust with sample freezing and thawing and with short- and long-term sample storage. The established method was used for simultaneous quantification and was successfully used for the first time for the pharmacokinetic evaluation of 13 compounds after the intragastric administration of raw and processed Fructus Xanthii in rats. The results indicated that processing affects the absorption and  of Fructus Xanthii extract.

The impact of plant volatiles in shaping herbivore defenses is unclear. Here, we report that specific plant volatiles induce immune responses in the polyphagous herbivore, Spodoptera litura. We characterized the hemocyte profile and established their functional significance with respect to ontogeny and exposure to specific plant volatiles. Fifth instar larvae showed the highest number and hemocytes diversity. We characterized seven different types of hemocytes, of which granulocytes performed phagocytosis, oenocytoids showed melanization activity, and plasmatocytes along with granulocytes and oenocytoids were found to be involved in encapsulation. Among the six volatiles tested, exposure to (E)-β-ocimene caused the highest increase in total hemocytes number (THC) followed by linalool and (Z)-3-hexenyl  exposure. Although THC did not differ between these three volatile treatments, circulating hemocytes diversity varied significantly. (E)-β-ocimene exposure showed higher number of plasmatocytes and phenol oxidase activity. The interaction of the parasitic wasp Bracon brevicornis with (E)-β-ocimene exposed larvae was poor in terms of delayed paralysis and lower egg deposition. In choice assays, the wasp showed clear preference towards control larvae indicating (E)-β-ocimene treatment renders the host unattractive. Hemocyte profiles post-parasitoid exposure and (E)-β-ocimene treatment were similar indicating cue-based priming. When challenged with Bacillus thuringiensis, linalool exposure resulted in the highest survival as compared to other volatiles. Our results show that specific HIPVs can modulate cellular immunity of S. litura, revealing a new role for HIPVs in tri-trophic interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618914>Effects of Nutritional Deprivation and Re-Alimentation on the Feed Efficiency, Blood Biochemistry, and Rumen Microflora in Yaks ().</a></h2><p>Yak suffers severe starvation and body weight reduction in the cold season and recovers relatively rapid growth in the warm season every year. Herein, we investigated the effects of starvation and refeeding on the growth, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry and rumen microbial community as well as functions of yaks. The results showed that starvation significantly reduced the body weight of yaks. Serum glucose and triglyceride concentrations significantly decreased, and β-hydroxybutyric acid and non-esterified fatty acid levels were significantly increased during the starvation period. Starvation also dramatically inhibited rumen microbial fermentations. Whereas, refeeding with the same diet significantly increased the feed efficiency, nutrient digestibility together with rumen , propionate and microbial protein productions compared with those before starvation. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that starvation mainly decreased the ruminal protein-degrading bacteria  and propionate-producing bacteria  populations and dramatically increased the denitrifying bacteria  populations. Refeeding reduced the  population and increased propionate-producing bacteria  and starch-degrading bacteria  populations when compared with those before starvation. The predicted microbial  , related to amino acid and starch metabolisms, were also significantly altered during the starvation and refeeding. The results indicated that the rumen microorganisms and their   changed with feed supply, and these alterations in part contributed to yak adaption to starvation and re-alimentation. This study is helpful for enhancing the understanding and utilization of this natural character of yaks to explore and improve their growth potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355413>Use of UPLC-HRMS/MS for In Vitro and In Vivo Metabolite Identification of Three Methylphenidate-derived New Psychoactive Substances.</a></h2><p>The distribution of so-called new psychoactive substances (NPS) as substitute for common drug of abuse was steadily increasing in the last years, but knowledge about their toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic properties is lacking. However, a comprehensive knowledge of their toxicokinetics, particularly their , is crucial for developing reliable screening procedures and to verify their intake, e.g., in case of intoxications. The aim of this study was therefore to tentatively identify the metabolites of the methylphenidate-derived NPS isopropylphenidate (isopropyl 2-phenyl-2-(2-piperidyl) , IPH), 4-fluoromethylphenidate (methyl 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(piperidin-2-yl) , 4-FMPH) and 3,4-dichloromethylphenidate (methyl 2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(piperidin-2-yl) , 3,4-CTMP) using different in vivo and in vitro techniques and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS). Urine samples of male rats were analyzed, and the transfer to human  was done by using pooled human S9 fraction (pS9), which contains the microsomal fraction of liver homogenisate as well as its cytosol. UHPLC-HRMS/MS analysis of rat urine revealed 17 metabolites for IPH (14 phase I and 3 phase II metabolites), 13 metabolites were found for 4-FMPH (12 phase I metabolites and 1 phase II metabolite) and 7 phase I metabolites and no phase II metabolites were found for 3,4-CTMP. pS9 incubations additionally indicated that all investigated substances were primarily hydrolyzed, resulting in the corresponding carboxy metabolites. Finally, these carboxy metabolites should be used as additional analytical targets besides the parent compounds for comprehensive mass spectrometry-based screening procedures.© The Author(s) 2019.

Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences of 15 T. halophilus strains revealed their phylogenetic distinctness from other Tetragenococcus species. Pan-genome analysis of the T. halophilus strains showed that their carbohydrate  capabilities were diverse and strain dependent. Aside from one histidine decarboxylase gene in one strain, no decarboxylase gene associated with biogenic amine production was identified from the genomes. However, T. halophilus DSM 20339 produced tyramine without a biogenic amine-producing decarboxylase gene, suggesting the presence of an unidentified tyramine-producing gene. Our reconstruction of the   of these strains showed that T. halophilus harbors a facultative lactic acid fermentation pathway to produce l-lactate, ethanol, , and CO from various carbohydrates. The transcriptomic analysis of strain DSM 20339 suggested that T. halophilus may produce more  via the heterolactic pathway (including d-ribose ) at high salt conditions. Although genes associated with the  of glycine betaine, proline, glutamate, glutamine, choline, and citrulline were identified from the T. halophilus genomes, the transcriptome and metabolite analyses suggested that glycine betaine was the main compatible solute responding to high salt concentration and that citrulline may play an important role in the coping mechanism against high salinity-induced osmotic stresses. Our results will provide a better understanding of the genome and  features of T. halophilus, which has implications for the food fermentation industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Incubation of two aryl-SCFCH ethers with the model yeast organism  indicates that the sulfur of the thioether is rapidly converted to the corresponding sulfoxide, and then significantly more slowly to the sulfone. When the substrate was (OMe)PhSCFCH, then the resultant (demethylated) phenol sulfoxide had an enantiomeric excess of 60%, and when the substrate was the β-substituted-SCFCH naphthalene, then the enantiomeric excess of the resultant sulfoxide was 54%. There was no evidence of defluorination, unlike the corresponding oxygen ether (OMe)PhOCFCH, which was converted to the (demethylated) phenol  ester during  incubation. We conclude that the aryl-S-CFCH motif is metabolised in a similar manner to aryl-SCF, a motif that is being widely explored in discovery chemistry. It is however, significantly less lipophilic than aryl-SCF which may offer a practical advantage in tuning overall pharmacokinetic profiles of molecules in development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550490>Acid-resistant enzyme@MOF nanocomposites with mesoporous silica shells for enzymatic applications in acidic environments.</a></h2><p>Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) with tunable pore sizes and high surface areas have recently used as an effective support for immobilizing enzymes. However, the instability in the aqueous acidic environment has limited their practical applications in some cases. In this work, we develop a novel catalase/ZIFs composite with mesoporous silica shell (mSiO@CAT/ZIFs) via co-precipitation, and controlled self-assembly of silanes. During preparation, the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide induced the formation of the mesostructured silica layer on the outer surface of CAT/ZIFs. The resultant mSiO@CAT/ZIFs exhibited high activity recovery (92%). Compared with the conventional CAT/ZIFs and free CAT, mSiO@CAT/ZIFs exhibited excellent acid resistance. For example, after 30 min in  buffer solution (pH 3.0), the CAT/ZIFs and free CAT almost lost activity whereas the mSiO@CAT/ZIFs still retained 35% of original activity. Meanwhile, the thermostability of the mSiO@CAT/ZIFs was enhanced significantly compared with conventional CAT/ZIFs. In addition, the mSiO@CAT/ZIFs displayed excellent storage stability, and retained 60% of its initial activity after 15 days storage period. Furthermore, the mSiO@CAT/ZIFs could maintain 70% of its initial activity after 8 continuous uses, demonstrating superior reusability than the free CAT and CAT/ZIFs.

Cell viability was examined by 4-[3-[4-lodophenyl]-2-4(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio-1,3-benzene disulfonate] water soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. Bifenthrin (100-400 μM) concentration-dependently induced [Ca] rises. Ca removal reduced the signal by approximately 30%. In Ca-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished bifenthrin-evoked [Ca] rises. Conversely, treatment with bifenthrin abolished BHQ-evoked [Ca] rises. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 significantly inhibited bifenthrin-induced [Ca] rises.

However, the transcriptional, , and epigenetic regulation of Trm cell and TIL development and function is largely undefined. Here, we found that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 was specifically required for Trm cell and TIL development and polyfunctionality. Local PD-1 signaling inhibited TIL Bhlhe40 expression, and Bhlhe40 was critical for TIL reinvigoration following anti-PD-L1 blockade. Mechanistically, Bhlhe40 sustained Trm cell and TIL mitochondrial fitness and a functional epigenetic state. Building on these findings, we identified an epigenetic and  regimen that promoted Trm cell and TIL gene signatures associated with tissue residency and polyfunctionality. This regimen empowered the anti-tumor activity of CD8 T cells and possessed therapeutic potential even at an advanced tumor stage in mouse models. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the local regulation of Trm cell and TIL function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to evaluate the benefits of flutamide as an alternative anti-androgen agent and its effects on the efficacy of novel androgen receptor-targeted agents.Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer on novel androgen receptor-targeted agents without prior docetaxel therapy were included. Changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level were recorded.Patients who responded well to flutamide (Flutamide effective) following initial maximum androgen blockade (MAB) showed significantly higher changes in serum PSA levels (p=0.039) and PSA-progression-free survival (PFS) rate (p=0.016) following enzalutamide therapy compared to those who did not respond well to flutamide. Multivariate analysis showed that the factor of Flutamide effective was significantly associated with a good PSA-PFS rate following enzalutamide therapy (HR=7.36, 95%CI=1.4-38.71, p=0.018).Patients showing good response to flutamide following initial MAB may achieve a satisfactory PSA-PFS rate with subsequent enzalutamide therapy.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

In this study, 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenome sequencing were combined with C-labeled metabolite probing of the CCMPs to assess community carbon  along a temperature gradient (60-95°C) in Great Boiling Spring, NV. 16S rRNA gene amplicon diversity was inversely proportional to temperature, and  were dominant at higher temperatures. KO richness and diversity were also inversely proportional to temperature, yet CCMP genes were similarly represented across the temperature gradient and many individual metagenome-assembled genomes had complete . In contrast, genes encoding cellulosomes and many genes involved in plant matter degradation and photosynthesis were absent at higher temperatures.  C-CO production from labeled isotopomer pairs of glucose, pyruvate, and  suggested lower relative oxidative pentose phosphate pathway activity and/or fermentation at 60°C, and a stable or decreased maintenance energy demand at higher temperatures. Catabolism of C-labeled citrate, succinate, L-alanine, L-serine, and L-cysteine was observed at 85°C, demonstrating broad heterotrophic activity and confirming functioning of the TCA cycle. Together, these results suggest that temperature-driven losses in biodiversity and gene content in geothermal systems may not alter CCMP function or maintenance energy demands at a community level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566701>Nutritional requirements for Lactobacillus vini growth in sugarcane derivative substrate of ethanol fermentation.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus vini is a bacterial contaminant found in industrial environments of winemaking and fuel-ethanol fermentation. However, there has been no standard analysis of its physiology that can pinpoint its adaptive traits to these kinds of environments. In view of this lack of information, the aim of this study is to determine the nutritional factors that lead to the growth of L. vini in the industrial plants of fuel-ethanol. First of all, the limited growth of this bacterium was studied in the industrial substrate, which was improved by nutritional supplementation with amino acids, and its homofermentative status was confirmed. Metabolite analysis showed that citrate is a growth factor of paramount importance for this bacterium in industrial processes through pyruvate metabolization, and increases ATP production and biomass formation. Furthermore,e  uptake, either from the medium or generated from citrate , was assimilated for biomass production. Hence, a  model was designed to describe the role of citrate and  in the growth of L. vini that could be tested on other lactobacilli.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611860> gen. nov. sp. nov., a Novel Fumarate-Fermenting Microorganism From a Deep Fractured Carbonate Aquifer of the US Great Basin.</a></h2><p>Deep fractured rock ecosystems across most of North America have not been studied extensively. However, the US Great Basin, in particular the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS, formerly the Nevada Test Site), has hosted a number of influential subsurface investigations over the years. This investigation focuses on resident microbiota recovered from a hydrogeologically confined aquifer in fractured Paleozoic carbonate rocks at 863 - 923 meters below land surface. Analysis of the microorganisms living in this oligotrophic environment provides a perspective into microbial  strategies required to endure prolonged hydrogeological isolation deep underground. Here we present a microbiological and physicochemical characterization of a deep continental carbonate ecosystem and describe a bacterial genus isolated from the ecosystem. Strain DRI-13 is a strictly anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, fumarate-respiring member of the phylum . This bacterium grows optimally at 55°C and pH 8.0, can tolerate a concentration of 100 mM NaCl, and appears to obligately metabolize fumarate to  and succinate. Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicates a global subsurface distribution, while the closest cultured relatives of DRI-13 are  (90.0% similarity) and  (88.0% similarity). The predominant fatty acid profile is iso-C  , C  , C   and C  . The percentage of the straight-chain fatty acid C   is a defining characteristic not present in the other closely related species. The genome is estimated to be 3,649,665 bp, composed of 87.3% coding regions with an overall average of 45.1% G + C content. Strain DRI-13 represents a novel genus of subsurface bacterium isolated from a previously uncharacterized rock-hosted geothermal habitat. The characterization of the bacterium combined with the sequenced genome provides insights into  strategies of the deep subsurface biosphere. Based on our characterization analysis we propose the name  (DRI-13 = DSM 100382 = ATCC TSD-12).Copyright © 2019 Hamilton-Brehm, Stewart, Zavarin, Caldwell, Lawson, Onstott, Grzymski, Neveux, Lollar, Russell and Moser.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350361>Ferredoxin5 Deletion Affects  of Algae during the Different Phases of Sulfur Deprivation.</a></h2><p>Ferredoxin5 (FDX5), a minor ferredoxin protein in the alga  (), helps maintain thylakoid membrane integrity in the dark. Sulfur (S) deprivation has been used to achieve prolonged hydrogen production in green algae. Here, we propose that FDX5 is involved in algal responses to S-deprivation as well as to the dark. Specifically, we tested the role of FDX5 in both the initial aerobic and subsequent anaerobic phases of S-deprivation. Under S-deprived conditions, absence of FDX5 causes a distinct delay in achieving anoxia by affecting photosynthetic O evolution, accompanied by reduced  uptake, lower starch accumulation, and delayed/lower fermentative metabolite production, including photohydrogen. We attribute these differences to transcriptional and/or posttranslational regulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase and ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, and increased stability of the PSII D1 protein. Interestingly, increased levels of FDX2 and FDX1 were observed in the mutant under oxic, S-replete conditions, strengthening our previously proposed hypothesis that other ferredoxins compensate in response to a lack of FDX5. Taken together, the results of our omics and pull-down experiments confirmed biochemical and physiological results, suggesting that FDX5 may have other effects on   through its interaction with multiple redox partners.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The set scenario of this work was to investigate the feasibilities of glucose (G) combining with sodium  (SA) carbon sources in enhancing biomass and lipid accumulation in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea. The results demonstrated that C. subellipsoidea subjected to the combination feeding of G (20 g/L) and SA (12 g/L) achieved the favorable biomass (5.22 g/L) and lipid content (52.16%). The resulting lipid productivity (388.96 mg/L/day) was 1.33- to 7.60-fold more than those of sole G or SA as well as other combinations of G and SA. Even though the total fatty acids of C. subellipsoidea cells treated with the optimal combination of G and SA showed no noticeable increment in comparison with sole G or SA, the proportion of monounsaturated C18:1 (over 48.69%) and the content of C18:3 (< 12%) were commendable in high-quality algal biodiesel production. Further, such fascinating lipid accumulation in C. subellipsoidea cells treated with G combining with SA might be attributed to that G promoted glycolysis as well as SA activated glyoxylate shunt and TCA cycle to synergistically provide sufficient acetyl-CoA precursors for lipid accumulation. These findings hinted the potential of the combination of carbon sources in enhancing the overall lipid productivity to offset alga-based biodiesel production cost and would guide other alga strains cultivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253318>Sand as a solid support in ultrasound-assisted MSPD: A simple, green and low-cost method for multiresidue pesticide determination in fruits and vegetables.</a></h2><p>Sand was studied as a solid support in ultrasound-assisted matrix solid-phase dispersion (UA-MSPD) for the extraction of different pesticide classes, including organophosphates, carbamates, triazoles and pyrethroids from fruits and vegetables, with determination by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS.

The aim was to assess the changes in biochemistry associated with the cases self-reported PEM scores over a 7-day period and the frequency of reporting over a 12-month period. Forty-seven ME/CFS cases and age/sex-matched controls had a clinical examination, completed questionnaires; were subjected to standard serum biochemistry; had their serum and urine metabolomes analyzed in an observational study. Thirty-five of the 46 ME/CFS cases reported PEM in the last 7-days and these were allocated to the PEM group. The principal biochemical change related to the 7-day severity of PEM was the fall in the purine metabolite, hypoxanthine. This decrease correlated with alterations in the glucose:lactate ratio highly suggestive of a glycolytic anomaly. Increased excretion of urine metabolites within the 7-day response period indicated a hypermetabolic event was occurring. Increases in urine excretion of methylhistidine (muscle protein degradation), mannitol (intestinal barrier deregulation) and  were noted with the hypermetabolic event. These data indicate hypoacetylation was occurring, which may also be related to deregulation of multiple cytoplasmic enzymes and DNA histone regulation.

This study is based on the use of a chromogenic reporter "visible" substrate (substrate A), whose complete hydrolysis time course is retarded by a competing "invisible" substrate (substrate B). For BChE, four visible substrates were used, two thiocholine esters, benzoylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, and two aryl-acylamides, o-nitro trifluoro acetaminide and 3-(acetamido)-N,N,N-trimethylanilinium. Three different competing invisible substrates were used, phenyl , acetylcholine and butyrylcholine. For AChE, two visible substrates were used, acetylthiocholine and 3-(acetamido)-N,N,N-trimethylanilinium. For AChE, acetylcholine was competing with visible substrates. The ratio (R) of bimolecular rate constants, k/K, for all couples of substrates, invisible/visible (B/A) covered all possible limit situations, R ≪ 1, R ≈ 1 and R ≫ 1. The kinetic approach, based on the method developed by Golicnik and Masson allowed determination of binding and catalytic parameters of cholinesterases for both visible and invisible substrates. This analysis was applied to michaelian and non-michaelian catalytic behaviors (activation and inhibition by excess substrate). Reevaluation of catalytic parameters obtained for acetylcholine and butyrylcholine more than 50 years ago was made. The method is fast, reliable, and particularly suitable for poorly soluble substrates and for substrates B when no direct spectrophotometric assays exist. Moreover, replacing substrate B by a reversible inhibitor, mechanism of cholinesterase inhibition was possible to study. It is therefore, useful for screening libraries of new substrates and inhibitors, and/or screening of new cholinesterase mutants. This method can be applied to any other enzymes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, CA and polycaprolactone (PCL) was applied to fabricate the electrospun nanofibrous for wound dressing application. Propolis is a resin-like macromolecule produced by honeybees from the buds and diverse plants. Among many applications of this macromolecule, it has been occasionally employed directly to the skin for wound healing applications. Herein, owing to the significance of propolis, CA/PCL nanofibers were impregnated with a propolis-extracted solution to reach antibacterial and antioxidant mat. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that electrospinning of 10% (w/w) CA along with 14% (w/w) PCL produced excellent nanofibers compared to the resultant nanofibers. Hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity nature of CA/PCL mats was measured using water contact-angle method before and after treatment with NaOH. The nanofibrous mats exhibited a high water absorption capacity of about 400%. Antioxidant effect was measured by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and propolis-CA/PCL presented a high antioxidant activity. Additionally, propolis-CA/PCL mats showed antibacterial activity against both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, our results have confirmed that the propolis-impregnated CA/PCL mats have provided an appropriate surface for wound healing system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Dexamethasone (DXM) was used to create a CP mouse model. A 9.4‑Tesla (T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imager was used to measure an array of metabolites in the maternal serum, placental tissue, amniotic fluid and fetal palates. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed using SIMCA‑P 14.1 software. Following DXM treatment, variations were detected in multiple metabolites in the female mice and their fetuses based on 9.4T MRS. It was indicated that in the experimental group during CP formation, leucine, valine, creatine,  and citrate levels in the palatal tissue were lower, whereas lactate, alanine, proline/inositol and glutamate‑containing metabolite levels were higher, compared with the levels in the control group. In placental tissue and amniotic fluid, succinate and choline levels were lower in the experimental group. The relative concentrations of cholesterol and lipids in palatal tissues from mice treated with DXM were higher compared with the concentrations in tissues from mice in the control group, with the exception of (CH2)n lipids. In the placental tissue, the alteration in cholesterol level exhibited the opposite trend.

To improve the release and acidification of organic matters in waste activated sludge (WAS) fermentation simultaneously, a novel method was proposed with magnetite addition under alkaline condition in this study. Compared with the control, SCFAs and acetic acids yields increased by 21.2% ± 3.1% and 31.0% ± 1.2% in the 0.6 g/gVSS magnetite-based system, respectively. Besides, the activities of α-glucosidase, protease and  kinase (AK) were enhanced with magnetite addition, and the abundance of acidogenic microbes was improved obviously. Furthermore, magnetite reduced the release of PO-P significantly via the precipitation reaction. Of all, a novel side-stream WAS hydrolysis and acidification process based on magnetite addition under suitable alkaline condition is proposed, realizing the efficient recovery of carbon and phosphorus resources along with wastewater and WAS treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There are some indications that SCFAs inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rodents, but research on this subject is sparse. However, it has been reported that receptors for SCFAs, free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) and FFAR3 are expressed not only on gut endocrine cells secreting GLP-1 and PYY, but also on pancreatic islet cells. We hypothesized that SCFAs might influence the endocrine secretion from pancreatic islets similar to their effects on the enteroendocrine cells. We studied this using isolated perfused mouse pancreas which responded adequately to changes in glucose and to infusions of arginine. None of the SCFAs, , propionate and butyrate, influenced glucagon secretion, whereas they had weak inhibitory effects on somatostatin and insulin secretion. Infusions of two specific agonists of FFAR2 and FFAR3, CFMB and Compound 4, respectively, did not influence the pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon, whereas both induced strong increases in the secretion of somatostatin. In conclusion, the small effects of , propionate and butyrate we observed here may not be physiologically relevant, but the effects of CFMB and Compound 4 on somatostatin secretion suggest that it may be possible to manipulate pancreatic secretion pharmacologically with agonists of the FFAR2 and 3 receptors, a finding which deserves further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289990>Synergistic Effects of Volatiles from Host-Infested Plants on Host-Searching Behavior in the Parasitoid Wasp Lytopylus rufipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae).</a></h2><p>Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are important cues for natural enemies to find their hosts. HIPVs are usually present as blends and the effects of combinations of individual components are less studied. Here, we investigated plant volatiles in a tritrophic system, comprising the parasitoid wasp Lytopylus rufipes Nees (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), the Oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and Japanese pear, Pyrus pyrifolia 'Kosui', so as to elucidate the effects of single components and blends on wasp behaviors. Bioassays in a four-arm olfactometer, using either shoots or their isolated volatiles collected on adsorbent, revealed that female wasps preferred volatiles from host-infested shoots over those from intact shoots. Analyses identified (Z)-3-hexenyl  (H), linalool (L), (E)-β-ocimene (O), (E)-3,8-dimethyl-1,4,7-nonatriene (D), and (E,E)-α-farnesene (F). Among them, only F was induced by infestation with G. molesta. When tested singly, only O and D elicited positive responses by L. rufipes. Binary blends of HO and DF elicited a positive response, but that of HD elicited a negative one, even though D alone elicited a positive response. Remarkably, wasps did not prefer either the ODF or HL blends, but showed a highest positive response to a quinary blend (HLODF). These results show that synergism among volatiles released from host-infested plants is necessary for eliciting high behavioral responses in L. rufipes, enabling L. rufipes to find its host efficiently.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636611>Interrogating the Transient Selectivity of Bacterial Chemotaxis-Driven Affinity and Accumulation of Carbonaceous Substances  Raman Microspectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Carbonaceous substances are fundamental organic nutrients for microbial  and catabolism in natural habitats. Microbial abilities to sense, accumulate, and utilize organic carbonaceous substances in the complex nutrient environment are important for their growth and ecological functions. Bacterial chemotaxis is an effective mechanism for microbial utilization of carbonaceous substances under nutrient depletion conditions. Although bacterial accumulation and utilization to individual carbonaceous substance in long-term cultivation has been well studied, their selective affinity of mixed carbonaceous substances remains to be investigated, primarily because of technical limitations of conventional methods. Herein, we applied Raman microspectroscopy to identify chemotaxis-driven affinity and accumulation of four organic carbonaceous substances (glucose, succinate, , and salicylate) by three bacterial strains (, , and ).  exhibited strong binding affinity toward glucose and succinate, whereas  and  were preferentially responsive to glucose and . For the first time, bacterial transient selectivity of carbonaceous substances was studied  interrogating Raman spectral alterations. Post-exposure to carbonaceous-substance mixtures, the three bacterial strains showed distinct selective behaviors. Stronger selective affinity enhanced the chemotaxis-related signal transduction in  cells, whereas the carbonaceous substance signal transduction in  was decreased by higher selective affinity. In , there was no specific effect of selective affinity on signal transduction. Our study suggests that Raman microspectroscopy can successfully investigate and distinguish different scenarios of bacterial competitive and transient unitization of organic carbonaceous substances.Copyright © 2019 Li, Martin, Jones and Zhang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212140>Development and validation of a chiral LC-ESI-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of the enantiomeric metabolites isosorbide 2-mononitrate and isosorbide 5-mononitrate of isosorbide dinitrate in rat and human plasma.</a></h2><p>A specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) assay was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of two active metabolites of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), namely, isosorbide 2-mononitrate (IS 2-MN) and isosorbide 5-mononitrate (IS 5-MN). A simple protein precipitation extraction technique was employed using C isosorbide 5-mononitrate as the internal standard. The two isomers were separated on a chiral column and mass detection was carried out by electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode (ESI -ve). As neutral organic nitrates do not ionize well in ESI ion source, adduct formation of IS 2-MN and IS 5-MN were evaluated.  adduct ions of IS 2-MN and IS 5-MN were well ionized and fragmentable in the negative mode by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry. These acetates adduct ions, of IS 2-MN and IS 5-MN were selected as parent mass for quantitation. The method was developed and validated in rat and human plasma with KEDTA as an anticoagulant. This simultaneous quantitation method was shown to be linear over a working range of 25.0 ng/mL to 5050 ng/mL and 12.4 ng/mL to 2500 ng/mL for IS 2-MN (r > 0.99) and IS 5-MN (r > 0.99), respectively, in rat and human plasma. Sensitivity was determined as 25.0 ng/mL for IS 2-MN and 12.4 ng/mL for IS 5-MN in rat and human plasma. Inter- and intra-day accuracy and precision were within ±15% in both method validations. This validated method was subsequently applied to a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ISDN in rat after oral administration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we compared the physiology of A. schindleri ACE and Escherichia coli JM101 growing on  as the carbon source. In contrast to JM101, ACE grew on  threefold faster, had a twofold higher biomass yield, and a 45% higher specific  consumption rate. Transcriptional analysis revealed that genes like ackA, pta, aceA, glcB, fumA, tktA and talA were overexpressed while acsA, sfcA, ppc and rpiA were underexpressed in ACE relative to JM101. This transcriptional profile together with carbon flux balance analysis indicated that ACE forms acetyl-CoA preferentially by the AckA-Pta ( kinase-phosphotransacetylase) pathway instead of Acs (acetyl-CoA synthetase) and that the glyoxylate shunt and tricarboxylic acid cycle are more active in ACE than in JM101.

In neurons, acetylation of histones relies on the metabolite acetyl-CoA, which is produced from  by chromatin-bound acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). Notably, the breakdown of alcohol in the liver leads to a rapid increase in levels of blood , and alcohol is therefore a major source of  in the body. Histone acetylation in neurons may thus be under the influence of  that is derived from alcohol, with potential effects on alcohol-induced gene expression in the brain, and on behaviour. Here, using in vivo stable-isotope labelling in mice, we show that the  of alcohol contributes to rapid acetylation of histones in the brain, and that this occurs in part through the direct deposition of acetyl groups that are derived from alcohol onto histones in an ACSS2-dependent manner. A similar direct deposition was observed when mice were injected with heavy-labelled  in vivo. In a pregnant mouse, exposure to labelled alcohol resulted in the incorporation of labelled acetyl groups into gestating fetal brains. In isolated primary hippocampal neurons ex vivo, extracellular  induced transcriptional programs related to learning and memory, which were sensitive to ACSS2 inhibition.

The structures of flavanols were confirmed by NMR analysis after the isolation procedure from a hydrohalcolic extract (Hh-B) that also allowed for the identification of phenolic acids, an aryl butanol glucoside, and different derivatives of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol. Tiliroside isomers were the chemical markers of Hh-A and Hh-B (54.33 and 36.00 mg/g, respectively).

As a noninvasive physical therapy, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory effect in recent years. However, the role of LIPUS on synovitis of OA and the underlying mechanisms are little known. The present study showed that LIPUS ameliorated synovial inflammation in destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model and air pouch model, and alleviated pain gait patterns of DMM mouse. LIPUS dramatically inhibited the production of mature IL1B/IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta)  and . In addition, LIPUS upregulated the macroautophagy/autophagy level as well as accelerated the formation of an SQSTM1 (sequestosome1)-PKM (pyruvate kinase, muscle) complex in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-treated macrophages. Besides, LIPUS downregulated the level of PKM2 in LPS-ATP-treated macrophages, which could be reversed by SQSTM1 knockdown. In brief, the present study for the first time demonstrates that LIPUS inhibits the production of mature IL1B partially via SQSTM1-dependent autophagic degradation of PKM2 in LPS-ATP-treated macrophages, which may further ameliorate the synovial inflammation and gait patterns in animal models.

Here, we demonstrate an alternative strategy, a growth-coupled, high-yield bioconversion, by feeding cells a non-sugar substrate, by-passing central , and linking a key  step to generation of acetyl-CoA that is required for biomass and energy generation. Specifically, we converted levulinic acid (LA), an established degradation product of lignocellulosic biomass, to butanone (a.k.a. methyl-ethyl ketone - MEK), a widely used industrial solvent. Our strategy combines a catabolic pathway from Pseudomonas putida that enables conversion of LA to 3-ketovaleryl-CoA, a CoA transferase that generates 3-ketovalerate and acetyl-CoA, and a decarboxylase that generates 2-butanone. By removing the ability of E. coli to consume LA and supplying excess  as a carbon source, we built a strain of E. coli that could convert LA to butanone at high yields, but at the cost of significant  consumption. Using flux balance analysis as a guide, we built a strain of E. coli that linked  assimilation to production of butanone. This strain was capable of complete bioconversion of LA to butanone with a reduced  requirement and increased specific productivity. To demonstrate the bioconversion on real world feedstocks, we produced LA from furfuryl alcohol, a compound readily obtained from biomass. These LA feedstocks were found to contain inhibitors that prevented cell growth and bioconversion of LA to butanone. We used a combination of column chromatography and activated carbon to remove the toxic compounds from the feedstock, resulting in LA that could be completely converted to butanone. This work motivates continued collaboration between chemical and biological catalysis researchers to explore alternative conversion  and the technical hurdles that prevent their rapid deployment.Copyright © 2019 International  Engineering Society.

The gut microbiota/gut hormone axis has recently received increasing attention. However, the relationship between the gut microbiota and melatonin receptors has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effect of the gut microbiota on colonic melatonin receptor expression in germ-free (GF) rats and to further explore the potential mechanism in Caco-2 cells. In this study, GF rats were transplanted with fecal samples from a healthy human donor. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze the microbial communities. Colon tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The correlations between melatonin receptor expression and the gut microbiota were assessed. Melatonin receptor expression in Caco-2 cells was detected by Western blot. We found that fecal microbiota transplantation significantly increased the expression of colonic melatonin receptors in GF rats. The amount of fecal Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was significantly higher in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rats than in GF rats. SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats. Additionally,  and propionate significantly increased melatonin receptor-1 expression in Caco-2 cells. Therefore, the gut microbiota may promote melatonin receptor expression, and the mechanism may involve the action of SCFAs.

The multi-flower spiciform thyrse of lavender not only determines the output of EOs but also reflects an environmental adaption strategy. With the flower development and blossom in turn, the fluctuation of the volatile terpenoids displayed a regular change at each axis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of volatile terpenoids during the process of flowering is poorly understood in lavender. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA-Seq analyses of flowers of five developmental stages at first- and second-axis (FFDSFSA) and initial flower bud (FB0) to discover the active terpenoid biosynthesis as well as flowering-related genes.A total of 56 mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified in the EOs of L. angustifolia 'JX-2'. FB0' EO consists of 55 compounds and the two highest compounds, β-trans-ocimene (20.57%) and (+)-R-limonene (17.00%), can get rid of 74.71 and 78.41% aphids in Y-tube olfactometer experiments, respectively. With sequential and successive blossoms, temporally regulated volatiles were linked to pollinator attraction in field and olfaction bioassays. In three characteristic compounds of FFDSFSA' EOs, linalyl  (72.73%) and lavandulyl  (72.09%) attracted more bees than linalool (45.35%). Many transcripts related to flowering time and volatile terpenoid  expressed differently during the flower development. Similar  and transcriptomic profiles were observed when florets from the two axes were maintained at the same maturity grade. Besides both compounds and differentially expressed genes were rich in FB0, most volatile compounds were significantly correlated with FB0-specific gene module. Most key regulators related to flowering and terpenoid  were interconnected in the subnetwork of FB0-specific module, suggesting the cross-talk between the two biological processes to some degree.Characteristic compounds and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest control.

In addition to echocardiographic,  and hemodynamic analyses, immunohistochemistry and RNAseq were performed on left ventricular tissue. Obesity negatively affected cardiac output, led to an elevated E/e' ratio and mildly reduced ejection fraction. DS-induced hypertension did not affect cardiac output and minimally elevated E/e' ratio. Diastolic derangements in placebo-treated obese rats developed in absence of inflammation and fibrosis, yet in presence of oxidative stress and hypertrophic remodelling. In contrast, hypertension triggered apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis, with limited synergy of the comorbidities observed for inflammation and fibrosis. Transcriptional data suggested that these comorbidities exerted opposite effects on mitochondrial function. In placebo-treated obese rats, genes involved in fatty acid  were up-regulated, whereas DS-induced a down-regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, limited interaction was observed between these comorbidities in development of diastolic dysfunction. Importantly, differences in obesity- and hypertension-induced cardiac remodelling emphasize the necessity for comorbidity-specific phenotypical characterization.© 2019 The Authors.

The  of ellagitannins to urolithins via GM depends on urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, -B, or -0), which have been reported to predict host responsiveness to a polyphenol-rich intervention. This study aims to assess whether UMs were associated with differential GM modulation after short-term walnut consumption. In this study, 27 healthy individuals consumed 33 g of peeled raw walnuts over three days. GM profiling was determined using 16S rRNA illumina sequencing and specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), as well as microbial activity using short-chain fatty acids analysis in stool samples. UMs stratification of volunteers was assessed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis of urolithins in urine samples. The gut microbiota associated with UM-B was more sensitive to the walnut intervention. , and members of the Coriobacteriaceae family, including , increased exclusively in UM-B subjects, while some members of the Lachnospiraceae family decreased in UM-A individuals.  and  increased in both UMs and higher  and propionate production resulted after walnuts intake. Our results show that walnuts consumption after only three days modulates GM in a urolithin metabotype-depending manner and increases the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295574>Using carbon substrate as a selection pressure to enhance the potential of aerobic granular sludge microbial communities for removing contaminants of emerging concern.</a></h2><p>The ability of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) technology to biotransform contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is largely unknown. AGS supplemented with either , 2-propanol, glycerol, or a 1:1:1 mixture of all three, were cultivated to investigate the link between carbon supplements and biotransformation of six CECs. Carbon substrate had a significant effect on the microbial community composition, as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. Substrate degradation requiring a larger number of catabolic reactions (i.e., glycerol and the mix) was associated with greater microbial richness. The biotransformation of CECs was 45.9% greater in communities supplemented with glycerol (60.3 ± 30.2 µg L VSS) compared to  (20.9 ± 29.7 µg L VSS). Database surveys of  reactions indicate that microbial communities supplemented with glycerol have the greatest capacity for the degradation of aromatic compounds, while those supplemented with  community have the lowest.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to develop an ophthalmic nanoparticles loaded gel, for delivering prednisolone  (PA), to increase dosing accuracy, bioavailability, and accordingly, efficiency of PA in treating inflammatory ocular diseases.  A novel formulation of self-assembled nanoparticles was prepared by the complexation of chitosan (CS) and, the counter-ion, sodium deoxycholate (SD), loaded with the poorly-water-soluble PA. Particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading content (LC) of prepared nanoparticles were assessed. Moreover, the nanoparticles were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Drug release and eye anti-inflammatory potential of the prepared novel formulation was investigated.  Mean particle size of the nanoparticles have dropped from 976 nm ±43 (PDI 1.285) to 480 nm ±28 (PDI 1.396) when the ratio of CS-SD was decreased. The incorporation of 0.1-0.3% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), in the preparation stages, resulted in smaller nanoparticles: 462 nm ±19 (PDI 0.942) and 321 nm ±22 (PDI 0.454) respectively. DSC and FTIR results demonstrated the interaction between CS and SD, however, no interactions were detected between PA and CS or SD. Drug release of PA as received, in simulated tears fluid (pH 7.4), showed a twofold increase (reaching an average of 98.6% in 24 hours) when incorporated into an optimized nanoparticle gel formulation (1:5 CS-SD).  The anti-inflammatory effect of PA nanoparticles loaded gel on female guinea pig eyes was significantly superior to that of the micronized drug loaded gel ( < 0.05).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239112>Effects of drospirenone and norethisterone  combined with estradiol on mammographic density and proliferation of breast epithelial cells-A prospective randomized trial.</a></h2><p>There are no previous data on the influence of drospirenone (DRSP) in combination with estradiol (E2) on the breast in postmenopausal women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of DRSP or norethisterone  (NETA) in continuous combination with E2 on two surrogate markers for breast cancer - mammographic breast density and proliferation of breast epithelial cells - in healthy postmenopausal women.120 healthy, naturally postmenopausal women were randomized to either 2 mg of DRSP or 0.5 mg of NETA in continuous combination with 1 mg of oral E2. The women underwent mammography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the breast at baseline and after six months of treatment.Digitized mammographic breast density and breast cell proliferation.There was a significant increase in mammographic breast density after treatment in both groups (median increase 5.5% for E2/DRSP and 2.3% for E2/NETA, respectively, p < 0.001), but with no significant difference between groups. The proliferation of breast epithelial cells also increased in both groups (p < 0.001, respectively), with a significantly larger increase in the E2/DRSP group than in the E2/NETA group (2.5% versus 0.7%, respectively, p < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure had decreased significantly after 6 months of treatment in the E2/DRSP group (p < 0.05) but not in the E2/NETA group.Breast density increased to a similar degree with E2/DRSP and E2/NETA.

One of the key intermediates in central carbon  is acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which can be either oxidized in the citric acid cycle or assimilated into biomass through dedicated . Two acetyl-CoA assimilation strategies in bacteria have been described so far, the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP) and the glyoxylate cycle (GC). Here, we show that  uses both strategies for acetyl-CoA assimilation during different growth stages, revealing an unexpected  complexity in the organism's central carbon . The EMCP is constitutively expressed on various substrates and leads to high biomass yields on substrates requiring acetyl-CoA assimilation, such as , while the GC is specifically induced on these substrates, enabling high growth rates. Even though each acetyl-CoA assimilation strategy alone confers a distinct growth advantage,  recruits both to adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as a switch from succinate to . Time-resolved single-cell experiments show that during this switch, expression of the EMCP and GC is highly coordinated, indicating fine-tuned genetic programming. The dynamic  rewiring of acetyl-CoA assimilation is an evolutionary innovation by  that allows this organism to respond in a highly flexible manner to changes in the nature and availability of the carbon source to meet the physiological needs of the cell, representing a new phenomenon in central carbon . Central carbon  provides organisms with energy and cellular building blocks during growth and is considered the invariable "operating system" of the cell. Here, we describe a new phenomenon in bacterial central carbon . In contrast to many other bacteria that employ only one pathway for the conversion of the central metabolite acetyl-CoA,  possesses two different acetyl-CoA assimilation . These two  are dynamically recruited during different stages of growth, which allows  to achieve both high biomass yield and high growth rates under changing environmental conditions. Overall, this dynamic rewiring of central carbon  in  represents a new strategy compared to those of other organisms employing only one acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway.Copyright © 2019 Kremer et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31457094>Life on the thermodynamic edge: Respiratory growth of an acetotrophic methanogen.</a></h2><p>Although two-thirds of the nearly 1 billion metric tons of methane produced annually in Earth's biosphere derives from , the in situ process has escaped rigorous understanding.

Abelmoschus manihot (AM) extracted from Flos Abelmoschus manihot that has been applied for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we showed that AM significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. AM modified gut microbiota composition, increased microbial diversity, and in particularly, elevated the abundance of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing gut microbiota in colitic mice. Consequently, levels of SCFAs especially butyrate and  were increased upon AM treatment, which, primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway, led to the enhanced Treg generation and the suppressed Th17 development. Together, we herein provide the first evidences to support that AM, a natural plant-derived complex, can potentially reset gut microbiome and , resume immune and tissue homeostasis, and hence prevent colitis, which may provide a new perspective on IBD pathogenesis and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Many studies have characterized the response of genetically identical cells to nutrient switches in homogeneous cultures; however, in nature, microbes often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms where cells can create  gradients by consuming and releasing nutrients. Consequently, cells experience different local microenvironments and vary in their phenotype. How does this phenotypic variation affect the ability of cells to cope with nutrient switches? Here, we address this question by growing dense populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers and studying a switch from glucose to  at the single-cell level. Before the switch, cells vary in their  activity: some grow on glucose, while others cross-feed on . After the switch, only few cells can resume growth after a period of lag. The probability to resume growth depends on a cells' phenotype prior to the switch: it is highest for cells cross-feeding on , while it depends in a non-monotonic way on the growth rate for cells growing on glucose. Our results suggest that the strong phenotypic variation in spatially structured populations might enhance their ability to cope with fluctuating environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301512>Carbamazepine is degraded by the bacterial strain Labrys portucalensis F11.</a></h2><p>The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a topic of concern. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a widespread antiepileptic drug and due to its physical-chemical characteristics minimal removal is achieved in conventional water treatments, and thus has been suggested as a molecular marker of wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater. The present study reports the biotransformation of CBZ by the bacterial strain Labrys portucalensis F11. When supplied as a sole carbon source, a 95.4% biotransformation of 42.69 μM CBZ was achieved in 30 days. In co- with , complete biotransformation was attained at a faster rate. Following a target approach, the detection and identification of 14 intermediary metabolites was achieved through UPLC-QTOF/MS/MS. Biotransformation of CBZ by the bacterial strain is mostly based on oxidation, loss of -CHNO group and ketone formation reactions; a biotransformation pathway with two routes is proposed. The toxicity of untreated and treated CBZ solutions was assessed using Vibrio Fischeri and Lepidium sativum acute toxicity tests and Toxi-Chromo Test. The presence of CBZ and/or its degradations products in solution resulted in moderate toxic effect on Vibrio Fischeri, whereas the other organisms were not affected. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report that proposes the  degradation pathway of CBZ by a single bacterial strain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show reduction of fetal thymic size, altered thymic architecture and reduced fetal thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell output in preeclamptic pregnancies, which persists up to 4 years of age in human offspring. In germ-free mice, fetal thymic CD4 T cell and Treg cell development are compromised, but rescued by maternal supplementation with the intestinal bacterial metabolite short chain fatty acid (SCFA) , which induces upregulation of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), known to contribute to Treg cell generation.

Glucose is the ultimate substrate for most brain activities that use carbon, including synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid via mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Brain  and neuronal excitability are thus interdependent. However, the principles that govern their relationship are not always intuitive because heritable defects of brain glucose  are associated with the paradoxical coexistence, in the same individual, of episodic neuronal hyperexcitation (seizures) with reduced basal cerebral electrical activity. One such prototypic disorder is pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency (PDHD). Pyruvate dehydrogenase is central to  because it steers most of the glucose-derived flux into the TCA cycle. To better understand the pathophysiology of PDHD, we generated mice with brain-specific reduced PDH activity that paralleled salient human disease features, including cerebral hypotrophy, decreased amplitude electroencephalogram (EEG), and epilepsy. The mice exhibited reductions in cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate content, spontaneous, and electrically evoked in vivo cortical field potentials and γ EEG oscillation amplitude. Episodic decreases in γ oscillations preceded most epileptiform discharges, facilitating their prediction. Fast-spiking neuron excitability was decreased in brain slices, contributing to in vivo action potential burst prolongation after whisker pad stimulation. These features were partially reversed after systemic administration of , which augmented cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate-dependent synaptic transmission, inhibition and γ oscillations, and reduced epileptiform discharge duration. Thus, our results suggest that dysfunctional excitability in PDHD is consequent to reduced oxidative flux, which leads to decreased neuronal activation and impaired inhibition, and can be mitigated by an alternative  substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325170>Validated HPLC method for simultaneous quantification of mutant IDH1/2 inhibitors (enasidenib, ivosidenib and vorasidenib) in mouse plasma: Application to a pharmacokinetic study.</a></h2><p>Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors comprise a novel class of anticancer drugs, which are approved to treat acute myeloid leukemia patients having mutations on IDH1/2.

These substrates are becoming increasingly important feedstock in industrial microbiology. The main potential industrial application of acetogenic bacteria is the production of metabolites that constitute renewable energy sources (biofuel); such bacteria are of particular interest for this purpose thanks to their low energy requirements for large-scale cultivation. Here, we report new genome sequences for four species, three of them are reported for the first time, namely Acetobacterium paludosum DSM 8237, Acetobacterium tundrae DSM 917, Acetobacterium bakii DSM 8239, and Alkalibaculum bacchi DSM 221123. We performed a comparative genomic analysis focused on the WL pathway's genes and their encoded proteins, using Acetobacterium woodii as a reference genome. The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values ranged from 70% to 95% over an alignment length of 5.4-6.5 Mbp. The core genome consisted of 363 genes, whereas the number of unique genes in a single genome ranged from 486 in A. tundrae to 2360 in A.bacchi. No significant rearrangements were detected in the gene order for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway however, two species showed variations in genes involved in formate : A. paludosum harbor two copies of fhs1, and A. bakii a truncated fdhF1. The analysis of protein  highlighted the expansion of protein orthologues in A. woodii compared to A. bacchi, whereas protein  involved in the WL pathway were more conserved.

Simultaneously, herbivores utilize volatile cues to identify appropriate hosts. Despite extensive efforts to understand sources of variation in plant communication by VOCs, we lack an understanding of how ubiquitous belowground mutualists, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), influence plant VOC emissions. In a full factorial experiment, we subjected plants of two milkweed (Asclepias) species under three levels of AMF availability to damage by aphids (Aphis nerii). We then measured plant headspace volatiles and chemical defenses (cardenolides) and compared these to VOCs emitted and cardenolides produced by plants without herbivores. We found that AMF have plant species-specific effects on constitutive and aphid-induced VOC emissions. High AMF availability increased emissions of total VOCs, two green leaf volatiles (3-hexenyl  and hexyl ), and methyl salicylate in A. curassavica, but did not affect emissions in A. incarnata. In contrast, aphids consistently increased emissions of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and benzeneacetaldehyde in both species, independent of AMF availability. Both high AMF availability and aphids alone suppressed emissions of individual terpenes. However, aphid damage on plants under high AMF availability increased, or did not affect, emissions of those terpenes. Lastly, aphid feeding suppressed cardenolide concentrations only in A. curassavica, and AMF did not affect cardenolides in either plant species. Our findings suggest that by altering milkweed VOC profiles, AMF may affect both herbivore performance and natural enemy attraction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364272>Carbon isotopic heterogeneity of coenzyme F430 and membrane lipids in methane-oxidizing archaea.</a></h2><p>Archaeal ANaerobic MEthanotrophs (ANME) facilitate the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), a process that is believed to proceed via the reversal of the methanogenesis pathway. Carbon isotopic composition studies indicate that ANME are metabolically diverse and able to assimilate metabolites including methane, methanol, , and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Our data support the interpretation that ANME in marine sediments at methane seeps assimilate both methane and DIC, and the carbon isotopic compositions of the tetrapyrrole coenzyme F430 and the membrane lipids archaeol and hydroxy-archaeol reflect their relative proportions of carbon from these substrates. Methane is assimilated via the methyl group of CH -tetrahydromethanopterin (H MPT) and DIC from carboxylation reactions that incorporate free intracellular DIC. F430 was enriched in  C (mean δ C = -27‰ for Hydrate Ridge and -80‰ for the Santa Monica Basin) compared to the archaeal lipids (mean δ C = -97‰ for Hydrate Ridge and -122‰ for the Santa Monica Basin). We propose that depending on the side of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle used to synthesize F430, its carbon was derived from 76% DIC and 24% methane via the reductive side or 57% DIC and 43% methane via the oxidative side. ANME lipids are predicted to contain 42% DIC and 58% methane, reflecting the amount of each assimilated into acetyl-CoA. With isotope models that include variable fractionation during biosynthesis for different carbon substrates, we show the estimated amounts of DIC and methane can result in carbon isotopic compositions of - 73‰ to - 77‰ for F430 and - 105‰ for archaeal lipids, values close to those for Santa Monica Basin. The F430 δ C value for Hydrate Ridge was  C-enriched compared with the modeled value, suggesting there is divergence from the predicted two carbon source models.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261727>Physiologically Relevant Alternative Carbon Sources Modulate Biofilm Formation, Cell Wall Architecture, and the Stress and Antifungal Resistance of .</a></h2><p>Flexibility in carbon  is pivotal for the survival and propagation of many human fungal pathogens within host niches.

The cholinergic system can be investigated specifically using positron emission tomography (PET) with [C]N-methyl-4-piperidyl- (MP4A), while neuronal  is often assessed with 2-deoxy-2-[F]fluoro-d-glucose-(FDG) PET. We hypothesised a close correlation between MP4A-perfusion and FDG-uptake, permitting inferences about  from MP4A-perfusion, and investigated the patterns of neuronal hypometabolism and cholinergic impairment in non-demented AD patients. MP4A-PET was performed in 18 cognitively normal adults and 19 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and positive AD biomarkers. In nine patients with additional FDG-PET, the sum images of every combination of consecutive early MP4A-frames were correlated with FDG-scans to determine the optimal time window for assessing MP4A-perfusion. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was estimated using a 3-compartmental model. Group comparisons of MP4A-perfusion and AChE-activity were performed using the entire sample. The highest correlation between MP4A-perfusion and FDG-uptake across the cerebral cortex was observed 60-450 s after injection (r = 0.867). The patterns of hypometabolism (FDG-PET) and hypoperfusion (MP4A-PET) in MCI covered areas known to be hypometabolic early in AD, while AChE activity was mainly reduced in the lateral temporal cortex and the occipital lobe, sparing posterior midline structures. Data indicate that patterns of cholinergic impairment and neuronal hypometabolism differ significantly at the stage of MCI in AD, implying distinct underlying pathologies, and suggesting potential predictors of the response to cholinergic pharmacotherapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Previous studies in our laboratory showed that early lead exposure reduced the number of microglial cells in hippocampus/dentate gyrus of C57BL/6 J mice. In the current study, C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) were examined to investigate whether these neuroimmune factors which are known to trigger cell migration and antigen presentation, were altered by early chronic lead exposure. Thirty-six C57BL/6 J male mice were exposed to 0 ppm (controls, n = 12), 30 ppm (low-dose, n = 12), or 430 ppm (higher-dose, n = 12) of lead  via dams' milk from postnatal day (PND) 0 to 28. Flow cytometry was used to quantify cell types and cell surface expression of MHC II and CCR7 in hippocampal and whole brain microglia. Non-parametric independent samples median tests were used to test for statistically significant differences between groups. As compared to controls, CCR7 in hippocampal microglia was decreased in the low-dose group, measured as geometric mean fluorescence intensity (GMFI); in the higher-dose group CCR7MHC II hippocampal microglia were decreased. Further analyses revealed that the higher-dose group had decreased percentage of CCR7MHC II hippocampal macrophages as compared to controls but increased MHC II levels in CCR7MHC II hippocampal macrophages as compared to controls. It was also noted that lead exposure disrupted the balance of MHC II and/or CCR7 in lead exposed animals. Reduced CCR7 in hippocampal microglia might alter the neuroimmune environment in hippocampi of lead exposed animals. Additional studies are needed to test this possibility.Copyright © 2019.

Although several marketed direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) have been widely used in clinic, the potentially serious complications of these DTIs prompted the researchers to find more DTIs with improved safety profiles. Herein, we report that natural anthraquinones in Cassiae semen (the seed of Cassia obtusifolia L. or C. tora L.), including obtusifolin, obtusin, aurantio-obtusin and chryso-obtusin, display strong to moderate inhibition on human thrombin, with the IC values ranging from 9.08 μM to 27.88 μM. Further investigation on the inhibition kinetics demonstrates that these anthraquinones are mixed inhibitors against thrombin-mediated Z-GGRAMC  hydrolysis, while obtusifolin and aurantio-obtusin show strong thrombin inhibition capacity, with the K values of 9.63 μM and 10.30 μM, respectively. Docking simulations demonstrate that both obtusifolin and aurantio-obtusin can simultaneously bind on the catalytic cavity and the two anion binding exosites (ABE1 and ABE2), while the hydroxyl group at the C-7 site and the methoxyl group at the C-8 site can create key interactions with the amino acids surrounding the catalytic cavity via hydrogen bonding. All these findings suggest that obtusifolin and aurantio-obtusin are strong thrombin inhibitors possessing a unique anthraquinone skeleton, and could be used as lead compounds for the development of new thrombin inhibitors with improved properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this cross-sectional study (160 participants, 64% male, BMI: 19.2-41.0 kg/m, normal or impaired glucose ), associations between SCFA (faecal and fasting circulating) and circulating metabolites, substrate oxidation and IS were investigated. In a subgroup (n = 93), IS was determined using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age and BMI. Fasting circulating , propionate and butyrate concentrations were positively associated with fasting GLP-1 concentrations. Additionally, circulating SCFA were negatively related to whole-body lipolysis (glycerol), triacylglycerols and free fatty acids levels (standardized (std) β adjusted (adj) -0.190, P = 0.023; std β adj -0.202, P = 0.010; std β adj -0.306, P = 0.001, respectively). Circulating  and propionate were, respectively, negatively and positively correlated with IS (M-value: std β adj -0.294, P < 0.001; std β adj 0.161, P = 0.033, respectively). We show that circulating rather than faecal SCFA were associated with GLP-1 concentrations, whole-body lipolysis and peripheral IS in humans. Therefore, circulating SCFA are more directly linked to  health, which indicates the need to measure circulating SCFA in human prebiotic/probiotic intervention studies as a biomarker/mediator of effects on host .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591464>Alternative fate of glyoxylate during  and hexadecane  in Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1.</a></h2><p>The glyoxylate shunt (GS), involving isocitrate lyase (encoded by aceA) and malate synthase G (encoded by glcB), is known to play important roles under several conditions including oxidative stress, antibiotic defense, or certain carbon source  ( and fatty acids). Comparative growth analyses of wild type (WT), aceA, and glcB null-strains revealed that aceA, but not glcB, is essential for cells to grow on either  (1%) or hexadecane (1%) in Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1. Interestingly. the aceA knockout strain was able to grow slower in 0.1%  than the parent strain. Northern Blot analysis showed that the expression of aceA was dependent on the concentration of  or HO, while glcB was constitutively expressed. Up-regulation of stress response-related genes and down-regulation of main carbon -participating genes in a ΔaceA mutant, compared to that in the parent strain, suggested that an ΔaceA mutant is susceptible to  toxicity, but grows slowly in 0.1% . However, a ΔglcB mutant showed no growth defect in  or hexadecane and no susceptibility to HO, suggesting the presence of an alternative pathway to eliminate glyoxylate toxicity. A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, encoded by a ldh) could possibly mediate the conversion from glyoxylate to oxalate based on our RNA-seq profiles. Oxalate production during hexadecane degradation and impaired growth of a ΔldhΔglcB double mutant in both  and hexadecane-supplemented media suggested that LDH is a potential detoxifying enzyme for glyoxylate. Our constructed LDH-overexpressing Escherichia coli strain also showed an important role of LDH under lactate, , and glyoxylate metabolisms. The LDH-overexpressing E. coli strain, but not wild type strain, produced oxalate under glyoxylate condition.

This regulatory process is orchestrated by the Crc and Hfq proteins. The present work examines the changes that occur in  fluxes when the crc gene is inactivated and cells grow exponentially in LB complete medium. Analyses were performed at three different moments during exponential growth, examining the assimilation rates for the compounds present in LB, changes in the proteome, and the changes in  fluxes predicted by the iJN1411  model for P. putida KT2440. During the early exponential phase, consumption rates for sugars, many organic acids and most amino acids were higher in a Crc-null strain than in the wild type, leading to an overflow of the   and the leakage of pyruvate and . These accelerated consumption rates decreased during the mid-exponential phase, when cells mostly used sugars and alanine. At later times, pyruvate was recovered from the medium and utilized. The higher consumption rates of the Crc-null strain reduced the growth rate. The lack of the Crc/Hfq regulatory system thus led to unbalanced  with poorly optimized  fluxes.© 2019 The Authors.

Ames, an edible medicinal plant named "panlongshen" in Chinese that is popularly used in medicinal foods and herbal teas. The structures of the obtained compounds were identified on the basis of extensive NMR spectroscopy and HR-ESI-MS analyses. The cytotoxicities of the phenanthrenes (1-13), the bibenzyl compound (14) , and the flavonoids (15-16 and 20-22) toward SGC-7901, HepG2, and B16-F10 cell lines were examined in vitro. Compounds 1 and 7 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities toward all of the selected cancer cell lines, and their IC values ranged from 19.0 ± 7.3 to 30.2 ± 5.6 μM. Spiranthesphenanthrene A (1) exhibited higher cytotoxic activity than the positive control cisplatin toward the B16-F10 cell line (IC = 19.0 ± 7.3 μM). A wound healing assay revealed the inhibition of the migration of B16-F10 cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent pattern by treatment with 2.5, 5, and 10 μM solutions of compound 1 for 24 and 48 h, respectively. Western blots revealed that compound 1 obviously increased the level of the E-cadherin protein (an epithelial marker) and decreased the levels of the vimentin and N-cadherin proteins (mesenchymal markers). Furthermore, the level of the transcription factor Snail was also obviously decreased by compound 1 in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, compound 1 inhibits the migration of B16-F10 cancer cells, which may be closely related to the inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen results in the formation of VFA with hydrogen (H2) as a byproduct that is used for CH4 formation. Generally, fermentation  leading to  are associated with the most H2 production, less H2 formation is associated with butyrate production, and propionate and valerate production are associated with reduced H2 production. Therefore, VFA may constitute a potential correlated proxy for CH4 emissions to enable high-throughput animal screening. The objective of the present study was to determine the genetic parameters for ruminal and plasma VFA concentrations in sheep fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pellets and their genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations with CH4 emissions. Measurements of CH4 emissions in respiration chambers and ruminal (stomach tubing 18 h from last meal) and blood plasma (3 h post-feeding) VFA concentrations were made on 1,538 lambs from 5 birth years (2007 and 2009 to 2012) aged between 5 and 10 mo, while the animals were fed alfalfa pellets at 2.0 times maintenance requirements in 2 equal size meals (0900 and 1500 h). These measurements were repeated twice (rounds) 14 d apart. Mean (± SD) CH4 production was 24.4 ± 3.08 g/d, and the mean CH4 yield was 15.8 ± 1.51 g/kg DMI. Mean concentration of total ruminal VFA was 52.2 mM, with concentrations of , propionate and butyrate of 35.97, 8.83, and 4.02 mM, respectively. Ruminal total VFA concentration had heritability (h2) and repeatability estimates (± SE) of 0.24 ± 0.05 and 0.35 ± 0.03, respectively, and similar estimates were found for , propionate, and butyrate. Blood plasma concentrations of VFA had much lower estimates of h2 and repeatability than ruminal VFA. Genetic correlations with CH4 yield were greatest for total concentrations of ruminal VFA and , with 0.54 ± 0.12 and 0.56 ± 0.12, respectively, which were much greater than their corresponding rp. The rp and rg of ruminal VFA proportions and blood VFAs with CH4 emissions were in general lower than for ruminal VFA concentrations. However, minor ruminal VFA proportions had also moderate rg with CH4 yield. Pre-feeding concentrations of total VFA and  were the strongest correlated proxies to select sheep that are genetically low CH4 emitters.© The Author(s) 2019.

Women with PCOS manifest hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, low-grade systemic inflammation, and polycystic ovaries. Unfortunately, current available medications are only symptomatic without relevant reported treatment. Therefore, a pressing need for alternative safe approaches is necessitated. To this end, the present study is designed to investigate therapeutic merits of the edible plant: Ocimum kilimandscharicum (Ok), in a letrozole PCOS rat model, and compare it to metformin.PCOS rats were treated with Ok total extract and its different fractions at 100 mg/kg orally for 10 consecutive days. Moreover, phytochemical characterization was applied using HPLC/PDA/ESI-MS to identify different secondary metabolites in the bioactive fractions.Results revealed that the total extract (Ok) and ethyl  (EA) fraction improved insulin sensitivity and restored normal hormonal and lipid profiles as well as normal morphological structure of the reproductive system. Furthermore, elevation of SOD and reduction of VEGF levels in comparison with metformin were recorded.These results suggest that Ok extract and EA fraction halt letrozole-induced reproductive dysfunctions and restore normal morphological and physiological functions in PCOS rats, even superior to metformin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

No research information concerning its capability to improve fish immune response is available, so in this study the potential immunomodulatory effects of Protec were investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Head kidney (HK) leukocytes from adult fish (100 g, n = 6) were in vitro incubated with Protec immune support pack resulting in significantly higher respiratory burst activity and proliferation. Specifically, sonicated Protec immune support pack (160 μg/ml) induced a respiratory burst response similar to that promoted by zymosan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while non-sonicated Protec immune support pack induced a response comparable to that of cells stimulated with phorbol myristate  (PMA). Moreover, the proliferation of leukocytes exposed to sonicated Protec immune support pack (20 μg/ml) was significantly higher than that of cells stimulated with zymosan, and it was comparable to the proliferation of cells stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and LPS. Afterwards, a feeding trial was performed in a rainbow trout farm. Two groups of juvenile rainbow trout (10 g) were acclimated for 7 weeks before the experiment and fed daily with a commercial control diet (Optiline HE, Skretting Italia) at 2% BW/day. At the end of acclimation, one group of fish was fed with Protec diet (Skretting Italia) at 2% BW/day whereas the other group continued to feed the control diet at the same level for further 4 weeks. Then, fish were sampled (HK leukocytes from n = 6 fish/group, serum from n = 12 fish/group) or intraperitoneally vaccinated against lactococcosis (n = 160/dietary group/time point). Fish fed the same diets for further 4 weeks after vaccination, then feeding returned to the control diet in both groups until the end of the trial. The specific antibody response was recorded at 4 and 8 weeks after vaccination (n = 12 fish/group). The administration of Protec significantly enhanced the respiratory burst activity of leukocytes and the synthesis of specific IgM against Lactococcus garvieae, whereas the serum lysozyme activity was unaffected.

In each developmental stage, rats were further divided into three subgroups: lead-exposed, one-course and two-course DMSA chelation therapy subgroups. Blood/bone lead concentrations, serum calciotropic hormones concentrations, and mRNA and protein expressions of bone turnover markers in the serum and bones were measured. Bone microstructures were analyzed using Micro-CT.Compared with lead-exposed during childhood and adolescenthood, increases in blood/bone lead levels, and the changes of blood/bone lead and trabecular bone microstructures after one-course DMSA chelation were most significant in rats lead-exposed during infanthood (P < .05).

These effects were accompanied by changes of serum parathormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)-D) concentrations. DMSA chelation partially reversed the changes of bone microarchitectures, bone formation and resorption markers, and calciotropic-hormones, and the efficiency was greatest when the therapy was provided during infanthood.Developmental Pb exposure impaired bone microstructures and interfered bone , and the exposure effect was more obvious during infanthood than during childhood and adolescenthood.

The residue depletion study showed that the concentrations of FF and FFA in urine were higher than those in edible tissues at three time points. This method was reliable, simple and cost efficient, and could be used to monitor FF residues in porcine edible tissue without slaughtering animals.

Long term semi continuous experiments were carried out, both with sole FW and with Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) as a co-substrate, at varying operational conditions (0.8-2.2 g VS L d) and FW / WAS ratios. Acidification was observed along FW mono-digestion, making it necessary to buffer the digesters; ADM1 modelling and experimental results suggested that this phenomenon was due to the methanogenic activity decline, most likely related to a deficiency in trace elements. WAS addition, even at proportions as low as 10% of the organic load, settled the acidification issue; this ability was related to the promotion of the methanogenic activity and the consequent enhancement of  consumption, rather than to WAS buffering capacity. The ability of the ADM1 to model processes affected by low microbial activity, such as FW mono-digestion, was also assessed. It was observed that the ADM1 was only adequate for digestions with a high activity level for both bacteria and methanogens (FISH/CARD-FISH ratio preferably >0.8) and, under these conditions, the model was able to correctly predict the relative abundance of both microbial populations, extrapolated from FISH analysis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing mathematical rumen models, however, lack the representation of these mechanisms. A dynamic mechanistic model was developed that simulates the thermodynamic control of hydrogen partial pressure ( [Formula: see text] ) on volatile fatty acid (VFA) fermentation  via the NAD to NADH ratio in fermentative microbes, and methanogenesis in the bovine rumen. This model is unique and closely aligns with principles of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. Model state variables represent ruminal carbohydrate substrates, bacteria and protozoa, methanogens, and gaseous and dissolved fermentation end products. The model was extended with static equations to model the hindgut . Feed composition and twice daily feeding were used as model inputs. Model parameters were estimated to experimental data using a Bayesian calibration procedure, after which the uncertainty of the parameter distribution on the model output was assessed. The model predicted a marked peak in [Formula: see text] after feeding that rapidly declined in time. This peak in [Formula: see text] caused a decrease in NAD to NADH ratio followed by an increased propionate molar proportion at the expense of  molar proportion, and an increase in CH production that steadily decreased in time, although the magnitude of increase for CH emission was less than for [Formula: see text] . A global sensitivity analysis indicated that parameters that determine the fractional passage rate and NADH oxidation rate altogether explained 86% of the variation in predicted daily CH emission. Model evaluation indicated over-prediction of in vivo CH emissions shortly after feeding, whereas under-prediction was indicated at later times.

In particular, odd-chain carboxylic acids (OCCAs) such as valerate (C) and heptanoate (C), were produced at relatively high concentrations upon propionate supplementation.

Thus two bioaugmentation inocula (an enriched culture, and a mixed culture composed 50/50 by Methanoculleus thermophilus and the enriched culture) on the recovery of ammonia-inhibited thermophilic continuous reactors was assessed. The results showed that bioaugmentation improved methane yield by 11-13% and decreased the volatile fatty acids (VFA) by 45-52% compared to the control reactor (abiotic augmentation). Moreover, the importance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens to a fast and successful bioaugmentation was recognized. Specifically, the instant hydrogen partial pressure reduction by the bioaugmented hydrogenotroph created thermodynamically favourable conditions for the  oxidation process and consequently, the catabolism of other VFA.

Our goal here is to examine the effects of EtOH and its metabolites, acetaldehyde (AcH) and , on embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation.We designed ESC lines in which aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2, NCBI#11669) and acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2, NCBI#60525) were knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We selected these genes because of their key roles in EtOH oxidation in order to dissect the effects of EtOH  on differentiation.By using kinetic assays, we confirmed that AcH is primarily oxidized by ALDH2 rather than ALDH1A2. We found increases in mRNAs of differentiation-associated genes (Hoxa1, Cyp26a1, and RARβ2) upon EtOH treatment of WT and Acss2 ESCs, but not Aldh2 ESCs. The absence of ALDH2 reduced mRNAs of some pluripotency factors (Nanog, Sox2, and Klf4). Treatment of WT ESCs with AcH or 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), another substrate of ALDH2, increased differentiation-associated transcripts compared to levels in untreated cells. mRNAs of genes involved in retinoic acid (RA) synthesis (Stra6 and Rdh10) were also increased by EtOH, AcH, and 4-HNE treatment. Retinoic acid receptor-γ (RARγ) is required for both EtOH- and AcH-mediated increases in Hoxa1 and Stra6, demonstrating the critical role of RA:RARγ signaling in AcH-induced ESC differentiation.ACSS2 knockouts showed no changes in differentiation phenotype, while pluripotency-related transcripts were decreased in ALDH2 knockout ESCs.

Temporal data for fraction of dose in plasma [13C10]retinol were modeled using WinSAAM software and a 6-component model with vitamin A intake included as weighted data.Model-predicted TBS was 198, 533, and 1062 μmol for the Bangladeshi (age, 9-17 mo), Filipino (12-18 mo), and Guatemalan children (35-65 mo). Retinol kinetics were similar for Filipino and Guatemalan groups and generally faster for Bangladeshi children, although fractional transfer of plasma retinol to a larger exchangeable storage pool was the same for the 3 groups. Recycling to plasma from that pool was ∼2.5 times faster in the Bangladeshi children compared with the other groups and the recycling number was 2-3 times greater. Differences in kinetics between groups are likely related to differences in vitamin A stores and intakes (geometric means: 352, 727, and 764 μg retinol activity equivalents/d for the Bangladeshi, Filipino, and Guatemalan children, respectively).By collecting 1 or 2 blood samples from each child to generate a composite plasma tracer data set with a minimum of 5 children/time, group TBS and retinol kinetics can be estimated in children by compartmental analysis; inclusion of vitamin A intake data increases confidence in model predictions.

Till now, the effects of PCB on methane production during WAS anaerobic digestion was still limited. This study aimed to investigate whether and how PCB affects methane production. Results showed that the increased PCB concentration led to the less methane produced. At the highest concentrations of PCB (100 mg/kg DS) in this study, the methane production (112 ± 6 L CH/kg VS) was significantly reduced by 26.6 ± 0.1% compared to the control (153 ± 7 L CH/kg VS). Correspondingly, VS destruction at the studied concentrations showed the similar trend. In addition, the dewaterability evaluation indicated that the PCB resulted in the deteriorative sludge dewaterability. The mechanism studies suggested that the decreased methane production with the increased levels of PCB was attributed to the suppression on hydrolysis-acidification and methanation processes.

We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty acid and bacterial butyryl CoA: CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2,  enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate  and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In this study, a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) poised at -500 mV (vs. SHE) was operated for biogas upgrading. Methane content in the biogas increased from 71% to >90%, and 8.2% of the CO was converted to methane. Methanothrix, an acetoclastic methanogen that can participate in direct electron transfer (DET), and Azonexus, an -oxidizing electrogen, were enriched on the cathode. Transcriptomics revealed that Methanothrix on the cathode were using the CO reduction pathway, while Methanothrix in the bulk sludge were using the  decarboxylation pathway for production of methane.

Analysis of the underivatized amino acids is performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) in the positive ESI mode. Separation is achieved on a strong cation exchange (SCX) column (Luna 5 μ SCX 100 Å) with 5% acetic acid in water (A) and 75 mM ammonium  in water (B). Quantification is accomplished by use of d-phenylalanine as internal standard achieving limits of detection of 5-50 nM. The method was successfully applied for the determination of proteinogenic amino acids in plant extracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504493>Contrasting effects of isocitrate dehydrogenase deletion on fluxes through enzymes of central  in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Flux analysis is central to understanding cellular  and successful manipulation of  fluxes in microbial cell-factories. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) deletion conferred contrasting effects on fluxes through substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) reactions. While significantly increasing flux through pyruvate kinase, it diminishes flux through succinyl CoA synthetase and upregulates phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and  kinase (AK). In addition to , the ICDH-less strain excretes pyruvate, citrate and isocitrate. While efflux to  excretion by the Escherichia coli parental strain and its ICDH-less derivative is a reflection of high throughput of glycolytic intermediates, excretion of pyruvate is a reflection of high throughput via pyruvate kinase. On the other hand, citrate and isocitrate excretion is a reflection of truncating the Krebs cycle at the level of ICDH. Furthermore, another striking finding is the inability of the ICDH-less cultures to utilize  as a source of carbon despite the availability of an adequate supply of extracellular glutamate (for biosynthesis) and elevated levels of AK and PTA (for  uptake). This striking observation is now explicable in the light of the newly proposed hypothesis that the expression of the ace operon enzymes is controlled in response to a minimum threshold signal (ATP), which could not be achieved in the ICDH-less strain.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358612>Impact of CO/HCO  Availability on Anaplerotic Flux in Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex-Deficient Corynebacterium glutamicum Strains.</a></h2><p>The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, yielding acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and CO The PDHC-deficient  Δ strain therefore lacks an important decarboxylation step in its central . Additional inactivation of , encoding pyruvate carboxylase, resulted in a >15-h lag phase in the presence of glucose, while no growth defect was observed on gluconeogenetic substrates, such as . Growth was successfully restored by deletion of , encoding the glucose-specific permease of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), thereby linking the observed phenotype to the increased sensitivity of the Δ Δ strain to glucose catabolism. In this work, the Δ Δ strain was used to systematically study the impact of perturbations of the intracellular CO/HCO  pool on growth and anaplerotic flux. Remarkably, all measures leading to enhanced CO/HCO  levels, such as external addition of HCO , increasing the pH, or rerouting  flux via the pentose phosphate pathway, at least partially eliminated the lag phase of the Δ Δ strain on glucose medium. In accordance with these results, inactivation of the urease enzyme, lowering the intracellular CO/HCO  pool, led to an even longer lag phase, accompanied by the excretion of l-valine and l-alanine. Transcriptome analysis, as well as an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment with the Δ Δ strain, revealed the reduction of glucose uptake as a key adaptive measure to enhance growth on glucose- mixtures. Taken together, our results highlight the significant impact of the intracellular CO/HCO  pool on  flux distribution, which becomes especially evident in engineered strains exhibiting low endogenous CO production rates, as exemplified by PDHC-deficient strains. CO is a ubiquitous product of cellular  and an essential substrate for carboxylation reactions. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) catalyzes a central  reaction contributing to the intracellular CO/HCO  pool in many organisms. In this study, we used a PDHC-deficient strain of , which additionally lacked pyruvate carboxylase (Δ Δ). This strain featured a >15-h lag phase during growth on glucose- mixtures. We used this strain to systematically assess the impact of alterations in the intracellular CO/HCO  pool on growth in glucose- medium. Remarkably, all measures enhancing CO/HCO  levels successfully restored growth. These results emphasize the strong impact of the intracellular CO/HCO  pool on  flux, especially in strains exhibiting low endogenous CO production rates.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252317>Unraveling interactive characteristics of microbial community associated with bioelectric energy production in sludge fermentation fluid-fed microbial fuel cells.</a></h2><p>This first-attempt study deciphered the interactive characteristics of anodophilic microbial community-associated bioelectricity production in waste activated sludge (WAS) fermentation fluid-fed microbial fuel cells (MFCs). A novel schematic elucidation for illustrating synergistic interactions in anodic microbial consortia towards electrogenesis was proposed. Moreover, the specific genera of Pseudomonas, Desulfovibrio, Phyllobacterium, Desulfuromonas, Chelatococcus and Aminivibrio were dominant in anodic biofilms, leading to an electrogenesis efficiency of 1.254 kWh/kg COD and peak power density of 0.182 W/m (at feeding level of 1.20 g COD/L). It was apparently higher than those MFCs fed with glucose/. The fermentative species contributed positively in reorganizing microbial community structure in anodic biofilms, positively relating to electrogenesis via interactions with exoeletrogens in MFCs. Finally, a more electrogenesis was positively associated to larger anodic microbial diversity, relatively medium anodic community evenness, together with higher abundance of functional genes related to electrogenesis in functional species in MFCs fed with WAS fermentation fluid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

First-line mCRPC treatment with enzalutamide and AAP yields similar overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival in phase III trials. Thus, treatment selection relies on patient choice, cost and side effects. The aim of this randomised trial is to investigate differences in fatigue, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and  side effects in men with mCRPC treated with first-line enzalutamide versus AAP.In this ongoing open-label randomised (1:1) clinical trial, enzalutamide is compared with AAP as first-line treatment for men with mCRPC. The primary endpoint is fatigue assessed with the questionnaire Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue version 4. Secondary endpoints are changes in body composition (ie, fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lean body mass assessed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), glucose  assessed with a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, serum lipids, blood pressure and HRQoL assessed with the questionnaire Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P). All study endpoints are assessed at baseline and 12-week postintervention. Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and at time of progression on allocated treatment for future investigation of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in prostate cancer treatment. The planned sample size is 170 participants. All participants are recruited from Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Denmark. Estimated last patient's last visit is February 2020.The study received project approval from the National Committee on Health Research Ethics and Danish Data Protection Agency and Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT no.: 2017-000027-99).

It gives the functional value true (1) if both functional arguments (input signals) have the same logical value (0,0 or 1,1), and false (0) if they are different (0,1 or 1,0). The output signal producing reaction is catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH), which is inhibited at acidic and basic pH values. Two other reactions catalyzed by esterase and urease produce acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide, respectively, shifting solution pH from the optimum pH for PQQ-GDH to acidic and basic values (1,0 and 0,1 input combinations, respectively), thus switching the enzyme activity off (output 0). When the input signals are not applied (0,0 combination) or both applied compensating each other (1,1 combination) the optimum pH is preserved, thus keeping PQQ-GDH running at the high rate (output 1). The biocatalytic cascade mimicking the NXOR gate was characterized optically and electrochemically. In the electrochemical experiments the PQQ-GDH enzyme communicated electronically with a conducting electrode support, thus resulting in the electrocatalytic current when signal combinations 0,0 and 1,1 were applied. The logic gate operation, when it was realized electrochemically, was also extended to the biomolecular release controlled by the gate. The release system included two electrodes, one performing the NXOR gate and another one activated for the release upon electrochemically stimulated alginate hydrogel dissolution. The studied system represents a general approach to the biocatalytic realization of the NXOR logic gate, which can be included in different catalytic cascades mimicking operation of concatenated gates in sophisticated logic circuitries.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
