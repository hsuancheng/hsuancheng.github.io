<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1607682>Aberrant cytokine production by Sezary syndrome patients: cytokine secretion pattern resembles murine Th2 cells.</a></h2><p>Sezary syndrome (SzS), the leukemic stage of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), is typically a CD4+ T-cell lympho-proliferative disease characterized by numerous immunologic abnormalities, including decreased T-cell responses to antigens and mitogens, decreased natural killer and lymphocyte-activated killer cell activities, eosinophilia, and increased levels of immunoglobulins, particularly IgE and IgA. Because this constellation of abnormalities is reminiscent of the pleiotropic in vitro activities of IL-4 and IL-5, we examined the possibility that malignant T cells in SzS may be producing increased amounts of IL-4 with a concomitant decrease in IL-2 and IFN-gamma production. Such a cytokine secretion pattern would be similar to that produced by murine Th2 cells. Serum IL-4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements revealed that 33% of SzS patients (n = 21) had levels of IL-4 significantly higher (mean, 7.2 pg/ml; range, 0-48, p less than 0.05) than normal controls (mean, 1.59; range, 0-3.1). Although the majority of tested patients had elevated serum IgE, no direct correlation between serum IL-4 levels and serum IgE levels was observed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from SzS patients and stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) produced significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and significantly lower levels of IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma than did PBMC from normal controls (p less than 0.02, p less than 0.05, and p less than 0.02, respectively). PBMC from SzS patients in remission produced IL-4 and IL-2 levels similar to that of the normal controls. To determine if IFN-gamma could inhibit the increased IL-4 production by PHA-stimulated PBMC from SzS patients, IFN-gamma was added to culture at 0, 24, or 48 h prior to the addition of PHA. Significant decreases in IL-4 production were seen only in cultures incubated with IFN-gamma for 24 and 48 h prior to the addition of PHA. IL-2 levels were not affected by IFN-gamma incubation. The increased IL-4 and decreased IL-2 and IFN-gamma production by PBMC from SzS patients suggests that Sezary cells have a cytokine profile similar to murine Th2 cells. Moreover, this cytokine secretion pattern may play an integral role in the immunopathogenesis of advanced CTCL. The results also suggest that IFN-gamma be a useful component in the spectrum of therapeutic approaches to SzS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11464181>Complete molecular remission during biologic response modifier therapy for Sézary syndrome is associated with enhanced helper T type 1 cytokine production and natural killer cell activity.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a clonally derived, skin-invasive malignancy of CD4(+) T lymphocytes with the phenotype of mature helper T cells. Advancing stages of CTCL are associated with depressed cell-mediated , increased production of T helper type 2 cytokines and decreased levels of T helper type 1 cytokines.Our purpose was to evaluate the cytokine secretion pattern and cell-mediated cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with Sézary syndrome in relation to the presence of the malignant clone.Serial polymerase chain reaction for the T-cell receptor-beta or T-cell receptor-gamma gene rearrangement was used to determine the presence of the malignant clone. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine the levels of interleukin 4 and interferon gamma produced by the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients with Sézary syndrome.We demonstrate 3 cases of Sézary syndrome with typically suppressed cell-mediated cytotoxicity, elevated production of interleukin 4, and depressed production of interferon gamma by their peripheral blood mononuclear cells before institution of therapy with biologic response modifier therapy. In all 3 cases after clinical and molecular remission, we observed striking immunologic changes, including an increase in levels of natural killer cell activity and interferon gamma production and decreased production of interleukin 4.The observation that the cytokine secretion pattern by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 3 patients with Sézary syndrome normalized with the disappearance of the malignant clone from the peripheral blood suggests that the malignant T cells account for the aberrant cytokine production. Moreover, the aberrant cytokine production may be the cause for suppression of cell-mediated  seen in advancing stages of CTCL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9002450>A new human transporter associated with antigen processing alleles encodes a large C-terminal protein domain.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10570384>Extracorporeal photochemotherapy does not suppress T- or B-cell responses to novel or recall antigens.</a></h2><p>Extracorporeal photopheresis (ExP) is an effective therapy for several conditions including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, scleroderma, and allograft rejection. Experimental animal models suggest that ExP may induce antigen-specific immunosuppression.Our purpose was to determine the effect of photopheresis on humoral and cell-mediated  in human subjects.Recall and primary immune responses of patients with scleroderma receiving monthly ExP treatments were assessed by delayed type hypersensitivity skin tests, T-cell proliferative responses after immunizations with tetanus toxoid and keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and serum antibody titers against common viral pathogens.After 6 months of ExP, viral antibody titers and delayed type hypersensitivity responses were not significantly different from baseline values in all 7 patients tested. T-cell responses to tetanus toxoid remained normal in 3 of 3 patients tested for a minimum of 6 months after booster immunization. Immunization with the protein antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin after initiation of ExP therapy resulted in sustained T-cell proliferative responses up to 6 months in 3 of 3 patients.These results, along with the observation of no increased incidence of opportunistic infections or neoplasms, suggest that ExP is not broadly immunosuppressive and does not prevent primary responses to vaccination or other antigenic challenges.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8980285>Calcitonin gene-related peptide inhibits proliferation and antigen presentation by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: effects on B7, interleukin 10, and interleukin 12.</a></h2><p>CGRP is a neuropeptide that has previously been described to possess immunosuppressive activities. CGRP is released from peripheral nerves that, in the skin, are in close physical association with dendritic APC. We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which CGRP can inhibit immune responses by studying its effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Using allogeneic monocytes as stimulator cells, CGRP could inhibit the proliferation of PBMC by 47% when CGRP was present for the duration of culture. Interestingly, when the stimulator monocytes were incubated with CGRP for 2 h prior to irradiation then washed, the observed inhibition increased to 85%, suggesting that CGRP was exerting a direct effect on the monocyte stimulator population. Finally, the recall response to tetanus toxoid (TT) by PBMC from individuals vaccinated with TT 14 d prior was inhibited by 25-50% in the presence of CGRP. Also, CGRP decreased the levels of B7.2 but not B7.1 on treated monocytes, and this inhibition could be abrogated by the addition of anti-IL-10 antibody, suggesting that the inhibition was mediated by an increase in IL-10 production. Moreover, increased IL-10 production was confirmed by ELISA. Both IL-12 p40 and IFN-gamma levels in CGRP-treated cultures were found to be decreased by approximately 30%. The decrease in IL-12 p40 levels could be reversed by addition of anti-IL-10. These data suggest that CGRP inhibits PBMC proliferation, in part, through the release of IL-10, which in turn can downregulate important co-stimulatory molecules and the cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8958942>The potential therapeutic role of interleukin-12 in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by skin invasion of clonally derived malignant CD4+ lymphocytes that phenotypically resemble mature T-helper (Th) cells. Sezary syndrome (SzS) represents an advanced form of CTCL associated with generalized erythroderma and involvement of the peripheral blood by the malignant cell population. We have previously demonstrated aberrant cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in SzS characterized by increased IL-4 and deficient IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, as well as increased expression of mRNA for IL-4 and IL-5 within active skin lesions, indicating that the clonal T-cell population is likely derived from the T-helper type 2 (Th2) subset of helper T lymphocytes. Furthermore, a variety of immune abnormalities have been observed in association with SzS that have been attributed to the cytokine abnormalities. Because IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-gamma production and causes the activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, we assessed the production of IL-12 by PBMCs from SzS patients, and whether IL-12 could alter the unfavorable cytokine balance typical of SzS and, thus, possibly lead to correction of immune defects. In this review, we present our data, which indicate that patients with SzS exhibit marked defects in monocyte production of IL-12 p70. Moreover, in vitro culture of PBMC from SzS patients with recombinant IL-12 leads to reconstitution of normal IFN-gamma production and markedly enhances cell-mediated cytotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068644>Genomes and transcriptomes of partners in plant-fungal-interactions between canola (Brassica napus) and two Leptosphaeria species.</a></h2><p>Leptosphaeria maculans 'brassicae' is a damaging fungal pathogen of canola (Brassica napus), causing lesions on cotyledons and leaves, and cankers on the lower stem. A related species, L. biglobosa 'canadensis', colonises cotyledons but causes few stem cankers. We describe the complement of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZys) and peptidases of these fungi, as well as of four related plant pathogens. We also report dual-organism RNA-seq transcriptomes of these two Leptosphaeria species and B. napus during disease. During the first seven days of infection L. biglobosa 'canadensis', a necrotroph, expressed more cell wall degrading genes than L. maculans 'brassicae', a hemi-biotroph. L. maculans 'brassicae' expressed many genes in the Carbohydrate Binding Module class of CAZy, particularly CBM50 genes, with potential roles in the evasion of basal innate  in the host plant. At this time, three avirulence genes were amongst the top 20 most highly upregulated L. maculans 'brassicae' genes in planta. The two fungi had a similar number of peptidase genes, and trypsin was transcribed at high levels by both fungi early in infection. L. biglobosa 'canadensis' infection activated the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid defence pathways in B. napus, consistent with defence against necrotrophs. L. maculans 'brassicae' triggered a high level of expression of isochorismate synthase 1, a reporter for salicylic acid signalling. L. biglobosa 'canadensis' infection triggered coordinated shutdown of photosynthesis genes, and a concomitant increase in transcription of cell wall remodelling genes of the host plant. Expression of particular classes of CAZy genes and the triggering of host defence and particular metabolic pathways are consistent with the necrotrophic lifestyle of L. biglobosa 'canadensis', and the hemibiotrophic life style of L. maculans 'brassicae'.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153925>Immunomodulatory drugs: new options for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.</a></h2><p>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are common adult hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with progressive cytopenia and a risk of evolving into currently incurable acute myeloid leukemia. Until recently, the only treatment was bone marrow transplantation, but, over the past few years, a new therapeutic approach based on immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) has been developed. IMiDs belong to a therapeutic class whose progenitor is thalidomide, a synthetic derivative of glutamate that was initially used because of its sedative and antiemetic properties but was then withdrawn because of its teratogenic effects. IMiDs represent a major advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma at different disease stages, 5q minus syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia with the 5q deletion, mantle cell lymphoma, relapsing or unresponsive high-grade lymphoma, and relapsing indolent lymphoma.Medical databases and conference proceedings were searched to identify articles and clinical trials that have investigated or are investigating the use of IMiDs on MDS.An important part of their in vivo efficacy is attributed to their immunomodulatory properties because they potentiate the immune response by restoring dendritic cell function and inhibiting T-cell regulatory activity, which leads to the activation of T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells by increasing the production of interleukin-2 and interferon gamma. IMiDs are characterized by antitumoral and antiangiogenic activities, and they also induce the apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Thalidomide and its derivative lenalidomide have been proposed for the treatment of MDS because of their action on the immune mechanisms that appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of this syndrome.This article examines the pharmacology and molecular action of IMiDs and the evidence of their efficacy in treating patients with MDS in different risk classes.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The cured pods of these species are the source of natural vanilla flavor. In intensive cultivation systems the vines are threatened by viruses such as Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV). In order to investigate the effect of CymMV on the growth and metabolome of vanilla plants, four accessions grown in intensive cultivation systems under shadehouse, CR01 (V. planifolia), CR17 (V. xtahitensis), CR03 (V. planifolia × V. xtahitensis) and CR18 (Vanilla pompona), were challenged with an isolate of CymMV. CymMV infected plants of CR01, CR03 and CR17 had a reduced growth compared to healthy plants, while there was no significant difference in the growth of CR18 vines. Interestingly, CR18 had qualitatively more phenolic compounds in leaves and a virus titre that diminished over time. No differences in the metabolomic profiles of the shadehouse samples obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were observed between the virus infected vs. healthy plants. However, using in- vitro V. planifolia plants, the metabolomic profiles were affected by virus infection. Under these controlled conditions the levels of amino acids and sugars present in the leaves were increased in CymMV infected plants, compared to uninfected ones, whereas the levels of phenolic compounds and malic acid were decreased. The metabolism, growth and viral status of V. pompona accession CR18 contrasted from that of the other species suggesting the existence of partial resistance to CymMV in the vanilla germplasm.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.
