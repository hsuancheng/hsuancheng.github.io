Pigeon fanciers often feed their show pigeons  with the intention of increasing flight performance. The objective of our study was to determine the effect of two different , alone and in combination, on the fecal microbiome of Birmingham Roller pigeons. We sequenced fecal samples from 20 pigeons divided into three probiotic treatments, including prior to, during, and after treatment. Pre-treatment and control group samples were dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. Administration of a probiotic pellet containing Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus resulted in increase in average relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. from 4.7 ± 2.0% to 93.0 ± .3%. No significant effects of Enterococcus spp. were detected. Probiotic-induced shifts in the microbiome composition were temporary and disappeared within 2 days of probiotic cessation. Administration of a probiotic powder in drinking water that contained Enterococcus faecium and three Lactobacillus species had minimal effect on the microbiome. We conclude that supplementing Birmingham roller pigeons with the probiotic pellets, but not the probiotic powder, temporarily changed the microbiome composition. A next step is to experimentally test the effect of these changes in microbiome composition on host health and physical performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164406>New Approaches to Microbiome-Based Therapies.</a></h1><p>Over the last decade, our understanding of the composition and functions of the gut microbiota has greatly increased. To a large extent, this has been due to the development of high-throughput genomic analyses of microbial communities, which have identified the critical contributions of the microbiome to human health. Consequently, the intestinal microbiota has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. The large majority of microbiota-targeted therapies aim at engineering the intestinal ecosystem by means of  or prebiotics. Recently, a novel therapeutic approach has emerged which focuses on molecules that are secreted, modulated, or degraded by the microbiome and act directly on the host. Here, we discuss the advantages and challenges associated with the metabolite-based "postbiotic" approach, highlighting recent progress and the areas that need intensive attention and investigation over the next  years. The time is ripe for postbiotic therapies to be developed in the near future.Copyright © 2019 Wong and Levy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115599>Adhesion and Colonization of the Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus Labeled by Dsred2 in Mouse Gut.</a></h1><p>The health-promoting effects of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus are based on its adherence and colonization ability. However, little is known about its adhesion and colonization rates. Lactobacillus rhamnosus in mouse intestinal mucosa a mutant of the red fluorescence protein (RFP) DSred2 was used to tag L. rhamnosus to observe the adhesion and distribution of L. rhamnosus in mouse intestinal mucosa. A mutant of the red fluorescence protein (RFP) Dsred2 was used to tag L. rhamnosus to allow us to observe and distinguish it in the mouse intestine. Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were fed once (at day 0) with an oral administration of the labeled L. rhamnosus, and the number of labeled bacteria was detected in different regions of the intestinal tract at 3 h and at day 1, 2, 3, 4, , 6, 7, and 15 after administration. The labeling process changed the morphology of L. rhamnosus, as it appeared after observation under the microscope, but did not change its basic probiotic properties in vitro. In vivo, labeled L. rhamnosus reached the colonization peak at the fourth day after gavage. From the distribution point of view, the number of colonization strains increased from the proximal to the distal small intestine (duodenum < jejunum < ileum) and the number of strains in the colon was less than the distal small intestine (ileum). The labeling protocol actually allowed the detection of the distribution and adhesion of this bacterium to the intestine, thus demonstrating that the health-promoting effects of this probiotic are satisfied. This study provides a scientific basis in the use of  such as L. rhamnosus in functional foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280506>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is Associated with Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection in Premenopausal Women Independent of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Recently, studies have found that non-alcholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with bacterial infections. Attempts to identify risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are still underway.To examine a possible association between NAFLD and rUTIs among premenopausal women.In a case-control study, 1009 hospitalized premenopausal women with a UTI during a period of 3 years were retrospectively studied. A total of 186 subjects with rUTIs and 186 controls without a history of rUTIs were included in this study. Each participant had an abdominal ultrasonogram as part of the inclusion criteria. The two groups were compared in terms of risk factors for rUTIs, such as maternal history of rUTIs, use of contraceptives, frequency of sexual intercourse, metabolic syndrome, obesity, use of , serum levels of vitamin D, and NAFLD. An rUTI was defined as three or more episodes of UTI over a period of 1 year. NAFLD was diagnosed based on abdominal ultrasonography examination.Mean age of the 372 participants was 39.7 ±  years. NAFLD was diagnosed in 81/186 subjects (43.%) with rUTIs vs. 40/186 controls (21.%), P = 0.05. Women with rUTIs were more often obese and presented with lower serum levels of vitamin D than controls. Multivariate analysis showed that NAFLD (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.0, P = 0.04) were associated with rUTIs in premenopausal women.NAFLD was associated with rUTI in premenopausal women, independent of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are needed to confirm this association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375014>Dietary and Supplement-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Pediatric Autism Spectrum Disorder.</a></h1><p>Previous literature has shown that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is steadily increasing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little data is currently available regarding its use, safety, and efficacy in children with ASD. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the use of supplement-based CAM therapies in children between the ages of 4 to 17 years with ASD. This population-based, cross-sectional study evaluated children with ASD regarding supplement use. A total of 210 participants were recruited from a variety of sources including educational and physical activity programs, and social media to complete a questionnaire. Primary caregivers provided information on current supplement based CAM use. Data evaluated the proportion of children that used supplement therapies, the types of supplements used, reasons for use, perceived safety, and demographic factors associated with use (e.g. income, parental education, severity of disorder). Seventy-five percent of children with ASD consumed supplements with multivitamins (77.8%), vitamin D (44.9%), omega 3 (42.%),  (36.%), and magnesium (28.1%) as the most prevalent. Several supplements, such as adrenal cortex extract, where product safety has not yet been demonstrated, were also reported. A gluten free diet was the most common specialty diet followed amongst those with restrictions (14.8%). Health care professionals were the most frequent information source regarding supplements; however, 33% of parents reported not disclosing all their child's supplements to their physician. In conclusion, the use of supplement therapies in children with ASD is endemic and highlights the need for further research concerning public health education surrounding safety and efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315657> in pregnancy: protocol of a double-blind randomized controlled pilot trial for pregnant women with depression and anxiety (PIP pilot trial).</a></h1><p>Maternal prenatal depressive or anxiety symptoms are associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. With prevalence rates of maternal prenatal depression and anxiety ranging between 10 and 20%, attempts to identify effective interventions to reduce symptoms are priority. There are indications that  can reduce symptoms of maternal depression or anxiety.  ingested by the mother may thus offer a promising and accessible intervention to complement existing treatments.The  in Pregnancy (PIP) pilot trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot trial. While one group orally consumes a probiotic mixture (Ecologic® Barrier; 2, × 109 colony forming units/g; 2 g; daily), the other group consumes a placebo, from between 26 and 30 weeks gestation until delivery. Subjects are randomly allocated (1:1) to the intervention or placebo group. Forty healthy pregnant women with symptoms of depression or anxiety and uncomplicated pregnancies at randomization will be included. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a probiotic trial to reduce symptoms of maternal depression or anxiety in pregnancy. The secondary aim is to exploratorily compare the potential effect of , compared to placebo, on depressive and/or anxiety symptoms, maternal stress (i.e. reported/hair cortisol), maternal vaginal and intestinal microbiota, and by possibly affecting maternal mood and microbiota, maternal bonding to offspring, infant microbiota and infant crying.Results of this pilot trial will help determine whether or not to proceed with a full trial after the pilot trial, and if so, whether revisions should be made to the study protocol and procedures before conducting a full randomized controlled trial. Additionally, they are expected to provide insights into whether changes in psychological, behavioral and biological parameters can be attributed to the probiotic intervention.Netherlands Trial Register, NTR6219 .

Nowadays, in addition to phototherapy, other auxiliary methods are used to reduce jaundice and the length of hospitalization. This study aimed to investigate the effect of  on the treatment of hyper-bilirubinemia in full-term neonates.In this randomized clinical trial, 83 full-term neonates, who were admitted to the hospital to receive phototherapy in the first 6 months of 2015, were randomly divided into two groups: synbiotic (SG, n=40) and control (CG, n=43). Both groups received phototherapy but the SG also received  drops/day of synbiotics. Serum bilirubin, urine, stool, feeding frequency, and weight were measured daily until hospital discharge. A -value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.The mean total serum bilirubin in the SG was lower than that in the CG (9.38±2.37 and 11.17±2.60 mg/dL, respectively). The urine and stool frequency in the SG was significantly higher than that in the CG (<0.05). The duration of hospitalization in the SG was shorter than that in the CG.Use of synbiotics as an adjuvant therapy had a significant treatment effect on jaundice in full-term neonates. Further studies including larger samples with long follow-up periods are essential to confirm the benefits of routine use of synbiotics in neonatal patients with jaundice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198939>Effects of a combination of xylanase, amylase and protease, and  on major nutrients including amino acids and non-starch polysaccharides utilization in broilers fed different level of fibers.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effects of a combination of xylanase, amylase, and protease (XAP), with  (3 Bacillus spp.) supplementation on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients in Cobb 500 broilers from 0 to 21 d. A completely randomized 2 × 4 factorial design (2 levels of fiber; 4 types of supplements) with 8 replicate cages (6 birds/cage) was used. Each low and high-fiber diet contained 500 FTU/kg Buttiauxella sp. phytase and was supplemented with: (a) none (control), (b) XAP (2,000 U xylanase + 200 U amylase + 4,000 U protease/kg diet), (c)  (75,000 CFU/g of Bacillus spp.), or (d) XAP + . High fiber decreased (P < 0.05) nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn), AID of all amino acids (AA), AID and ATTD of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), starch, and gross energy (GE). High fiber increased (P < 0.01) the flow of total non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in both ileum and total tract. The XAP +  increased (P < 0.01) AMEn as well as AID and ATTD of DM, CP, GE, starch, while alone, XAP yielded similar improvement except for DM compared with control. The supplemental XAP alone improved (P < 0.01) the digestibility of most of the AAs compared with control. Moreover, XAP +  increased (P < 0.05) AID of all AA except arginine and serine compared with control. A fiber × supplements interaction (P < 0.05) was found for AID of histidine and threonine, and their digestibility in high-fiber diet was improved to a level comparable to low-fiber diet by XAP + . The flow of NSP in XAP group was  to 6% lower than in control while NSP flow in XAP + probiotic group was further 4% lower than that of XAP group (P < 0.01). The results infer that the combination of XAP and  can effectively optimize the nutrient digestibility in broilers fed both low and high-fiber diets.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204202>Cryopreservation of the human gut microbiota: Current state and perspectives.</a></h1><p>The human intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem that consists of thousands of bacterial species that are responsible for human health and disease. The intestinal microbiota is a natural resource for production of therapeutic and preventive medicals, such as  and fecal transplants. Modern lifestyles have resulted in the extinction of evolutionally selected microbial populations upon exposure to environmental factors. Therefore, it is very important to preserve the human gut microbiota to have the opportunity for timely restoration with minimal safety risks. Cryopreservation techniques that are suitable for the preservation of viable, mixed microbial communities and a biobanking approach are currently under development in different countries. However, the number of studies in this area is very limited. The variety of morphological and physiological characteristics of microbes in the microbiota, the different cryopreservation goals, and the criteria for the evaluation of cryopreservation effectiveness are the main challenges in the creation of a universal and standardized cryopreservation protocol. In this review, we summarized the current progress of the main cryopreservation techniques for gut microbiota communities and the methods for the assessment of the effectiveness of these techniques in the context of practical application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager , we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, , purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except -ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, -ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and -ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122042> Zhengchangsheng® attenuates DSS-induced colitis and modulates the gut microbiota in mice.</a></h1><p>Human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and experimental colitis models in mice are associated with shifts in gut microbiota composition, and several  are widely used to improve gastrointestinal health. Here, we investigated whether the probiotic  Zhengchangsheng (BL) ameliorates dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis through alteration of the gut microbiota. Experimental colitis was induced in BALB/C mice by dissolving 3% DSS in their drinking water for 7 days, which were gavaged with 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline or BL (3×10 cfu/ml) once a day. Administration of BL attenuated several effects of DSS-induced colitis, including weight loss, increased disease activity index, and disrupted intestinal barrier integrity. In addition, BL mitigated the reduction in faecal microbiota richness in DSS treated mice. Interestingly, BL was found to reduce the elevated circulating endotoxin level in mice with colitis by modulating the microbial composition of the microbiota, and this was highly associated with a proportional decrease in gut . Our results demonstrate that BL can attenuate DSS-induced colitis and provide valuable insight into microbiota interactions during IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572482>Effect of  N1115 and fructooligosaccharides in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern worldwide. Administration of  and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal barrier functions and histologic integrity. This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the tight junction components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Our data support the translation of these agents into clinical evaluation in human subjects with NAFLD and/or associated risk factors.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia & Banach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535332>Oral  and the female urinary microbiome: a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial.</a></h1><p> may reduce risk of urinary tract infection by preventing colonization of uropathogens.

Analysis included t test of the ratios and separate generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM) for microbiota diversity.481 samples of seven female participants with mean age 29.1 years (± .3 years) were included in the analysis (probiotic n = 4; placebo n = 3). No adverse events were reported. The placebo and probiotic groups had similar mean U/L ratios with no difference between placebo and probiotic groups in Phases 1-3 (p = 0.90, p = 0.58 and p = 0.72, respectively).

We cultured and identified primary bovine vaginal epithelial cells treated with SQ0048 to investigate the pathways involved in host cell responses using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Transcription profiling showed 296 significantly altered differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 170 were upregulated and 126 downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed significant enrichment of 424 GO terms throughout the differentiation process (0.05). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEGs were successfully annotated as members of 171 pathways, with 23 significantly enriched KEGG pathways (0.05). A relatively high number of genes were enriched for the endoplasmic reticulum protein processing and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathways and for antigen processing and presentation. DEGs were verified by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) and determination of which were most enriched for endoplasmic reticulum protein processing pathways, the activation of which might be a major factor underlying  adhesion to cells and pathogenic inhibition. Bovine bacterial vaginitis causes infertility, abortion, and postpartum uterine diseases, causing serious economic loss to the dairy industry. The large-scale use of antibiotics destroys normal genital tract flora and hinders the defense mechanisms of the host. Recent research suggests that lactobacilli present in the vaginal microflora of healthy cows constitute the primary microbiological barrier to infection by genital pathogens, exerting a protective role on the reproductive tract via specific adherence to the epithelium and the production of inhibitory substances. Our research identified the mechanisms for  adhesion and pathogenic inhibition, providing valuable information for the development of new  and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of infections in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 Niu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424003>Antimicrobial activity of  against endodontic pathogens:- A preliminary study.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effectiveness of  lactobacilli group and Bifidobacterium against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans in both planktonic stage and biofilm stage.Phase 1 of the study was conducted by agar well diffusion method.

Additionally, the risk factors associated with the deterioration of NEC were further analyzed with a case-control study.A total of 231 infants met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-one pairs were matched according to similar gestational age and birth weight. Before matching, we found that the rate of deterioration of NEC from stage I to II/III in the group with probiotic treatment was similar to that in the group without probiotic treatment (23.1% [25/108] vs 26.0% [32/123], P = 0.614). After matching, the rate of deterioration of NEC between the two groups still had no significant difference (21.0% [17/81] vs 27.2% [22/81], P = 0.358). Logistic regression analysis showed that sepsis after NEC was an independent risk factor for NEC deteriorating from stage I to II/III (OR 2.378, 95% CI 1.005-.628, P = 0.049). may not prevent the deterioration of NEC from stage I to II/III in infants, but this conclusion should be treated with caution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120680>GROWTH, HUSBANDRY, AND DIETS OF FIVE SUCCESSFULLY HAND-REARED ORPHANED GIRAFFE CALVES ( AND ).</a></h1><p>Giraffe in the wild are in ongoing decline because of poaching and habitat loss and fragmentation, and were recently assessed as "vulnerable" on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Threatened Species. Captive breeding and saving each individual are therefore becoming more important to save this species from extinction. This paper describes the husbandry and diets of successfully hand-reared Rothschild's giraffes (;  = 3) and reticulated giraffes (;  = 2). All calves were initially fed with bovine colostrum followed by cow's milk (Holstein milk; Holstein milk with 10% of bovine colostrum; Jersey and Guernsey milk). Additionally, lactase enzymes (Lactaidt, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Guelp, Ontario N1K1A5, Canada) and  (Probiost, Vets Plus, Inc., Menomonie, WI 54751, USA) were used. Average growth varied from 764 to 1,239 g/day from birth until 2 mo of age and between 508 and 1,161 g/day from birth until last measurement before weaning. Hand-reared calves gained up to 21 cm in height within the first month and 82-138% of their birth weight during the first 2 mo. The giraffes were weaned at 6 ( = 1), 8 ( = 3), and 11. ( = 1) mo and successfully socialized and introduced to other giraffes. The described diets and husbandry proved to be effective in all five calves. Large amounts of cow's milk per feeding (up to 6 L) did not result in gastrointestinal problems.© 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587409>Transplant associated infections-The role of the gastrointestinal microbiota and potential therapeutic options.</a></h1><p>Infectious complications are common following kidney transplantation and rank in the top five causes of death in patients with allograft function. Over the last  years, there has been emerging evidence that changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota following kidney transplantation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of transplant-associated infections.

An online survey was performed to investigate the management of AGE followed by members of The Korean Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, and the results were compared between pediatric gastroenterologists (PG) and general pediatricians (GP).Questionnaires were sent to pediatricians between June 2 and 4, 2018 regarding the type of hospital, indications for admission, antiemetic and antidiarrheal drugs and antibiotics prescribed, and dietary changes advised.Among the 400 pediatricians approached, 141 pediatricians (35.3%) responded to the survey. PG comprised 39% of the respondents and 72.7% worked at a tertiary hospital. Both PG and GP considered diarrhea or vomiting to be the primary symptom. The most common indication for hospitalization was severe dehydration (98.8%). Most pediatricians managed dehydration with intravenous fluid infusions (PG 98.2%, GP 92.9%). Antiemetics were prescribed by 87.3% of PG and 96.6% of GP.  to manage diarrhea were prescribed by 89.1% of PG and 100.0% of GP. Antibiotics were used in children with blood in diarrheal stool or high fever. Dietary changes were more commonly recommended by GP (59.3%) than by PG (27.3%) (<0.05). Tests to identify etiological agents were performed primarily in hospitalized children.This survey assessing the management of pediatric AGE showed that the indications for admission and rehydration were similar between GP and PG.

C57BL/6J mice were administered with 2.% dextran sulfate sodium for  consecutive days to develop the acute colitis model except for the blank control group. Meantime,Mice were treated with drinking water (DSS model group),VSL#3 (1.×10(9) CFU),or (×10(7) CFU) by gavage for 7 days respectively,and mice were sacrificed 2 days after the model of colitis was established. The fecal specimens before gavage (day 0),in the middle of experiment (day 4),and the end of gavage (day 7) and the intestinal mucosa after sacrifice were collected to analyze the differences between these four groups by 16s rDNA sequencing method.  Compared with the DSS model group, VSL#3 group showed a decrease in disease activity index (DAI) and histological scores, and there was no significant change in the  group. Fecal microbiota:in the middle of experiment,the alpha diversity of DSS model group,VSL#3 group and  group were lower than that of the blank control group(0.0135,0.0018,0.0151). After the end of gavage,the diversity of the VSL#3 group was lower than that of the blank control group(0.025), and the difference between any other two groups was not statistically significant. Mucosa-adherent microbiota:biodiversity of DSS model group, group were lower than the blank control group(0.031,0.0437),while biodiversity of VSL#3 group was higher than DSS model group and  group(0.0394, 0.0426). Compared with the blank control group, the DSS model group showed an increase in Bacteroides and a decrease in Lactobacillus. Abundance in the genus Turicibacter and Odoribacter increased in intestinal microbiota of mice with acute colitis, while VSL#3 inhibited them.  VSL#3 alleviates inflammation in DSS-induced colitis of mice.Both VSL#3 and  can affect intestinal microbiota. Compared with healthy mice,mice with colitis showed a reduced diversity of microbiota both in feces and in intestinal mucosa. VSL#3 increases biodiversity of mucosal microbiota in mice with acute colitis,while it does not increase biodiversity of fecal microbiota. Genera such as Turicibacter and Odoribacter increase in mice with acute colitis, and these genera can be inhibited by VSL#3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465314>Ocular allergy: update on clinical trials.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this article is to provide an update on the advances made through recent clinical trials regarding the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and its associated conditions.Recent studies have demonstrated significant advancement in the various forms of immunotherapy treatments.

Its whole genome was sequenced and analysed for its evolutionary relationship with other lactic acid bacteria (LAB). This is a novel sequence and first report of genome sequence of P. acidilactici of dairy origin. Its genome is relatively larger than other studied genomes of P. acidilactici and is comprised of 40 scaffolds that totals to 3,243,337 bases and 44.% GC content. A total of 3054 coding sequences (CDS) were identified by RAST and DIAMOND servers. The genome also encoded different enzyme activities required for utilization of various carbohydrates. This was also confirmed by carbohydrate utilization studies. The genome also encoded genes for  properties. The phylogenetic analysis of P. acidilactici NCDC 252 genome was done using Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood methods to study its evolution and relatedness to other LABs based upon their 16S rDNA sequences. The strain exhibited highest resemblance to Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 and is also much close to P. acidilactici based on similarity of ribosomal protein.

The possible health effects of  include modulating the immune system and exerting antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-mutagenic effects. The purpose of this study was to isolate, identify, and characterize novel strains of  from the faeces of Korean infants. Various assays were conducted to determine the physiological features of candidate probiotic isolates, including Gram staining, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, tolerance assays to stimulated gastric juice and bile salts, adherence ability assays, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and assays of immunomodulatory effects. Based on these morphological and biochemical characteristics, five potential probiotic isolates (Enterococcus faecalis BioE EF71, Lactobacillus fermentum BioE LF11, Lactobacillus plantarum BioE LPL59, Lactobacillus paracasei BioE LP08, and Streptococcus thermophilus BioE ST107) were selected. E. faecalis BioE EF71 and L. plantarum BioE LPL59 showed high tolerance to stimulated gastric juice and bile salts, and S. thermophilus BioE ST107 as well as these two strains exhibited stronger adherence ability than reference strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. All five strains inhibited secretion of lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro. L. fermentum BioE LF11, L. plantarum BioE LPL59, and S. thermophilus BioE ST107 enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

Different stressors, including food process parameters and storage, can affect their viability and functionality.The resistance to frozen storage, tolerance to lyophilization and viability during storage, thermal, acidic and simulated gastric resistance, surface hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activity against pathogens were studied. Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and INL1 were used as reference strains. The results obtained demonstrated that the new isolates presented strain-dependent behaviour. Good results were obtained for thermal resistance, frozen storage at -80°C and lyophilized powders maintained at °C. Cell viability during refrigerated storage was higher when the strains were resuspended in milk at pH ·0 than at 4·. The surface hydrophobicity ranged between 7 and 98% depending on the strain. The simulated gastric resistance was improved for the strains incorporated in cheese. Regarding antimicrobial activity, bifidobacteria isolated from monkey presented higher inhibitory capacity than the reference strains.This research provides a deeper insight into new strains of bifidobacteria isolated from primates and chicken that have not been previously characterized for their potential use in dairy products and confirm the most robust stress tolerance of B. lactis.The possibility of expanding the available bifidobacteria with the potential to be added to a probiotic food necessarily implies characterizing them from different points of view, especially when considering unknown species. For monkey isolates (which showed higher antimicrobial activity against pathogens), more in-depth knowledge is needed before applying strategies to improve their performance. On the contrary, the chicken isolate B. lactis P32/1 showed similar behaviour to the references B. lactis strains; therefore, it could be considered as a potential probiotic candidate.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31403136>Broncho-vaxom alleviates persistent allergic rhinitis in patients by improving Th1/Th2 cytokine balance of nasal mucosa.</a></h1><p> are mainly distributed in the mucosal system and have the ability to enhance mucosal barrier function and regulate immune responses. Broncho-Vaxom (BV), as a probiotic, has been applied to patients suffering from respiratory tract infections, but its potential effectiveness in allergic rhinitis (AR) has not been evaluated in human. This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of BV in patients with persistent AR and to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms.Sixty patients with AR were enrolled to this study and were randomly assigned to the BV group (n=30) and the placebo group (n=30). Changes of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of allergic inflammation were measured at baseline visit, immediately after BV treatment, four weeks, and eight weeks after the BV treatment.After BV treatment, medication score in the BV group was significantly decreased compared with placebo group, along with a significant drop of the total nasal symptom score and the individual nasal symptom scores (itching score: 23.72±.32%; nasal rhinorrhea score: 18.59±4.83%; sneezing score: 23.08±4.98%). The levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in nasal lavage were diminished remarkably while the level of INF-γ was markedly increased in the BV group. This rendered a significant reduction of the ratio of IL-4/INF-γ. Moreover, a decrease of eosinophils in nasal smear was observed after BV treatment. The BV-induced favorable changes sustained for at least four to eight weeks post BV treatment.Oral administration of BV offers remarkable and sustained efficacy in alleviating AR symptoms and may be considered as an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients with persistent AR.

The Rome IV guidelines were published in 2016 and together with the growing body of Asian data on IBS, we felt it is timely to update the Asian IBS Consensus.Key opinion leaders from Asian countries were organized into 4 teams to review 4 themes: symptoms and epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and investigations, and lifestyle modifications and treatments. The consensus development process was carried out by using a modified Delphi method.Thirty-seven statements were developed. Asian data substantiate the current global viewpoint that IBS is a disorder of gut-brain interaction. Socio-cultural and environmental factors in Asia appear to influence the greater overlap between IBS and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. New classes of treatments comprising low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosacharides, and polyols diet, , non-absorbable antibiotics, and secretagogues have good evidence base for their efficacy.Our consensus is that all patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders should be evaluated comprehensively with a view to holistic management.

However, freeze-drying and subsequent storage are accompanied by a decline in cell viability. Whey protein (WP) or polymerized whey protein (PWP) was used to protect  LA- against damage during freeze-drying process and the subsequent storage. The protection capacity and effects of polymerized whey protein protected freeze-dried  LA- on physiochemical properties of cow and goat milk yoghurts were evaluated in comparison with maltodextrin (MD). The survival rate of  LA- after freeze-drying decreased in the order of MD (80.91%) > PWP (69.86%) > WP (64.89%). The particles of WP- and PWP-based freeze-dried samples showed an average diameter of about 10 μm, which was significantly higher than that of MD-based particles (1. μm). Both whey protein preparations showed higher protecting effect than MD at high humidity condition during the 180-day storage. Addition of freeze-dried  LA- with the presence of WP or PWP improved the protein content and decreased spontaneous whey separation and syneresis significantly for both yoghurts. PWP-protected  LA- addition significantly improved the firmness and adhesiveness of the yoghurt. Freeze-dried  LA- mixed with PWP had higher survivability in yoghurts compared with the culture alone at the end of storage. Data indicated that whey protein can be used to protect  during freeze-drying and may also improve the physiochemical properties of the yoghurt.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428172>Study on the Antihypertensive Mechanism of  and  Based on Intestinal Flora-Host Metabolism.</a></h1><p>Our previous studies have shown that the combination of  and  (HD) had a good antihypertensive effect, but its potential mechanism remained unclear.

HD also changed the serum metabolic pattern of SHRs. 16 potential biomarkers related to inflammation, vasodilation, steroid hormones, oxidative stress, and etc. changed significantly, mainly enriched in arachidonic acid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the dominant genius and species in three groups were highly correlated with steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and vitamin B6 metabolism. Our research indicated that HD had a good antihypertensive effect, which may be driven by the protective intestinal flora and beneficial metabolites induced by it, and the metabolites were closely related to the changes of intestinal flora.

Growth of bacteria in a liquid changes physicochemical property of the medium and its behavior at solid-liquid interface. Wettability determines characteristic of solid-liquid interface. Nano-rod, helical tetragonal and L-shaped morphologies were designed and fabricated. Hydrophobicity and zeta potential were measured for dried surfaces of  dairy bacterial strains. Relationship between microbial population and changes in solid-liquid interface was studied by wettability and surface free energy measurements. Due to hydrophobic surface property of conventional dairy strains, they strongly affect solid-liquid and liquid-vapor surface tensions when dispersed in a liquid, which are dependent on the bacterial concentration. Response surface methodology results showed that type and concentration of bacteria, droplet volume and solid-surface morphology affect wettability significantly. Higher hydrophobicity resulted in higher ∆θ (absolute value of the difference between the pure physiological saline and the bacterial suspension contact angles) dependence on the bacterial concentration. Probiotic bacteria concentration in fermented milk was estimated using the proposed method. A direct relationship was obtained between milk contact angle and bacterial concentration. Results show that this physical method can be applied for rapid estimation of bacterial concentration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The test diets were fed to fish at a daily rate of 3% of their live weights, three times per day. On the 50th day, fish were weighed and blood samples were collected to determine the main nonspecific humoral and cellular immune responses and digestive enzymes (protease, amylase, and lipase). Fish performance (weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and protein productive value) was also calculated. Growth rates and digestive enzyme activity were significantly increased (P < 0.05) with increasing dietary P. maritimus S up to 0.%, and leveled off with further increase in bacterial concentrations. Phagocytic activity, lysozyme activity, alternative complement hemolysis, and hematological parameters were also significantly increased (P < 0.05) with increasing P. maritimus S concentration to 0.%, followed by a slight decrease (P > 0.05) at 1% level.

We aimed to investigate the effects of  (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus), prebiotics and their combination on inflammation, and microflora in mice of acute colitis.C57BL/6J mice were divided into six groups randomly (blank control group, model control group,  group, synbiotics group, lactitol group and  + lactitol group). Each group was given 2.% dextran sulfate sodium drinking water for  days other than the blank control group. Except for the model control group, the other four groups were intervened with , synbiotics ( and inulin), lactitol, and  + lactitol. Mice were sacrificed after 1 week of gavage, and pathologic scores were calculated. The feces of different periods and intestinal mucosa samples were collected to analyze the differences of intestinal microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing. Differences of two groups or multiple groups were statistically examined through unpaired Student t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively. ANOVA, Tukey, Anosim, and metastats analysis were used to compare differences of microbiota among different groups.After gavage for 1 week, the pathologic scores of groups with the intervention were significantly lower than those in the model control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

The secretion of gastrointestinal hormones can be mediated by the elevation of intracellular Ca concentration, suggesting that these hormones may act through common mechanisms. We have previously shown that heat-killed  SBC8803 (hk-SBC8803) induced the secretion of serotonin and elevated intracellular Ca concentration in serotonin-producing RIN-14B cells, suggesting that hk-SBC8803 could potentially cause the same effect on other gastrointestinal hormones, including hunger hormone ghrelin. Here, we tested this hypothesis by treating cultured cells and experimental animals with hk-SBC8803 and assessing ghrelin secretion, expression of ghrelin-related genes, and food intake. The results indicated that hk-SBC8803 treatment for 30 min significantly upregulated the secretion of acyl ghrelin (active form) (=0.046) and mRNA expression of the  (synaptotagmin 3) gene related to ghrelin exocytosis (<0.05) in primary mouse stomach cells. In addition, oral administration of 500 mg/kg hk-SBC8803 to rats tended to upregulate acyl ghrelin concentration (=0.10) and significantly increased the ratio of acyl to des-acyl (inactive) ghrelin (=0.027) in blood, which corresponded to a tendency of stimulating food intake (=0.087) at 30 min post-treatment. However, when in order to minimise individual differences we normalised the data on food intake to those on one-day food intake prior to food deprivation, the resultant food intake ratio showed a significant increase (by % compared to control; =0.032) at 30 min after hk-SBC8803 treatment, indicating that hk-SBC8803 administration stimulated rats to take more food during the first meal after fasting. These results suggest that hk-SBC8803 induces short-term ghrelin secretion and transiently increases appetite, which is an important effect for individuals with low energy intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31441662>An overview on marine anti-allergic active substances for alleviating food-induced allergy.</a></h1><p>Food provides energy and various nutrients and is the most important substance for the survival of living beings. However, for allergic people, certain foods cause strong reactions, and sometimes even cause shock or death. Food allergy has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a major global food safety issue which affect the quality of life of nearly % of adults and 8% of children, and the incidence continues to rise but there is no effective cure. Drug alleviation methods for food allergies often have shortcomings such as side effects, poor safety, and high cost. At present, domestic and foreign scientists have turned to research and develop various new, safe and efficient natural sources of hypoallergenic or anti-allergic drugs or foods. There are many kinds of anti-allergic substances obtained from the plants and animals have been reported. Besides,  and bifidobacteria also have certain anti-allergic effects. Of all the sources of anti-allergic substances, the ocean is rich in effective active substances due to its remarkable biodiversity and extremely complex living environment, and plays a huge role in the field of anti-food allergy. In this paper, the anti-food allergic bioactive substances isolated from marine organisms encompassing marine microbial, plant, animal sources and their mechanism were reviewed and the possible targets of anti-allergic substances exerting effects are illustrated by drawing. In addition, the development prospects of marine anti-allergic market are discussed and forecasted, which can provide reference for future research on anti-allergic substances.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562911>Randomized Trial of Perioperative  Among Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Operation.</a></h1><p>We investigated the utility and safety of short-course oral  among patients undergoing major abdominal operations.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of 2 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum J26, against oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells, and gave an overview of the mechanisms of lactic acid bacteria antioxidant activity using digital gene expression profiling. The 2 LAB strains provided significant protection against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced reduction in superoxide dismutase activity and increase in glutathione peroxidase activity in Caco-2 cells. However, inactive bacteria had little effect on alleviating oxidation stress in Caco-2 cells. Eight genes related to oxidative stress-FOSB, TNF, PPP1R15A, NUAK2, ATF3, TNFAIP3, EGR2, and FBN2-were significantly upregulated in HO-induced Caco-2 cells compared with untreated Caco-2 cells. After incubation of the HO-induced Caco-2 cells with L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum J26,  genes (TNF, EGR2, NUAK2, FBN2, and TNFAIP3) and 2 genes (NUAK2 and FBN2) were downregulated, respectively. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes indicated that some signaling pathways associated with inflammation, immune response, and apoptosis, such as Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak-STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κB, and tumor necrosis factor, were all negatively modulated by the 2 strains, especially L. rhamnosus GG.

Salivary pH, plaque index, pH variation before and after a sugar rinse, quantification of Streptococcus mutans in saliva and demineralisation of the carious lesions were determined at the beginning and at the end of both milk ingestion periods.Regarding WP milk, a non-significant decrease in terms of the concentration of S. mutans and pH variation (p > 0.05), a significant decrease (i.e. acidification) in salivary pH (p < 0.01) and a remineralisation of 39.4% of the caries were found. On the other hand, for NP milk, a non-significant increase in terms of the concentration of S. mutans, pH variation, salivary pH (p > 0.05) and a remineralisation of 64.2% were found.Lactic acid  can contribute to the decrease in the number of cariogenic microorganisms.

Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05).  treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile, but an increase in acetate was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino acids metabolism such as urocanic acid, citrulline, cystamine and -oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers.

Compared with baseline, Foxp3 expression (0.45 ± 0.1 vs. 1.3 ± 0.4;  = 0.002) and interferon-gamma/interleukin-4 (IFN-γ/IL-4) ratios were increased post-treatment in volunteers receiving BB536 ( = 0.031), although differences between groups were not significant. For volunteers receiving combination BB536 and AHCC, there was an increase in myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) compared with plasmacytoid DC (pDC) counts (80% vs. 61%;  = 0.006) at post treatment time points. mDC2 phenotypes were more prevalent, compared with baseline, following combination treatment (0.16% vs. 0.05%;  = 0.002). Oral intake of AHCC and BB536 may modulate T regulatory and DC phenotypes to favour anti-inflammatory responses following antibiotic usage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198580>Impact of endurance exercise and probiotic supplementation on the intestinal microbiota: a cross-over pilot study.</a></h1><p>The human microbiota has a broad range of functions contributing to metabolic processes and the activities of our immune system. Its influence on health, well-being and chronic diseases are discussed in various studies. The intestinal microbiota and the mucosal integrity are influenced by diet, environment and other lifestyle factors, including physical activity. There are correlations between cardiorespiratory fitness and important markers of intestinal health. However, data linking endurance exercise to microbiota composition are sparse. Many endurance athletes take  to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms linked to exercise or immunosuppression, but the longitudinal data is insufficient.This randomised, controlled cross-over pilot study will examine the impact of specific endurance training and probiotic supplementation on the intestinal microbiota and mucosa in healthy, athletic students.The aim of this pilot study is to elucidate the impact of physical activity on the intestinal microbiota and mucosa with regard to the effects of a probiotic supplementation.In this pilot study, thirty non-specifically trained student athletes will participate in an intervention consisting of a two-week rest (baseline) period, a four-week exercise programme and a four-week probiotic intervention using SymbioLactComp®. The exercise programme consists of three 60-min running workouts per week at 70-85% of the peak heart rate (HRpeak). Primary endpoint of this pilot study is the feasibility and practicality of the intervention as well as a sample size estimation. Furthermore, anthropometric measurements and information on nutrition and lifestyle will be obtained. The peak oxygen uptake (VOpeak) and peak heart rate (HRpeak) (determined during a shuttle run test) as well as selected blood and saliva parameters (haemogram, cytokines) will be evaluated. Changes to the intestinal microbiota will be analysed by stool diagnostics (KyberKompaktPRO®, KyberPlus®). The potential changes may include microbiota composition, bacterial metabolites and mucosa- and immune markers.Results will be used for the design of a main randomised controlled trial with a larger collective based on feasibility, validity and sample size estimation as well as the potential effects of endurance exercise on intestinal microbiota and mucosa. Evidence-based information of an exercise-altered microbiota could be of importance for the prevention and therapy of intestinal or immune disorders.German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00011108.

Indeed, the development of a simple and fast SERS method dedicated to the quantification of bacteria should be very useful for the characterization of such formulations in a more convenient way than the usually performed tedious and time-consuming conventional counting method. For this purpose, uncoated near-spherical gold nanoparticles were developed at room temperature by acidic treatment of star-like gold nanoparticle precursors. In this study, we first investigated the influence of acidic treatment conditions on both the nanoparticle physicochemical properties and SERS efficiency using Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as "model" analyte. Results highlighted that an effective R6G Raman signal enhancement was obtained by promoting chemical effect through R6G-anion interactions and by obtaining a suitable aggregation state of the nanoparticles. Depending on the nanoparticle synthesis conditions, R6G SERS signals were up to 10-10-fold greater than those obtained with star-like gold nanoparticles. The synthesized spherical gold nanoparticles were then successfully applied for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). In that case, the signal enhancement was especially due to the combination of anion-induced chemical enhancement and nanoparticle aggregation on LGG cell wall consecutive to non-specific interactions. Both the simplicity and speed of the procedure, achieved under 30 min, including nanoparticle synthesis, sample preparation, and acquisition of SERS spectra, appeared as very relevant for the characterization of pharmaceutical formulations incorporating .

However, there is a paucity of literature on the safety profiles, mechanistic action, and therapeutic potential of topical probiotic products. Several regulatory gaps exist, including approval and classification of topical probiotic products by the FDA; currently there are no topical probiotic products the FDA has approved as drugs.With increasing popularity among the general public, but insufficient clinical data to demonstrate large-scale effectiveness and a thorough understanding of side effects, there is a need for further mechanistic and clinical investigation, as well as improved regulation and standardization of topical probiotic products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401369>Modulation of -fluorouracil activation of toll-like/MyD88/NF-κB/MAPK pathway by Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 probiotic.</a></h1><p>Chemotherapy drugs that act via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can exacerbate mucosal injury through the production of cytokines. Intestinal mucositis can activate TLR2 and TLR4, resulting in the activation of NF-κB. Intestinal mucositis characterized by intense inflammation is the main side effect associated with -fluorouracil (-FU) treatment. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 (S.b) is a probiotic yeast used in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of S.b treatment on the Toll-like/MyD88/NF-κB/MAPK pathway activated during intestinal mucositis and in Caco-2 cells treated with -FU.The mice were divided into three groups: saline (control), saline + -FU, and -FU + S.b (1.6 × 10 colony forming units/kg). After 3 days of S.b administration by gavage, the mice were euthanized and the jejunum and ileum were removed. In vitro, Caco2 cells were treated with -FU (1 mM) alone or in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (1 ng/ml). When indicated, cells were exposed to S.b. The jejunum/ileum samples and Caco2 cells were examined for the expression or concentration of the inflammatory components.Treatment with S.b modulated the expressions of TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, ERK1/2, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, TNF-α, IL-1β, and CXCL-1 in the jejunum/ileum and Caco2 cells following treatment with -FU.Toll-like/MyD88/NF-κB/MAPK pathway are activated during intestinal mucositis and their modulation by S.b suggests a novel and valuable therapeutic strategy for intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are a paucity of data on long-term durability and safety of FMT. The aim of this study is to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of FMT for RCDI. Ninety-four patients underwent FMT via retention enema for RCDI between 2008 and 2012 and completed a follow-up questionnaire 4 to 8 years following the last FMT. Of these, 32 were unreachable and 37 were deceased; 23 of the remaining 25 participants completed the survey. No CDI recurrences were reported in patients treated with FMT; 12 of the 23 participants (52.2%) received at least one course of non-CDI antibiotic(s). Nine participants (40.9%) received  and 4 (17.4%) received both non-CDI antibiotics and . All 23 participants rated their overall health compared with pre-FMT. Current health was considered "much better" in 17 patients (73.9%); "somewhat better" in 3 patients (13.0%); and "about the same" in 3 patients (13.0%). A total of 11 participants (47.8%) reported an increase in weight of more than  kg (kg) post-FMT and 9 participants (39.1%) reported no change in weight (±  kg).

Probiotic strains used are Bifidobacterium BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-, Lactobacillus delbrueckii LBY-27, Lactobacillus paracasei LC-01, and Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31. Thirty rats randomly assigned to five groups were used in the experiment. Groups A to C received 1 × 10 CFU,  × 10 CFU, and 10 × 10 CFU of the multi-strain  daily and respectively from day 0 post-supplementation (PS) to termination. Group D and E were the infected and uninfected controls respectively. On day seven PS, groups A to D were challenged intraperitoneally with approximately 1 × 10 trypanosomes. Parasitemia, nitric oxide level, hematobiochemical parameters, and antibody titer to heterologous antigen stimulation were monitored post-infection. By days 7 and 16 PS, -treated groups had significantly lower (p < 0.05) mean creatinine concentration than the controls; however, on day 7 PS, there were no significant variations in the leukocyte counts (LC), total erythrocyte counts (TEC), and the packed cell volume (PCV) in all experimental groups.

More and more basic studies have indicated that gut microbiota can regulate brain function through the gut-brain axis, and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota was related to anxiety. However, there is no specific evidence to support treatment of anxiety by regulating intestinal microbiota.To find evidence supporting improvement of anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota.This systematic review of randomised controlled trials was searched based on the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, OVID, Web of Knowledge, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP databases and SinoMed. The retrieval time dated back to 25 July 2018. Then we screened research literatures based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality evaluation for each included study was done using the Cochrane risk of bias and the Jadad scale.A total of 3334 articles were retrieved and 21 studies were included which contained 1503 subjects. In the 21 studies, 15 chose  as interventions to regulate intestinal microbiota and six chose non-probiotic ways such as adjusting daily diets. Probiotic supplements in seven studies contained only one kind of probiotic, two studies used a product that contained two kinds of  and the supplements used in the other five studies included at least three kinds of . In the studies that used treatment as usual plus interventions regulating intestinal flora (IRIF) as interventions (five studies), only non-probiotic ways were effective (two studies), which means 40% of studies were effective; in the studies that used IRIF alone (16 studies, 11 studies used probiotic ways and  studies used non-probiotic ways), 56% of studies could improve anxiety symptoms, and 80% of studies that conducted the non-probiotic interventions were effective, while 45% of studies that used probiotic supplementations had positive effects on anxiety symptoms. Overall, 11 studies showed a positive effect on anxiety symptoms by regulating intestinal microbiota, which indicated 52% of the 21 studies were effective, and there were five studies that used probiotic supplements as interventions and six used non-probiotic interventions. In addition, it should be noted that six of seven studies showed that regulation of intestinal microbiota could treat anxiety symptoms, the rate of efficacy was 86%.We find that more than half of the studies included showed it was positive to treat anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota. There are two kinds of interventions (probiotic and non-probiotic interventions) to regulate intestinal microbiota, and it should be highlighted that the non-probiotic interventions were more effective than the probiotic interventions.

GG, which is a representative commercial probiotic, was used as a comparative sample. Regarding probiotic properties,  KCCM 12203P was resistant to 0.3% pepsin with a pH of 2. for 3 h and 0.3% oxgall solution for 24 h, having approximately a 99% survival rate. It also showed strong adhesion activity (6.84%) onto HT-29 cells and did not produce β-glucuronidase but produced high quantities of leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, β-galactosidase, and -acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. For antioxidant activity, it appeared that viable cells had higher radical scavenging activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, while in the 2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, heat-killed cells had higher antioxidant activity. Additionally,  KCCM 12203P showed higher lipid oxidation inhibition ability than  GG; however, there was no significant difference ( < 0.05) between heat-killed cells and control cells. Furthermore, heat-killed  KCCM 12203P activated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells without cytotoxicity at a concentration lower than 10 CFU/ml and promoted higher gene expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 than  GG.

This work evaluated the effect of a carrageenan encapsulated probiotic, Lactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C strain, against the pathogenic H. pylori SS1 strain under simulated gastric conditions (fasting or standard diet, pH 3.0 under microaerophilic condition and agitation). Samples were obtained from simulators up to 2. h after adding the probiotic, either planktonic or carrageenan encapsulated, and H. pylori were counted using enriched Columbia agar. Gastric simulations under fasting or standard diet showed collaboration between L. fermentum and carrageenan against the pathogen, it is undetectable at 1. or 2. h, respectively, allowing to conclude that the administration of the probiotic under fasting (harsher acid environment) provides a better anti-H. pylori effect that administering it associated with the diet.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group). The growth of infants in the three groups was consistent with standards. No significant differences were observed in the main outcome, weight-gain (Control group: .77 Kg ± 0.95, Lf group: .77 Kg ± 1.31, Bb group: .58 Kg ± 1.10; p = 0.527). The three milk formulae were well tolerated, and no adverse effects were related to the consumption of any of the formula. Infants receiving B. breve CECT7263 had a 1.7 times lower risk of crying than the control group (OR = 0.569, CI 95% 0.568-0.571; p = 0.001). On the other hand, the incidence of diarrhoea in infants receiving the formula supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 was a 44% lower than in infants receiving the control formula (p = 0.014).

As a result, conventional dietary guidelines have focused on individual nutrients to maintain health and prevent disease. For dairy foods, this has led to general dietary recommendations to consume 2-3 daily servings of reduced-fat dairy foods, without regard to type (e.g., yogurt, cheese, milk), largely based on theorized benefits of isolated nutrients for bone health (e.g., calcium, vitamin D) and theorized harms of isolated nutrients for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and obesity (e.g., total fat, saturated fat, total calories). However, advances in nutrition science have demonstrated that foods represent complex matrices of nutrients, minerals, bioactives, food structures, and other factors (e.g., phoshopholipids, prebiotics, ) with correspondingly complex effects on health and disease. The present evidence suggests that whole-fat dairy foods do not cause weight gain, that overall dairy consumption increases lean body mass and reduces body fat, that yogurt consumption and  reduce weight gain, that fermented dairy consumption including cheese is linked to lower CVD risk, and that yogurt, cheese, and even dairy fat may protect against type 2 diabetes. Based on the current science, dairy consumption is part of a healthy diet, without strong evidence to favor reduced-fat products; while intakes of probiotic-containing unsweetened and fermented dairy products such as yogurt and cheese appear especially beneficial.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658700>Physicochemical and Microbiological Properties of Synbiotic Yogurt Made with Probiotic Yeast  in Combination with Inulin.</a></h1><p> is a unique species of yeast previously characterized as a probiotic strain (CNCM I-745) among a few probiotic yeasts reported to date.

Microrheological, microstructural, microbiological, sensory properties, and volatile compounds of the yogurt samples were evaluated. Microrheological analysis showed that addition of inulin to yogurt slightly reduced the values of G' and G″, while solid-liquid balance (SLB) values confirmed more solid properties of the synbiotic yogurt (0.582~0.595) than the plain yogurt (0.503~0.518). A total of 18 volatile compounds were identified in the synbiotic yogurt, while only five and six compounds were identified in plain and probiotic yogurts, respectively. Physiochemical parameters such as pH, acidity, and protein content were in the normal range (as with the control), while fat content in the synbiotic yogurt decreased significantly. Addition of 1% inulin not only reduced syneresis but also maintained viability of  after 28 days of storage.

In conclusion, in zebrafish, prolonged ingestion of a mixture of  CECT8361 and  CECT7347 has positive effects on growth, sperm quality, and progeny survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454425>Probiotic survival during a multi-layered tablet development as tested in a dynamic, computer-controlled in vitro model of the stomach and small intestine (TIM-1).</a></h1><p>The aim of the research was to develop a galenical formulation for the combination of the three probiotic strains Lactobacillus gasseri PA 16/8, Bifidobacterium longum SP 07/3 and Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/ that would lead to the presence of a high amount of viable cells in the small intestine, the presumed site of action of these strains. This was tested in a validated, dynamic in vitro model of the stomach and small intestine (TIM-1), simulating human adults after intake of a meal. Experiments were performed both in the gastric compartment of the model, as well as in the complete system (stomach + small intestine). Survival of the strains in an unformulated probiotic powder after transit through the gastric compartment was ·3% for the bifidobacteria and 1% for L. gasseri. After transit through the complete gastrointestinal tract, this dropped to 2% for bifidobacteria and 0·1% for Lactobacillus. After several rounds of optimization, an enteric-coated tablet was developed that increased the delivery of viable cells reaching the small intestine to 72% (gastric survival) for bifidobacteria, and 53% (gastric) for L. gasseri. Also survival in the small intestine increased by about an order of magnitude. The final galenical formulation was tested in two applications: adults and elderly, both of which have their own physiological parameters. These experiments corroborated the results obtained in the development phase of the project. In conclusion, the developed enteric coating led to a 20- to 40-fold increase in the delivery of viable cells to the small intestine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Predictive GI in vitro models are very helpful and reliable tools for the development of new galenical formula containing , and in the current example helped to deliver >10-fold higher numbers of viable cells to the small intestine, presumably leading to improved functionality of the strains.© 2019 The Authors.

For this purpose,  (TC48) and  (TC50) were isolated from fermented triticale silage. The fermentation ability of these isolates in triticale powder was studied by an ensiling method. TC48 had higher ability to ferment silage powder by increasing the lactic acid content of silage than TC50. Extracellular supernatant (ECS) of TC48 and TC50 exhibited strong antibacterial effects (inhibition zone diameters: 18-28 mm) against tested cattle pathogenic bacteria with minimum inhibitory/ minimum bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC) values of .0-10 mg/mL and 10-20 mg/mL, respectively. Extracellular supernatant (ECS) of TC48 and TC50 showed antibacterial activities on , ,  and  through destruction of membrane integrity as confirmed by decreased viability, and increased 260 nm absorbing material in culture filtrate of pathogenic bacteria exposed to ECS of both strains. TC48 and TC50 strains exhibited high tolerance to artificial gastric, duodenal and intestinal fluids. TC48 showed good hydrophobicity and auto-aggregations properties. TC48 and TC50 significantly co-aggregated with , ,  and  in a time-dependent manner. In summary, all of the bacteria had a positive impact on at least one functional property of the silage during the fermentation process. However, the addition of  (TC48) and  (TC50) yielded the greatest silage quality improvement, having high antibacterial and probiotic properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289543>Effects of preoperative oral administration of glucose solution combined with postoperative  on inflammation and intestinal barrier function in patients after colorectal cancer surgery.</a></h1><p>The effects of preoperative oral administration of glucose solution combined with postoperative  on inflammation and intestinal barrier function in patients after colorectal cancer surgery were observed. Sixty patients treated and scheduled to undergo radical resection of colorectal cancer in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from March 2017 to December 2017 were selected and randomly divided into the glucose solution group (n=30) and combined  group (n=30). Patients in both groups took orally 12.% glucose solution before surgery, and those in the combined  group received bifidus-triple viable preparation every day for 7 consecutive days. Changes in endotoxin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentration, white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-lactic acid and urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) were detected before surgery and at 1, 3 and 7 days after surgery. The general condition was observed and changes in intestinal florae were compared between the two groups. The body temperature was measured every 4 h with an electronic thermometer, and the duration of fever was recorded (from the first day after operation to the time with normal body temperature after operation, axillary temperature <37.4°C), and the average heart rate was recorded by the ECG monitor. In addition, the time of the first anal exsufflation (the time from the beginning of the operation to the first anal exsufflation) was recorded. In the combined  group, the plasma endotoxin, IGF-I concentration, D-lactic acid and urinary L/M levels were significantly lower than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Moreover, the duration of postoperative fever, average heart rate at 7 days after surgery as well as WBC and CRP clinical indexes were obviously shorter and lower in the combined  group than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Therefore, the combined application of  after surgery can effectively improve the imbalance of intestinal flora. In conclusion, preoperative oral administration of glucose solution combined with postoperative  can improve the intestinal barrier function after colorectal cancer surgery, and benefit the recovery of early inflammatory response after surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383293>Probiotic use in clinical practice: Results of a national survey of gastroenterologists and nutritionists.</a></h1><p> are effective in gastrointestinal disease management.

Low-dose antibiotics have historically been used to modulate food production animals and their microbiome. Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing microbiome. Over 13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or without two different  (8 cage units,  = 80 per group). Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We found that development of the early-life microbiome of turkey poults was tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in overall microbiome composition during development compared to controls. Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches may also be beneficial for humans. Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their microbiota, similar to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial turkey gut microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches. This work suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development hold promise for modulating the avian host and its microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Ward et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293721>Efficacy of long-term rifaximin treatment for hepatic encephalopathy in the Japanese.</a></h1><p>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of liver cirrhosis and can result in neuropsychological and neuromuscular dysfunctions in patients. Rifaximin, an antibiotic, has been reported to decrease the occurrence of overt HE and also improve cognitive function in studies from Europe and the United States of America. There is not enough evidence of the relationship between the long-term use of rifaximin and its clinical effects in the Japanese.To determine the clinical effects of long-term rifaximin therapy in decompensated liver cirrhosis patients, with overt HE or hyperammonemia.In this single-center retrospective observational cohort study, we reviewed the data of 38 patients who had taken rifaximin at the dose of 1200 mg/d for more than 24 wk. The primary outcome measured was the efficacy of long-term rifaximin use, and secondary outcome measured was the safety of its long-term use as determined by its influence on portosystemic shunts as well as -related infections. Moreover, we compared the prognosis between the rifaximin group and control cases, matched for hepatic elasticity assessed by magnetic resonance ela-stography, age, and Child-Pugh classification.Of the 38 patients included in the study, 12 (31.6%) had overt HE, 27 (71.1%) had complications of esophageal varices, and 9 (23.7%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The control group was matched for age, Child-Pugh classification, liver stiffness, and presence of HCC. The median of serum ammonia level before treatment was 104 μg/dL (59-297), and 2 wk after treatment, it significantly decreased to 85 μg/dL (34-153) ( = 0.002). A significantly low value of 80. μg/dL (44-150) was maintained 24 wk after treatment. The long-term use of rifaximin did not cause a decline in liver function. Diarrhea occurred in 2 patients, who improved with the administration of , and there were no cases of aborted rifaximin therapy owing to adverse events. In patients with Child C, the survival was short, but there was no significant difference compared with that of the control group.Rifaximin therapy improves overt HE.

Gallstones can be pigmentary, cholesterol (75%) or mixed. Age, female sex, obesity, rapid weight loss, consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, iron deficiency, vitamin D and low intake of fiber and vitamin C are factors associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis. On the other hand, the intake of ω-3 fatty acids, oleic acid, calcium, magnesium, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, coffee, moderate consumption of alcohol, vitamin C supplements, physical exercise and a regular diet have a protective paper. The most frequent kidney stones are calcium oxalate followed by mixed ones (oxalate and calcium phosphate), struvite, uric acid and cystine. A high water intake is recommended (> 2. l / day), varying the type of recommended or unadvisable food depending on the type of calculus. In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading  (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (liver, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary. The nutritional intervention is an effective measure in the prevention of biliary and renal lithiasis and prevent its recurrence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201450>Survival of probiotic bacteria in the presence of food grade nanoparticles from chocolates: an in vitro and in vivo study.</a></h1><p>The use of  to treat gastrointestinal diseases such as diarrhea especially in children is becoming increasingly popular. Besides, the use of nanomaterials in food products is increasing rapidly especially in candies and chocolates. How these nanomaterials influence probiotic bacteria and their activity remains unexplored. Therefore, nanomaterials from commercial chocolate were purified and characterized by using SEM-EDS and XRD. The tested chocolate contained nano-TiO with an average size of ~ 40 nm. The influence of the extracted TiO on a commercial probiotic formulation usually used to treat diarrhea in children was studied. The probiotic formulation contained Bacillus coagulans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium as evident from 16S rRNA gene sequences and polyphasic characterization. Isolated bacteria exhibited known probiotic activities like biofilm formation, acid production, growth at 6% salt, and antibiotic resistance. TiO from chocolates inhibited the growth and activity of the probiotic formulation over a concentration range of 125-500μg/ml in vitro. Based on results, it is estimated that 20 g of such chocolate contains enough TiO to disturb the gut microbial community of children aged 2-8 years with a stomach capacity of ~ 0.-0.9 l. The in vivo study on white albino mice shows the same response but with a higher dose. The results obtained by plate counts, MTT assay, live/dead staining, and qPCR suggest that TiO from chocolates inhibits the growth and viability of probiotic bacteria in mice gut even at a concentration of 50-100 μg/day/mice. Therefore, TiO in chocolate discourages survival of probiotic bacteria in the human gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124640>The potential involvement of human microbiota in osteoarthritis: encouraging data useful for future studies.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173526> CECT5716: a novel alternative for the prevention of vascular disorders in a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to examine whether the immune-modulatory bacteria  CECT5716 (LC40) ameliorates disease activity and cardiovascular complications in a female mouse model of lupus. Eighteen-week-old NZBWF1 [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and NZW/LacJ (control) mice were treated with vehicle or LC40 ( × 10 colony-forming units/d) for 15 wk. LC40 treatment reduced lupus disease activity, blood pressure, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and splenomegaly in SLE mice. LC40 reduced the elevated T, B, regulatory T cells (T), and T helper (T)-1 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes of lupus mice. LC40 lowered the higher plasma concentration of proinflammatory cytokines observed in lupus mice. Aortas from SLE mice showed reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. Endothelial dysfunction found in SLE is related to an increase of both NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide production and eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr. These activities returned to normal values after a treatment with LC40. Probiotic administration to SLE mice reduced plasma LPS levels, which might be related to an improvement of the gut barrier integrity. LC40 treatment increases the  count in gut microbiota of SLE mice.

Functional yoghurt fortified with DPP in three forms was prepared and their physicochemical, microstructure, texture and sensory characteristics were assessed. The micro morphology was explored via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed for functional groups detection. Phenolic compounds were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) while fatty acids were identified via Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC). Cytotoxicity of DPP nanocapsules was evaluated against RPE1 cell line (BJ1). The Egyptian date palm pollen grains evaluation revealed its rich content of protein and carbohydrate (36.28 and 17.14 g/ 100g), high content of Fe, Zn and Mg (226., 124.4 and 318 mg/100g), unsaturated fatty acids ω-3, ω-6 and ω-9 (8.76, 20.26 and 7.11 g/100g, which was increased by ethanol extraction) and phenolic compounds especially catechin (191.73 μg/mL) which was pronounced in DPP antioxidant potentials (IC50 35.54 mg/g). The FTIR analyses indicated the presence of soluble amides (proteins) and polysaccharides (fibers) functional groups in DPP.

Randomized controlled trials have shown positive effects of  on clinical outcomes in these commonly occurring RTIs. Two meta-analyses published by the York Health Economics Consortium (YHEC) and Cochrane reported the efficacy of  in reducing incidence and duration of RTIs, number of antibiotic courses, and days absent from work. The aim of this study was to assess the potential health-economic impact of  on RTI-associated events and expenses in the US primary care setting. A state-transition microsimulation model reproduced a study population representative of the US national demographics for age and gender (1/1,000 sample). RTI incidence was based on the influenza-like illness outpatient consultation rate reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FluView. Data on vaccination, on factors that negatively impact RTI outcomes, on resource utilization, and on productivity loss were obtained from US national databases. Analyses were performed for both meta-analyses independently. Outcomes included cost savings for the health care payer, related to a reduced number of RTI episodes, less outpatient consultations, and decreased medical prescriptions as well as cost savings from a broader societal perspective related to productivity loss. The analysis showed that generalized probiotic intake in the US population for 2017-2018 would have allowed cost savings for the health care payer of 4.6 million USD based on the YHEC scenario and 373 million USD for the Cochrane scenario, by averting 19 million and 54. million RTI sick days, respectively, compared to no . Antibiotic prescriptions decreased with 1.39-2.16 million courses, whereas absence from work decreased by 3.58-4.2 million days when applying the YHEC and Cochrane data, respectively. When productivity loss is included, total savings for society represented 784 million or 1.4 billion USD for the YHEC and Cochrane scenarios, respectively.

This investigation compares clinical outcomes before and after quality improvement-program interventions in a population of premature infants at intermediate risk for NEC.This study is a retrospective single-center chart review of infants admitted with a birth weight of 1000-1499 g, excluding major congenital anomalies, over a 6-year period, beginning with implementation of a donor breast-milk program when mother's own milk was not available. Infants were separated into 2 epochs, before (July 2012-December 2013) and after (April 2014-June 2018) introduction of human milk-derived fortifier (Prolacta) and a daily probiotic (FloraBABY) supplement.Comparing 140 preintervention infants with 265 postintervention infants, NEC was significantly lower in the postintervention group: .2% vs 1.1% (P = 0.046). Somatic growth was similar in both epochs.Quality-improvement initiatives utilizing an exclusive human-milk diet and daily probiotic supplementation were associated with a decreased incidence of NEC in infants with a birth weight of 1000-1499 g.

In this study, the gel made from whey protein concentrate (WPC) and pullulan (PUL) was used as the wall material to prepare the microencapsulation for LGG protection. The gelation process was optimized and the properties of gel were also determined. The results showed the optimal gel was made from 10% WPC and 8.0% PUL at pH 7., which could get the best protective effect; the viable counts of LGG were 6.61 Log CFU/g after exposure to simulated gastric juice (SGJ) and 9.40 Log CFU/g to simulated intestinal juice (SIJ) for 4 h. Sodium dodecyl sulphite polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed that the WPC-PUL gel had low solubility in SGJ, but dissolved well in SIJ, which suggested that the gel can protect LGG under SGJ condition and release  in the SIJ. Moreover, when the gel has highest hardness and water-holding capacity, the viable counts of LGG were not the best, suggesting the relationship between the protection and the properties of the gel was non-linear.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249562>Effects of Single Probiotic- and Combined Probiotic-Fermented Milk on Lipid Metabolism in Hyperlipidemic Rats.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that  have positive effects on hyperlipidemia by lowering the serum lipid concentration and improving the lipid profile. To explore the mechanism by which probiotic-fermented milk improves lipid metabolism, the transcription of genes regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs), '-AMP-activated protein kinase, and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which play integral roles in lipid metabolism, was investigated in hyperlipidemic rats. Compared with rats fed a high-fat diet, the administration of probiotic-fermented milk significantly lowered the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and total triglycerides (TG) in rat serum and viscera ( < 0.05) and significantly increased the level of total bile acid in the rat liver and small intestine ( < 0.05). The quantitative PCR results showed that the  ameliorated the TC levels in the rats by activating the transcription of genes involved in the LXR axis, which promoted TC reverse transport and increased the conversion of TC to bile acids. The level of TG in the hyperlipidemic rats was ameliorated by the inhibition of the transcription of carbohydrate reaction element binding protein genes and activation of the transcription of PPARα genes.

Sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons was performed on faecal samples taken at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. Additionally, and for comparative purposes, ethidium monoazide (EMA) was used to avoid detection of DNA from dead bacteria. Members of two genera of the family Coriobacteriaceae ( and ) were found in greater proportions at all sampling points during isoflavone supplementation. Different genera of the family Ruminococcaceae (e.g.,  and ), as well as members of the family Lachnospiraceae () also underwent significant increases. For this last genus a positive correlation with the levels of equol excretion in urine was found. Currently bacterial strains known to be involved in isoflavone metabolism and equol production have been assigned to these taxa. The use of EMA dye allowed us to unravel those bacterial gut linages (e.g., Lachnospiraceae) that were more susceptible to damage.

We conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the effects of  on fasting blood glucose (FBG), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total glutathione (GSH), malonaldehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in pregnant women with GDM.We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, Embase and PubMed electronic databases up to November 2018. A meta-analysis was then conducted using weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect measures.A total of 7 studies were enrolled in the final meta-analysis. Data showed that  reduced FBG (WMD: -3.19mg/dl, 95% CI: -.55 to -0.82, P=0.008) in pregnant women with GDM. Sub-group analysis suggested that the effect of  on lowering FBG was more significant in patients with a baseline FBG ≥92mg/dl (WMD: -3.62mg/dl, 95% CI: -6.64 to -0.60, P=0.019), a duration of probiotic treatment ≤6 weeks (WMD: -3.24mg/dl, 95% CI: -4.96 to -1.53, P=0.000) and a dose<6×10 colony-forming unit (CFU) (WMD: -3.37mg/dl, 95% CI: -6.64 to -0.10, P=0.043).

Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria models ( (Moro) Hansen and Mocquot (ATCC® 4356™) and  S17, respectively) have been successfully encapsulated for the first time in pH-independent microparticulate polymethacrylates (i.e., Eudraguard biotic) used for the targeted delivery of nutraceuticals to the colon. These bacteria have also been encapsulated within the mucoadhesive polymethacrylate Eudragit RS 100 widely used as targeted release formulation for active pharmaceutical ingredients. The enteric microparticles remained unaltered under simulated gastric conditions and released the contained viable microbial cargo under simulated intestinal conditions. Buoyancies of 90.2% and 57.3% for Eudragit and Eudraguard microparticles, respectively, and long-term stability ( months) for the encapsulated microorganisms were found. Cytotoxicity of the microparticles formulated with both polymers was evaluated (0.-20 mg/mL) on Caco-2 cells, showing high cytocompatibility.

However, sublethal exposure can exert unintentional toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial pollinators by dysregulating innate immunity. Generation of hydrogen peroxide (HO) by the dual oxidase (Duox) pathway is a critical component of the innate immune response, which functions to impede infection and maintain homeostatic regulation of the gut microbiota. Despite the importance of this pathway in gut immunity, the consequences of neonicotinoid exposure on Duox signaling have yet to be studied. Here, we use a  model to investigate the hypothesis that imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) can affect the Duox pathway. The results demonstrated that exposure to sublethal imidacloprid reduced HO production by inhibiting transcription of the  gene. Furthermore, the reduction in  expression was found to be a result of imidacloprid interacting with the midgut portion of the immune deficiency pathway. This impairment led to a loss of microbial regulation, as exemplified by a compositional shift and increased total abundance of  and  spp. (dominant microbiota members) found in the gut. In addition, we demonstrated that certain probiotic lactobacilli could ameliorate Duox pathway impairment caused by imidacloprid, but this effect was not directly dependent on the Duox pathway itself. This study is the first to demonstrate the deleterious effects that neonicotinoids can have on Duox-mediated generation of HO and highlights a novel coordination between two important innate immune pathways present in insects. Sublethal exposure to certain pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoid insecticides) is suspected to contribute to honey bee () population decline in North America. Neonicotinoids are known to interfere with immune pathways in the gut of insects, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We used a  model to understand how imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) interferes with two innate immune pathways-Duox and Imd. We found that imidacloprid dysregulates these pathways to reduce hydrogen peroxide production, ultimately leading to a dysbiotic shift in the gut microbiota. Intriguingly, we found that presupplementation with probiotic bacteria could mitigate the harmful effects of imidacloprid. Thus, these observations uncover a novel mechanism of pesticide-induced immunosuppression that exploits the interconnectedness of two important insect immune pathways.Copyright © 2019 Chmiel et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495848>Probiotic strains improve high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia through modulating gut microbiota in ways different from atorvastatin.</a></h1><p>Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).  are one of the most popular dietary supplements for hypercholesterolemia, but there are questions as to whether there are differences between  and cholesterol-lowering drugs like atorvastatin (ATO) both in effectiveness and in the underlying mechanisms.

Besides, these effects were associated with restoration of microbiota dysbiosis induced by HFD. It was worth noting that ATO and  induced different shifts of the gut microbiota in both structure and key phylotypes. Most interestingly, Allobaculum, a HFD-suppressed genus, reported to be involved in alleviating oxidative stress, was enriched by all tested probiotic strains, but not by ATO. Furthermore, Prevotella, also a HFD-suppressed genus, was uniquely reversed by JQII-.

Of the 16 RCTs that reported the mean age of children, mean age overall was 2.4 years; in 4 RCTs the mean age of children participating in the trial was less than 1 year old; in 2 RCTs the mean age was between 1 and 2 years old; and in 10 RCTs the mean age was older than 2 years. Probiotic strains evaluated by the trials varied, with 11 of the included RCTs evaluating Lactobacillus-containing , and six RCTs evaluating Streptococcus-containing .The proportion of children (i.e. the number of children in each group) experiencing one or more episodes of AOM during the treatment was lower for those taking  (RR 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.93; 16 trials; 2961 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 10; moderate-certainty evidence).Post hoc subgroup analysis found that among children not prone to otitis media, a lower proportion of children receiving  experienced AOM (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84; 11 trials; 2227 participants; NNTB = 9; moderate-certainty evidence). However, among children who were otitis prone, there was no difference between probiotic and comparator groups (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11;  trials; 734 participants; high-certainty evidence). The test for subgroup differences was significant (P = 0.007).None of the included trials reported on the severity of AOM.The proportion of children experiencing adverse events did not differ between the probiotic and comparator groups (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.94; 4 trials; 395 participants; low-certainty evidence). decreased the proportion of children taking antibiotics for any infection (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86; 8 trials; 1768 participants; NNTB = 8; moderate-certainty evidence). Test for subgroup differences (use of antibiotic specifically for AOM, use of antibiotic for infections other than AOM) was not significant.There was no difference in the mean number of school days lost (MD -0.95, 95% CI -2.47 to 0.57;  trials; 1280 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in the level of compliance in taking the intervention (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.05;  trials; 990 participants). decreased the proportion of children having other infections (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 11 trials; 3610 participants; NNTB = 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Test for subgroup differences (acute respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections) was not significant.Probiotic strains trialled and their dose, frequency, and duration of administration varied considerably across studies, which likely contributed to the substantial levels of heterogeneity. Sensitivity testing of funnel plots did not reveal publication bias. may prevent AOM in children not prone to AOM, but the inconsistency of the subgroup analyses suggests caution in interpreting these results.  decreased the proportion of children taking antibiotics for any infection. The proportion of children experiencing adverse events did not differ between the probiotic and comparator groups.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD).  may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients,  remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of .© Copyright by the Author(s).

The aim of this study was to explore how the probiotic mixture VSL#3 affects gastric cell lineages in mice with a special focus on protective and aggressive factors. Weight-matching littermate male mice ( = 14) were divided into treated and control pairs. The treated mice received VSL#3 ( mg/day/mouse) by gastric gavage for 10 days. Control mice received only the vehicle. Food consumption and bodyweight were monitored. All mice were injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuridine (120 mg/Kg bodyweight) two hours before sacrificed to label S-phase cells. Stomach tissues were processed for lectin- and immunohistochemical examination. ImageJ software was used to quantify immunolabeled gastric epithelial cells. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to provide relative changes in expression of gastric cell lineages specific genes. Results revealed that treated mice acquired (i) increased production of mucus, trefoil factor (TFF) 1 and TFF2, (ii) decreased production of pepsinogen, and (iii) increased ghrelin-secreting cells. No significant changes were observed in bodyweight, food consumption, cell proliferation, or parietal cells.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of  compared with placebo or treatment as usual on defecation frequency [bowel movements (BMs)/wk] or treatment success rates in children with functional constipation. Independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed risk of bias in each RCT. Data were pooled with (inverse variance) random-effects models.We identified 17 RCTs, of which 14 and 11 provided sufficient data to enable meta-analysis of the effects of  compared with control on defecation frequency (n = 965) or treatment success (n = 835), respectively. When compared to (any) control intervention,  did not significantly increase defecation frequency [weighted mean difference (WMD): 0.28 BMs/wk; 95% CI: -0.12, 0.69; P = 0.165] but were more efficacious in achieving treatment success (RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.50; P = 0.024). These effects did not differ by type of control (i.e., active or inactive) intervention. However, in analyses confined to the RCTs that were free of high risk of bias (only ),  did not confer any beneficial effects on defecation frequency (WMD: -0.55 BMs/wk; 95% CI: -1.37, 0.26; P = 0.185) and achievement of treatment success (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.13; P = 0.873), compared with control interventions.The current evidence thus does not support the use of  as a single or coadjuvant therapy for treatment of functional constipation in children and refutes recently published reviews reporting favorable effects of .

Kefir consumption has been associated with many advantageous properties to general health, including as an antioxidative, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-tumor moiety. This beverage is commonly found and consumed by people in the United States of America, China, France, Brazil, and Japan. Recently, the consumption of kefir has been popularized in other countries including Malaysia. The microflora in kefir from different countries differs due to variations in culture conditions and the starter media. Thus, this study was aimed at isolating and characterizing the lactic acid bacteria that are predominant in Malaysian kefir grains via macroscopic examination and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The results revealed that the Malaysian kefir grains are dominated by three different strains of Lactobacillus strains, which are Lactobacillus harbinensis, Lactobacillusparacasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The probiotic properties of these strains, such as acid and bile salt tolerances, adherence ability to the intestinal mucosa, antibiotic resistance, and hemolytic test, were subsequently conducted and extensively studied. The isolated Lactobacillus spp. from kefir H maintained its survival rate within 3 h of incubation at pH 3 and pH 4 at 98.0 ± 3.3% and 96.1 ± 1.7% of bacteria growth and exhibited the highest survival at bile salt condition at 0.3% and 0.%. The same isolate also showed high adherence ability to intestinal cells at 96.3 ± 0.01%, has antibiotic resistance towards ampicillin, penicillin, and tetracycline, and showed no hemolytic activity. In addition, the results of antioxidant activity tests demonstrated that isolated Lactobacillus spp. from kefir G possessed high antioxidant activities for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazine (DPPH) assay compared to other isolates. From these data, all Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Malaysian kefir serve as promising candidates for  foods and beverage since they exhibit potential probiotic properties and antioxidant activities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623025>Probiotic extracts ameliorate nasal allergy by inducing interleukin-35-producing dendritic cells in mice.</a></h1><p>The therapeutic efficacy of allergic rhinitis (AR) needs to be improved.  have immunoregulatory functions.

Growing evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a role in the occurrence and evolution of this disease, namely through the production of bioactive metabolites.Omics technologies (metagenomic, metabolomic, and phenomic data) allow providing a robust prediction of steatosis. More than just correlations, causative effects of certain bacterial metabolites have been evidenced in vitro and in rodent models. Butyrate has been shown to be a potent metabolic and inflammatory modulator in the liver. Several aromatic amino-acids such as phenylacetic acid, imidazole propionate, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate have been identified as potential inducers of steatosis and hepatic inflammation, whereas indolic compounds (indole and indole-3-acetate) seem to preserve liver integrity.

Probiotic lactobacilli may aid this purpose. We investigated whether vaginal  (containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 14870 and Lactobacillus gasseri DSM 14869) would result in vaginal colonisation with lactobacilli in women with and without BV.This prospective, partially randomised, exploratory pilot study was conducted in Soweto, South Africa. Thirty-nine sexually-active, HIV negative women were enrolled from October 2014 to May 2016 into three arms. Women who did not have BV (Group 1, n = 13) self-administered probiotic capsules vaginally once daily for 30 days, then once a week until Day 190. Women diagnosed with BV were randomized into Group 2 (n = 12) or Group 3 (n = 14) and treated with the triple oral antibiotic combination for vaginal discharge syndrome per South African guidelines (cefixime 400 mg stat, doxycycline 100 mg BD for 7 days and metronidazole 2 g stat). Immediately after antibiotic treatment, women in Group 2 self-administered probiotic capsules vaginally once daily for 30 days then vaginally once a week until Day 190. Women in Group 3 were not given lactobacilli.During the study, L. rhamnosus DSM 14870 or L. gasseri DSM 14869, were isolated in /13 (38.%) women in Group 1 compared to 10/12 (83.3%) women in Group 2 (p = 0.041). The 1-month and 6-month BV cure rates were similar (P >  0.05) between Group 2 (42 and 25%) compared to Group 3 (36 and 25%). In Group 2, no correlation was observed between the frequency of isolation of the two Lactobacillus strains and the 1-month or 6-month cure rate.Supplementation with vaginal probiotic capsules resulted in colonisation of the vagina by the Lactobacillus strains (L. rhamnosus DSM 14870 and L. gasseri DSM 14869) contained in the capsules. We observed low initial cure rates of BV after a stat dose of metronidazole and that the probiotic did not improve BV cure rates or alleviate recurrence which could be due to treatment failure or very limited power of the study.Registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry ( www.pactr.org ) on April 13, 2018 (retrospectively registered).

However, the effectiveness of such treatments has not received much study. In this research, the unique chitinotrophic Bacillus was isolated on shrimp shell from salt lakes and identified as Bacillus altitudinis by 16SRNA sequencing. This strain produced a novel chitin-oligosaccharide material and thermostable chitinase (.1 units/ml) during 4 days incubation on shrimp shell medium; nevertheless, its growth on nutrient agar was negative. The zymogram showed less than 50 kD protein responsible for chitinase activities. The LC/MS detection of concentrate fermented products showed the production of oligosaccharide during chitin fermentation. As results of shrimp shell degradation, 65.6 mg/l protein, 73.4 mg/l N-acetyl glucose amine, and oligosaccharide were produced. Synergism activities of chitooligosaccharide and chitinase from this strain against fungi and pathogen candida (staining with methylene blue showed that almost 50% of 10 cells were died during 6 h) are promising for new anti-fungal drug with no side effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291932>In vivo effectiveness and safety of  on prophylaxis and treatment of oral candidiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>To systematically review and assess the in vivo effectiveness and safety of  for prophylaxis and treating oral candidiasis.A literature search for studies published in English until August 1, 2018 was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science.

Recent evidence has shown a significant connection between gut microbiota and brain function, as butyrate production by microorganisms is believed to activate the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To investigate whether modification of intestinal microbiota could impact cognitive decline in the aging brain, Romo-Araiza . conducted a study to test how probiotic and prebiotic supplementation impacted spatial and associative memory in middle-aged rats. Their results showed that rats supplemented with the symbiotic (both probiotic and prebiotic) treatment performed significantly better than other groups in the spatial memory test, though not in that of associative memory. Their data also reported that this improvement correlated with increased levels of BDNF, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and better electrophysiological outcomes in the hippocampi of the symbiotic group. Thus, the results indicated that the progression of cognitive impairment is indeed affected by changes in microbiota induced by  and prebiotics. Potential future applications of these findings center around combatting neurodegeneration and inflammation associated not only with aging but also with the damaging posttraumatic effects of ischemic stroke.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111344>Improving Compliance with Very Low Energy Diets (VLEDs) Prior to Bariatric Surgery-a Randomised Controlled Trial of Two Formulations.</a></h1><p>Preoperative very low energy diets (VLEDs) improve access during bariatric surgery.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after -weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The correction of such bowel problems could therefore make an important contribution to improving population health and quality-adjusted lifespan. We examined independent and interactive effects upon the fecal microbiota of two potentially favorable determinants of intestinal motility: the intake frequency of a fermented milk product containing  strain Shirota (LcS) and the quantity/quality of habitual physical activity in 338 community-living Japanese aged 65-92 years. Subjects were arbitrarily grouped on the basis of questionnaire estimates of LcS intake (0-2, 3-, and 6-7 days/week) and pedometer/accelerometer-determined patterns of physical activity [<7000 and ≥7000 steps/day, or <15 and ≥15 min/day of activity at an intensity >3 metabolic equivalents (METs)]. After adjustment for potential confounders, the respective numbers of various beneficial fecal bacteria tended to be larger in more frequent consumers of LcS-containing products, this trend being statistically significant (mostly  < 0.001) for total , the  subgroup, and the  cluster; in contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in fecal bacterial counts between the physical activity groups. A multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis estimated that the risk of infrequent bowel movements (arbitrarily defined as defecating ≤3 days/week) was significantly lower ( < 0.05) in subjects who ingested LcS-containing products 6-7 rather than 0-2 days/week [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.382 (0.149-0.974)] and was also lower in those who took ≥7000 rather than <7000 steps/day [0.441 (0.201-0.971)] or spent ≥15 rather than <15 min/day of physical activity at an intensity >3 METs [0.412 (0.183-0.929)]. The risk of infrequent bowel movements in subjects who combined 6-7 days/week of LcS with ≥7000 steps/day or ≥15 min/day of activity at >3 METs was only a tenth of that for individuals who combined 0-2 days/week of LcS with <7000 steps/day or <15 min/day at >3 METs. These results suggest that elderly individuals can usefully ingest LcS-containing supplements regularly (≥6 days/week) and also engage in moderate habitual physical activity (≥7000 steps/day and/or ≥15 min/day at >3 METs) in order to enhance their gastrointestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588396>High-level extracellular secretion and characterization of the thermophilic β-cyclodextrin glucanotranferase from  in .</a></h1><p>A strain - producing β-cyclodextrin glucanotranferase (β-CGTase) was identified as  by morphological analysis and 16s rDNA analysis.

This study thus aims to evaluate the ability to survive under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and impact of Torulaspora delbrueckii B14 and Kluyveromyces lactis B10 as single and mixed inocula for cheese production. These two yeast strains were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal tracts and tested for self-aggregation, hydrophobicity, pathogen inhibition, antibiotic resistance, and β-galactosidase production. The yeast strains were also assessed for their ability to survive in different NaCl concentrations (2.%, %, and 10% w/v), multiple temperatures (4 °C and 40 °C), and used as single and mixed starter cultures for cheese production. Yeasts population levels were monitored by YPD plating and MALDI-TOF and metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS over the course of the 21 days cheese maturation process. T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 both showed >80% viability after the passage through the simulated gastrointestinal tract, had self-aggregation rates >90%, and displayed β-galactosidase activities of 0.35 U/g and 0.53 U/g, respectively. Both yeasts survived at 2.%, %, and 10% NaCl for 21 days and showed growth at 4 °C. In cheese, the single inoculum of K. lactis B10 and mixed inoculum showed the highest levels of lactose consumption.

The dltD gene knock-out mutant, L. rhamnosus GG CMPG5540, displaying modified cell wall lipoteichoic acids, showed significantly increased colony-forming units after spray-drying and subsequent storage under standard conditions compared to wild-type L. rhamnosus GG. In contrast, disruption of the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides or pili expression did not impact survival. However, spray-drying did significantly affect the adherence capacity of L. rhamnosus GG. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the pili, key surface factors for adherence to intestinal cells and mucus, were sheared off during the spray-drying process. These data thus highlight that both the functionality and viability of  should be assessed during the spray-drying process and subsequent storage.© 2019 The Authors.

Thus, there was a dire need for alternate sources to help in poultry production. Recently,  and prebiotics claimed to be effective alternatives to antibiotics in the poultry. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of different  and prebiotics on the performance of broilers. The study involved 2 broiler cycles, 1 during winter and 1 during summer with a total of 425 1-day-old Cobb 500 broiler chicks for each cycle. They were allotted to  experimental treatments. The  were Bacillus coagulans (1 g/kg dried culture) and Lactobacillus (1 g/kg dried culture of 12 commercial strains). The prebiotics included fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) ( g/kg) and mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( g/kg). The results showed that there was no effect of the different  and prebiotics on the production performance of broilers. There was increased weight of the thymus in the control group. In cycle 1, the panelists indicated that the smell, color, taste, and texture of the cooked meat were acceptable, and that there were no significant differences between the different groups. There was no significant effect of the different diets on the biochemical parameters of the blood among the experimental groups at 3- and -wk of age. Phytohaemaglutinin test showed that dietary FOS and MOS induced higher cellular response than the other treatments (P = 0.04) in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the results revealed that dietary FOS induced higher cellular response than the other treatments (P = 0.019). The used experimental treatments have a positive effect on microbial count in -week-old broilers. There was no Salmonella sp. recorded using the experimental treatments in the first cycle, and the growth of E. coli was reduced significantly. In the second cycle, all treatments in 3-week-old broilers did not affect the count of both lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and E. coli. At -week-old of the same cycle, the bacterial count of E. coli increased even with control, whereas Salmonella growth was inhibited. The pH value was driven toward acidity in all of the treatments.  and prebiotics can be used in chicken feed safely and without any adverse effects on the productive parameters and immune status of the flock.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623341>Development of a Mucoadhesive  Gelling Formulation for the Delivery of  into Vaginal Cavity.</a></h1><p>Local administration of vaginal , especially lactobacilli, has been recently proposed as an effective prevention strategy against candidosis recurrences, which affect 40-50% of women.

Glyphosate (Gly) is the most utilised herbicide in agriculture, although its widespread use is generating controversy in the scientific world because of its probable carcinogenic effect on human cells. Gly performs as an inhibitor of -enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phospate synthase (EPSP synthase), not only in plants, but also in bacteria. An inhibiting effect on EPSP synthase from intestinal microbiota has been reported, affecting mainly beneficial bacteria. To the contrary, Clostridium spp. and Salmonella strains are shown to be resistant to Gly. Consequently, researchers have suggested that Gly can cause dysbiosis, a phenomenon which is characterised by an imbalance between beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. The overgrowth of bacteria such as clostridia generates high levels of noxious metabolites in the brain, which can contribute to the development of neurological deviations. This work reviews the impact of Gly-induced intestinal dysbiosis on the central nervous system, focusing on emotional, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. A wide variety of factors were investigated in relation to brain-related changes, including highlighting genetic abnormalities, pregnancy-associated problems, diet, infections, vaccines and heavy metals. However, more studies are required to determine the implication of the most internationally used herbicide, Gly, in behavioural disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, fermentation of pineapple juice with probiotic bacteria  and  strains as well as changes of some properties in the beverage during storage were investigated. All tested strains exhibited good growth properties on pineapple juice without supplementation of any nutrient compounds. After 24 h fermentation, the cell counts of lactobacilli passed the level of 10 cfu/ml, while the cell number of bifidobacteria reached a level of 10 cfu/ml. The highest volumetric productivity (3.10 cfu/mlh) was observed in  299V. The ratios of lactic acids to acetic acids in the cases of  299V and  La5 were .37 and 9.91, respectively. In the case of  Bb-12, the concentrations of lactic acid and acetic acid were 6 mM and 23 mM in natural juices, and 15 and 21 mM in the case of supplementation with prebiotics at the 16 h of fermentation, respectively. Additionally, supplementation with prebiotics at the initiation of fermentation resulted 7 mM lactic acid and 23 mM acetic acid at the end of fermentation. Fructose was the most preferred sugar for both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Both total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity increased slightly during fermentation and dropped during the storage period. The microbial population did not change significantly during the first month of storage. After the storage period (2 months), the probiotic bacteria lost about 0.11 log cfu/ml viability after treatment with 0.3% pepsin for 135 min, and a further 0.1 log cfu/ml after treatment with 0.6% bile salts. These values were 10 times higher than data from the fresh fermented pineapple juice.

In this study, three Bacillus species were isolated from the digestive tract of freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus and characterised based on their morphological, biochemical and evolutionary relationships. Their probiotic potentials were evaluated based on their ability to tolerate low pH, bile salt concentration, high temperatures, adhesion ability (auto-aggregation and hydrophobicity), haemolytic activity and antimicrobial activity including biosafety assay. Three Bacillus strains identified as Bacillus velezensis TPS3N (MK130897), Bacillus subtilis TPS4 (MK130899) and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens TPS17 (MK130898) were designated as TPS3N, TPS4 and TPS17, respectively. TPS3N and TPS17 were α-haemolytic, while TPS4 was γ-haemolytic. The three isolates had higher viability ability after exposure to higher temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C) and were resistant to low pH (1) and bile salt concentration (0.%) as well as high cell surface hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation. The three isolates were compatible with one another and thus can be used in consortia. These strains were susceptible to gentamicin, cephalexin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, kanamycin, amikacin, penicillin, cefoperazone, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin (except TPS4) and furazolidone (except TPS17).

A total of 225 healthy olive flounders (initial mean body weight, 13. ± 0.01 g) were randomly separated into 3 groups of 75 fish, each group having three replicates of 25 fish; first group was fed with a FM-based control diet (Con), 2nd group was fed with a low-FM diet containing a blend of plant and animal protein meals replacing 30% of the FM protein (FM30), and 3rd group was fed with the FM30 diet supplemented with 10-10 CFU kg of the MSP (Pro). With the exception of lipid retention, which was significantly lower in fish fed the FM30 diet compared to the other two treatments, no other statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to any of the other growth and nutrient utilization parameters. Myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities of fish fed the Pro diet were much higher and significantly different than those of fish fed the FM30 diet. Glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly higher in Pro- than in Con-fed fish, which, in turn, was significantly higher than FM30-fed fish. Expression of immune-related genes including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α was markedly upregulated in livers of the fish fed Pro diet compared to those fed the Con and FM30 diets. Furthermore, supplementation of MSP in FM30 diet enriched the Lactobacillus abundance in the fish gut as well as predictive gene functions in relation to lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms. These data suggested that the MSP could reduce the potential adverse effects of the low-FM diet and might be used as a healthy immunostimulant for olive flounder.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to these traditional cancer therapies, the use of targeted delivery vectors to deliver anticancer genes or antitumor drugs to hypoxic areas in tumors is the most clinically promising cancer treatment with rapid development in recent years. In this study,  Nissle 1917 (EcN), an intestinal probiotic, was utilized as a targeted transport vector to deliver p53 and Tum- protein to tumor hypoxic regions. The tumor-targeting characteristics of EcN were investigated using luciferase CDABE operon, and the results demonstrated that EcN could specifically accumulate in the solid tumor areas of SMMC-7721 tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice. The Tum -p53 bifunctional proteins were initially constructed and then delivered to solid tumor regions by using the targeted transporter EcN for cancer therapy. The antitumor effect and safety of three engineered bacteria, namely, EcN (Tum-), EcN (p53), and EcN (Tum -p53), were also examined. The calculated tumor volume and tumor weight indicated that these three engineered bacteria could inhibit the growth of human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells, and the antitumor effect of EcN (Tum -p53) expressing the Tum -p53 fusion protein was significantly better than those of EcN (Tum-) and EcN (p53) alone. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that the expression of Ki-67, a nuclear proliferation-related protein, was inhibited in the tumor areas of the groups treated with the engineered bacteria, whereas the expression of caspase-3 was upregulated. The expression trends of Ki-67 and caspase-3 were consistent with the different antitumor efficacies of these three engineered bacteria. EcN did not elicit obvious side effects on mice.

We evaluated the effect of a postnatal probiotic combination on development of allergic diseases in very preterm infants.This sub-study was an a priori secondary outcome of the ProPrems multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (ANZCTR:12607000144415). ProPrems randomized 1099 very preterm infants to receive a probiotic combination or placebo from soon after birth until discharge from hospital or term corrected age (CA), whichever was earlier. Allergic disease (eczema, atopic eczema, food allergy, wheeze, atopic sensitization) was assessed in a subgroup of ProPrems infants (n=281) as close to 12 months CA as possible by questionnaire, clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens.There was no difference in eczema incidence between the probiotic and placebo group (35[30%] of 118 infants vs 37[27%] of 137 infants, respectively, absolute difference 2.65%, 95% CI -8.45 to 13.75). Similarly, the incidence of atopic eczema (6[%] of 118 vs 3[2%] of 137), food allergy (4[3%] of 124 vs 2[1%] of 154), wheeze (39[31%] of 127 vs 45[29%] of 154) and atopic sensitization (14[13%] of 106 vs 13[11%] of 123) were similar between the probiotic and placebo groups.This study found no effect of postnatal administration of a probiotic combination on the incidence of allergic diseases or atopic sensitization in the first two years of life in children born very preterm. Evidence that  are effective for prevention of allergic disease in premature infants remains lacking; adequately powered randomized controlled trials evaluating probiotic supplementation for allergy prevention in very preterm infants are needed.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Leaves of raw eaten vegetables and herbs are habitats for bacteria important not only to the host plant, but also to human health when ingested via meals. The aim of the current study was to determine the presence of putative probiotic bacteria in the phyllosphere of raw eaten produce. Quantification of bifidobacteria showed that leaves of  L.,  L., and  L. harbor between 10 and 10 DNA copies per gram fresh weight. Total cultivable bacteria in the phyllosphere of those three plant species ranged from 10 to 10 CFU per gram fresh weight. Specific enrichment of probiotic lactic acid bacteria from ,   L.,  L., and  L. led to the isolation of 155 bacterial strains, which were identified as , , and  species, based on their intact protein pattern. A comprehensive community analysis of the  leaves by PhyloChip hybridization revealed the presence of genera , , and .

In our previous work, it was demonstrated that the protein effectively alleviated food allergy symptoms via mast cell specific apoptosis, and it has revealed a therapeutic potential of this protein in allergy treatment. In the present study, we cloned the gene encoding extracellular solute-binding protein of the strain into the histidine-tagged pET-28a(+) vector and transformed the resulting plasmid into the  strain BL21 (DE3). The histidine-tagged extracellular solute-binding protein expressed in the transformed cells was purified using Ni-NTA affinity column. To enhance the efficiency of the protein purification, three parameters were optimized; the host bacterial strain, the culturing and induction temperature, and the purification protocol. After the process, two liters of transformed culture produced 7.15 mg of the recombinant proteins. This is the first study describing the production of extracellular solute-binding protein of probiotic bacteria. Establishment of large-scale production strategy for the protein will further contribute to the development of functional foods and potential alternative treatments for allergies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155822>Probiotic effect of Bifidobacterium longum  and Weissella paramesenteroides WpK4 on gerbils infected with Giardia lamblia.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to assess the probiotic potential of genuine strains of Bifidobacterium longum  and Weissella paramesenteroides WpK4, in experimental giardiasis.The bacteria were administered orally to gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) 10 days before oral infection with trophozoites of Giardia lamblia. After 7 days of infection, the animals were euthanized and portions of the duodenum were processed for histopathologic, histochemical and morphometric assessment.

We recently developed a new live-attenuated OCV candidate (HaitiV) derived from a Vibrio cholerae strain isolated during the 2010 Haiti cholera epidemic. HaitiV exhibited an unexpected probiotic-like activity in infant rabbits, preventing intestinal colonization and disease by wild-type V. cholerae before the onset of adaptive immunity. However, it remained unknown whether HaitiV would behave similarly to other OCVs to stimulate adaptive immunity against V. cholerae. Here, we orally immunized adult germ-free female mice to test HaitiV's immunogenicity. HaitiV safely and stably colonized vaccinated mice and induced known adaptive immune correlates of cholera protection within 14 days of administration. Pups born to immunized mice were protected against lethal challenges of both homologous and heterologous V. cholerae strains. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that protection was not dependent on vaccine colonization in or transmission to the pups. These findings demonstrate the protective immunogenicity of HaitiV and support its development as a new tool for limiting cholera.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662635>The Anti-parasitic Effect of Probiotic Bacteria  Limiting the Fecundity of  Female Adults.</a></h1><p>A potential protective effect of probiotic strains against zoonotic  infection was investigated in the framework of a new therapeutic strategy aimed at using  to control parasitic zoonoses.

To effectively overcome this problem, efficacious probiotic candidates were isolated from shrimp farms near coastal areas. The isolated Bacillus  were screened for their ability to control pathogenic Vibrio spp. and various V. parahaemolyticus AHPND (VP) strains. Among the obtained , Bacillus subtilis AQAHBS001, which broadly inhibited various strains of VP, was evaluated on a laboratory scale in water-soluble and feed applications of viable probiotic. The water addition of 1 × 10-1 × 10 CFU/mL of this probiotic effectively reduced total ammonia but did not improve shrimp growth and resistance to VP. However, feed supplemented with the selected probiotic at 1 × 10 and 1 × 10 CFU/kg diet and provided to shrimp continuously for  weeks efficiently improved growth, as indicated by significant final weight gain, average daily growth, specific growth rates and feed conversion ratios. Additionally, this probiotic significantly elevated immune responses through phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency and enhanced the expression of the prophenoloxidase, lysozyme, and anti-lipopolysaccharide factor genes. Furthermore, B. subtilis AQAHBS001 obviously improved midgut characteristics by increasing microvilli and intestinal wall thickness.

Selection criteria were original research report, those published in peer reviewed journal, and study investigating in vivo use of probiotic for prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in dogs. Studies were rated based on the level of evidence, and methodological quality was evaluated by the following variables: similarities between groups at baseline, risk of bias, and study group size.One hundred sixty-five studies were identified, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria-12 concerned acute gastrointestinal disease and  concerned chronic gastrointestinal disease. The level of evidence ranged between randomized controlled studies and crossover uncontrolled trials; estimated risk of bias was generally moderate to high; and sample sizes were small. Feces consistency was the most frequently evaluated clinical variable.The current data point toward a very limited and possibly clinically unimportant effect for prevention or treatment of acute gastrointestinal disease. For chronic gastrointestinal disease, dietary intervention remains the major key in treatment, whereas probiotic supplement seems not to add significant improvement. However, studies were often underpowered, underscoring the need for future larger, preferably multicenter studies.© 2019 The Authors.

The whole fruit juice of P. granatum which is rich with phytonutrients appeared to be a good probiotic carrier. The probiotication was carried out for 24 hr at 30, 35, and 37°C and pH 2., 4.0, and . under microaerophilic conditions. The results found that P. granatum juice cultivated with L. casei had a better growth profile with a higher biomass density at 37°C around pH 3.-4.0. Probiotication could maintain the scavenging activity of P. granatum juice cultivated with L. casei. The scavenging activity achieved up to 90% inhibition at the concentration of  mg/ml. The whole fruit-squeezed P. granatum juice was suitable for the growth of Lactobacillus species even without supplementation during cultivation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The findings of this study presented the potential of P. granatum juice (whole fruit) to be used as a good probiotic carrier, particularly for Lactobacillus species without supplementation. High nutritious P. granatum juice catered the need of probiotic bacteria during fermentation. Probiotication could maintain the antioxidant capacity of the juice in term of its radical scavenging activity. The antioxidant capacity was mainly attributed to the metabolites such as phenolic acids (romarinic acid and caftaric acid) and flavonoids (quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, rutin and kaempferol rutinoside). With the optimized temperature (37°C) and pH (4.00), probiotic bacteria could growth well up to a cell viability of 2.46 × 10  cfu/ml. This offers P. granatum to be developed into functional food to cater to the needs of the consumers who are lactose intolerant to dairy products.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31334254>Pharmaceutical Prescription in Canine Acute Diarrhoea: A Longitudinal Electronic Health Record Analysis of First Opinion Veterinary Practices.</a></h1><p>Canine acute diarrhoea is frequently observed in first opinion practice, though little is known about commonly used diagnostic or therapeutic management plans, including use of antimicrobials. This retrospective observational study utilised electronic health records augmented with practitioner-completed questionnaires from 3,189 cases (3,159 dogs) collected from 179 volunteer veterinary practices between April 2014 and January 2017. We used multivariable analysis to explore factors potentially associated with pharmaceutical agent prescription, and resolution of clinical signs by 10 days post-initial presentation. Use of bacteriological and/or parasitological diagnostic tests were uncommon (3.2% of cases, 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.4-4.0), though systemic antimicrobials were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical agents (49.7% of cases, 95% CI 46.1-53.2). Such prescription was associated with haemorrhagic diarrhoea (odds ratio, OR, 4.1; 95% CI 3.4-.0), body temperature in excess of 39.0°C, or moderate/severe cases (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7). Gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids) were prescribed to 37.7% of cases (95% CI 35.4-39.9), and were most frequently prescribed to vomiting dogs regardless of presence (OR 46.4, 95% CI 19.4-110.8) or absence of blood (OR 17.1, 95% CI 13.4-21.9). Endoparasiticides/endectocides were prescribed to 7.8% of cases (95% CI 6.8-9.0), such prescription being less frequent for moderate/severe cases (OR 0., 95% CI 0.4-0.7), though more frequent when weight loss was recorded (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.3-9.0). Gastrointestinal nutraceuticals (e.g., ) were dispensed to 60.8% of cases (95% CI 57.1-64.6), these cases less frequently presenting with moderate/severe clinical signs (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.-0.8). Nearly a quarter of cases were judged lost to follow-up (=754). Insured (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.-0.9); neutered (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.), or vaccinated dogs (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.3-0.4) were less commonly lost to follow-up. Of remaining dogs, clinical signs were deemed resolved in 95.4% of cases (95% CI 94.6-96.2). Provision of dietary modification advice and gastrointestinal nutraceuticals alone were positively associated with resolution (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.1); no such associations were found for pharmaceutical agents, including antimicrobials. Hence, this study supports the view that antimicrobials are largely unnecessary for acute diarrhoea cases; this being of particular importance when considering the global threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111440>Effect of a Potential Probiotic Candidate Enterococcus faecalis-1 on Growth Performance, Intestinal Microbiota, and Immune Response of Commercial Broiler Chickens.</a></h1><p>The probiotic effect of Enterococcus faecalis-1 (isolated from healthy chickens) on growth performance, immune response, and modulation of the intestinal microbiota of broilers was assessed with a total of 100-day-old commercial Cobb chicks. The chicks were randomly divided into two equal groups. The control group received a basal diet, while the test group received a basal diet and was orally supplied with E. faecalis at a dose of 10 CFU/bird/day. Results showed that E. faecalis-1 supplement significantly (P < 0.05) improved the body weight and feed conversion ratio of treated broilers compared with the control ones. The mortality percentage was reduced in E. faecalis-1-supplemented group. The total IgY serum level was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in broilers receiving E. faecalis-1 supplement (7.1 ± 0.39) compared with the control group (.8 ± 0.3), while the serum avidin level was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in E. faecalis-1-supplemented broilers (76 ± 11.1).

The probiotic was applied in all four quadrants at a total dose of 10 CFUs, administered in a buccoadhesive gel for  min, either in a single dose (n = ) or daily for a week (n = 6). Dental plaque and saliva samples were collected at baseline and after 14 and 28 days of first application. Amounts of S. dentisani and the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutans were measured by qPCR and salivary pH was measured by reflectometry. There was a significant increase in S. dentisani cells at day 14 but not at day 28 under both dosing schedules. A non-significant higher colonization was found in the half-mouth with previous professional cleaning as compared to the intact half. There was a significant increase in salivary pH at day 14 (p = 0.024) and day 28 (p = 0.014), which was stronger in multi-dose patients, and a significant decrease in S. mutans at day 28 (p < 0.01).

These beverages have important health benefits, which could be improved with the addition of probiotic cultures. This study assessed the protective effect of the cosupplementation of a probiotic culture (Lactobacillus casei 01) with a fermented whey dairy beverage against infection by Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovar Typhimurium in a murine model. Two fermented whey dairy beverages were prepared: conventional (FWB; starter culture) and probiotic (PFWB; starter and probiotic cultures). In the first set of experiments, Balb/C female mice were treated with FWB or PFWB, challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium, and analyzed for clinical signs, weight loss, and mortality for 20 d postinfection. In the second set of experiments, mice were treated with FWB or PFWB, challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium, and killed on d 10 postinfection. The liver, colon, and ileum were used for myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, and histological analysis and translocation to the liver. The contents from the small intestine were used for secretory IgA determination. The FWB treatment showed a better effect on animal survival (70%), translocation of the pathogen to the liver (2 out of 10), histopathology (fewer lesions), and inflammation than PFWB, which presented 50% animal survival, translocation in  out of 10 animals, and higher lesions. The control group presented 40% animal survival, translocation in 6 out of 10 animals, and severe lesions. Therefore, FWB was deemed to have a greater protective effect against Salmonella Typhimurium infection in the murine model compared with PFWB.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In this study the body mass index (BMI) cut off was taken as 18.-22.9 kg/m for normal, 23.0-24.9 kg/m for Overweight and >25 kg/m for obese as per WHO recommendation for Asian Indians, which is different for developed and developing countries. Role of gut microbiota mediated immune response in the development of obesity has been studied but the literature on Indian population are lacking. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine Toll like receptors (TLRs) in response to human gut microbiota of Indian obese and lean individuals using viable colonocytes in a Non invasive technique and Flowcytometry.A total of 20 healthy volunteer (10 obese and 10 lean) were enrolled in the study as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Viable colonocytes were isolated from fecal samples using a Non invasive technique (SCSR Method). Toll like receptors (TLRs) and immunoglobulin (IgA &IgG) receptor concentration were measured by standard Flowcytometry methods using specific fluorochrome conjugated antibodies.Average TLR2 receptor concentration was significantly higher in obese (6.35 %) as compared to lean (2.9 %) ( = 0.01). TLR4 receptor concentration was 1.4 % in obese and 1.65 % in lean although the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.59). IgA & IgG receptor concentration was 49.6 % & 11.2 % in the obese and 67.15 % & 8.05 % in the lean respectively but the differences among both the group were not statistically significant.The results of the present study will be helpful for physicians and researchers to find some biomarkers which can determine predisposition of the obesity in Indian population and helps to use alternative therapeutics such as  to maintain gut homeostasis and immune modulation to prevent obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302283>Effects of Lactococcus lactis from Cyprinus carpio L. as  on growth performance, innate immune response and disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we reported 18 LAB strains isolated from the intestinal contents of Cyprinus carpio, and their probiotic properties both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that 9 of them had higher in vitro immunomodulatory properties, effectively survived under acidic (pH 2.) and bile salt (ranging from 0.1% to 0.%) conditions, and inhibited the growth of 4 pathogens. Among them, Lactococcus lactis Q-8, Lactococcus lactis Q-9, and Lactococcus lactis Z-2 showed the strongest adhesion abilities and inhibition of pathogen adhesion to mucin. When the fish consumed diets containing these 3 strains ( × 10 CFU/g) for 8 weeks, the weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) had significantly (P < 0.05) increased, especially with L. lactis Q-8, which had a WG of 231.45%, and SGR of 2.22%. Survival rate in each LAB supplementation group was also significantly higher than that in control group during the feeding period (P < 0.05). For the cytokines expression levels in serum, different expression patterns were also observed. Before the infection with Aeromonas hydrophila, L. lactis supplementation significant up-regulated protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12) compared with negative (CK1) group, while these cytokines were significantly lower than those in positive (CK2) group after infection. However, whether infected or not, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β) were significantly increased in L. lactis Q-8, L. lactis Q-9, and L. lactis Z-2 treatment groups. In conclusion, these 3 L. lactis strains screened from common carp were effective in improving growth, innate immunity and disease resistance. Based on the physiological characteristics in our study, they might be used as potential  in aquaculture.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the factors involved in its pathogenesis are inflammation and increased intestinal permeability. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of  GG (LGG) on hepatic lipid accumulation, activation of inflammasomes, and gut permeability markers in experimental model of ALD with zebrafish.  An experiment was conducted to assess the effective LGG dose capable of promoting intestinal colonization. Animals were divided into three groups ( = 64/group): ethanol group (E), ethanol + probiotic group (EP), and control group (C). Groups E and EP were exposed to 0.% ethanol concentration for 28 days. At the end of this period, animals were euthanized, and livers were collected for Oil Red staining and assessment of the inflammasome system. Intestines were collected for evaluation of gut permeability markers.  The dose of 1.55 × 10 UFC LGG/fish/d promoted intestinal colonization. Group EP presented lower hepatic lipid accumulation, lower  expression, and higher  expression when compared to group E.  Supplementation with LGG was protective for hepatic steatosis in ALD model. In addition, LGG influenced the modulation of the inflammatory response and markers of gut permeability, improving the gut barrier structure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440006>Potency of  . and  to improve growth performance and business analysis in organic laying hens.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to determine the use of   spp. and  as alternative antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) to improve growth performance and business analysis.This study used a completely randomized factorial design. The first factor was the time of administration (1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks) and the second was the use of  (control without ; 0.1% AGP and 0.%  spp. + 0.25% ). One hundred and eighty laying hens (Lohmann strain), of 30 weeks old, were divided into 12 treatment groups, composed of five replicates, each consisting of three laying hens.The results showed that using 0.%  spp. + 0.25%  in weeks 1 and 2 showed the lowest feed intake (FI) (112.11-112.19 g/day), the highest egg weight (60.28 g) in the 1 week, the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) (2.21-2.23), and highest feed efficiency (44.75-45.25%) for 3-4 weeks, and the highest hen-day production (86.66-86.90%) for 3-4 weeks and the most profitable business analysis (IDR. 30,353).Based on the results, it can be concluded that the addition of 0.%  spp. + 25%   can be used as a substitute for AGP; it can reduce the FI and FCR, increasing egg weight, feed efficiency, and hen-day production, as well as illustrating the results of the most profitable business analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353590>Enhanced biotransformation of soybean isoflavone from glycosides to aglycones using solid-state fermentation of soybean with effective microorganisms (EM) strains.</a></h1><p>To improve the biotransformation efficacy (BE) of glycosides to aglycones in total soybean isoflavone (SIF), Taguchi experimental design has been used to study the most significant factors on BE of glycosides to aglycones using solid-state fermentation (SSF) of soybean with effective microorganisms (EM) strains. Physicochemical properties of optimized fermented dregs have also been analyzed to evaluate their  count and mainly nutritional parameters. The results showed that identified optimal fermentation conditions are 30°C, 40% water content, % inoculation level, 6 d culture time, and 20 mesh number. BE of aglycones reached 85.30% with dry matter recoveries of 96.34% based on optimal fermentation conditions. Total bacterial and lactic acid bacteria count reached 17.98 and 9.34 × 10 CFU/g with decreasing pH (4.21) and an increasing acidity (8.62 g/kg), respectively. This study could provide the theoretical grounds for aglycones biotransformation in large-scale production applied in food and other fields. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Isoflavones widely present in soy products possessing strong antioxidant capacity and estrogen-like activity. In human intestines, aglycone isoflavones after treatment/fermented are absorbed faster than their glucosides in untreated soybeans. The majority of glucoside isoflavones in soybean during fermentation were biologically converted to bioactive aglycone isoflavones via EM strains-fermented β-glucosidase. SSF of soybean with EM cocultures to ferment soymilk efficiently increased BE of glycosides to aglycones. Hence, EM cocultures as a new functional ingredient could improve the nutritional value of fermented soybean.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598135>Effects of  on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become prevalent in recent decades, especially in developed countries, and approaches for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD are not clear.

One of its beneficial features is the production of bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, and another is its buffering capacity through the production of ammonium from arginine. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of S. dentisani in the dental plaque of Colombian children and whether the presence of this bacterium is related to oral health and other conditions. Dental plaque and information on diet and oral hygiene habits were collected from children between 6 and 12 years of age from four Colombian cities, divided into caries-free children (International Caries Detection and Assessment System [ICDAS] 0, Decayed Missing Filled Teeth index [DMFT] 0), children with ICDAS 1 and 2, and children with ICDAS >3. Plaque DNA was extracted and quantified, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using specific primers. This bacterium was identified in all samples, with a median of 0.46 cells/ng DNA (interquartile range [IQR] 0.13-1.02), without finding significant differences between the groups ( > 0.05). In caries-free children, a median of 0.45 cells/ng DNA (IQR 0.14-1.23) was found. In children with ICDAS 1 and 2, the median was 0.49 cells/ng DNA (IQR 0.11-0.97), and in children with ICDAS >3, the median was 0.35 cells/ng DNA (IQR 0.12-1.07). However, statistically significant differences were found in the origin of children ( < 0.01), the use of fluoride-containing products ( < 0.01), and the frequency of food intake ( < 0.05). In conclusion, the presence of S. dentisani was quantified in children from four Colombian cities, without finding significant differences in oral health status.

To test this hypothesis, newborn piglets (16 piglets/group) were treated with either S. cerevisiae yeast ( x 109 cfu/pig: Low) or (2. x 1010 cfu/piglet: High) or equivalent volume of sterile water (Control) by oral gavage every other day starting from day 1 of age until weaning (28±1 days of age). Piglet body weight was recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24 and 28 and average daily gain (ADG) calculated for the total period. At weaning, piglets were euthanized to collect cecum content for microbial profiling by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. ADG was higher in both Low and High yeast groups than in Control group (P<0.05). Alpha diversity analyses indicated a more diverse microbiota in the Control group compared with Low yeast group; the High yeast being intermediate (P < 0.01). Similarly, Beta diversity analyses indicated differences among treatments (P = 0.03), mainly between Low yeast and Control groups (P = 0.02). The sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) indicated that Control group was discriminated by a higher abundance of Veillonella, Dorea, Oscillospira and Clostridium; Low yeast treated pigs by higher Blautia, Collinsella and Eubacterium; and High yeast treated pigs by higher Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, Parabacteroides, Mogibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis showed that piglet ADG was positively correlated with genus Prevotella in High yeast group. Yeast supplementation significantly affected microbial diversity in cecal contents of suckling piglets associated with an improvement of short chain fatty acid producing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, yeast treatment improved piglet performance and shaped the piglet cecum microbiota composition in a dose dependent way.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363877>Rumen fermentation and microbial community composition influenced by live Enterococcus faecium supplementation.</a></h1><p>Supplementation of appropriate  can improve the health and productivity of ruminants while mitigating environmental methane production. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the effects of Enterococcus faecium SROD on in vitro rumen fermentation, methane concentration, and microbial population structure. Ruminal samples were collected from ruminally cannulated Holstein-Friesian cattle, and 40:60 rice straw to concentrate ratio was used as substrate. Fresh culture of E. faecium SROD at different inclusion rates (0, 0.1%, 0.%, and 1.0%) were investigated using in vitro rumen fermentation system. Addition of E. faecium SROD had a significant effect on total gas production with the greatest effect observed with 0.1% supplementation; however, there was no significant influence on pH. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest propionate (P = 0.005) but the lowest methane concentration (P = 0.001). In addition, acetate, butyrate, and total VFA concentrations in treatments were comparatively higher than control. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the predominance of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota. At the genus level, Prevotella (15-17%) and Methanobrevibacter (96%) dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities of the in vitro rumen fermenta, respectively. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest quantities of total bacteria and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, whereas 1.0% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest contents of total fungi and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Overall, supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD significantly increased the propionate and total volatile fatty acids concentrations but decreased the methane concentration while changing the microbial community abundance and composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132882>Effect of storage temperature on the chemical, microbiological, and sensory characteristics of pasta filata soft cheese containing probiotic lactobacilli.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to manufacture pasta filata cheeses added with two probiotic lactobacilli:  GG and  LA5, either individually or combined, and to evaluate the effect of the storage temperature (4 and 12 °C) on their chemical, microbiological, and sensorial characteristics. Three cheese types were made: (i) G: containing  GG, (ii) L: containing  LA5, and (iii) GL: containing both probiotic strains. Gross composition, pH, microbiological, and sensory characteristics were determined. No differences in gross composition were found among them. pH values remained above .2 in cheeses stored at 4 °C. However, a postacidification was observed in cheeses ripened at 12 °C.  LA5 was not able to grow, while  GG grew 1. log CFU/g in G and GL cheeses stored at 12 °C, reducing the pH from day 8 onwards. These results emphasize the importance of the storage temperature since the good characteristics of probiotic cheeses are kept if the cold-chain is respected.

In a previous study comparing children with kwashiorkor and healthy children from Niger and Senegal, we found a dramatic gut microbiota alteration with a predominant depletion of anaerobes and enrichment in Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria in kwashiorkor. However, it remained unknown whether this association was related to malnutrition or was a specific feature of kwashiorkor. In this continuation study, we added 7 new marasmus subjects and 71,162 new colonies from the same countries. Our results showed that, compared to marasmus, the kwashiorkor gut microbiota was characterized by an increased proportion of Proteobacteria (culturomics, Marasmus .0%, Kwashiorkor 16.7%, p < 0.0001; metagenomics, Marasmus 14.7%, Kwashiorkor 22.0%, p = 0.001), but there was a decreased proportion of Bacteroidetes in marasmus (culturomics, Marasmus 0.8%, Kwashiorkor 6.%, p = 0.001; metagenomics, Marasmus .4%, Kwashiorkor 7.0%, p = 0.03). Fusobacterium was more frequently cultured from kwashiorkor. All detected potential pathogenic species were enriched in the kwashiorkor gut microbiota.

Our goal was to investigate whether a probiotic mixture could be used for eradication therapy in patients with prolonged intestinal EPE carriage.We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded clinical superiority trial in the south of Sweden between February 2017 and April 2019. Probiotic Vivomixx®, a mixture of 8 different living bacterial strains or placebo was given to adult outpatients intestinally colonized for at least 3 months with EPE. Patients with suspected active infections at the time of evaluation were excluded, and also those with immunosuppression, severe psychiatric disorder, drug abuse or dementia. Each patient in the probiotic arm was administered 2 sachets (9.0 × 10 live bacteria) twice daily for 2 months. The primary outcome was intestinal EPE eradication at the end of the 1-year follow-up, as shown by 3 consecutive negative EPE rectal swabs during the follow-up year. The per protocol follow-up for all patients was 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the initiation of the intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .In total, the target size of 80 patients were included. The median age was 68 years in both groups. The number of females in the  group was 23 (58%) and in the placebo group 28 (70%). At the end of the trial, 12.% ( out of 40) of the patients in the probiotic group had achieved successful eradication of EPE, as defined by the primary outcome, in the intention to treat analysis. In the placebo group, % (2 out of 40) of the patients had achieved successful eradication of EPE (odds ratio 2.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49-14.9; p 0.24).Successful EPE eradication was observed in very few individuals. This trial did not support Vivomixx® as being superior to placebo for intestinal decolonization in adult patients with chronic colonization of EPE, but was limited in power.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

A number of autoimmune, psychiatric, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders may be associated with the imbalance of gut microbiota. This study examines the effect of 21 days consumption of multistrain  on hippocampus injury, spatial and learning memory and some potential molecular mechanisms in a mouse model with cerebral hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion was established in the mouse model by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 20 min and 24 h reperfusion. Mixtures of several probiotic bacteria at concentrations of 10, 10 and 10 CFU/day were orally administrated for 3 weeks before the BCCAO. Spatial and learning memory, histological damage and apoptosis were assessed in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus 24 h after ischemia. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level were measured by ELISA technique. Prophylactic of probiotic considerably reduced the number of apoptotic cells and neuronal death in the CA1, CA3 and DG of the hippocampus at all three concentrations (P < 0.001). In addition,  reduced spatial memory impairment and neurological dysfunction only at the 10-CFU/day (P < 0.01). Nonetheless,  did not change the levels of BDNF and MDA in the hippocampus (P > 0.05).

A total of 140 five-week-old cockerels were randomly allocated to 4 experimental diets formulated to have similar energy and protein levels as follows: 1) negative control diet (CON; commercial chicken grower diet without both antibiotics and ), 2) positive control diet (ANTIB; commercial chicken grower diet with antibiotics [0.05% Coxistac and 0.04% olaquindox] but no ), 3) negative control diet plus 2. mL of  per litre of water (PROB25) and 4) negative control with .0 mL of  per litre of water (PROB50). There was a significant ( < 0.05) week and diet interaction effect on average weekly feed conversion efficiency. At 9 weeks of age, cockerels in PROB50 group had higher ( < 0.05) feed conversion efficiency than those in CON and ANTIB groups. However, 14-week-old cockerels in PROB50 group had lower ( < 0.05) feed conversion efficiency than those in ANTIB group. Treatments had no significant ( > 0.05) effect on overall feed intake, overall weight gain and haemato-biochemical parameters of cockerels. Gizzard and spleen weights were similar ( > 0.05) in PROB50, CON and PROB25 groups. Cockerels in PROB50 group had shorter ( < 0.05) small intestine than those in CON and PROB25 groups. Cockerels in PROB50 group had larger ( < 0.05) breast weight than those in PROB25 group. Cockerels in ANTIB and PROB50 groups had greater ( < 0.05) wing and thigh weights than those in CON and PROB25 groups. Shank weight was similar ( > 0.05) in PROB50, CON and ANTIB groups. Meat pH measured after 24 h of slaughter was the highest ( < 0.05) in CON and ANTIB groups followed by PROBO25 and PROB50 groups. Cockerels in CON group had lower ( < 0.05) cooking losses than those in ANTIB, PROB25 and PROB50 groups. It was concluded that  can be used in place of prophylactic antibiotics in Potchefstroom koekoek cockerels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479530>A double-blind, paralleled-arm, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trial of the effectiveness of  as an adjunct in periodontal care.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT).A double-blind, paralleled-arm, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trial was conducted.  L. reuteri or placebo lozenges were randomly prescribed for use twice-daily for 28 days. Primary outcomes were clinical attachment levels (CAL) and probing pocket depths (PPD). All participants underwent NSPT, and follow-up clinical assessments were performed at day 90 and day 180.The trial response rate was 69.% (41 out of 59). Among the test and control groups, there were significant intra-group differences in primary outcomes: CAL (both, p < .001) and PPD (both, p < .001); and in secondary outcomes: percentage of sites with 'bleeding on probing' (both, p < .001) and visible plaque (both, p < .001). There were no statistically significant inter-group differences in any outcomes at any time points (all, p > .05) nor in the changes in outcomes (∆) with time (all, p > .05). There was a trend of a greater magnitude of statistical change occurring among the test group compared to the control group.The adjunctive use of  with NSPT did not show any additional clinical effectiveness when compared to NSPT alone in the management of periodontitis (ChiCTR-IOR-17010526).© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Glucocorticoids are released in stress condition as endpoint activation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Evidence indicates a cross-talk between gut microbiota and brain function. This study assesses the effect of probiotic supplementation on behavioral functionand HPA axis action in stressed rats.The young rats born from dams exposed to noise stress (ST) during third trimester of pregnancy were used. Two groups of stressed animals were received a two-week probiotic supplementation before (pre-ST) and after (post-ST) birth. The time and distance to find hidden platform in Morris water maze were evaluated as spatial memory. Also entry to open arms in elevated plus-maze was considered as anxiety-like behaviors. The serum level of corticosterone was measured as the HPA axis function.While the stressed rats decreased entries to open arms to one third compared to the controls (CON) the probiotic treatment increased the entries by two times. The ST rats required more time and distance to find the platform than did the CON animals. The pre- and post-ST rats significantly restored the impaired behavior almost near the CON ones. While the serum corticosterone concentration increased by 50% in the ST rats it was reduced to almost normal level in the pre- and post-ST rats.Our findings confirmed a link between the gut microbiome and  with the behavioral functions and HPA axis. The probiotic treatment favorably affected the stress-dependent behavioral disorders and the interaction between HPA and gut-brain-microbiota axes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269544>Nationwide Survey for Application of ROME IV Criteria and Clinical Practice for Functional Constipation in Children.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the awareness and application of ROME IV criteria for functional constipation (FC) in real-world practices and assessed differences between pediatric gastroenterologists (PGs) and general pediatricians.A total of 239 (47.8%) out of 500 nationwide pediatricians answered a questionnaire for diagnosis and management of pediatric FC; 60 were PGs (75% of total PGs in Korea).A total of 16.6% of pediatricians were aware of the exact ROME IV criteria. Perianal examination and digital rectal examination were practiced less, with a higher tendency among PGs ( < 0.001). Treatment duration was longer among PGs for > 6 months (63.8%) than < 3 months among general pediatricians (59.2%,  < 0.001). Fecal disimpaction and rectal enema were practiced among 78.8% and 58.% of pediatricians, respectively. High dose medication for initial treatment phase was prescribed by 70.7% of pediatricians, primarily within the first 2 weeks (48.3%). The most commonly prescribed medications in children aged > 1-year were lactulose (59.1%), followed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 (17.7%), and  (11.8%). Prescription priority significantly differed between PGs and general pediatricians; lactulose or PEG 4000 were most commonly prescribed by PGs (89.7%), and lactulose or  (75.7%) were prescribed by general pediatricians ( < 0.001). For patients aged < 1-year, lactulose (41.6%) and changing formula (31.7%) were commonly prescribed. Most participants recommended diet modification, and PGs more frequently used defecation diary ( = 0.002).Discrepancies between actual practice and Rome IV criteria and between PGs and general pediatricians were observed. This survey may help construct practice guidelines and educational programs for pediatric FC.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112774>Antagonistic activity of recombinant Lactococcus lactis NZ1330 on the adhesion properties of Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infection.</a></h1><p>Death from infectious diseases has caused concerns about increases in the resistance of pathogens, impelling researchers to create novel therapeutic solutions. The management of intestinal tract problems has been the advance use of  in medicine. The aim of this study was evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesion properties of recombinant Lacotococcus lactis NZ1330 containing Ama r 2 gene, followed by the assessment of the antagonistic activity of this strain against the Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infection (UTI) in humans. For this purpose, cloning and expression of Ama r 2 gene were done. Afterwards, acid and bile resistance, which are the primary characteristics of any probiotic, were evaluated. The r-L. lactis NZ1330 was examined for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion properties against Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the potential of the recombinant strain to adhere to adenocarcinoma intestinal cell line, Caco-2 cells, as well as the antagonistic properties of r-L. lactis NZ1330 against E. coli was investigated. r-L. lactis NZ1330 was capable of surviving at low pH and different concentrations of bile salts. 40.1% hydrophobicity, 36.% auto-aggregation and 14.4% co-aggregation were observed for this strain. The adhesion level of r-L. lactis NZ1330 was .7% which was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). r-L. lactis NZ1330 was able to compete, inhibit and displace the adhesion of Escherichia coli to Caco-2 cells. r-L. lactis NZ1330 was considered to be a reliable probiotic alternative by showing these desirable properties. Results revealed that Ama r 2 gene expression had no effect on the positive probiotic properties of L. lactis NZ1330, proving this strain could be a suitable probiotic host for the expression of this allergen.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimum temperature and pH for the LP and LBr was 37°C and 6·4 respectively. The FAE exhibited a good stability at temperatures between 25 and 50°C and at pH values of ·0-7·0. The two strains and a commercial cellulase (CE) were applied as additives to alfalfa silage. After 60 days of ensiling, the lactic acid in the control and CE groups were significantly lower than those of the other treatment groups. The neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre contents in the LP group were significantly lower than those observed in the other groups. At the same time, the combination of CE and FAE-producing lactic acid bacteria synergistically improved the fermentation quality of the silage.The addition of the FAE-producing strain of L. plantarum A1 to alfalfa silage improved its fermentation quality, and reduced the fibre content of the silage.The screened homo-fermentative and FAE-producing strain of L. plantarum A1 could be a candidate strain in improving fermentation quality and fibre digestibility of ensiled forages.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415011>Gut-Brain Axis and Stress Regulation: Effects of  on Neurocognition.</a></h1><p></p></html>
