In this study, we characterized the lipid and protein composition of purified Caenorhabditis elegans lipid droplets. These lipid droplets are composed mainly of triacylglycerols, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer composed primarily of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acid composition of the triacylglycerols is rich in fatty acid species obtained from the dietary Escherichia coli, including cyclopropane fatty acids and cis-. Unlike other organisms, C. elegans lipid droplets contain very little cholesterol or cholesterol esters. Comparison of the lipid droplet proteomes of wild type and high-fat daf-2 mutant strains shows a very similar proteome in both strains, except that the most abundant protein in the C. elegans lipid droplet proteome, MDT-28, is relatively less abundant in lipid droplets isolated from daf-2 mutants. Functional analysis of lipid droplet proteins identified in our proteomic studies indicated an enrichment of proteins required for growth and fat homeostasis in C. elegans. Finally, we confirmed the localization of one of the newly identified lipid droplet proteins, ACS-4. We found that ACS-4 localizes to the surface of lipid droplets in the C. elegans intestine and skin. This study bolsters C. elegans as a model to study the dynamics and functions of lipid droplets in a multicellular organism.Copyright © 2015.

Although animal and cell studies suggest that VA and c9,t11-CLA may be hypocholesterolemic and antiatherogenic, epidemiologic data comparing rTFAs and iTFAs are inconsistent, and human intervention studies have been limited, underpowered, and not well controlled.We determined the effects of VA, c9,t11-CLA, and iTFA, in the context of highly controlled diets (24 d each), on lipoprotein risk factors compared with a control diet.We conducted a double-blind, randomized, crossover feeding trial in 106 healthy adults [mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10.8 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 28.5 ± 4.0; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 3.24 ± 0.63 mmol/L]. Diets were designed to have stearic acid replaced with the following TFA isomers (percentage of ): 0.1% mixed isomers of TFA (control), ∼3% VA, ∼3% iTFA, or 1% c9,t11-CLA. Total dietary fat (34% of ) and other macronutrients were matched. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoprotein B were higher after VA than after iTFA; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI also were higher after VA. Compared with control, VA and iTFA both increased TC, LDL cholesterol, ratio of TC to HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (2-6% change; P < 0.05); VA also increased HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a) (2-6% change; P < 0.05), whereas iTFA did not. c9,t11-CLA lowered triacylglycerol (P ≤ 0.01) and had no effect on other lipoprotein risk factors.With respect to risk of cardiovascular disease, these results are consistent with current nutrition labeling guidelines, with the requirement of VA, but not c9,t11-CLA, to be listed under TFA on the Nutrition Facts Panel.

Participants were healthy adolescents (n 54, 15-19 years, 1-90 days postpartum) practicing exclusive breastfeeding. Milk samples were collected 3 days after delivery (colostrum) and in the third month postpartum (mature milk) by hand expression. The fatty acid composition of the milk samples was determined by gas chromatography. TFA intake corresponded to 1.23 % of total  value. Total 18:2 TFA accounted for less than 0.5 % of the  intake. The amount of total 18:1 TFA (mean ± SEM) was 1.9 % ± 0.14 in colostrum and 1.5 % ± 0.2 in mature milk. The total content of n-3 PUFA was inversely correlated with the total content of 18:1 TFA in colostrum. Both in colostrum and in mature milk,  (11t-18:1) was found to be the most abundant 18:1 trans isomer, followed by elaidic acid (9t-18:1), whereas rumenic acid (9c,11t-18:2 CLA) was the predominant 18:2 trans isomer. In conclusion, the levels of TFA of industrial sources found in the mother's diet and breast milk (colostrum and mature milk) showed a decrease in relation to those observed in studies conducted prior to the TFA labeling resolution in Brazil. However, the current low intake levels of n-3 LCPUFA and DHA content in the milk of lactating adolescents may be insufficient for supporting adequate neurological development of the infants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146725>New Nordic Diet versus Average Danish Diet: A Randomized Controlled Trial Revealed Healthy Long-Term Effects of the New Nordic Diet by GC-MS Blood Plasma Metabolomics.</a></h1><p>A previous study has shown effects of the New Nordic Diet (NND) to stimulate weight loss and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in obese Danish women and men in a randomized, controlled dietary intervention study. This work demonstrates long-term metabolic effects of the NND as compared with an Average Danish Diet (ADD) in blood plasma and reveals associations between metabolic changes and health beneficial effects of the NND including weight loss. A total of 145 individuals completed the intervention and blood samples were taken along with clinical examinations before the intervention started (week 0) and after 12 and 26 weeks. The plasma metabolome was measured using GC-MS, and the final metabolite table contained 144 variables. Significant and novel metabolic effects of the diet, resulting weight loss, gender, and intervention study season were revealed using PLS-DA and ASCA. Several metabolites reflecting specific differences in the diets, especially intake of plant foods and seafood, and in  metabolism related to ketone bodies and gluconeogenesis formed the predominant metabolite pattern discriminating the intervention groups. Among NND subjects, higher levels of  and 3-hydroxybutanoic acid were related to a higher weight loss, while higher concentrations of salicylic, lactic, and N-aspartic acids and 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol were related to a lower weight loss. Specific gender and seasonal differences were also observed. The study strongly indicates that healthy diets high in fish, vegetables, fruit, and whole grain facilitated weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity by increasing ketosis and gluconeogenesis in the fasting state.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778198>The relationship of plasma Trans fatty acids with dietary inflammatory index among US adults.</a></h1><p>It has been suggested that trans fatty acids (TFAs) play an important role in cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the association between plasma TFAs and the dietary inflammatory index (DII) ™ in US adults.National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants with data on plasma TFAs measured from 1999 to 2010 were included. Energy-adjusted-DII ™ (E-DII ™) expressed per 1000 kcal was calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. All statistical analyses accounted for the survey design and sample weights.Of the 5446 eligible participants, 46.8% (n = 2550) were men. The mean age of the population was 47.1 years overall, 47.8 years for men and 46.5 years for women (p = 0.09).

The present study evaluated the effects of a high concentrate diet on milk fat and milk composition, especially, cis-9, trans-11 CLA content in milk and gene expression of lactating goats. Eight mid-lactating goats with rumen fistula were randomly assigned into a high concentrate diet (HCD) group and low concentrate diet (LCD) group. High concentrate diet feeding significantly increased lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in plasma and decreased milk fat content,  (VA) and cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk of the lactating goats. The mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein B 1c (SREBP1c), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthetase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACACA, ACCα) involving in lipid metabolism were analyzed, and ACACA and LPL all decreased in their expression level in the mammary glands of goats fed a high concentrate diet. DNA methylation rate of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) was elevated and decreased, and SCD mRNA and protein expression was reduced significantly in the mammary glands of goats fed a high concentrate diet. In conclusion, feeding a high concentrate diet to lactating goats decreases milk fat and reduced expression of SCD in the mammary gland, which finally induced cis-9, trans-11 CLA content in milk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359441>Proteomic analysis of Lactobacillus casei GCRL163 cell-free extracts reveals a SecB homolog and other biomarkers of prolonged heat stress.</a></h1><p>Prolonged heat stress is one of the harsh conditions Lactobacillus casei strains encounter as non-starter lactic acid bacteria in dairy product manufacture. To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms through which Lb. casei GCRL163 adapts to persistent elevated temperature, label-free quantitative proteomics of cell-free extracts was used to characterize the global responses of the strain cultured anaerobically in bioreactors at 30 to 45°C, pH 6.5, together with GC-MS for fatty acid methyl ester analysis at different growth phases. At higher growth temperatures, repression of -consuming metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, was observed, while PTS- and ABC-type transporter systems associated with uptake of nitrogen and carbon sources were up-regulated. Alkaline shock protein Asp23_2 was only detected at 45°C, expressed at high abundance, and presumptive α-L-fucosidase only at 40 and 45°C, with highly increased abundance (log2-fold change of 7) at 45°C. We identified a novel SecB homolog as a protein export chaperone putatively involved in posttranslational translocation systems, which was down-regulated as growth temperature increased and where the modelled 3D-structure shared architectural similarities with the Escherichia coli SecB protein. Membrane lipid analyses revealed temporal changes in fatty acid composition, cyclization of oleic acid to cyclopropane and novel cyclopentenyl moieties, and reduced synthesis of , at higher temperatures. An 18kDa α-crystallin domain, Hsp20 family heat shock protein was more highly up-regulated in response to heat stress compared to other molecular chaperones, suggesting this protein could be a useful biomarker of prolonged heat stress in Lb. casei GCRL163.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28335611>Evaluation of thioesterases from Acinetobacter baylyi for production of free fatty acids.</a></h1><p>Acinetobacter baylyi is one of few Gram-negative bacteria capable of accumulating storage lipids in the form of triacylglycerides and wax esters, which makes it an attractive candidate for production of lipophilic products, including biofuel precursors. Thioesterases play a significant dual role in the triacylglyceride and wax ester biosynthesis by either providing or removing acyl-CoA from this pathway. Therefore, 4 different thioesterase genes were cloned from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and expressed in Escherichia coli to investigate their contribution to free fatty acids (FFAs) accumulation. Overexpression of the genes tesA' (a leaderless form of the gene tesA) and tesC resulted in increased accumulation of FFAs when compared with the host E. coli strain. Overexpression of tesA' showed a 1.87-fold increase in production of long-chain fatty acids (C16 to C18) over the host strain. Unlike TesC and the other investigated thioesterases, the TesA' thioesterase also produced shorter chain FFAs (e.g., myristic acid) and unsaturated FFAs (e.g., cis- (18:1Δ11)). A comparison of the remaining 3 A. baylyi ADP1 thioesterases (encoded by the tesB, tesC, and tesD genes) revealed that only the strain containing the tesC gene produced statistically higher levels of FFAs over the control, suggesting that it possesses the acyl-ACP thioesterase activity. Both E. coli strains containing the tesB and tesD genes produced levels of FFAs similar to those of the plasmid-free control E. coli strain, which indicates that TesB and TesD lack the acyl-ACP thioesterase activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549245>Serum trans-fatty acids level are positively associated with lower food security among american adults.</a></h1><p>In the current study we aimed to assess whether the food security is associated with serum trans-fatty acids (TFAs) and dietary fat.Analyses were restricted to participants (from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) with data available on serum and diet TFAs and food security status from 2009 to 2010. All statistical analyses (analysis of covariance and linear regression) accounted for the survey design and sample weights.We included 3876 participants, overall (48.6%) participants were men, and (51.4%) were women, generally (69.0%) had high food security. Subjects with higher food security had a higher level of education as well (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted, sex-adjusted, race-adjusted, education-adjusted mean of trans 9-octadecenoic acid and trans-9, trans-12-octadecadienoic acid were higher in plasma of participants with lower food security (all p < 0.001), moreover in same model there was a significant positive association between plasma level of trans-, trans-9-octadecenoic acid and trans-9, trans-12-octadecadienoic acid and score of food security. Further, age, sex, race, education, and  intake adjusted mean of dietary fatty acids show that total polyunsaturated fatty acids are higher in subjects with higher food security (p = 0.026) while, cholesterol consumption is higher in subjects with lower food security (p = 0.039).Our findings provide more evidence on the association between food insecurity and the higher level of TFAs in serum and different type of fat in the diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262139>Conversion of dietary trans- to trans11,cis13-conjugated linoleic acid in the rat lactating mammary gland by Fatty Acid Desaturase 3-catalyzed methyl-end Δ13-desaturation.</a></h1><p>In vitro, the rat Fatty Acid Desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene was shown to code for an enzyme able to catalyze the unexpected Δ13-desaturation of trans-, producing the trans11,cis13-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer. FADS3 may therefore be the first methyl-end trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase functionally characterized in mammals, but the proof of this concept is so far lacking in vivo. The present study therefore aimed at investigating further the putative in vivo synthesis of trans11,cis13-CLA from dietary trans- in rodents. During one week of pregnancy and two weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed two diets either high (10.0% of fatty acids and 3.8% of  intake) or low (0.4% of fatty acids and 0.2% of  intake) in trans-. The trans11,cis13-CLA was specifically detected, formally identified and reproducibly quantified (0.06% of total fatty acids) in the mammary gland phospholipids of lactating female rats fed the high trans--enriched diet. This result was consistent with FADS3 mRNA expression being significantly higher in the lactating mammary gland than in the liver. Although the apparent metabolic conversion is low, this physiological evidence demonstrates the existence of this new pathway described in the lactating mammary gland and establishes the FADS3 enzyme as a reliable mammalian trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the effect of the presence of horns on the metabolome of milk serum and lipidome of milk fat, to assess the physiological effect of dehorning. Milk sampling took place at low ambient temperatures of -6 to 2°C. Horned and dehorned cows were kept in a mixed herd of Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows. The hypothesis was that horned cows needed to increase their metabolism to compensate for additional heat loss through the presence of their horns. No differences were observed in milk yield, milk solids, and somatic cell counts between horned and dehorned cows. For the milk metabolome, horned cows showed an upregulation of several glucogenic AA that could be transformed into glucose for  supply and a downregulation of sugar intermediates and γ-glutamylcysteine compared with dehorned cows. The fatty acid (FA) composition in horned cows showed a shift toward decreased odd medium-chain FA (C7:0, C9:0, and C11:0) and increased cis- (C18:1n-7 cis-11) and stearidonic acid (C18:4n-3). The changes in milk composition related to additional heat loss in horned cows indicate a competition in C3 metabolism for glucose synthesis and de novo FA synthesis under cold stress.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.
