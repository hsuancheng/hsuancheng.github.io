These free-fatty  receptors include FFA2 and FFA3, which are agonized by short-chained FFA, as well as FFA1 and FFA4, which are agonized by medium-to-long chained FFA. Ligands for FFA1 and FFA4 comprise the family of long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids including α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), suggesting that many of the long-known beneficial effects of these fats may be receptor mediated. In this regard, FFA4 has gathered considerable interest due to its role in ameliorating , promoting insulin sensitization, and regulating energy metabolism in response to FFA ligands. The goal of this review is to summarize the body of evidence in regard to FFA4 signal transduction, its mechanisms of regulation, and its functional role in a variety of tissues. In addition, recent endeavors toward discovery of small molecules that modulate FFA4 activity are also presented.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of several unsaturated fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) docosahexaenoic  (DHA), α  (ALA), linoleic  (LA), and oleic  (OA) have received much attention in past years. In addition, results from recent studies revealed that several other uncommon fatty acids (fatty acids present at a low content or else not contained in usual foods), such as furan fatty acids, -3 docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and conjugated fatty acids, also have favorable effects on cardiometabolic health. In the present report, we searched the literature in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to review the research progress on anti-CVD effect of these uncommon fatty acids. DPA has a favorable effect on cardiometabolic health in a different way to other long-chain -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC -3 PUFAs), such as EPA and DHA. Furan fatty acids and conjugated  (CLNA) may be potential bioactive fatty acids beneficial for cardiometabolic health, but evidence from intervention studies in humans is still limited, and well-designed clinical trials are required. The favorable effects of conjugated linoleic  (CLA) on cardiometabolic health observed in animal or in vitro cannot be replicated in humans. However, most intervention studies in humans concerning CLA have only evaluated its effect on cardiometabolic risk factors but not its direct effect on risk of CVD, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be required to clarify this point. However, several difficulties and limitations exist for conducting RCTs to evaluate the effect of these fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, especially the high costs for purifying the fatty acids from natural sources. This review provides a basis for better nutritional prevention and therapy of CVD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848861>Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Inhibit IL-17A Secretion through Decreased ICAM-1 Expression in T Cells Co-Cultured with Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Harvested from Adipose Tissues of Obese Subjects.</a></h1><p>Obese adipose tissue (AT) is infiltrated by inflammatory immune cells including IL-17A-producing-T (Th17) cells. It has been previously demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells from obese (ob-ASCs), but not lean AT promote Th17 cells. Because n-3 PUFAs are known to inhibit obese AT , it is tested here whether they could inhibit ob-ASC-mediated IL-17A secretion.The n-3 PUFA precursor,  (ALA), or its derivatives, eicosapentaenoic, or docosahexaenoic , is added to co-cultures of human ob-ASCs and mononuclear cells (MNCs). All three inhibited IL-17A, but not IL-1β, IL-6, nor TNFα  secretion. As a control, palmitic  (PA), a saturated fatty , did not inhibit IL-17A secretion. ALA also inhibited IL-17A secretion mediated by adipocytes differentiated from ob-ASCs. Toll-like-receptor 4 is shown to be involved in ob-ASC-mediated-IL-17A secretion, and to be inhibited by ALA, together with Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 and Signal-Transducer-and-Activator-of-transcription-3. In addition, ALA down-regulated Intercellular-Adhesion-Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in both monocytes and ASCs, which resulted in decreased interactions between ob-ASCs and MNCs, and inhibition of IL-17A secretion.It is demonstrated herein that ALA inhibits Th17 cell promotion, through decreased ICAM-1expression in both ob-ASCs and monocytes. This novel mechanism may contribute to explain the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA in IL-17A-related inflammatory pathologies.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Oxylipins are a class of biologically active metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that have been linked to a number of diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMSO on oxylipin levels in mouse liver. Liver tissue from male mice (C57Bl6/N) that were either untreated or injected with 1% DMSO at 18 weeks of age was analyzed for oxylipin levels using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A decrease in oxylipin diols from linoleic  (LA, C18:2n6),  (ALA, C18:3n3) and docosahexeanoic  (DHA, C22:6n3) was observed 2 h after injection with DMSO. In contrast, DMSO had no effect on the epoxide precursors or other oxylipins including those derived from arachidonic  (C20:4n6) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n3). It also did not significantly affect the diol:epoxide ratio, suggesting a pathway distinct from, and potentially complementary to, soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHI). Since oxylipins have been associated with a wide array of pathological conditions, from arthritis pain to obesity, our results suggest one potential mechanism underlying the apparent beneficial health effects of DMSO. They also indicate that caution should be used in the interpretation of results using DMSO as a vehicle in animal experiments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378407>Molecular cloning and functional characterization of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5), and its expression in response to the ratio of  to linoleic  in diets of large yellow croaker (Larmichthys crocea).</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to clone and functionally characterize a full-length cDNA encoding arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) from large yellow croaker (Larmichthys crocea) and investigate its gene expression in response to graded dietary ratio of  (ALA) to linoleic  (LNA) (0.03, 0.06, 0.45, 0.90 and 1.51). An isolated 2372bp cDNA clone of Alox5 contained an open reading frame spanning 2025bp encoding a protein with the ability to modify arachidonate  (AA) to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (5-HETE). In the liver, the Alox5 mRNA expression levels significantly increased to the maximum when the dietary ALA/LNA increased from 0.03 to 0.06, and then significantly decreased with dietary ALA/LNA increased to 1.51 (P<0.05). In the kidney, the expression levels of Alox5 of fish fed diets with low dietary ALA/LNA (0.03-0.06) were significantly higher than those of fish fed diets with high dietary ALA/LNA (0.45-1.51) (P<0.05). The dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) could act on cognate cis-acting elements in the promoter of Alox5 and increased the transcription of Alox5. Results of the present study suggested that the expression of Alox5 is higher in croakers fed high concentrations of LNA compared to those fed high concentrations of ALA, which might be regulated by NF-κB and contribute to the  process by catalyzing the dioxygenation of AA.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the adipose tissue of these SRD-fed rats, the present study analyzed the possible beneficial effects of dietary Salba (chia) seeds in improving or reversing the depletion of antioxidant defenses, changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production.Wistar rats were fed a SRD for 3 months. After that, half of the animals continued with the SRD until month 6, while in the other half, corn oil was replaced by chia seeds for 3 months (SRD + chia). A reference group consumed a control diet all the time.Compared with the SRD-fed rats, the animals fed a SRD + chia showed a reduction in epididymal fat pad weight; the activities of antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD and GPx returned to control values, while GR significantly improved; mRNA GPx increased, and both mRNA SOD and the redox state of glutathione returned to control values; a significant increase in the expression of Nrf2 was recorded. These results were accompanied by a decrease in XO activity and ROS contents as well as plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels. Chia seeds reversed the decrease in PPARγ protein mass level and increased the n-3/n-6 fatty acids ratio of membrane phospholipids. Besides, dyslipidemia and insulin sensitivity were normalized.This study provides new information concerning some mechanisms related to the beneficial effects of dietary chia seeds in reversing adipose tissue oxidative stress and improving the adipose tissue dysfunction induced by a SRD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404455>A High Linoleic  Diet does not Induce  in Mouse Liver or Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Recently, the pro-inflammatory effects of linoleic  (LNA) have been re-examined. It is now becoming clear that relatively few studies have adequately assessed the effects of LNA, independent of obesity. The purpose of this work was to compare the effects of several fat-enriched but non-obesigenic diets on  to provide a more accurate assessment of LNA's ability to induce . Specifically, 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were fed either saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), LNA, or  enriched diets (50 % Kcal from fat, 22 % wt/wt) for 4 weeks. Chow and high-fat, hyper-caloric diets were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant markers from epididymal fat, liver, and plasma were measured along with food intake and body weights. Mice fed the high SFA, MUFA, and high-fat diets exhibited increased pro-inflammatory markers in liver and adipose tissue; however, mice fed LNA for four weeks did not display significant changes in pro-inflammatory or pro-coagulant markers in epididymal fat, liver, or plasma. The present study demonstrates that LNA alone is insufficient to induce . Instead, it is more likely that hyper-caloric diets are responsible for diet-induced  possibly due to adipose tissue remodeling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26941581>Dietary Flaxseed Mitigates Impaired Skeletal Muscle Regeneration: in Vivo, in Vitro and in Silico Studies.</a></h1><p>Diets enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to exert a positive impact on muscle diseases. Flaxseed is one of the richest sources of n-3 PUFA  α- (ALA). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of flaxseed and ALA in models of skeletal muscle degeneration characterized by high levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF).The in vivo studies were carried out on dystrophic hamsters affected by muscle damage associated with high TNF plasma levels and fed with a long-term 30% flaxseed-supplemented diet. Differentiating C2C12 myoblasts treated with TNF and challenged with ALA represented the in vitro model. Skeletal muscle morphology was scrutinized by applying the Principal Component Analysis statistical method. Apoptosis,  and myogenesis were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Finally, an in silico analysis was carried out to predict the possible pathways underlying the effects of n-3 PUFAs.The flaxseed-enriched diet protected the dystrophic muscle from apoptosis and preserved muscle myogenesis by increasing the myogenin and alpha myosin heavy chain. Moreover, it restored the normal expression pattern of caveolin-3 thereby allowing protein retention at the sarcolemma. ALA reduced TNF-induced apoptosis in differentiating myoblasts and prevented the TNF-induced inhibition of myogenesis, as demonstrated by the increased expression of myogenin, myosin heavy chain and caveolin-3, while promoting myotube fusion. The in silico investigation revealed that FAK pathways may play a central role in the protective effects of ALA on myogenesis.These findings indicate that flaxseed may exert potent beneficial effects by preserving skeletal muscle regeneration and homeostasis partly through an ALA-mediated action. Thus, dietary flaxseed and ALA may serve as a useful strategy for treating patients with muscle dystrophies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30505053>The effect of  and α- on oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</a></h1><p>Various pharmacological effects including antioxidant property of  L. were reported previously. In the present study, the effect of the extract of the plant and its constituent, α- (ALA), on oxidant and antioxidant markers of PHA/non-stimulated human mononuclear cells was evaluated.The effect of 10, 40, and 160 μg/ml of  and 5, 15, and 45 μg/ml of ALA or dexamethasone (0.1 mM) on nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), total thiol (SH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the supernatant of phytohemagglutinin-A (PHA)- and nonstimulated lymphocytes was examined ( = 6 for each group).In nonstimulated cells, dexamethasone, high concentration of the extract (160 μg/ml), and ALA (45 μg/ml) significantly increased thiol, CAT, and SOD values. Dexamethasone and high concentration of ALA significantly reduced MDA value ( < 0.01 to  < 0.001). However, the levels of NO and MDA due to dexamethasone and 160 μg/ml of the extract and 15 and 45 μg/ml of ALA treatment were also reduced in PHA-stimulated cells ( < 0.001 for all cases). Treatment of stimulated lymphocyte by dexamethasone and two higher concentrations of the extract and ALA also leads to increased levels of thiol, CAT, and SOD ( < 0.05 to  < 0.001). and ALA, as well as dexamethasone, decreased NO and MDA levels but increased antioxidant agents in human lymphocytes.

The eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, ω-3:20-5), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, ω-3:22-6) and  (ALA, ω-3:18-3) are known ω-3 fatty acids, extracted from animal (e.g fish oil) and plant sources (e.g flaxseed oil). Furthermore, linoleic  (LA, ω-6:18-2) is recognized as ω-6 fatty  and the most prominent biological fatty  with a pro-inflammatory response. Flaxseed oil has variety of biological roles, due to the significant amount of ω-3/ω-6 fatty acids. Numerous studies have reported that ALA (ω-3:18-3) and LA (ω-6:18-2) has diverse pharmacological activities. The ALA (ω-3:18-3) and LA (ω-6:18-2) are recognised to be the pharmacological antagonist. For example, ALA (ω-3:18-3) is recognised as anti-inflammatory, whereas LA (ω-6:18-2) is considered to be pro-inflammatory. PUFA's get oxidized in three ways; firstly, free radical-mediated pathway, secondly non-free radical non-enzymatic metabolism, and lastly enzymatic degradation. The present report is an attempt to summarize various modes of PUFA's metabolism and elaborate biological effects of the associated metabolites concerning flaxseed oil.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, these bioactivities have been hampered by chemical instability, poor water solubility, rapid metabolism, and low bioavailability of PAP. Therefore, this study was aimed at optimizing the liposomal formulation of Triacylglycerol-bound punicic  with its regioisomers (TPAR) for improved oral bioavailability and increased hepatoprotection through antioxidation and anti-. Herein, the optimized TPAR nanoliposome (TPAR-NL) was developed using thin-film dispersion method and subsequently characterized with appropriate indices. The optimized TPAR-NL produced fairly stable spherical nanoparticles (˂ 200 nm) with encapsulation efficiency (%EE) of 85.77%, as well as enhanced in vitro release and improved oral bioavailability. The TPAR-NL exhibited profound antihepatotoxic effect in mice pretreated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl ) via reduction of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels compared with free TPAR. The TPAR-loaded liposome also significantly reduced oxidative stress by increasing superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels while lowering malonaldehyde concentration compared with the free TPAR. The TPAR-LNF further exhibited remarkable anti-inflammatory activity compared with the free drug via inhibition of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha generation.

It has been implicated that various fatty acids exert different effects on food intake and body weight. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of linoleic  (LA) and stearic  (SA) on agouti-related protein (AgRP) expression and secretion in immortalized mouse hypothalamic N38 cells and to explore the likely underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that LA inhibited, while SA stimulated AgRP expression and secretion of N38 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, LA suppressed the protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphorylation levels of JNK and IKKα/β, suggesting the inhibition of TLR4-dependent  pathway. However, the above mentioned inhibitory effects of LA were eliminated by TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast, SA promoted TLR4 protein expression and activated TLR4-dependent  pathway, with elevated ratio of p-JNK/JNK. While TLR4 siRNA reversed the stimulatory effects of SA on AgRP expression and TLR4-dependent . Moreover, we found that TLR4 was also involved in LA-enhanced and SA-impaired leptin/insulin signal pathways in N38 cells. In conclusion, our findings indicated that LA elicited inhibitory while SA exerted stimulatory effects on AgRP expression and secretion via TLR4-dependent  and leptin/insulin pathways in N38 cells.

This over-simplified interpretation is confounded by a failure to account for conversion of the parent FA (LA and ALA) to longer-chain bioactive products (AA and EPA/DHA, respectively), thereby precluding discernment of the immunomodulatory potential of specific FA. Therefore, we utilized the Δ6-desaturase model, wherein knockout mice (D6KO) lack the Fads2 gene encoding for the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates FA metabolism, thereby providing a model to determine specific FA immunomodulatory effects. Wild-type (WT) and D6KO mice were fed one of four isocaloric diets differing in FA source (9weeks): corn oil (LA-enriched), arachidonic  single cell oil (AA-enriched), flaxseed oil (ALA-enriched) or menhaden fish oil (EPA/DHA-enriched). Splenic mononuclear cell cytokine production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), T-cell receptor (TCR) and anti-CD40 stimulation was determined. Following LPS stimulation, AA was more bioactive compared to LA, by increasing inflammatory cytokine production of IL-6 (1.2-fold) and TNFα (1.3-fold). Further, LPS-stimulated IFNγ production in LA-fed D6KO mice was reduced 5-fold compared to LA-fed WT mice, indicating that conversion of LA to AA was necessary for cytokine production. Conversely, ALA exerted an independent immunomodulatory effect from EPA/DHA and all n-3 FA increased LPS-stimulated IL-10 production versus LA and AA. These data definitively identify specific immunomodulatory effects of individual FA and challenge the simplified view of the immunomodulatory effects of n-3 and n-6 FA.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Pharmacotherapies that moderate  in ARDS are lacking. Several trials have evaluated the effects of pharmaconutrients, given as part of a feeding formula or as a nutritional supplement, on clinical outcomes in critical illness and ARDS.To systematically review and critically appraise available evidence on the effects of immunonutrition compared to standard non-immunonutrition formula feeding on mechanically ventilated adults (aged 18 years or older) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, conference proceedings, and trial registries for appropriate studies up to 25 April 2018. We checked the references from published studies and reviews on this topic for potentially eligible studies.We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing immunonutrition versus a control or placebo nutritional formula in adults (aged 18 years or older) with ARDS, as defined by the Berlin definition of ARDS or, for older studies, by the American-European Consensus Criteria for both ARDS and acute lung injury.Two review authors independently assessed the quality of studies and extracted data from the included trials. We sought additional information from study authors. We performed statistical analysis according to Cochrane methodological standards. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilator days, indices of oxygenation, cardiac adverse events, gastrointestinal adverse events, and total number of adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.We identified 10 randomized controlled trials with 1015 participants. All studies compared an enteral formula or additional supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA)), gamma- (GLA), and antioxidants. We assessed some of the included studies as having high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings. Studies were heterogenous in nature and varied in several ways, including type and duration of interventions given, calorific targets, and reported outcomes. All studies reported mortality. For the primary outcome, study authors reported no differences in all-cause mortality (longest period reported) with the use of an immunonutrition enteral formula or additional supplements of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07; participants = 1015; studies = 10; low-quality evidence).For secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants reduces ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -3.09 days. 95% CI -5.19 to -0.99; participants = 639; studies = 8; very low-quality evidence) and ventilator days (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.77 to -0.71; participants = 581; studies = 7; very low-quality evidence). We are also uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improve oxygenation, defined as ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO₂) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂), at day 4 (MD 39 mmHg, 95% CI 10.75 to 67.02; participants = 676; studies = 8), or whether they increase adverse events such as cardiac events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.09 to 8.46; participants = 339; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), gastrointestinal events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75; participants = 427; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence), or total adverse events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.23; participants = 517; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence).This meta-analysis of 10 studies of varying quality examined effects of omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants in adults with ARDS. This intervention may produce little or no difference in all-cause mortality between groups. We are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improves the duration of ventilator days and ICU length of stay or oxygenation at day 4 due to the very low quality of evidence. Adverse events associated with immunonutrition are also uncertain, as confidence intervals include the potential for increased cardiac, gastrointestinal, and total adverse events.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29426270>Evening primrose oil and labour, is it effective?

There was no significant difference between the two groups according to gestational age at delivery, need for induction or augmentation of labour, duration of different stages of labour, neonatal weight and Apgar scores, and the indications for hospital admission. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Evening primrose oil has been used for the treatment of systemic disorders, which are accompanied with chronic  such as atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Also, it has been proposed for some women's health conditions including breast pain (mastalgia), symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and menopausal symptoms, cervical ripening and induction or augmentation of labour. What do the results of this study add? Evening primrose oil does not have any impact on Bishop Score and the duration of different stages of labour. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? According to the present study and the other performed studies, there is not enough evidence confirming effectiveness of Evening primrose oil for cervical ripening and duration of labour. It is suggested that pending further data its usage should be limited to experimental RCTs and its use in clinical practice should be prevented. Also, different routes of administration and different dosages should be investigated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26396384>Diet containing partially hydrogenated vegetable fat enhances the carrageenan induced paw  but not oxidative stress markers in liver of rats.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of feeding Partially hydrogenated vegetable fat (PHVF) on carrageenan induced paw  and oxidative stress markers in liver of rats. In addition, the effect of feeding rats with Linseed Oil (LSO, α-, n-3 PUFA) or PHVF blended with incremental amounts of LSO on these markers were also monitored. Rats weighing 200 g were given 1 mL of different oils (PHVF, Groundnut Oil; GNO, Olive Oil; OO and LSO) per day for 15 days. Rats given PHVF showed higher levels of paw  in response to carrageenan injection. Rats given LSO showed least amounts of paw  when injected with carrageenan. A second set of experiment was conducted by feeding weaning rats with AIN-93 purified diet supplemented with PHVF or PHVF with incremental amounts of LSO for 60 days. The rats fed PHVF showed higher degree of carrageenan induced  as compared to rats given GNO and LSO. However, the rats fed PHVF showed lower levels of lipid peroxides, protein carbonyls, 8-hydroxy guanine and antioxidant enzyme activities in liver homogenate as compared to those given LSO. In conclusion dietary PHVF rendered the rats prone to higher levels of carrageenan induced  which can be reduced by giving PHVF blended with LSO. However, oxidative stress markers found to be higher levels in rats given LSO or PHVF blended with LSO as compared to rats given PHVF as sole source of fat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233142>Role of disturbed fatty acids metabolism in the pathophysiology of diabetic erectile dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (VED) is considered as a common complication among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We tested whether changes in fatty  (FAs) classes measured in erythrocytes are associated with increased risk of diabetic VED along with related risk factors.We assessed erythrocyte FAs composition, lipid peroxidation parameters and inflammatory cytokines among 72 T2D men with VED, 78 T2D men without VED and 88 healthy volunteers with similar age. Biochemical, hepatic, lipid and hormonal profiles were measured.T2D people with VED had significant decrease in the indexes of Δ6-desaturase and elongase activities compared to the other studied groups. The same group of participants displayed lower erythrocytes levels of dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6) (P < .001), precursor of the messenger molecule PGE1 mainly involved in promoting erection. Moreover, absolute SFAs concentration and HOMA IR levels were higher in T2D people with VED when compared to controls and associated with impaired NO concentration (1.43 vs 3.30 ng/L, P < .001). Our results showed that IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly increased and positively correlated with MDA levels only in T2D people with VED (r = 0.884, P = .016 and r = 0.753, P = .035; respectively) suggesting a decrease in the relative availability of vasodilator mediators and an activation of vasoconstrictors release.Our findings show that the deranged FAs metabolism represents a potential marker of VED in progress, or at least an indicator of increased risk within men with T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27642591>Perilla Oil Supplementation Ameliorates High-Fat/High-Cholesterol Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Rats via Enhanced Fecal Cholesterol and Bile  Excretion.</a></h1><p>Recent experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that hepatic cholesterol metabolic disorders are closely related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The main goal of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the perilla oil rich in  (ALA) against NASH and gain a deep insight into its potential mechanisms. Rats were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFD) supplement with perilla oil (POH) for 16 weeks. Routine blood biochemical tests and histological staining illustrated that the perilla oil administration improved HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, reduced hepatic steatosis, and inhibited hepatic inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. Perilla oil also increased fecal bile  and cholesterol excretion. Hepatic RNA-Seq analysis found that the long time perilla oil supplement notably modified the gene expression involved in cholesterol metabolism. Our results implicate that, after long-term high level dietary cholesterol feeding, rat liver endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and cholesterol-rich low density lipoprotein uptake was significantly inhibited, and perilla oil did not modulate expression of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis but did increase cholesterol removed from hepatocytes by conversion to bile acids and increased fecal cholesterol excretion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28301958>Unlocking the in vitro anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic potential of Polygonum maritimum.</a></h1><p>Several Polygonum species (Polygonaceae) are used in traditional medicine in Asia, Europe and Africa to treat  and diabetes.Evaluate the in vitro antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic potential of methanol and dichloromethane extracts of leaves and roots of the halophyte Polygonum maritimum L.Antioxidant activity was determined (up to 1 mg/mL) as radical-scavenging activity (RSA) of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic ) (ABTS), copper (CCA) and iron (ICA) chelating activities and iron reducing power (FRAP). NO production was measured in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages for 24 h at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL and antidiabetic potential was assessed by α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition (up to 10 mg/mL) assays. The phytochemical composition of the extracts was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The methanol leaf extract had the highest activity against DPPH• (IC = 26 μg/mL) and ABTS• (IC = 140 μg/mL), FRAP (IC = 48 μg/mL) and CCA (IC = 770 μg/mL). Only the dichloromethane leaf extract (LDCM) showed anti-inflammatory activity (IC = 48 μg/mL). The methanol root (IC = 19 μg/mL) and leaf (IC = 29 μg/mL) extracts strongly inhibited baker's yeast α-glucosidase, but LDCM had higher rat's α-glucosidase inhibition (IC = 2527 μg/mL) than acarbose (IC = 4638 μg/mL). GC-MS analysis identified β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 1-octacosanol and  as possible molecules responsible for the observed bioactivities.Our findings suggest P. maritimum as a source of high-value health promoting commodities for alleviating symptoms associated with oxidative and inflammatory diseases, including diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26422255>Dependency of Phytoprostane Fingerprints of Must and Wine on Viticulture and Enological Processes.</a></h1><p>Wine is one of the most consumed alcoholic beverages around the world. Red wine has demonstrated several benefits for health maintenance. One group of potential anti-inflammatory compounds is the phytoprostanes, oxidative degradation products of . The aim of the present study was to measure, for the first time, the phytoprostane content in wine and must by an UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS method after solid-phase extraction. The data showed two predominant classes of phytoprostanes: F1- and D1-phytoprostane series. In wines, the total phytoprostane concentration ranged from 134.1 ± 2.3 to 216.2 ± 3.06 ng/mL. Musts showed concentrations between 21.4 ± 0.8 and 447.1 ± 15.8 ng/mL. The vinification and aging procedures for the production of wine seem to influence the final phytoprostane levels in red wine and to modify the phytoprostane profile. The high concentrations observed and previous reports on anti-inflammatory effects of phytoprostanes make further research on the benefits of phytoprostanes more important.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241993>Arachidonic  and lipoxinA4 attenuate streptozotocin-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5 F cells in vitro and type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in vivo.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to observe whether polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can protect rat insulinoma (RIN5 F) cells against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced apoptosis in vitro and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 DM (T2DM) in vivo and if so, what would be the mechanism of this action.RIN5 F cells were used for the in vitro study, whereas the in vivo study was performed in Wistar rats. STZ was used to induce apoptosis of RIN5 F cells in vitro and T1- and T2DM in vivo. The effect of PUFAs: γ- (GLA), arachidonic  (AA) of ω-6 series, and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) of ω-3 series; cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors and antiinflammatory metabolite of AA and DHA, lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and resolvin D2 and protectin, respectively against STZ-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5 F cells in vitro and LXA4 against T1- and T2DM in vivo was studied. Changes in the antioxidant content, lipid peroxides, nitric oxide, and expression of PDX1, P65, nuclear factor-κb (NF-κb), and IKB genes in STZ-treated RIN5 F cells in vitro and Nrf2, GLUT2, COX2, iNOS protein levels in the pancreatic tissue of T1- and T2DM and LPCLN2 (lipocalin 2), NF-κb, IKB I in adipose tissue of T2DM after LXA4 treatment were studied. Plasma glucose, insulin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels also were measured in STZ-induced T1- and T2DM Wistar rats.Among all PUFAs tested, AA and EPA are the most effective against STZ-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5 F cells in vitro. Neither COX nor LOX inhibitors blocked the cytoprotective action of AA in vitro and T1- and T2DM by STZ. LXA4 production by RIN5 F cells in vitro and plasma LXA4 levels in STZ-induced T1- and T2DM animals were decreased by STZ that reverted to normal after AA treatment. AA prevented both T1- and T2DM induced by STZ. Antiinflammatory metabolite of AA and LXA4 prevented both T1- and T2DM induced by STZ. The expression of Pdx1, NF-κb, IKB genes in the pancreas and plasma TNF-α levels in T1- and T2DM; Nrf2, Glut2, COX2, and iNOS proteins in pancreatic tissue of T1DM and LPCLN2, NF-κb, IKB I in adipose tissue of T2DM reverted to normal in LXA4-treated animals.Both AA and LXA4 prevented STZ-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5 F cells in vitro and T1- and T2DM in vivo, suggesting that these two bioactive lipids may function as antidiabetic molecules. AA is beneficial against STZ-induced cytotoxicity and T1- and T2DM by enhancing the production of LXA4.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Through the measurement of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), oxidative stress, and  status in liver and heart tissues of apolipoprotein E (ApoE  ), mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) or HFD with oat bran (HFD + Oat) were investigated. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), PUFA and over 40 types of its oxidized products were assessed. The HFD + Oat group had augmented adrenic  (ADA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and suppressed n-3 docosapentaenoic  levels in the liver tissues compared to the HFD group. Arachidonic  (ARA) and α- (ALA) levels were elevated and ADA was suppressed in the heart tissues of the HFD + Oat group compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, enzymatically mediated oxidized ARA product levels (9-, 11- and 20-HETE [hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ], and PGF ) were augmented and those of the oxidized DHA products (4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, and 14-HDHA [hydroxy-docosahexaenoic ]) were reduced in the liver tissues of the HFD + Oat group. It also increased 17-F -dihomo-isoprostane and 7-F -dihomo-isofuran derived from nonenzymatic oxidation of ADA in the heart and liver tissues, and those from ALA namely 16-F -phytoprostane and 16(RS)-13-epi-STΔ -9-phytofuran. Our study showed oat bran to be a weak antioxidant and lacked anti-inflammatory properties in atherosclerotic mice. Elevation of oxidized PUFA products that are potentially proinflammatory and vasoconstrictors (HETE, PGF ) with simultaneous reduction of those that are anti-inflammatory (HDHA) may not be desirable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26111478>Phospholipid Incorporation of Non-Methylene-Interrupted Fatty Acids (NMIFA) in Murine Microglial BV-2 Cells Reduces Pro-Inflammatory Mediator Production.</a></h1><p>Sciadonic  (SCA), pinolenic  (PNA), and Δ7-eicosatrienoic  (Δ7-ETrA) are three non-methylene-interrupted fatty acids (NMIFA). Using murine microglial BV-2 cells, this study determined how NMIFA incorporation modulated phospholipid fatty  composition and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Each NMIFA was rapidly taken up and incorporated in BV-2 cells, resulting in the differential redistribution of total lipids. The cellular phospholipid fatty  compositions were altered, and a significant decrease in the proportions of total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was observed while the proportions of NMIFA and its metabolites accounted for 38% of the fatty  total. Incubation of microglial cells with NMIFA suppressed production of LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the over-expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and type 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2). These inhibitory effects could be accounted for, in part, by the inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling.

However, fat-1 transgenic mice can synthesize omega-3 PUFAs from omega-6 PUFAs without dietary supplementation of omega-3, leading to abundant omega-3 PUFA accumulation in various tissues. In this study, we used fat-1 transgenic mice to investigate the role of omega-3 PUFAs in response to inflammatory pain. A high omega-3 PUFA tissue content attenuated formalin-induced pain sensitivity, microglial activation, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and the phosphorylation of NR2B, a subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Our findings suggest that elevated omega-3 PUFA levels inhibit NMDA receptor activity in the spinal dorsal horn and modulate inflammatory pain transmission by regulating signal transmission at the spinal dorsal horn, leading to the attenuation of chemically induced inflammatory pain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993723> ameliorates bronchial asthma features in ovalbumin-sensitized rats.</a></h1><p>Effect of  (ALA) against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced , oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and pathological features was examined in rat.Total and differential WBC count and oxidant/antioxidant levels in BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) as well as lung pathological features were investigated in five groups of rats including controls (group C), rats sensitized with OVA (group S) and S treated with either ALA (0.2 and 0.4 mg/ml) or dexamethasone.As compared to group C, in OVA-sensitized rats, increases in WBC counts, levels of oxidant biomarkers and most pathological scores were observed while lymphocyte percentage and antioxidants levels decreased.

The dynamics of the inflammatory response and the oxidative stress was indicated by measuring plasma concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, serum amyloid A and malondialdehyde before, 24h after stent implantation. The multiple linear regression analysis was preceded by an exploratory data analysis, principal component analysis, factor analysis and cluster analysis, which proved a hidden internal relation of 37 fatty acids. The concentration of cerotic  (C26:0) has been positively associated with an increase of malondialdehyde concentration after stent implantation, while the concentrations of tetracosatetraenoic (C24:4 N6) and nonadecanoic (C19:0) acids were associated with decrease of lipoperoxidation. The increase of interleukin-6 during the 24h after implantation was associated with higher levels of pentadecanoic  (C15:0) and lower levels of α- (C18:3 N3). Regression models found several significant fatty acids at which the strength of the parameter β for each fatty  on selected markers of C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, interleukin-6 and serum amyloid A was estimated. Parameter β testifies to the power of the positive or negative relationship of the fatty  concentration on the concentration of selected markers. The influencing effect of the cerotic  (C26:0) concentration in plasma phospholipids exhibiting parameter β=140.4 is, for example, 3.5 times higher than this effect of n-3 tetracosapentaenoic  (C24:5 N3) with β=40.0.

In this short review, the antimicrobial actions of various polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, mainly free acids) and their putative mechanisms of action are described. In general, PUFAs kill microbes by their direct action on microbial cell membranes, enhancing generation of free radicals, augmenting the formation of lipid peroxides that are cytotoxic, and by increasing the formation of their bioactive metabolites, such as prostaglandins, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins that enhance the phagocytic action of leukocytes and macrophages. Higher intakes of α- and cis-linoleic acids (ALA and LA respectively) and fish (a rich source of eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) might reduce the risk pneumonia. Previously, it was suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): linoleic, α-, γ- (GLA), dihomo-GLA (DGLA), arachidonic (AA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) function as endogenous anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and immunomodulating agents. A variety of bacteria are sensitive to the growth inhibitory actions of LA and ALA . Hydrolyzed linseed oil can kill methicillin-resistant . Both LA and AA have the ability to inactivate herpes, influenza, Sendai, and Sindbis virus within minutes of contact. AA, EPA, and DHA induce death of  both  and . Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostaglandin A (PGA), derived from DGLA, AA, and EPA inhibit viral replication and show anti-viral activity. Oral mucosa, epidermal cells, lymphocytes and macrophages contain and release significant amounts of PUFAs on stimulation. PUFAs stimulate NADPH-dependent superoxide production by macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes to kill the invading microorganisms. Cytokines induce the release of PUFAs from cell membrane lipid pool, a potential mechanism for their antimicrobial action. AA, EPA, and DHA give rise to lipoxins (LXs), resolvins, protectins, and maresins that limit and resolve  and have antimicrobial actions. Thus, PUFAs and their metabolites have broad antimicrobial actions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279702>Analysis of Time-Series Gene Expression Data to Explore Mechanisms of Chemical-Induced Hepatic Steatosis Toxicity.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from simple fatty liver through steatosis with  and necrosis to cirrhosis. One of the most challenging problems in biomedical research and within the chemical industry is to understand the underlying mechanisms of complex disease, and complex adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Based on a set of 28 steatotic chemicals with gene expression data measured on primary hepatocytes at three times (2, 8, and 24 h) and three doses (low, medium, and high), we identified genes and pathways, defined as molecular initiating events (MIEs) and key events (KEs) of steatosis using a combination of a time series and pathway analyses. Among the genes deregulated by these compounds, the study highlighted OSBPL9, ALDH7A1, MYADM, SLC51B, PRDX6, GPAT3, TMEM135, DLGDA5, BCO2, APO10LA, TSPAN6, NEURL1B, and DUSP1. Furthermore, pathway analysis indicated deregulation of pathways related to lipid accumulation, such as fat digestion and absorption, linoleic and  metabolism, calcium signaling pathway, fatty  metabolism, peroxisome, retinol metabolism, and steroid metabolic pathways in a time dependent manner.

The aim of this review is to examine the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation at reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents. Medline, Cinahl+, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Embase were searched for trials investigating the effects of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents with ADHD. The primary outcome measure was a mean difference in Conners' rating scale (CRS) between the intervention and placebo group. Search terms used include ADHD, omega-3, fish oils, eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic acids,  and Conners' rating scale. Randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents as measured by CRS were included. Studies using a combination of polyunsaturated fatty acids or any other rating scale were excluded. Seven trials were included in this review, totalling 926 participants. We found no evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity between trials. Overall, there was a slightly greater reduction in CRS score in favour of the experiment group. One study found a greater reduction in score in favour of the placebo group. Neither findings were statistically significant. There is little supportive evidence to validate the claim of omega-3 supplementation to reduce the degree of ADHD symptoms experienced by children and adolescents.

To determine why consumption of ω-3 fatty  is associated with lower risk of CVD, we investigated the biological functions of ω-6 (linoleic ) and ω-3 () in reconstituted HDL (rHDL) after encapsulation using human cells and zebrafish embryo. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the principal protein behind the beneficial functions of HDL, which include potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherosclerotic activities in blood. Several rHDLs were synthesized with apoA-I and different molar ratio of ω-6 or ω-3 fatty . Both fatty acids showed similar solubility in rHDL up to a molar ratio of 95:5:1:10 (palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:apoA-I:fatty ). Although both rHDL showed similar structural properties and α-helical contents, ω-6-rHDL showed loss of anti-oxidant ability against LDL oxidation. Uptake of acetylated LDL into macrophages was inhibited by ω-3-rHDL but not ω-6-rHDL, suggesting that ω-6-rHDL has higher pro-atherosclerotic activity. ω-3-rHDL showed more enhanced cholesterol efflux activity with less accumulation of triglyceride in the macrophage. ω-6-rHDL caused more senescence in human dermal fibroblast cells with cytotoxicity, while ω-3-rHDL treatment inhibited the senescence. In zebrafish embryo survivability, ω-3-rHDL-injected embryos showed 86±3% survival, whereas ω-6-rHDL-injected ones showed 72±2% survival as well as an elevated inflammatory response in zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, ω-6-rHDL and ω-3-rHDL show different physiological activities in atherosclerosis, , and cellular senescence.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate  processes and energy metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and oleic acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies.

Hence, in this study, we assessed the implications of aging, hyperglycemia, and also the dietary effect of n-3 fatty acids (α- (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) + docosahexaenoic  (DHA)) on OS and  in dyslipidemic rats. Dyslipidemia was induced in young and aged rats by feeding high-fat lard (HFL) diet. Diabetes was induced in young dyslipidemic rats by administering streptozotocin 30 days after the induction of dyslipidemia. Experimental groups received diets containing canola oil (HF + CNO) and fish oil (HF + FO) as a source of ALA and EPA + DHA respectively. After 60 days of feeding rats with their respective diets, OS and inflammatory markers in serum were assessed. Dyslipidemia caused significant (p < 0.05) increase in OS (lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and protein carbonyl), pro-inflammatory cytokine (CRP, IL-1β, MCP-1, and TNF-α), and eicosanoid (PGE, LTB, and LTC) level in serum of both young and aged rats. Aged dyslipidemic rats presented significantly (p < 0.05) higher level of these markers compared to young dyslipidemic rats. Hyperglycemia onset further augmented OS and inflammatory markers in young dyslipidemic rats significantly (p < 0.05). Administration of n-3 fatty acids downregulated the serum markers of OS and  in all the three experimental models. Thus, aging and hyperglycemia onset intensified dyslipidemia-induced OS and . Dietary preformed EPA + DHA presented larger restorative potentials than precursor ALA in countering OS and  in all the three experimental models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29456586>Dietary canolol protects the heart against the deleterious effects induced by the association of rapeseed oil, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 in the context of a high-fat diet.</a></h1><p>Obesity progressively leads to cardiac failure. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective effects in numerous pathological situations. It is not known whether rapeseed oil, which contains α- (ALA), has a similar protective effect. Omega-3 PUFAs are sensitive to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipid peroxidation products could damage cardiac cells. We thus tested whether dietary refined rapeseed oil (RSO) associated with or without different antioxidants (vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and canolol) is cardio-protective in a situation of abdominal obesity.Sixty male Wistar rats were subdivided into 5 groups. Each group was fed a specific diet for 11 weeks: a low-fat diet (3% of lipids, C diet) with compositionally-balanced PUFAs; a high-fat diet rich in palm oil (30% of lipids, PS diet); the PS diet in which 40% of lipids were replaced by RSO (R diet); the R diet supplemented with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E (RTC diet); and the RTC diet supplemented with canolol (RTCC diet). At the end of the diet period, the rats were sacrificed and the heart was collected and immediately frozen. Fatty  composition of cardiac phospholipids was then determined. Several features of cardiac function (fibrosis, , oxidative stress, apoptosis, metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis) were also estimated.Abdominal obesity reduced cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis rate by increasing the proportion of arachidonic  (AA) in membrane phospholipids. Dietary RSO had the same effect, though it normalized the proportion of AA. Adding vitamin E and CoQ10 in the RSO-rich high fat diet had a deleterious effect, increasing fibrosis by increasing angiotensin-2 receptor-1b (Ag2R-1b) mRNA expression. Overexpression of these receptors triggers coronary vasoconstriction, which probably induced ischemia. Canolol supplementation counteracted this deleterious effect by reducing coronary vasoconstriction.Canolol was found to counteract the fibrotic effects of vitamin E + CoQ10 on cardiac fibrosis in the context of a high-fat diet enriched with RSO. This effect occurred through a restoration of cardiac Ag2R-1b mRNA expression and decreased ischemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207257> based nano-suspension protect against lipopolysaccharides induced mastitis by inhibiting NFκBp65, HIF-1α, and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway in albino Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of  based intra-mammary nano-suspension (ALA-NS) on both in vitro antimicrobial and in vivo activity. The ALA-NS formulated and optimized for parameters like particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, sedimentation volume, and stability studies. In vitro, our results showed that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) have the higher zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value than ALA and cefotaxime alone against mastitis-causing pathogens. In vivo, our results showed that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) restored the altered oxidative biomarkers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, TBARs, and protein carbonyl) along with histopathological changes in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) treated rats. Western blot results indicated that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) inhibited LPS induced inflammatory proteins (NFκBp65, COX, LOX, and IFN-γ) in rat mammary epithelial cells. ALA-NS (F1 and F2) also suppressed the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and upregulated prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD-2), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1c), and fatty  synthase (FASN) protein expression. In addition, ALA-NS upregulated the pro-apoptotic (BAX and BAD) and downregulated anti-apoptotic (BCL-2 and BCL-XL) proteins expression in rat mammary epithelial tissue. In conclusion, we found that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) have in vitro antimicrobial activity and protective effects on LPS-induced mastitis in rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Besides classic inflammatory markers, oxidized polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites (oxylipins) are potent mediators of . Little is known about endogenous levels of oxylipins, e.g. hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy FA in obese subjects with persistent low-grade . We aimed to evaluate levels of inflammatory markers and blood oxylipins in obese subjects before and after weight reduction.In the present study, 42 obese (BMI 32.7 ± 0.22 kg/m(2)) men and women were classified in groups according to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (no <1mg/L; low-grade  ≥ 3 mg/L). Subjects underwent an intervention for eight weeks, which consisted of two phases: (1) week 1 and 2: total replacement of three meals by a formula diet and (2) six week partial formula diet (replacement of 1-2 meals). Blood samples were taken prior and post intervention for analysis of plasma protein levels of hsCRP, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Plasma Levels of free (unesterified) hydroxy, epoxy, and dihydroxy FAs as well as several prostanoids were analyzed in plasma by means of LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics.At baseline subjects with low-grade  (hsCRP 8.95 ± 1.39 mg/L) showed significant higher levels of IL-6 (22.7 ± 1.15 ng/L) and TNF-α (17.4 ± 0.75 ng/L) compared to subjects with no  (hsCRP: 0.69 ± 0.05 mg/L; IL-6: 15.9 ± 1.18 ng/L; TNF-α: 14.6 ± 0.80 ng/L). In both group's body weight was significantly reduced (p<0.001) after intervention (no  group: -7.19 ± 0.86 kg, -7.3 ± 0.89%, p<0.001; low-grade  group: -6.78 ± 0.87 kg, -6.7 ± 0.81%, p<0.001). Moreover, we observed significant decreases in levels of hsCRP (4.66 ± 0.64 mg/L; p=0.006), IL-6 (6.81 ± 1.15 ng/L; p<0.001) and TNF-α (6.09 ± 0.47 ng/L; p<0.001) in subjects with low-grade . Of 60 quantified oxylipins, 11 linoleic  (LA)-, 1 dihomo-γ- (DGLA)-, 7  (ALA)-, 15 arachidonic  (AA)-, 8 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)- and 18 docosahexaenoic  (DHA)-metabolites could be detected in plasma. For most oxylipins no differences were found between the low and high hsCRP groups before and after weight reduction. Interestingly, in subjects with low- grade  several AA-derived oxylipins (5-, 8-, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE)) were significantly higher compared to subjects with no  before weight reduction and significantly reduced after weight reduction.Even moderate weight loss in obese subjects correlates to a significant improvement in the inflammatory state, by reducing hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-α and few oxylipins. The biological consequences of these changes remain to be further investigated.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we investigated the effects of perinatal maternal n-3 fatty  deficiency on maternal-pup nurturing behavior and potential associations with pro-inflammatory signaling.  Eight-week-old virgin female Long-Evans hooded rats were randomized to a control diet containing  (ALA, 18:3n-3) (CON,  = 10) or an ALA-free diet (Deficient, DEF,  = 11) 30 d prior to mating. On postnatal day 2 (P2) litters were culled to eight per dam. On P3, P6, and P9 dams and their litters were video recorded and maternal nurturing behaviors, including licking/grooming of pups and arched-back nursing, were scored by a blinded rater. Following weaning on P21, dam postmortem central (prefrontal cortex, PFC) and peripheral (red blood cell, RBC) fatty  composition and central (PFC IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, TNFα, cPLA, COX-2 mRNA) and peripheral (plasma IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, TNFα, CRP) pro-inflammatory biostatus assessed.  DEF dams exhibited significantly lower RBC ( ≤ 0.0001) and PFC ( ≤ 0.0001) docosahexaenoic  (DHA) levels compared with CON dams. Irrespective of diet dams exhibited significantly lower RBC, but not PFC, DHA levels compared with non-parous rats. DEF dams exhibited less licking/grooming ( = 0.008), arched-back nursing ( ≤ 0.0001) and blanket nursing ( = 0.003), and exhibited more passive nursing ( = 0.003) but not time off pups ( = 0.1), compared with CON dams.

As a result, oxylipins have been implicated in many conditions characterized by these processes, including cardiovascular disease and aging. The best characterized oxylipins in relation to cardiovascular disease are derived from the ω-6 fatty  arachidonic . These oxylipins generally increase , hypertension, and platelet aggregation, although not universally. Similarly, oxylipins derived from the ω-6 fatty  linoleic  generally have more adverse than beneficial cardiovascular effects. Alternatively, most oxylipins derived from 20- and 22-carbon ω-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory, antiaggregatory, and vasodilatory effects that help explain the cardioprotective effects of these fatty acids. Much less is known regarding the oxylipins derived from the 18-carbon ω-3 fatty  α-, but clinical trials with flaxseed supplementation have indicated that these oxylipins can have positive effects on blood pressure. Normal aging also is associated with changes in oxylipin levels in the brain, vasculature, and other tissues, indicating that oxylipin changes with aging may be involved in age-related changes in these tissues. A small number of trials in humans and animals with interventions that contain either 18-carbon or 20- and 22-carbon ω-3 fatty acids have indicated that dietary-induced changes in oxylipins may be beneficial in slowing the changes associated with normal aging. In summary, oxylipins are an important group of molecules amenable to dietary manipulation to target cardiovascular disease and age-related degeneration. Oxylipins are an important group of fatty  metabolites amenable to dietary manipulation. Because of the role they play in cardiovascular disease and in age-related degeneration, oxylipins are gaining recognition as viable targets for specific dietary interventions focused on manipulating oxylipin composition to control these biological processes.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450497>Integrating 3-omics data analyze rat lung tissue of COPD states and medical intervention by delineation of molecular and pathway alterations.</a></h1><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious health problem. However, the molecular pathogenesis of COPD remains unknown. Here, we explored the molecular effects of cigarette smoke and bacterial infection in lung tissues of COPD rats. We also investigated therapeutic effects of aminophylline (APL) on the COPD rats and integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data for a global view of molecular mechanisms of COPD progression. Using molecular function and pathway analyses, the genes and proteins regulated in COPD and APL-treated rats were mainly attributed to oxidoreductase, antioxidant activity, energy and fatty  metabolism. Furthermore, we identified hub proteins such as Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), Pkm (pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2), and Sod1 (superoxide dismutase 1), included in energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Then, we identified the significantly regulated metabolic pathways in lung tissues of COPD- and APL-treated rats, such as arachidonic , linoleic , and α- metabolism, which belong to the lipid metabolism. In particular, we picked the arachidonic  metabolism for a more detailed pathway analysis of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. We could observe an increase in metabolites and genes involved in arachidonic  metabolism in COPD rats and the decrease in these in APL-treated rats, suggesting that inflammatory responses were up-regulated in COPD rats and down-regulated in APL-treated rats. In conclusion, these system-wide results suggested that COPD progression and its treatment might be associated with oxidative stress, lipid and energy metabolism disturbance. Additionally, we demonstrated the power of integrated omics for the elucidation of genes, proteins, and metabolites' changes and disorders that were associated with COPD.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746616>A regulatory insertion-deletion polymorphism in the FADS gene cluster influences PUFA and lipid profiles among Chinese adults: a population-based study.</a></h1><p>Arachidonic  (AA) is the major polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) substrate for potent eicosanoid signaling to modulate  and thrombosis and is controlled in part by tissue abundance. Fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) catalyzes synthesis of omega-6 (n-3) AA and n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The rs66698963 polymorphism, a 22-base pair (bp) insertion-deletion 137 bp downstream of a sterol regulatory element in FADS2 intron 1, mediates expression of FADS1 in vitro, as well as exerting positive selection in several human populations. The associations between the polymorphism rs66698963 and plasma PUFAs as well as disease phenotypes are unclear.This study aimed to evaluate the relation between rs66698963 genotypes and plasma PUFA concentrations and blood lipid profiles.Plasma fatty acids were measured from a single sample obtained at baseline in 1504 healthy Chinese adults aged between 35 and 59 y with the use of gas chromatography. Blood lipids were measured at baseline and a second time at the 18-mo follow-up. The rs66698963 genotype was determined by using agarose gel electrophoresis. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between genotype and plasma PUFAs and blood lipids.A shift from the precursors linoleic  and α- to produce AA and EPA, respectively, was observed, consistent with FADS1 activity increasing in the order of genotypes D/D to I/D to I/I. For I/I compared with D/D carriers, plasma concentrations of n-6 AA and the ratio of AA to n-3 EPA plus docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were 57% and 32% higher, respectively. Carriers of the deletion (D) allele of rs66698963 tended to have higher triglycerides (β = 0.018; SE: 0.009; P = 0.05) and lower HDL cholesterol (β = -0.008; SE: 0.004; P = 0.02) than carriers of the insertion (I) allele.The rs66698963 genotype is significantly associated with AA concentrations and AA to EPA+DHA ratio, reflecting basal risk of inflammatory and related chronic disease phenotypes, and is correlated with the risk of dyslipidemia.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been great source in suppressing . We investigated the effect of α- (ALA) on RANKL-stimulated osteoclast differentiation, LPS-induced and ovariectomized bone loss in mice models. MATERIAL AND METHODS The bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from femurs of ICR mice, stimulated with RANKL, and treated with ALA (100, 200, 300 µM). Major analytical methods include histological analysis, osteoclasts viability assay, serum cytokines and chemokines ELISA, and gene expression by qPCR. RESULTS ALA intervention inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclasts proliferation and differentiation. ALA inhibited bone resorption activity as measured by materialization of F-actin ring structures as well. ALA suppressed the RANKL-induced osteoclast markers c-Fos, c-Jun and NFATc1 together with transcription factor proteins TRAP, OSCAR, cathepsin K and β3-integrin. ALA also suppressed the RANKL-stimulated phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and AKT as well as NF-κB and BCL-2 proteins. ALA intervention (100 and 300 mg/kg) to LPS-challenged mice showed annulled morphometric changes induced by LPS by suppressing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ALA (100 and 300 mg/kg) intervention to estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss mice (ovariectomized) showed reductions in TRAP+ osteoclasts count, CTX-I expression, levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL10, TNF-α and MCP-1 and iNOS and COX-2. CONCLUSIONS ALA suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and prevents inflammatory bone loss via downregulation of NF-κB-iNOS-COX-2 signaling.

Subgroup analysis revealed that increasing dietary ALA tends to elevate CRP concentration in healthy subjects. However, the null effect of ALA supplementation on other inflammatory markers was not changed in various subgroups, indicating that the results are stable. Meta-regression results revealed a negative relationship between the effect size on CRP and its baseline concentration. No significant publication bias was observed for all inflammatory markers as suggested by funnel plot and Begg's test.Our meta-analysis did not find any beneficial effect of ALA supplementation on reducing inflammatory markers including TNF, IL-6, CRP, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1. However, in healthy subjects, ALA supplementation might increase CRP concentration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940033>In vitro effect of flaxseed oil and α- against the toxicity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to human umbilical vein endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Consumption of α- (ALA)-rich flaxseed oil is a possible way to supplement ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the beneficial effects to cardiovascular systems are still controversial. In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used as the in vitro model and the potential beneficial effects of well-characterized flaxseed oil and ALA were studied. Exposure of HUVECs to LPS for 24 h significantly promoted inflammatory response as release of interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) as well as adhesion of THP-1 monocytes, but did not induce cytotoxicity or oxidative stress. ALA, but not flaxseed oil, significantly reduced LPS-induced release of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, without effect on THP-1 adhesion. No radical scavenging activity was observed after flaxseed oil or ALA exposure. Rather, ALA at high concentrations promoted intracellular superoxide associated with damages to lysosomes, which was not observed in flaxseed oil exposed cells. These results indicated that ALA at high concentrations could inhibit inflammatory responses in LPS-treated HUVECs in vitro but might also promote a modest effect in cytotoxicity and oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28078067>α- Reduces TNF-Induced Apoptosis in C2C12 Myoblasts by Regulating Expression of Apoptotic Proteins.</a></h1><p>Impaired regeneration and consequent muscle wasting is a major feature of muscle degenerative diseases. Nutritional interventions such as adjuvant strategy for preventing these conditions are recently gaining increasing attention. Ingestion of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acids has been suggested as having a positive impact on muscle diseases. We recently demonstrated that a diet enriched with plant derived n3-fatty , α- (ALA), exerts potent beneficial effects in preserving skeletal muscle regeneration in models of muscle dystrophy. To better elucidate the underlying mechanism we here investigate on the expression level of the anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins, as well as caspase-3 activity, in C2C12 myoblasts challenged with pathological levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). The results demonstrated that ALA protective effect on C2C12 myoblasts was associated with a decrease in caspase-3 activity and an increase of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Indeed, the effect of ALA was directed to rescuing Bcl-2 expression and to revert Bax translocation to mitochondria both affected in an opposite way by TNF, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed in damaged skeletal muscle. Therefore, ALA counteracts inflammatory signals in the muscle microenvironment and may represent a valuable strategy for ameliorating skeletal muscle pathologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30441883>Anti-Inflammatory Effect of  Fatty Acids through NF-κB and MAPK Pathways against LPS-Stimulated RAW264.7 Cells.</a></h1><p> (starfish) is a marine organism that is harmful to the fishing industry, but is also a potential source of functional materials. The present study was conducted to analyze the profiles of fatty acids extracted from  tissues and their anti-inflammatory effects on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. In different tissues, the component ratios of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids differed; particularly, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as dihomo-gamma- (20:3n-6) and eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3) were considerably different. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, fatty acids from  skin, gonads, and digestive glands exhibited anti-inflammatory activities by reducing nitric oxide production and inducing nitric oxide synthase gene expression.  fatty acids effectively suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E, which are critical  biomarkers, were also significantly suppressed. Furthermore,  fatty acids reduced the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB p-65, p38, extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, indicating that these fatty acids ameliorated  through the nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. These results provide insight into the anti-inflammatory mechanism of  fatty acids on immune cells and suggest that the species is a potential source of anti-inflammatory molecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228158>Flaxseed oil ameliorates alcoholic liver disease via anti- and modulating gut microbiota in mice.</a></h1><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) represents a chronic wide-spectrum of liver injury caused by consistently excessive alcohol intake. Few satisfactory advances have been made in management of ALD. Thus, novel and more practical treatment options are urgently needed. Flaxseed oil (FO) is rich in α- (ALA), a plant-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, the impact of dietary FO on chronic alcohol consumption remains unknown.In this study, we assessed possible effects of dietary FO on attenuation of ALD and associated mechanisms in mice. Firstly, mice were randomly allocated into four groups: pair-fed (PF) with corn oil (CO) group (PF/CO); alcohol-fed (AF) with CO group (AF/CO); PF with FO group (PF/FO); AF with FO group (AF/FO). Each group was fed modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets containing isocaloric maltose dextrin a control or alcohol with corn oil and flaxseed oil, respectively. After 6 weeks feeding, mice were euthanized and associated indications were investigated.Body weight (BW) was significantly elevated in AF/FO group compared with AF/CO group. Dietary FO reduced the abnormal elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in chronic ethanol consumption. Amelioration of these parameters as well as liver injury via HE staining in dietary FO supplementation in ALD demonstrated that dietary FO can effectively benefit for the protection against ALD. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the inflammatory cytokine levels and gut microbiota. A series of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10, were determined. As a result, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were decreased in AF/FO group compared with control group; IL-10 showed no significant alteration between AF/CO and AF/FO groups (p > 0.05). Sequencing and analysis of gut microbiota gene indicated that a reduction of Porphyromonadaceae and Parasutterella, as well as an increase in Firmicutes and Parabacteroides, were seen in AF group compared with PF control. Furthermore, dietary FO in ethanol consumption group induced a significant reduction in Proteobacteria and Porphyromonadaceae compared with AF/CO group.Dietary FO ameliorates alcoholic liver disease via anti- and modulating gut microbiota, thus can potentially serve as an inexpensive interventions for the prevention and treatment of ALD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690246>The effect of fatty acids in red blood cell membranes on the dynamics of inflammatory markers following the coronary stent implantation.</a></h1><p>The effect of 20 fatty acids in erythrocyte cell membranes on the extent of inflammatory response and cell oxidative stress was evaluated using multidimensional statistical data analysis in 54 patients suffering from ischemic heart disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with coronary stent implantation using multidimensional statistical data analysis. A systemic inflammatory response was indicated by an increase of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and ceruloplasmin 48 h after stent implantation and by an increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) 24 h after intervention. The increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) after 48 h was used as a marker of cell damage by oxidative stress. Multiple linear regression revealed statistically significant relationships between concentration of some fatty acids and the magnitude of inflammatory response, or oxidative stress, after stent implantation. The most significant relationship with an increase of plasma CRP was found for myristic  and, to a lesser extent, for oleic . Trans octadecenoic , and to a lesser extent palmitooleic and nervonic fatty acids were found in inverse correlation with the CRP increase. The increase of IL-6 showed a statistically significant correlation with myristic , to a lesser extent with cis-9-eicosenoic  and to the least extent with docosahexaenoic , inversely with pentadecanoic, γ- and stearic acids. An increase of oxidative stress (MDA) significantly correlated only with γ-. Other studied markers of inflammatory response to coronary stenting were SAA and ceruloplasmin (Cp). Statistical evaluation revealed that SAA and Cp are not suitable markers for assessment relationships between  and erythrocyte membrane fatty acids.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we conducted a new prospective, randomized controlled study to elucidate any beneficial effect of an IMD containing eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and γ- (GLA) in patients undergoing radical esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer.From November 2009 to July 2011, 87 consecutive patients were randomized to receive either an IMD enriched with EPA, GLA, and antioxidants (n = 42) or a standard isocaloric, isonitrogenous diet (control group, n = 45) after esophagectomy with radical lymphadenectomy. The primary outcome measure was changes in the oxygenation status (PaO/FIO ratio), and the secondary outcome measures were body composition, -related factors, coagulation markers, cholesterol concentrations, and major clinical outcomes.Oxygenation was significantly better on postoperative days (PODs) 4, 6, and 8 in the IMD than control group (366.5 ± 63.3 vs. 317.3 ± 58.8, P = 0.001; 361.5 ± 52.6 vs. 314.0 ± 53.2, P < 0.001; 365.4 ± 71.2 vs. 315.2 ± 56.9, P = 0.001, respectively). Changes in the ratio of body weight on PODs 14 and 21 and lean body weight on POD 21 were significantly greater in the IMD than control group. No significant differences were observed in other measures.An enteral IMD enriched with EPA and GLA improved oxygenation and maintained the body composition of patients undergoing radical esophagectomy, indicating the potential efficacy of such a diet after esophagectomy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618904>n-3 PUFA Sources (Precursor/Products): A Review of Current Knowledge on Rabbit.</a></h1><p>This review compares the effects of different n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) sources on biological activity, physiological/reproductive endpoints, and health implications with a special emphasis on a rabbit case study. Linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) are members of two classes of PUFAs, namely the n-6 and n-3 series, which are required for normal human health. Both are considered precursors of a cascade of molecules (eicosanoids), which take part in many biological processes (, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, thromboregulation, etc.). However, their biological functions are opposite and are mainly related to the form (precursor or long-chain products) in which they were administered and to the enzyme-substrate preference. ALA is widely present in common vegetable oils and foods, marine algae, and natural herbs, whereas its long-chain PUFA derivatives are available mainly in fish and animal product origins. Recent studies have shown that the accumulation of n-3 PUFAs seems mostly to be tissue-dependent and acts in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, dietary n-3 PUFAs widely affect the lipid oxidation susceptibility of all tissues. In conclusion, sustainable sources of n-3 PUFAs are limited and exert a different effect about (1) the form in which they are administered, precursor or derivatives; (2) their antioxidant protections; and (3) the purpose to be achieved (health improvement, physiological and reproductive traits, metabolic pathways, etc.).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29081885>Dietary Flaxseed Oil Prevents Western-Type Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Apolipoprotein-E Knockout Mice.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has dramatically increased globally during recent decades. Intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6n-3), is believed to be beneficial to the development of NAFLD. However, little information is available with regard to the effect of flaxseed oil rich in - (ALA, C18:3n-3), a plant-derived n-3 PUFA, in improving NAFLD. This study was to gain the effect of flaxseed oil on NAFLD and further investigate the underlying mechanisms. Apolipoprotein-E knockout (apoE-KO) mice were given a normal chow diet, a western-type high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (WTD), or a WTD diet containing 10% flaxseed oil (WTD + FO) for 12 weeks. Our data showed that consumption of flaxseed oil significantly improved WTD-induced NAFLD, as well as ameliorated impaired lipid homeostasis, attenuated oxidative stress, and inhibited . These data were associated with the modification effects on expression levels of genes involved in de novo fat synthesis (SREBP-1c, ACC), triacylglycerol catabolism (PPAR, CPT1A, and ACOX1),  (NF-B, IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1), and oxidative stress (ROS, MDA, GSH, and SOD).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294699>Chia Oil-Enriched Restructured Pork Effects on Oxidative and Inflammatory Status of Aged Rats Fed High Cholesterol/High Fat Diets.</a></h1><p>Chia oil has the highest recognized α- (ALA) content. ALA is associated with beneficial changes in plasma lipids and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Present article aims to analyze the effect of Chia oil-enriched restructured pork (RP) on aged rats in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Groups of six male Wistar rats (1-year old) were fed the experimental diets: control RP diet (C) noncholesterol high saturated; cholesterol-enriched high-saturated fat/high-cholesterol control RP diet (HC) with added cholesterol and cholic ; and Chia oil- or Hydroxytyrosol RP cholesterol-enriched high-saturated fat/high cholesterol (CHIA and HxT). Total cholesterol, hepatosomatic index, Nrf2, antioxidant, and  markers were determined. CHIA reduced the hypercholesterolemic effect by lowering levels similar to C; also, ameliorated redox index. CHIA, despite high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content, reduced thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and induced the lowest SOD protein synthesis but not a reduction on its activity. Chia oil activated the Nrf2 to arrest the pro-oxidative response to cholesterol and aging. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) system was lower in HxT than in CHIA, suggesting its antiatherogenic activity and related protective effect against high PUFA. Increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was partially blocked by CHIA. Chia oil has the ability to prevent oxidative damage and modify the inflammatory response, suggesting adequate regulation of the antioxidant system.

Previous studies have shown the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of , which prevented cell damage by inhibiting apoptotic pathway. Also, it is known that gentamicin activates apoptotic mediators and causes necrosis in the kidney. Due to this reason, we planned a study to evaluate the protective effects of  on gentamicin induced ototoxicity by evaluating  and apoptotic mediators. For this purpose, 100 mg/kg gentamicin (i.p; intraperitoneally) and 200 mg/kg  (gavage) are administered to mice for 9 days. On 9th and 10th days, rotarod performance was assessed to test the effect of gentamicin and  treatment on the motor coordination of mice. Gentamicin treatment decreased fall latency of mice and gentamicin treatment together with  increased fall latency of mice. Gentamicin treatment also increased expression of phospholipase A2(plA2), cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide syntheses (iNOS). Furthermore, it increased Bax and caspase-3, which are proapoptotic proteins and decreased bcl-2 that is an antiapoptotic protein. Gentamicin treatment together  recovered the change of expression of these enzymes. In conclusion, this study showed that  will be useful to prevent gentamicin-induced ototoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29491308>The Clinical Significance of Low Serum Arachidonic  in Sepsis Patients with Hypoalbuminemia.</a></h1><p>Objectives Fatty acids (FAs) have various roles in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions. Hypoalbuminemia is often observed in sepsis patients. An imbalance among these compounds formed from FAs caused by hypoalbuminemia may be related to increased mortality in sepsis patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlations between serum albumin and FAs in sepsis and the outcome. Methods This study was an observational investigation. The clinical and laboratory data of sepsis patients were recorded and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was calculated at admission. The serum arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and dihomo-gamma- (DHLA) levels were also measured as FAs. The body mass index (BMI) was used to determine the general nutrition status. Results Two hundred sepsis patients were enrolled during the study period. No significant correlations were observed between the BMI and the SOFA score or the serum albumin level at admission. The FA levels of the non-survivors were significantly lower, but there were no significant differences in the EPA/AA levels of the survivors and non-survivors. A low serum albumin level was closely related to low AA (p<0.0001), EPA (p<0.0001), DHA (p=0.0003), and DHLA levels (p<0.0001). A multiple logistic-regression analysis revealed that a high SOFA score [adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.39, p=0.026] and low AA (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.978-0.994, p=0.041) were associated with a poor outcome. Conclusion A lower AA level was an important determinant of the outcome of patients with sepsis. These findings are consistent with the findings of previous studies, which reported that hypoalbuminemia might alter the AA metabolism in sepsis patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27973445>Roles of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α in Bitter Melon Seed Oil-Corrected Lipid Disorders and Conversion of α-Eleostearic  into Rumenic  in C57BL/6J Mice.</a></h1><p>We previously reported that bitter melon seed oil (BMSO) was an effective anti-steatosis and antiobesity agent. Since the major fatty  α-eleostearic  (α-ESA) in BMSO is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activator, the objective was to investigate the role of PPARα in BMSO-modulated lipid disorders and α-ESA metabolism. C57BL/6J wild (WD) and PPARα knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet containing BMSO (15% soybean oil + 15% BMSO, HB) or not (30% soybean oil, HS) for 5 weeks. The HB diet significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride concentrations and increased acyl-CoA oxidase activity in WD, but not in KO mice. However, regardless of genotype, body fat percentage was lowered along with upregulated protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and tyrosine hydroxylase, as well as signaling pathway of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase in the white adipose tissue of HB-treated groups compared to HS cohorts. In WD-HB and KO-HB groups, white adipose tissue had autophagy, apoptosis, , and browning characteristics. Without PPARα, in vivo reduction of α-ESA into rumenic  was slightly but significantly lowered, along with remarkable reduction of hepatic retinol saturase () expression. We concluded that BMSO-mediated anti-steatosis depended on PPARα, whereas the anti-adiposity effect was PPARα-independent. In addition, PPARα-dependent enzymes may participate in α-ESA conversion, but only have a minor role.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27126789>Simultaneous quantitative profiling of 20 isoprostanoids from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids by LC-MS/MS in various biological samples.</a></h1><p>Isoprostanoids are a group of non-enzymatic oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It belongs to oxylipins group, which are important lipid mediators in biological processes, such as tissue repair, blood clotting, blood vessel permeability,  and immunity regulation. Recently, isoprostanoids from eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, adrenic and α- namely F3-isoprostanes, F4-neuroprostanes, F2-dihomo-isoprostanes and F1-phytoprostanes, respectively have attracted attention because of their putative contribution to health. Since isoprostanoids are derived from different substrate of PUFAs and can have similar or opposing biological consequences, a total isoprostanoids profile is essential to understand the overall effect in the testing model. However, the concentration of most isoprostanoids range from picogram to nanogram, therefore a sensitive method to quantify 20 isoprostanoids simultaneously was formulated and measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The lipid portion from various biological samples was extracted prior to LC-MS/MS evaluation. For all the isoprostanoids LOD and LOQ, and the method was validated on plasma samples for matrix effect, yield of extraction and reproducibility were determined. The methodology was further tested for the isoprostanoids profiles in brain and liver of LDLR(-/-) mice with and without docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation. Our analysis showed similar levels of total F2-isoprostanes and F4-neuroprostanes in the liver and brain of non-supplemented LDLR(-/-) mice. The distribution of different F2-isoprostane isomers varied between tissues but not for F4-neuroprostanes which were predominated by the 4(RS)-4-F4t-neuroprostane isomer. DHA supplementation to LDLR(-/-) mice concomitantly increased total F4-neuroprostanes levels compared to F2-isoprostanes but this effect was more pronounced in the liver than brain.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In humans on a Western diet, the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  arachidonic  (ARA) makes a significant contribution to the fatty acids present in the membrane phospholipids of cells involved in . ARA is a precursor to a number of potent pro-inflammatory mediators including well described prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which has led to the development of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals that target the ARA pathway to successfully control . Hence, it is commonly believed that increasing dietary intake of the omega-6 fatty acids ARA or its precursor linoleic  (LA) will increase . However, studies in healthy human adults have found that increased intake of ARA or LA does not increase the concentrations of many inflammatory markers. Epidemiological studies have even suggested that ARA and LA may be linked to reduced . Contrastingly, there is also evidence that a high omega-6 fatty  diet inhibits the anti-inflammatory and -resolving effect of the omega-3 fatty acids.

High SFA intakes have been associated with increased CVD and type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk, due to alterations in cholesterol homoeostasis and adipose tissue . PUFA, in particular EPA and DHA, have been associated with health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects. It is well established that dietary fat composition plays an important role in biological processes. A recent review of evidence suggests that replacement of SFA with PUFA has potential to reduce risk of CVD and T2D. The public health and molecular impact of EPA and DHA have been well-characterised, while less is known of effects of α- (ALA). The current dietary guideline for ALA is 0·5% TE; however evidence from supplementation trials suggests that benefit is observed at levels greater than 2 g/d (0·6-1% TE). This review highlights the gap in the evidence base relating to effects of the replacement of SFA with ALA, identifying the need for randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose of ALA substitution to define the efficacy of dietary fat modification with ALA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29291387>A pilot study of the metabolomic profiles of saliva from female orthodontic patients with external apical root resorption.</a></h1><p>Orthodontically induced external apical root resorption (OIEARR) is one of the most severe complications of orthodontic treatment, which is hard to diagnose at early stage by merely radiographic examination.

DHA plays important roles in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral organs and is the precursor of several molecules that regulate resolution of . In the present study, we questioned whether impaired synthesis of DHA affected macrophage plasticity and polarization both in vitro and in vivo models. For this we investigated the activation status and inflammatory response of bone marrow-derived M1 and M2 macrophages obtained from mice deficient of Elovl2 (Elovl2), a key enzyme for DHA synthesis in mammals. Although both wild type and Elovl2 mice were able to generate efficient M1 and M2 macrophages, M1 cells derived from Elovl2 mice showed an increased expression of key markers (iNOS, CD86 and MARCO) and cytokines (IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23). However, M2 macrophages exhibited upregulated M1-like markers like CD80, CD86 and IL-6, concomitantly with a downregulation of their signature marker CD206. These effects were counteracted in cells obtained from DHA-supplemented animals. Finally, white adipose tissue of Elovl2 mice presented an M1-like pro-inflammatory phenotype. Hence, impairment of systemic DHA synthesis delineates an alteration of M1/M2 macrophages both in vitro and in vivo, with M1 being hyperactive and more pro-inflammatory while M2 less protective, supporting the view that DHA has a key role in controlling the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026586>Substitution of linoleic  with α- or long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  prevents Western diet induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Imbalance in the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and n-3 PUFA in the Western diet may increase the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study investigates the impact of substitution of linoleic  with α- (ALA) or long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA and hence decreasing n-6:n-3 fatty  ratio on high fat, high fructose (HFHF) diet induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups and fed control diet, HFHF diet (n-6:n-3 ratio of 200), HFHF diet with ALA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 2) or HFHF diet with LC n-3 PUFA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 5) for 24 weeks.

Recent studies indicated that the modification of gut microbiota plays an important role in the progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated consumption of fish oil or perilla oil rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protects against NAFLD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we adopted 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing technique to investigate the impacts of fish oil and perilla oil on gut microbiomes modification in rats with high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced NAFLD. Both fish oil and perilla oil ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and . In comparison with the low-fat control diet, HFD feeding significantly reduced the relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in the gut, which was slightly reversed by either fish oil or perilla oil. Additionally, fish oil and perilla oil consumption abrogated the elevated abundance of Prevotella and Escherichia in the gut from HFD fed animals. Interestingly, the relative abundance of antiobese Akkermansia was remarkably increased only in animals fed fish oil compared with HFD group.

PUFAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of JIA and support a necessity to identify new targets suitable for successful interventional studies in JIA patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245005>Individual free fatty acids have unique associations with inflammatory biomarkers, insulin resistance and insulin secretion in healthy and gestational diabetic pregnant women.</a></h1><p>We investigated the relationships of maternal circulating individual free fatty acids (FFA) with insulin resistance, insulin secretion and inflammatory biomarkers during mid-pregnancy.The data were drawn from a prospective cohort of generally healthy pregnant women (n=1368, African-American 36%, Hispanic 48%, Caucasian 16%) in Camden, NJ. We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, , myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, palmitic, stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect insulin resistance and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response. Modifying the composition of FFAs may help in reducing the risk of GDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886714>The oxylipin and endocannabidome responses in acute phase Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children.</a></h1><p>Oxylipins and endocannabinoids are low molecular weight bioactive lipids that are crucial for initiation and resolution of  during microbial infections. Metabolic complications in malaria are recognized contributors to severe and fatal malaria, but the impact of malaria infection on the production of small lipid derived signalling molecules is unknown. Knowledge of immunoregulatory patterns of these molecules in malaria is of great value for better understanding of the disease and improvement of treatment regimes, since the action of these classes of molecules is directly connected to the inflammatory response of the organism.Detection of oxylipins and endocannabinoids from plasma samples from forty children with uncomplicated and severe malaria as well as twenty controls was done after solid phase extraction followed by chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The stable isotope dilution method was used for compound quantification. Data analysis was done with multivariate (principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and univariate approaches (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, t tests, correlation analysis).Forty different oxylipin and thirteen endocannabinoid metabolites were detected in the studied samples, with one oxylipin (thromboxane B2, TXB) in significantly lower levels and four endocannabinoids (OEA, PEA, DEA and EPEA) at significantly higher levels in infected individuals as compared to controls according to t test analysis with Bonferroni correction. Three oxylipins (13-HODE, 9-HODE and 13-oxo-ODE) were higher in severe compared to uncomplicated malaria cases according to the results from multivariate analysis. Observed changes in oxylipin levels can be connected to activation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolic pathways in malaria infected individuals compared to controls, and related to increased levels of all linoleic  oxylipins in severe patients compared to uncomplicated ones. The endocannabinoids were extremely responsive to malaria infection with majority of this class of molecules found at higher levels in infected individuals compared to controls.It was possible to detect oxylipin and endocannabinoid molecules that can be potential biomarkers for differentiation between malaria infected individuals and controls and between different classes of malaria. Metabolic pathways that could be targeted towards an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of malaria were also pinpointed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130146>A systematic review of the effects of increasing arachidonic  intake on PUFA status, metabolism and health-related outcomes in humans.</a></h1><p>We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) of increased intake of arachidonic  (ARA) on fatty  status and health outcomes in humans. We identified twenty-two articles from fourteen RCT. Most studies were conducted in adults. These used between 80 and 2000 mg ARA per d and were of 1-12 weeks duration. Supplementation with ARA doses as low as 80 mg/d increased the content of ARA in different blood fractions. Overall there seem to be few marked benefits for adults of increasing ARA intake from the typical usual intake of 100-200 mg/d to as much as 1000 mg/d; the few studies using higher doses (1500 or 2000 mg/d) also report little benefit. However, there may be an impact of ARA on cognitive and muscle function which could be particularly relevant in the ageing population. The studies reviewed here suggest no adverse effects in adults of increased ARA intake up to at least 1000-1500 mg/d on blood lipids, platelet aggregation and blood clotting, immune function,  or urinary excretion of ARA metabolites. However, in many areas there are insufficient studies to make firm conclusions, and higher intakes of ARA are deserving of further study. Based on the RCT reviewed, there are not enough data to make any recommendations for specific health effects of ARA intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122230>Omega-3 fatty  intake and prevalent respiratory symptoms among U.S. adults with COPD.</a></h1><p>Omega-3 fatty acids, including  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and derivatives, play a key role in the resolution of . Higher intake has been linked to decreased morbidity in several diseases, though effects on respiratory diseases like COPD are understudied.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), with a focus on dietary assessment, provides a unique opportunity to explore relationships between omega-3 intake and morbidity in respiratory diseases marked by  in the United States (US) population. We investigated relationships between ALA or EPA + DHA intake and respiratory symptoms among US adults with COPD, as well as variation in relationships based on personal characteristics or exposures.Of 878 participants, mean age was 60.6 years, 48% were current smokers, and 68% completed high school. Omega-3 intake was, 1.71 ± 0.89 g (ALA), and 0.11 ± 0.21 g (EPA + DHA). Logistic regression models, adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index, FEV, education, smoking status, pack-years, total caloric intake, and omega-6 (linoleic , LA) intake demonstrated no primary associations between omega-3 intake and respiratory symptoms. Interaction terms were used to determine potential modification of relationships by personal characteristics (race, gender, education) or exposures (LA intake, smoking status), demonstrating that at lower levels of LA intake, increasing ALA intake was associated with reduced odds of chronic cough (p = 0.015) and wheeze (p = 0.037). EPA + DHA, but not ALA, was associated with reduced symptoms only among current smokers who did not complete high school.Individual factors should be taken into consideration when studying the association of fatty  intake on respiratory diseases, as differential responses may reveal susceptible subgroups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28067815>Marine Oil Supplements for Arthritis Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.</a></h1><p>Arthritis patients often take fish oil supplements to alleviate symptoms, but limited evidence exists regarding their efficacy. The objective was to evaluate whether marine oil supplements reduce pain and/or improve other clinical outcomes in patients with arthritis. Six databases were searched systematically (24 February 2015). We included randomized trials of oral supplements of all marine oils compared with a control in arthritis patients. The internal validity was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and heterogeneity was explored using restricted maximum of likelihood (REML)-based meta-regression analysis. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to rate the overall quality of the evidence. Forty-two trials were included; 30 trials reported complete data on pain. The standardized mean difference (SMD) suggested a favorable effect (-0.24; 95% confidence interval, CI, -0.42 to -0.07; heterogeneity, ² = 63%. A significant effect was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (22 trials; -0.21; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.004) and other or mixed diagnoses (3 trials; -0.63; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.06), but not in osteoarthritis patients (5 trials; -0.17; 95% CI, -0.57-0.24).

There is some evidence from observational and intervention studies to suggest a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFA in inflammatory diseases, specifically asthma. Marine-based n-3 PUFA have therefore been proposed as a possible complementary/alternative therapy for asthma. The proposed anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 fatty acids may be linked to a change in cell membrane composition. This altered membrane composition following n-3 fatty  supplementation (primarily EPA and DHA) can modify lipid mediator generation via the production of eicosanoids with a reduced inflammatory potential/impact. A recently identified group of lipid mediators derived from EPA including E-series resolvins are proposed to be important in the resolution of . Reduced  attenuates the severity of asthma including symptoms (dyspnoea) and exerts a bronchodilatory effect. There have been no major health side effects reported with the dietary supplementation of n-3 fatty acids or their mediators; consequently supplementing with n-3 fatty acids is an attractive non-pharmacological intervention which may benefit asthma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26500455>Nitric oxide secretion in human conjunctival fibroblasts is inhibited by .</a></h1><p>It is known that both human conjunctival fibroblasts (HCF) and corneal epithelial (HCE) cells contribute to the inflammatory process in the ocular surface by releasing inflammatory cytokines. In addition, nitric oxide (NO) has an important role in inflammatory responses in the ocular surface. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the capacity of these cells to release nitric oxide in response to cytokines and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and show that Alpha-linoleic  (ALA) inhibits these responses.HCF, HCE cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and co-culture of HCF and PBMC were treated with different combinations of inflammatory inducers, including interleukin)IL- (6, tumor necrosis factors (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)- γ and IL-1β and LPS. Nitrite levels were measured in cell supernatants with and without ALA by the Griess reaction test at 24, 48 and 72 h respectively. Expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) was evaluated by real-time PCR.All cytokine combinations had an inducible effect on nitrite secretion in HCF, PBMC and co-cultured PBMC and HCF, but not in HCE cells. Treatment with a combination of IL-6, LPS, TNF-α, IFN- γ and IL-1β induced the highest nitrite secretion (2.91 fold, P < 0.01) as compared to cells incubated in medium alone. nitrite secretion was reduced by 38.9 % (P < 0.05) after treatment with ALA alone. Co-culturing PBMC with HCF with and without ALA treatment demonstrated similar results in nitrite level as,compared to PBMC alone. In addition, ALA significantly decreased NOS-2 expression in HCF by 48.9 % (P < 0. 001) after 72 h.The decrease in nitrite release and inhibition of NOS-2 expression indicate that ALA may have an anti-inflammatory effect both on HCF and on peripheral immune cells. This indicates that ALA may serve as a potent anti-inflammatory agent in ocular surface .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27960561>Dietary essential α- and linoleic  differentially modulate TNFα-induced NFκB activity in FADS2-deficient HEK-293 cells.</a></h1><p>The pro- or anti-inflammatory bioactivity of dietary essential linoleic  (LA) and  (ALA) is mainly attributed to rate-limiting delta-6 desaturase (D6D) activity. The aim of this study was to analyze mechanisms of D6D-substrates ALA, LA and D6D-product gamma- (GLA) under D6D-deficient conditions. Fatty  profiles (GC-MS), D6D gene expression (real-time RT-PCR) and NFκB activity (luciferase assay) were assessed in HEK293 cells. FADS2 gene expression was approved being marginal. Incubation with ALA or LA did not increase D6D products but their elongase products C20:3n-3 and C20:2n-6. Bypassing the D6D, GLA elevated C20:3n-6 and C20:4n-6. LA significantly increased (+18% at 60 μM; p < .001), ALA reduced (-32% at 100 μM; p < .001) and GLA did not specifically change NFκB activity.

In the present study, we evaluate the potential of punicic  (PA), a nutraceutical found in pomegranate seed oil, against TNF-α induced alteration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on glucose metabolism, endocrine function and . IR was induced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treating with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of PA (5, 10, 30 μM) were incubated simultaneously. After 24 h, we found that TNF-α treatment increased mRNA expression of SOCS3, PTP1B and a decrease in IRS1 causing diminished glucose uptake. Further, it showed significantly increased transcriptional activity of NFκB and leptin secretion while PA maintained leptin levels normal. Additionally, PA prevented the over-expression of phosphorylated JNK in a dose dependent manner during IR. PA also ameliorated significantly the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. From the results, we conclude that PA is effective to ameliorate TNF-α induced IR and also we recommend the intake of PA for control and management of IR and its associated complications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

A 21-year follow-up study in general population men.</a></h1><p>Depression is a major public health challenge worldwide, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially n-3 PUFAs, have been found to inversely associate with the risk of depression. However, only few cross-sectional studies have investigated the association between dihomo-γ- (DGLA), an n-6 PUFA with anti-inflammatory effects, and depression. The aims of the present study were to examine an association between serum DGLA and the risk of depression, and to study whether the potential association is mediated via .A 20-year prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) follow-up study was conducted from 1984 to 1989 with 2179 middle-aged and older Finnish men (42-60 years old at baseline). The baseline concentrations of serum fatty acids, including DGLA, were determined. A hospital discharge diagnosis of depression was used as the main outcome and obtained from linkage to National Hospital Discharge Register. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured to assess .An inverse association between serum DGLA concentration and incidence of depression was found after adjustment for several potential confounders (Hazard ratio HR 0.53, CI 0.36-0.79, P=0.002). The association between DGLA and depression was not dependent on  (P-interaction=0.618).Our findings may not be generalizable to individuals below middle-age or women. Moreover, we were unable to consider cases with mild depression in the longitudinal setting.Higher serum DGLA concentrations may predict lower risk of develop depression in elderly men.

No significant relationships between hs-CRP and any of the food groups could be established, but significant relationships were established between hs-CRP levels and the high density of living arrangements and unhygienic ablution facilities.Although no link could be established between overnutrition and hs-CRP levels, an association was found between hs-CRP and dietary quality, as well as socio-economic status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202985>Dihomo-γ- inhibits several key cellular processes associated with atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis and its complications are responsible for one in three global deaths. Nutraceuticals show promise in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis but require an indepth understanding of the mechanisms underlying their actions. A previous study showed that the omega-6 fatty , dihomo-γ- (DGLA), attenuated atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein E deficient mouse model system. However, the mechanisms underlying such protective effects of DGLA are poorly understood and were therefore investigated. We show that DGLA attenuates chemokine-driven monocytic migration together with foam cell formation and the expression of key pro-atherogenic genes induced by three pro-inflammatory cytokines in human macrophages. The effect of DGLA on interferon-γ signaling was mediated via inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 phosphorylation on serine 727. In relation to anti-foam cell action, DGLA inhibits modified LDL uptake by both macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, the latter by reduction in expression of two key scavenger receptors (SR-A and CD36), and stimulates cholesterol efflux from foam cells. DGLA also improves macrophage mitochondrial bioenergetic profile by decreasing proton leak. Gamma- and prostaglandin E1, upstream precursor and key metabolite respectively of DGLA, also acted in an anti-atherogenic manner. The actions of DGLA extended to other key atherosclerosis-associated cell types with attenuation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells in response to platelet-derived growth factor. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-atherogenic actions of DGLA and supports further assessments on its protective effects on plaque regression in vivo and in human trials.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of αLA-enriched rations on gene expression of systemic (blood) and local (mammary gland) inflammatory markers in Holstein dairy cattle. Further, the effect of dietary treatments was evaluated on the concentration of αLA in serum phospholipids. Camelina (Camelina sativa) meal (containing 24.2% αLA) was fed at 0, 3, 6, and 9% (dry matter basis) replacing canola meal (rich in 18:1 ω-9) to provide rations with incremental concentrations of αLA. Lactating primiparous Holstein cows (n = 18) were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each period lasted 16 d and milk and blood samples were collected during the final 2 d of each period. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and milk cells (MC) were harvested, and RNA extracted and converted to complementary DNA for quantitative real time PCR analysis. The effect of dietary treatments (αLA) on the relative abundance of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in the PBMC and MC was tested by the MIXED procedure of SAS. Expression of pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in MC was linearly reduced (up to 40%) as dietary αLA increased. Expression of pro-inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α was reduced (29, 20, and 27%, respectively) in PBMC isolated from cows fed 6% camelina meal ration as compared with cows fed 0% (control). Expression of IL-6 was, however, increased with inclusion of camelina meal.

We used multivariate linear regression to assess associations between plasma levels of PUFAs and degree of  and interstitial fibrosis at 2 months and 1 year postoperatively and change in degree of interstitial fibrosis during the first year after transplantation, adjusting for  and fibrosis risk factors.Higher plasma marine n-3 PUFA levels were associated with less development of interstitial fibrosis in the kidney transplant (unstandardized β-coefficient -1.12, standardized β-coefficient -0.18, P = .03) during the first year after transplantation. Plasma levels of alpha linoleic , linoleic , and arachidonic  were not associated with development of interstitial fibrosis. No associations were found between plasma levels of PUFAs and  inside fibrotic areas or outside fibrotic areas in the kidney transplant at neither 2 months nor 1 year postoperatively.  levels in plasma were positively associated with change in renal function during the first year after transplantation.The inverse association between plasma marine n-3 PUFA levels and development of interstitial fibrosis during the first year after kidney transplantation suggests that marine fatty  consumption might halt progression of fibrosis.Copyright © 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Endotoxins are now well recognized as an important factor implicated in the onset and maintain of this inflammatory state during fat digestion in high-fat diet. As a preventive strategy, lipid formulation could be optimized to limit these phenomena, notably regarding fatty  profile and PL emulsifier content. Little is known about soybean polar lipid (SPL) consumption associated to oils rich in saturated FA vs. anti-inflammatory omega-3 FA such as α- on  and metabolic endotoxemia. We then investigated in mice the effect of different synthetic diets enriched with two different oils, palm oil or flaxseed oil and containing or devoid of SPL on adipose tissue  and endotoxin receptors. In both groups containing SPL, adipose tissue (WAT) increased compared with groups devoid of SPL and an induction of MCP-1 and LBP was observed in WAT. However, only the high-fat diet in which flaxseed oil was associated with SPL resulted in both higher WAT  and higher circulating sCD14 in plasma. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LPS transporters LBP and sCD14 and adipose tissue  can be modulated by SPL in high fat diets differing in oil composition. Notably high-flaxseed oil diet exerts a beneficial metabolic impact, however blunted by PL addition. Our study suggests that nutritional strategies can be envisaged by optimizing dietary lipid sources in manufactured products, including fats/oils and polar lipid emulsifiers, in order to limit the inflammatory impact of palatable foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial changes in CL were measured through mass spectrometry.Our data indicated that OA(18:1) was the most efficient fatty  that incorporated into CL, forming symmetrical CL without fatty  elongation and desaturation. In addition, LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were further elongated before incorporation, significantly increasing the number of double bonds and the chain length of CL. GLA and SDA were not optimal substrates for remodeling enzymes. The findings of RT-qPCR experiments revealed that none of these changes in CL occurred through the regulation of CL remodeling- or synthesis-related genes.

The TFA, trans-10, cis-12-conjugated linoleic  (CLA; 18:2n-6) is associated with adipose tissue (AT) , oxidative stress, and wasting. We examined the impact of a 4-week feeding of 0, 0.5, and 1.5% docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) in the presence and absence of 0.5% CLA on AT oxylipin profiles in female C57BL/6N mice. Esterified oxylipins in AT derived from linoleic  (LNA),  (ALA), arachidonic  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), DHA, and putative from CLA were quantified. CLA containing diets reduced AT mass by ~62%. Compared with the control diet, the DHA diet elevated concentrations of EPA-and DHA-derived alcohols and epoxides and LNA-derived alcohols, reduced ARA-derived alcohols, ketones, epoxides, and 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F (P < 0.05), and had mixed effects on ALA-derived alcohols. Dietary CLA lowered EPA-, DHA-, and ALA-derived epoxides, ARA-derived ketones and epoxides, and ALA-derived alcohols. While dietary CLA induced variable effects in EPA-, DHA-, and LNA-derived alcohols and LNA-derived ketones, it elevated ARA-derived alcohols and PGF, PGF, and F2-isoprostanes. DHA counteracted CLA-induced effects in 67, 57, 43, and 29% of total DHA-, ARA-, EPA-, and ALA-derived oxylipins, respectively. Thus, CLA elevated proinflammatory oxylipins while DHA increased anti-inflammatory oxylipins and diminished concentration of CLA-induced pro-inflammatory oxylipins in AT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422938>Protective effects of seabuckthorn pulp and seed oils against radiation-induced acute intestinal injury.</a></h1><p>Radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome, including nausea, diarrhea and dehydration, contributes to morbidity and mortality after medical or industrial radiation exposure. No safe and effective radiation countermeasure has been approved for clinical therapy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of seabuckthorn pulp and seed oils against radiation-induced acute intestinal injury. C57/BL6 mice were orally administered seabuckthorn pulp oil, seed oil and control olive oil once per day for 7 days before exposure to total-body X-ray irradiation of 7.5 Gy. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used for the measurement of apoptotic cells and proteins,  factors and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Seabuckthorn oil pretreatment increased the post-radiation survival rate and reduced the damage area of the small intestine villi. Both the pulp and seed oil treatment significantly decreased the apoptotic cell numbers and cleaved caspase 3 expression. Seabuckthorn oil downregulated the mRNA level of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-8. Both the pulp and seed oils elevated the level of phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and reduced the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38. Palmitoleic  (PLA) and  (ALA) are the predominant components of pulp oil and seed oil, respectively. Pretreatment with PLA and ALA increased the post-radiation survival time. In conclusion, seabuckthorn pulp and seed oils protect against mouse intestinal injury from high-dose radiation by reducing cell apoptosis and . ALA and PLA are promising natural radiation countermeasure candidates.© The Author 2016.

Recent dietary patterns of Western populations include higher than recommended intakes of n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) relative to n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs that may result in a chronic state of sterile whole body . Findings from human bone cell culture experiments have revealed both benefits and detriments to bone-related outcomes depending on the quantity and source of PUFAs. Findings from observational and randomized controlled trials suggest that higher fatty fish intake is strongly linked with reduced risk of fragility fracture. Moreover, human studies largely support a greater intake of total PUFAs, total n-6 (ω-6) fatty , and total n-3 (ω-3) fatty  for higher bone mineral density and reduced risk of fragility fracture. Less consistent evidence has been observed when investigating the role of long chain n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs or the ratio of n-6 (ω-6) PUFAs to n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs. Aspects to consider when interpreting the current literature involve participant characteristics, study duration, diet assessment tools, and the primary outcome measure.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068398>Precision Nutrition and Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids: A Case for Personalized Supplementation Approaches for the Prevention and Management of Human Diseases.</a></h1><p>Dietary essential omega-6 (-6) and omega-3 (-3) 18 carbon (18C-) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA), can be converted (utilizing desaturase and elongase enzymes encoded by  and  genes) to biologically-active long chain (LC; >20)-PUFAs by numerous cells and tissues. These -6 and -3 LC-PUFAs and their metabolites (ex, eicosanoids and endocannabinoids) play critical signaling and structural roles in almost all physiologic and pathophysiologic processes.This review summarizes: (1) the biosynthesis, metabolism and roles of LC-PUFAs; (2) the potential impact of rapidly altering the intake of dietary LA and ALA; (3) the genetics and evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthesis; (4) Gene-diet interactions that may lead to excess levels of -6 LC-PUFAs and deficiencies of -3 LC-PUFAs; and (5) opportunities for precision nutrition approaches to personalize -3 LC-PUFA supplementation for individuals and populations.The rapid nature of transitions in 18C-PUFA exposure together with the genetic variation in the LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway found in different populations make mal-adaptations a likely outcome of our current nutritional environment. Understanding this genetic variation in the context of 18C-PUFA dietary exposure should enable the development of individualized -3 LC-PUFA supplementation regimens to prevent and manage human disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27539101>Fatty  profile in erythrocyte membranes and plasma phospholipids affects significantly the extent of inflammatory response to coronary stent implantation.</a></h1><p>In coronary heart disease, the treatment of significant stenosis by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation elicits local and systemic inflammatory responses. This study was aimed at evaluation of the dynamics of inflammatory response and elucidation of the relationship between the fatty  profile of red blood cell (RBC) membranes or plasma phospholipids and  after PCI. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A (SAA), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the fatty  profiles were determined in patients with advanced coronary artery disease undergoing PCI before, 24 h and 48 h after drug-eluting stent implantation (n=36). Patients after PCI exhibited a significant increase in studied markers (hsCRP, IL-6, SAA, MDA). Many significant associations were found between the increase of IL-6, resp. SAA and the amounts of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (namely linoleic, dihomo-gamma-, docosatetraenoic and docosapentaenoic ), resp. saturated fatty acids (pentadecanoic, stearic, nonadecanoic) in erythrocyte membranes. The magnitude of the inflammatory response to PCI is related to erythrocyte membrane fatty  profile, which seems to be a better potential predictor of elevation of inflammatory markers after PCI than plasma phospholipids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26415675>Emu oil decreases atherogenic plaque formation in cafeteria diet-induced obese rats.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis-induced coronary heart disease - caused by elevated levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and  - is one of the most prevalent diseases. Monounsaturated fatty acids are reported to prevent atherosclerosis; emu oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty , and we hypothesize that emu oil supplementation could lower  and prevent atherosclerosis in diet-induced obese (DIO) animals. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), and fed with normal diet (chow pellet; ND), or with cafeteria diet (CD), or with CD along with emu oil supplementation at three different doses: ED1 (2 mL), ED2 (4 mL) and ED3 (8 mL) kg(-1) body weight (BW), respectively.After 12 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and serum was analysed for measuring lipid profile, C-reactive proteins, testosterone and luteinizing hormone. Histopathological studies were performed to observe atherogenic changes in thoracic aorta. Restoration of altered lipid and hormonal profiles, and inhibition of atherogenic changes in thoracic aorta, were observed with supplementation of emu oil, confirming its anti-atherosclerotic activity.The high content of oleic  in emu oil could have orchestrated - either solely or in combination with linoleic and  acids - causing the upregulation of testosterone biosynthesis and inhibition of atheromatous plaque formation in diet-induced obese animals. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552045>Erythrocyte polyunsaturated fatty  composition is associated with depression and FADS genotype in Caucasians.</a></h1><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), related, in part, to their role in inflammatory systems. The enzymes δ-5 and δ-6 desaturase are the rate-limiting steps in the metabolism of PUFAs and are encoded in the genes fatty  desaturase (FADS) 1 and 2, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes within the FADS gene cluster have been shown to influence PUFA composition.The objective of this study was to determine whether key omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids may be associated with depression, and to explore the role of FADS genotype in PUFA variation.Four erythrocyte long chain (LC) fatty acids (linoleic  [LA], α- [ALA], arachidonic  [AA] and Eicosapentaenoic  [EPA]), as well as six SNPs (rs174537, rs174547, rs174570, rs174575, rs498793 and rs3834458) within the FADS gene cluster were measured in a sample of 207 participants (154 with MDD versus 53 non-depressed controls).The precursor LC-PUFAs LA and ALA appeared to be negatively associated with depression (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively), while AA:LA (surrogate measure of desaturase activity) was positively associated with depression (P < 0.01). No significant differences were noted in erythrocyte EPA, AA or AA:EPA between groups. Minor alleles of each SNP (excluding rs498793) were associated with variation in desaturase activity and LA. Both rs174537 and rs174547 were associated with ALA. No genotype was associated with EPA or AA. Minor alleles of rs174537 and rs174547 were significantly associated with lower odds of MDD (although significance was lost after correction for multiple comparisons).Precursor LC-PUFAs, LA and ALA, appear to be associated with MDD and potentially modulated by genetic variation in the FADS gene cluster. These results provide support for the consideration of PUFA composition, diet and FADS genetic variation in the pathophysiology of MDD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429440>Role of Borage Seed Oil and Fish Oil with or without Turmeric and Alpha- Tocopherol in Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Fatty Liver in Rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present research was to Study the prevention of dyslipidemia, oxidative stress,  and fatty liver as risk factors for cardiovascular disease via intervention by borage oil (B) and fish oil (F) with or without turmeric (T) and alpha-tocopherols (TC). Fatty acids were assessed in both oils while curcuminoids were determined in turmeric. Rats were divided into; first group fed on balanced diet and designated as normal control (NC), second fed on dyslipidemic and steatohepatitis (DS) inducer diet which represented the DS control group and groups 3-6 fed on DS inducer diet with daily oral administration of B, B+T+TC, F and F+T+TC; respectively for 5 weeks. Liver fat and plasma lipid profile, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarker and liver and heart histopathology were assessed. Results showed gamma  to be 21.01% in B. F contained eicosapentaenoic as 22.768% and docosahexaenoic  as 13.574%.Total curcuminoids were 4.63 mg/g turmeric. The DS control group showed significant dyslipidemia, elevated malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha and liver fat with significant reduction in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to NC. The different treatments produced significant improvement in all the parameters and histopathology. F was superior to B in ameliorating liver histopathological changes while B was more efficient in elevating TAC. B was more promising in improving lipid profile and liver fat compared to B + T + TC, while the latter was superior in improving MDA and liver histopathology. Fish oil was more efficient than F+TC+T except for TAC and high density lipoprotein cholesterol which were more improved on addition of TC and T.

We investigated whether oral omega-3 supplements affect IOP in normotensive adults.We undertook a pooled analysis of data from two double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized trials (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12614001019695, ACTRN12615000173594) that investigated the efficacy and safety of oral omega-3 supplementation for treating ocular surface . Recruitment involved adults ( = 105) with IOP <21 mm Hg, and without a current or prior glaucoma diagnosis. Participants were randomly allocated to either an oral omega-3 (∼1000 mg/day eicosapentaenoic  + ∼500 mg/day docosahexaenoic  ± 900 mg/day α-) or placebo (olive oil, 1500 mg/day) supplement. IOP was quantified at baseline and after 3 months of supplementation (day 90). Change in IOP, relative to baseline, was compared between groups.At baseline, participants were of similar age (omega-3/placebo groups: mean ± SEM, 33.7 ± 1.7,  = 72/35.6 ± 3.0 years,  = 33), sex (65%/79% female), and had similar IOP (14.3 ± 0.3/13.8 ± 0.5 mm Hg). At day 90, IOP was reduced to 13.6 ± 0.3 mm Hg in the omega-3 group; controls had a slight IOP increase to 14.2 ± 0.4 mm Hg ( < 0.05).Oral omega-3 supplementation for 3 months significantly reduced IOP in normotensive adults. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that omega-3 fatty acids lower IOP in humans.These findings justify further investigation into the therapeutic potential of omega-3 supplementation for reducing IOP, to prevent and/or treat conditions with IOP elevation, including ocular hypertension and glaucoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528790>Dynamic differences in dietary polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism in sputum of COPD patients and controls.</a></h1><p>Disturbances in onset and resolution of  in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are incompletely understood. Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be converted into lipid mediators here collectively named oxylipins. These include classical eicosanoids, but also pro-resolving mediators. A balanced production of pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving oxylipins is of importance for adequate inflammatory responses and subsequent return to homeostasis.Here we investigated if PUFA metabolism is disturbed in COPD patients.Free PUFA and oxylipin levels were measured in induced sputum samples from the Bergen COPD cohort and COPD exacerbation study using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, effects of whole cigarette smoke on PUFA metabolism in air-liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells were assessed.Significantly lower levels of free , linoleic  and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were detected in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. During acute exacerbation (AE), levels of free arachidonic  and docosapentaenoic  were higher than in stable COPD patients. Furthermore, levels of omega-3 EPA- and docosahexaenoic -derived oxylipins were lower in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. Cyclooxygenase-2-converted mediators were mostly increased during AE. In vitro studies additionally showed that cigarette smoke exposure may also directly contribute to altered epithelial PUFA metabolism, and indirectly by causing airway epithelial remodelling.Our findings show significant differences in PUFA metabolism in COPD patients compared to controls, further changed during AE. Airway epithelial remodelling may contribute to these changes. These findings provide new insight in impaired inflammatory resolution in COPD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular . We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64%  (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased arachidonic  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Flowers have antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects, rhizomes constituents showed cytotoxic activity against liver cell carcinoma, while several Nymphaea species have been reported for their hepatoprotective effects. Leaves of N. alba have not been studied before. Therefore, in this study, in-depth characterization of the leaf phytoconstituents as well as its antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities have been performed where N. alba leaf extract was evaluated as a possible therapeutic alternative in hepatic disorders.The aqueous ethanolic extract (AEE, 70%) was investigated for its polyphenolic content identified by high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS/MS), while the petroleum ether fraction was saponified, and the lipid profile was analysed using gas liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis and compared with reference standards. The hepatoprotective activity of two doses of the extract (100 and 200 mg/kg; P.O.) for 5 days was evaluated against CCl-induced hepatotoxicity in male Wistar albino rats, in comparison with silymarin. Liver function tests; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and total bilirubin were performed. Oxidative stress parameters; malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as well as inflammatory mediator; tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were detected in the liver homogenate. Histopathological examination of the liver and immunohistochemical staining of caspase-3 were performed RESULTS: Fifty-three compounds were tentatively identified for the first time in N.alba leaf extract, where ellagitannins represent the main identified constituents. Nine hydrocarbons, two sterols and eleven fatty acids were identified in the petroleum ether extract where, palmitic  and  acids represented the major saturated and unsaturated fatty  respectively. N.alba AEE significantly improved the liver function, oxidative stress parameters as well as TNF-α in addition to the amelioration of histopathological features of the liver and a profound decrease in caspase-3 expression.These results shed light on the hepatoprotective effect of N. alba that is comparable with that of silymarin. The antioxidant activities of N. alba extract in addition to the inhibition of crucial inflammatory mediator, as TNF-α, might be the possible hepatoprotective mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466985>Association between plasma fatty acids and inflammatory markers in patients with and without insulin resistance and in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Proinflammatory biomarkers levels are increased among patients with cardiovascular disease, and it is known that both the presence of insulin resistance and diet may influence those levels. However, these associations are not well studied among patients with established cardiovascular disease. Our objective is to compare inflammatory biomarker levels among cardiovascular disease secondary prevention patients with and without insulin resistance, and to evaluate if there is any association between plasma fatty  levels and inflammatory biomarker levels among them.In this cross-sectional sub-study from the BALANCE Program Trial, we collected data from 359 patients with established cardiovascular disease. Plasma fatty acids and inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) were measured. Biomarkers and plasma fatty  levels of subjects across insulin resistant and not insulin resistant groups were compared, and general linear models were used to examine the association between plasma fatty acids and inflammatory biomarkers.Subjects with insulin resistance had a higher concentration of hs-CRP (p = 0.002) and IL-6 (p = 0.002) than subjects without insulin resistance. Among subjects without insulin resistance there was a positive association between stearic fatty  and IL-6 (p = 0.032), and a negative association between  fatty  and pro-inflammatory biomarkers (p < 0.05). Among those with insulin resistance there was a positive association between monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic fatty  and adiponectin (p < 0.05), and a negative association between monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and pro-inflammatory biomarkers (p < 0.05), as well as a negative association between polyunsaturated fatty acids and adiponectin (p < 0.05). Our study has not found any association between hs-CRP and plasma fatty acids.Subjects in secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease with insulin resistance have a higher concentration of hs-CRP and IL-6 than individuals without insulin resistance, and these inflammatory biomarkers are positively associated with saturated fatty acids and negatively associated with unsaturated fatty acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26615818>Mulberry fruit prevents LPS-induced NF-κB/pERK/MAPK signals in macrophages and suppresses acute colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice.</a></h1><p>Here, we investigated the impact of mulberry fruit (MBF) extracts on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages, and the therapeutic efficacy of MBF diet in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis and MUC2(-/-) mice with colorectal cancer. In vitro, LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production was significantly inhibited by MBF extracts via suppressing the expression of proinflammatory molecules, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-β) and IL-6. Particularly, a dose-dependent inhibition on LPS-induced inflammatory responses was observed following treatment with MBF dichloromethane extract (MBF-DE), in which linoleic  and ethyl linolenate were identified as two active compounds. Moreover, we elucidated that MBF-DE attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by blocking activation of both NF-κB/p65 and pERK/MAPK pathways. In vivo, DSS-induced acute colitis was significantly ameliorated in MBF-fed mice as gauged by weight loss, colon morphology and histological damage. In addition, MBF-fed MUC2(-/-) mice displayed significant decrease in intestinal tumor and  incidence compared to control diet-fed group. Overall, our results demonstrated that MBF suppressed the development of intestinal  and tumorgenesis both in vitro and in vivo, and supports the potential of MBF as a therapeutic functional food for testing in human clinical trials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28124089>Evening primrose oil or forskolin ameliorates celecoxib-enhanced upregulation of tissue factor expression in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia.</a></h1><p>Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, produces thrombotic events in patients predisposed to cardiovascular risk factors. One theory reported an increase in endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF) as a predisposing factor. This work explored the effect of evening primrose oil (EPO), a source of prostaglandin E1, and forskolin (a cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulator) against the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib in mice. Lipopolysaccharide mouse model of endotoxemia was used to induce an upregulation of TF activity. Male mice received celecoxib (25 mg/kg), celecoxib plus EPO, or celecoxib plus forskolin for 4 weeks and then subjected to a prothrombotic challenge in the form of an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide. Results showed an increase in plasma TF activity, endothelial TF expression, and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) but lower antithrombin III (ATIII) level in mice that received celecoxib in comparison to those that received the vehicle. Adding EPO or forskolin to celecoxib regimen significantly decreased the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib. A positive correlation (r = 0.8501) was found between TF activity and TAT. Co-administration of EPO or forskolin decreased the activity of TF and mitigated the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib. Therefore, these combinations may have the utility to abrogate the prothrombotic adverse effect of celecoxib in clinical setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604963>In vitro lipolytic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of roasted pistachio kernel and skin constituents.</a></h1><p>A comprehensive phytochemical analysis was conducted on pistachios to identify the differential contributions of skin and kernel phytochemicals to in vitro bioactivity. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of skin and kernel non-polar extracts (SNP and KNP, respectively) indicated that the major components are fatty acids (696.36 and 879.70 mg g), phytosterols (16.08 and 4.28 mg g), and γ-tocopherol (304.17 and 397.10 μg g). Analysis of the skin and kernel polar extracts (SP and KP, respectively) showed that skin accumulated higher levels of phenolic compounds, especially flavan-3-ols, compared to the kernel. An (epi)catechin hexoside was the major component in SP and KP (9.8 mg g and 3.3 mg g, respectively). Flavan-3-ols with different degrees of polymerization were detected in SP, but only the monomers were identified in the KP. Quercetin glycosides were the major flavonols present in both SP and KP. Bioassays with 3T3L1 mouse adipocytes demonstrated that all extracts decreased lipid accumulation, with SNP demonstrating the highest activity (17% inhibition). Bioassay guided fractionation of SNP indicated that the lipolytic activity was highest in the fraction consisting of linoleic  (20%),  (10%), and β-sitosterol (50%). Radical scavenging assays indicated that all pistachio extracts significantly inhibited ROS, while SP was the most inhibiting to NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Gene expression profiles associated with  (IL6, iNOS, and COX2) were characterized in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages after treatment with pistachio extracts.

Here, we examined the effects of flaxseed powder, which includes all flaxseed components, flaxseed oil, composed mainly of ALA, flaxseed lignan, and flaxseed fiber, on hypertension and renal damage induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt. Then, we investigated the mechanisms of action associated with the effects of flaxseed.Flaxseed powder, oil, lignan, or fiber was administered to DOCA-salt rats. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), urinary protein excretion, renal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, sympathetic nerve activity, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators in the kidney and hypothalamus were measured.Flaxseed powder and oil reduced the increases in SBP and urinary protein excretion induced by DOCA-salt treatment, whereas lignan and fiber had no effects. Flaxseed oil suppressed the increase in renal ACE activity, sympathetic nerve activity, and gene expression of renal and hypothalamic inflammatory mediators.Flaxseed has antihypertensive and renoprotective effects in DOCA-salt rats. These effects are likely principally exerted by ALA. Furthermore, the suppression of renal ACE activity, sympathetic nerve activity, and  is partly involved in the effects of flaxseed.© 2019 S.

Lipid profile, routine biochemical and hormone parameters were assayed by standard kit methods Serum EPA levels were significantly decreased while AA/EPA and DGLA/EPA ratio were significantly increased in acne vulgaris patients compared to controls. Serum levels of AA, DGLA and DHA showed no significant difference while activity of sPLA2 and LPL were significantly increased in acne vulgaris compared to controls. Results of this study reveal the presence of a proinflammatory state in acne vulgaris as shown by significantly decreased serum EPA levels and increased activity of sPLA2, AA/EPA and DGLA/EPA ratio. Increased LPL activity in the serum of acne vulgaris patients can be protective through its anti-dyslipidemic actions. This is the first study reporting altered EPA levels and increased sPLA2 activity in acne vulgaris and supports the use of omega-3 fatty acids as adjuvant treatment for acne patients.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the phytochemical composition and antioxidant properties of an infusion obtained from dried P. orientalis leaves against ethanol-induced oxidative stress (OS) in rats. After a toxicity test, thirty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Control, Ethanol 20%, Ethanol 20% + Silymarin (10 mg/kg), Ethanol 20% + PO-20 mg/mL infusion, and Ethanol 20% + PO-60 mg/mL infusion. The PO-leaf infusion doses were given ad libitum during 28 days to test the biochemical and antioxidant enzyme levels. According to the results, the PO-leaf contained rich compounds such as benzaldehyde, palmitic , 2,4-ditert-butylphenol, stearic , octadecanoic , linoleic , , kaempferol, and kaempferol derivatives. In the Ethanol group, AST, ALT, LDH, GGT, UA, and urea in the serum and GST and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and erythrocyte tissues showed a significant increase compared to the Control group. AST, LDH, GGT, UA, and LDL-C levels in the serum and MDA (all tissues) significantly decreased in the Ethanol + PO-60 mg/mL group compared to the Ethanol group. SOD, GPx, and CAT activities in the kidney tissue of the Ethanol group showed a significant decrease compared to the Control group, whereas the GPx activity in kidney tissue in all of the treatment groups increased significantly compared to the Ethanol group. These findings suggest that the administration of the determined PO-leaf infusion doses might have a protective role against ethanol-induced liver and kidney damage in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30140814>Anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of Rosa Mosqueta oil supplementation in rat liver ischemia-reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a deleterious condition associated with liver transplantation or resection that involves pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Considering that Rosa Mosqueta (RM) oil composition is rich in protective components such as α- (ALA) and tocopherols, we studied the effects of RM oil supplementation given prior to an IR protocol. Male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving RM oil (0.4 mL d-1) for 21 days were subjected to 1 h of ischemia followed by 20 h reperfusion. Parameters of liver injury (serum transaminases, histology), oxidative stress [liver contents of protein carbonyls, thiobarbituric  reactants, Nrf2 activity and its target mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1)] and  [nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and its target mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukine-1β (IL-1β)] were studied. RM oil increased liver ALA and its derived EPA and DHA fatty acids' contents, with enhancement in those of α- and γ-tocopherols. IR induced inflammatory liver injury, with enhancement in serum transaminases, oxidative stress-related parameters with reduced Nrf2 signaling, and higher pro-inflammatory cytokines, indexes that were attenuated or abrogated by RM oil pretreatment. It is concluded that RM oil supplementation represents a novel non-invasive preconditioning strategy against liver injury induced by IR that has potential clinical applications in metabolic stress conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28481011>Omega-3 fatty acids in prevention of diabetic retinopathy.</a></h1><p>To review the competence of Omega-3 fatty acids in restricting the progression, thereby leading to prevention of diabetic retinopathy.Owing to their anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties, Omega-3 fatty acids alleviate major aetiological agents.

When the animals were killed, blood plasma was isolated to test the level of TC, LDL-C, TNF-α, IL-6 and CRP by biochemistry analysis and ELISA method. The whole aorta and aortic root sections were also collected to study atherogenesis level and reveal the possible mechanism by histological examination, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis.The level of TC, LDL-C, TNF-α, IL-6 and CRP in plasma in H-LNA-LMWCS group were significantly lower than those of the control group (rosuvastatin calcium). Plaques in H-LNA-LMWCS group showed higher content of smooth muscle cells, lower content of lipid and macrophages, and lower mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6, CRP, MCP-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 than those in the control group. In addition, α-LNA-LMWCS could reduce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, inhibit expressions of p-ERK1/2, p-p38, MCP-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in mice aorta.α-LNA-LMWCS exhibited anti-atherosclerosis effect through regulating the lipid metabolism and diminishing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The possible mechanism may be that α-LNA-LMWCS could influence MAPK/ NF-κB related signal pathway.The results may provide significant suggestions for the application of α-LNA-LMWCS in anti-atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, the search for food components able to improve fish health is increasingly developing. Here, the influence of four dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are  (ALA, 18:3n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3) on the sensitivity of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles to environmentally realistic cadmium (Cd, 0.3 μg/L) concentration was investigated. Fish diets were designed to ensure the specific abundance of one of these individual PUFAs, and were given for a 4-week pre-conditioning period followed by a 6-week Cd exposure period. Focus was put on growth performance and immune responses following a short (24 h) and a long-term (6 weeks) Cd exposure. For each experimental condition, some fish were submitted to a bacterial challenge (24 h) with Aeromonas salmonicida achromogenes at the end of Cd conditioning period. DHA-enriched diet improved growth performances as compared to LA-enriched diet, but also increased ROS production (after short-term exposure to Cd) that could lead to a higher  status, and some immunity-related genes (at short and long-term exposure). We notably highlighted the fact that even a low, environmentally-realistic concentration, Cd can strongly impact the immune system of rainbow trout, and that specific dietary PUFA enrichment strategies can improve growth performance (DHA-enriched diet), provide protection against oxidative stress (ALA- and EPA-enriched diet) and stimulate non-specific immunity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The pups were scrutinized on the accounts of behavioral, biochemical, and inflammatory markers, and the results suggested that the GLA can impart significant protection in comparison to ALA against VPA-induced autism features. When scrutinized histopathologically, the cerebellum of the GLA-treated animals was evident for more marked protection toward neuronal degeneration and neuronal loss in comparison to ALA. Concomitant administration of ALA and GLA with VPA demonstrated a marked cutdown in the Pgp 9.5 expression with GLA having more pronounced effect.

We performed a narrative review to evaluate the existing evidence regarding the optimum diet for the management of CP, and we built a food pyramid on this topic. The present review also describes the activities of various natural compounds contained in foods (i.e. phenolic compounds in extra-virgin olive oil (EVO)) listed on our pyramid, which have comparable effects to drug management therapy. This review included 172 eligible studies. The pyramid shows that carbohydrates with low glycaemic index should be consumed every day (three portions), together with fruits and vegetables (five portions), yogurt (125 ml), red wine (125 ml) and EVO; weekly: legumes and fish (four portions); white meat, eggs and fresh cheese (two portions); red or processed meats (once per week); sweets can be consumed occasionally. The food amounts are estimates based on nutritional and practical considerations. At the top of the pyramid there is a pennant: it means that CP subjects may need a specific customised supplementation (vitamin B12, vitamin D, n-3 fatty acids, fibre). The food pyramid proposal will serve to guide dietary intake with to the intent of alleviating pain in CP patients. Moreover, a targeted diet can also help to solve problems related to the drugs used to combat CP, i.e. constipation.

It was also reported to possess antihypertensive, diuretic, anti-asthmatic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Attempt has been made to study hepatoprotective potential of LSS available in Saudi Arabian Market. The aim of the present study was to determine the hepatoprotective effect of ethanolic extracts of LSS against carbon tetrachloride (CCl) induced acute liver injury in rats. The bioactive compounds responsible for this activity have been analyzed by GC⿿MS. To evaluate the hepatoprotective activity, six groups ( = 6) of rats were taken. First group was control, second was toxic and other groups received oral test solutions: 100 mg/kg silymarin, or LSS (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), once daily for 7 consecutive days, followed by hepatotoxicity induction with CCl. Blood and liver tissues were collected for biochemical, antioxidant and microscopic analyses. The bioactive constituents present in the extract were analyzed by GC⿿MS. Results showed that pretreatment with LSS and silymarin significantly reduced the level of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin (BIL), which was increased significantly in toxic group treated with only CCl. Histological analysis of liver tissues in groups pretreated with LSS and silymarin showed mild necrosis and  of the hepatocytes compared to the toxic group. GC⿿MS analysis of LSS showed the presence of twelve major fatty acids including  as a major constituent. These results indicated that LSS exerts enhance hepatoprotective activity that could be attributed towards its antioxidant activity, coupled together with the presence of anti-inflammatory compounds in LSS extract.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29331316>Pharmacological activities of the organic extracts and fatty  composition of the petroleum ether extract from Haplophyllum tuberculatum leaves.</a></h1><p>Haplophyllum tuberculatum is used in traditional medicine to treat many disorders including  and pain.

Anti-inflammatory activity was also evaluated in vivo using carrageenan-induced paw edema in Wistar rats. Gastroprotective activity was tested using the HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulcer test in rats. Peripheral and central analgesic activities were assessed using the acetic -induced writhing test and the hot-plate method, respectively. The chemical composition of the fatty acids in the petroleum ether (PE) extract was determined with GC-MS.At 25, 50 and 100mg/kg PE extract was the most active against . Percentages inhibition 5h after carrageenan-injection were 51.12; 86.71% and 96.92%, respectively. The same extract at 100mg/kg showed good analgesic activities using the acetic -induced writhing test and the hot-plate method. The chloroform, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and butanolic (n-BuOH) extracts exhibited strong anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and analgesic activities at 100mg/kg. The GC-FID analysis revealed that the PE extract was rich in γ- (45.50%) followed by palmitic  (18.48%), linoleic  (10.73%), erucic  (4.72), stearic  (3.96%) and oleic  (2.57%).The results of the present study support the traditional use of the leaves of H. tuberculatum and may possibly serve as prospective material for further development of safe new phytochemical anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and/or analgesic agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the metabolic and molecular changes induced by the omega-3 fatty  α- (ALA), which is found in linseed oil, are not fully understood. In this study, we showed a correlation between ALA and insulin resistance,  and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS).We studied 40 male mice (C57/BL6) divided into 4 groups: a control (C) group, a control + omega-3/ALA (CA) group, a high-fat diet (HFD) (H) group and a high-fat diet + omega-3/ALA (HA) group. For 8 weeks, the animals in the H and HA groups were fed a high-fat (60%) diet, while the animals in the C and CA groups received regular chow. The diets of the CA and HA groups were supplemented with 10% lyophilized ALA.ALA supplementation improved glucose tolerance and reduced insulin resistance, as measured by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, respectively. In addition, ALA reduced hepatic steatosis and modified the standard fat concentration in the liver of animals fed an HFD. Dietary ALA supplementation reduced the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), increased the expression of important chaperones such as binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and reduced the expression of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) in hepatic tissues, suggesting an ERS adaptation in response to ALA supplementation.Dietary ALA supplementation is effective in preventing hepatic steatosis; is associated with a reduction in insulin resistance,  and ERS; and represents an alternative for improving liver function and obtaining metabolic benefits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340612>N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Decrease Long-Term Diabetic Risk of Offspring of Gestational Diabetes Rats by Postponing Shortening of Hepatic Telomeres and Modulating Liver Metabolism.</a></h1><p>The long-term influence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on offspring and the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on GDM offspring are poorly understood. We studied the long-term diabetic risk in GDM offspring and evaluated the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention. Healthy offspring rats were fed standard diet (soybean oil) after weaning. GDM offspring were divided into three groups: GDM offspring (soybean oil), n-3 PUFA adequate offspring (fish oil), and n-3 PUFA deficient offspring (safflower oil), fed up to 11 months old. The diabetic risk of GDM offspring gradually increased from no change at weaning to obvious impaired glucose and insulin tolerance at 11 months old. N-3 PUFA decreased oxidative stress and  in the liver of older GDM offspring. There was a differential effect of n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA on hepatic telomere length in GDM offspring. Non-targeted metabolomics showed that n-3 PUFA played a modulating role in the liver, in which numerous metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered when GDM offspring grew to old age. Many metabolites were related to diabetes risk, such as α-, palmitic , ceramide, oxaloacetic , tocotrienol, tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol, andniacinamide. In summary, GDM offspring exhibited obvious diabetes risk at old age, whereas n-3 PUFA decreased this risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30105961>Serum fatty acids and progression from dengue fever to dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome.</a></h1><p>PUFA might modulate inflammatory responses involved in the development of severe dengue. We aimed to examine whether serum PUFA concentrations in patients diagnosed with dengue fever (DF) were related to the risk of progression to dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). A secondary aim was to assess correlations between fatty acids (FA) and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with DF. We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within a cohort of patients who were diagnosed with DF and followed during the acute episode. We compared the distribution of individual FA (% of total FA) at onset of fever between 109 cases who progressed to DHF/DSS and 235 DF non-progressing controls using unconditional logistic regression. We estimated correlations between baseline FA and cytokine concentrations and compared FA concentrations between the acute episode and >1 year post-convalescence in a subgroup. DHA was positively related to progression to DHF/DSS (multivariable adjusted OR (AOR) for DHA in quintile 5 v. 1=5·34, 95 % CI 2·03, 14·1; P trend=0·007). Dihomo-γ- (DGLA) was inversely associated with progression (AOR for quintile 5 v. 1=0·30, 95 % CI 0·13, 0·69; P trend=0·007). Pentadecanoic  concentrations were inversely related to DHF/DSS. Correlations of PUFA with cytokines at baseline were low. PUFA were lower during the acute episode than in a disease-free period. In conclusion, serum DHA in patients with DF predicts higher odds of progression to DHF/DSS whereas DGLA and pentadecanoic  predict lower odds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832159>A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Delta-5 Desaturase Lowers Insulin Resistance and Reduces Body Weight in Diet-Induced Obese C57BL/6J Mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity is now recognized as a state of chronic low-grade  and is called as metabolic . Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to arachidonic  (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti-obesity effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA/DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily energy expenditure was also observed following administration of compound-326, in line with sustained body weight loss. These data indicate that the novel D5D selective inhibitor, compound-326, will be a new class of drug for the treatment of obese and diabetic patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814550>Serum Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Correlate with Serum Cytokines and Clinical Disease Activity in Crohn's Disease.</a></h1><p>Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with an increased consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), while greater intake of n-3 PUFA has been associated with a reduced risk. We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty acids with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non-IBD controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients. Nine serum cytokines and adipokines were increased in CD versus controls. CD subjects had increased percentage serum monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), dihomo-gamma  (DGLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and oleic , but decreased arachidonic  (AA) versus controls. The % total n-3 fatty acids and % EPA directly correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI, whereas the % total n-6 fatty acids were inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI. CD subjects had increased caloric intake versus controls, but no alterations in total fat or PUFA intake. We found differences in serum fatty acids, most notably PUFA, in CD that correlated both with clinical disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. Our findings indicate that altered fatty  metabolism or utilization is present in CD and is related to disease activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29310736>Anti-inflammatory effects of conjugated linoleic  isomers and essential fatty acids in bovine mammary epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Fatty acids are important modulators of inflammatory responses, in particular, n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids and CLA have received particular attention for their ability to modulate . The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of CLA and essential fatty acids on the expression of pro and anti- inflammatory cytokines and their protective efficacy against inflammatory status in mammary gland by an in vitro model based on bovine mammary epithelial cells (BME-UV1). Bovine mammary epithelial cells were treated with complete medium containing either 50 µM of cis-9, trans-11 CLA (c9,t11 CLA) or trans-10, cis-12 CLA (t10,c12 CLA) or (α)- (aLnA) or (γ)- (gLnA) or linoleic  (LA). After 48 h by fatty acids administration the cells were treated for 3 h with 20 µM of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammatory stimulus. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after treatments was assessed to verify and to compare the potential protection of different fatty acids against LPS-induced oxidative stress. The messenger RNA abundance of bovine pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukine-10 (IL-10)) and peroxisome proliferator receptor-α/γ (PPARγ/α) were determined in BME-UV1 by real-time PCR. The results showed that cells treated with fatty acids and LPS increased ROS production compared with control cells. Among treatments, cells treated with c9,t11 CLA and t10,c12 CLA isomers revealed significant lower levels of ROS production compared with other fatty acids. All fatty acids reduced the gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Among fatty acids, t10,c12 CLA, LA and gLnA showed an homogeneous reduction of the three pro-inflammatory cytokines and this may correspond to more balanced and efficient physiological activity and may trigger a better protective effect. The PPARγ gene expression was significantly greater in cells treated with t10,c12 CLA, aLnA and LA, whereas the PPARα gene expression levels were significantly lower in cells treated with all different fatty acids, compared with the control. These results suggest that fatty acids inhibited the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the upregulation of PPARγ expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170643>Acute effects of diets rich in almonds and walnuts on endothelial function.</a></h1><p>Omega-3 fatty acids, especially  (ALA), which are present in nuts may reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, by changing vascular  and improving endothelial dysfunction. The objective of the study was to evaluate the acute effects of two different diets, one containing walnuts and the other almonds on endothelial function.Twenty-seven overweight volunteers underwent a randomized 2-period, crossover, controlled intervention study. The subjects were given either walnut or almond diets which varied in monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) content. The walnut diet provided 23.1% energy from PUFA and the almond diet provided 7.6% energy from PUFA. Endothelial function was assessed physiologically by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and biochemically by sVCAM (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecules).The walnut diet significantly improved FMD (p=0.004) and decreased sVCAM (p=0.009) whereas the almond diet tended to improve FMD (p=0.06) and significantly decreased sVCAM (p=0.004).Both walnut and almond diets improved FMD and sVCAM and there was no significant difference in physiological and biochemical markers between the two diets.Copyright © 2018.

Potential beneficial effects of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), such as α-, eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  on hemorheology, vascular function,  and potential to improve physical performance as well as other CV parameters are currently investigated. Recent meta-analysis suggests no effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on CV function and outcomes of CV diseases. On the other hand, some studies support beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs dietary intake on CV and muscular system, as well as on immune responses in healthy and in CV patients. Furthermore, the interaction of exercise and dietary n-3 PUFA intake is understudied. Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs has been shown to have antithrombotic effects (by decreasing blood viscosity, decreasing coagulation factor and PAI-1 levels and platelet aggregation/reactivity, enhancing fibrinolysis, but without effects on erythrocyte deformability). They decrease  by decreasing IL-6, MCP-1, TNFα and hsCRP levels, expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules and significantly affect blood composition of fatty acids. Treatment with n-3 PUFAs enhances brachial artery blood flow and conductance during exercise and enhances microvascular post-occlusive hyperemic response in healthy humans, however, the effects are unknown in cardiovascular patients. Supplementation of n-3 PUFAs may improve anaerobic endurance and may modulate oxygen consumption during intense exercise, may increase metabolic capacity, enhance endurance capacity delaying the onset of fatigue, and improving muscle hypertrophy and neuromuscular function in humans and animal models. In addition, n-3 PUFAs have anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects and may attenuate delayed-onset muscle soreness and muscle stiffness, and preserve joint mobility. On the other hand, effects of n-3 PUFAs were variably observed in men and women and they vary depending on dietary protocol, type of supplementation and type of sports activity undertaken, both in healthy and cardiovascular patients. In this review we will discuss the physiological effects of n-3 PUFA intake and exercise on hemorheology, microvascular function, immunomodulation and  and physical performance in healthy persons and in cardiovascular diseases; elucidating if there is an interaction of exercise and diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29501845>Acetone fraction from Sechium edule (Jacq.) S.w. edible roots exhibits anti-endothelial dysfunction activity.</a></h1><p>A recent ethnomedical survey on medicinal plants grown in Mexico revealed that Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw. (Cucurbitaceae) is one of the most valued plant species to treat cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. Fruits, young leaves, buds, stems, and tuberous roots of the plant are edible. Considering that endothelial dysfunction induced by Angiotensin II plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and is accompanied by a prooxidative condition, which in turn induces an inflammatory state, vascular remodeling, and tissue damage, and that S. edule has been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activity, its capability to control endothelial dysfunction was also assessed.To assess in vivo the anti-endothelial dysfunction activity of the acetone fraction (rSe-ACE) of the hydroalcoholic extract from S. edule roots.Endothelial dysfunction was induced in female C57BL/6 J mice by a daily intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II for 10 weeks. Either rSe-ACE or losartan (as a control) were co-administered with angiotensin II for the same period. Blood pressure was measured at weeks 0, 5, and 10. Kidney extracts were prepared to determine IL1β, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL17, IFNγ, TNFα, and TGFβ levels by ELISA, along with the prooxidative status as assessed by the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The expression of ICAM-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in kidney histological sections. Kidney and hepatic damage, as well as vascular tissue remodeling, were studied.The rSe-ACE fraction administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg was able to control hypertension, as well as the prooxidative and proinflammatory status in kidney as efficiently as losartan, returning mice to normotensive levels. Additionally, the fraction was more efficient than losartan to prevent liver and kidney damage. Phytochemical characterization identified cinnamic  as a major compound, and linoleic, palmitic, and myristic acids as the most abundant non-polar components in the mixture, previously reported to aid in the control of hypertension, , and oxidative stress, three important components of endothelial dysfunction.this study demonstrated that rSe-ACE has anti-endothelial dysfunction activity in an experimental model and highlights the role of cinnamic  and fatty acids in the observed effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Levels of plant delivered oils as source of fatty acids (FA) in aquafeeds have reached around 70% resulting in reduced levels of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), in salmon fillet composition. EPA and DHA can modulate  and immune response, so it is crucial to understand how fish immune response is affected by low LC n-3 PUFA diet and if this diet can have a detrimental effect on vaccine response. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can produce EPA/DHA from α- (ALA) and this endogenous capacity can be explored to develop families with higher tolerance to low LC n-3 PUFA diets. Here we analyze innate and adaptive immune response in Atlantic salmon to a commercial vaccine after being fed low levels of EPA and DHA, and we also compare three strains of salmon selected by their endogenous capacity of synthesizing LC- n-3 PUFA. A total of 2,890 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (p-value adjusted < 0.1) when comparing vaccinated fish against control non-vaccinated. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis with 442 up/downregulated genes revealed that most DEGs were both related to immune response as well as part of important immune related pathways, as "Toll-like receptor" and "Cytokine-Cytokine interaction". Adaptive response was also addressed by measuring antigen specific IgM, and titers were significantly higher than in the pre-immune fish at 62 days post-immunization. However, diet and strain had no/little effect on vaccine-specific IgM or innate immune responses. Atlantic salmon therefore display robustness in its response to vaccination even when feed low levels of LC n-3 PUFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423681>Effects of Fatty Acids on CYP2A5 and Nrf2 Expression in Mouse Primary Hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Abnormal fatty  metabolism is observed throughout nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis, and fatty  storage is an important inducing factor in insulin resistance, lipid oxidation, hepatic cell damage, and . During NAFLD pathogenesis, changes in blood and liver contents of different fatty  types also vary. Cytochrome P450 2A5 (CYP2A5), an important enzyme in mouse liver, metabolizes many drugs and activates multiple pro-carcinogens with widely varying structures. According to the changes in liver fatty  profiles observed in NAFLD animal models developed in our laboratory and others, saturated (PA/palmitic, and SA/stearic acids) and unsaturated (OA/oleic, LA/linoleic, ALA/α- and AA/arachidonic acids) fatty acids were selected to induce mouse primary hepatocytes, at concentrations under 1 mM, as detected by MTT assay. After 24 h treatment with various fatty  concentrations and types, CYP2A5 mRNA and protein amounts, and enzyme activity were determined by real-time PCR, Western blot, and Coumarin 7-hydroxylation, respectively. Meanwhile, Nrf2 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot. The results indicated that saturated fatty acids are more potent in inducing CYP2A5 than unsaturated ones, except arachidonic . In addition, the changes in CYP2A5 expression were consistent with the alterations observed in Nrf2 expression, indicating that Nrf2 might play a regulatory role in CYP2A5 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129737>Endotoxemia is modulated by quantity and quality of dietary fat in older adults.</a></h1><p>Aging is an important determinant of the rate of atherosclerosis development, mainly through low-grade . Diet, and particularly its fat content, modulates the inflammatory response in fasting and postprandial states.We aimed to study the effects of dietary fat on endotoxemia in healthy older adults.Twenty healthy older adults were randomized to three diets, lasting three-weeks each, using a crossover design: 1. A Mediterranean diet enriched in MUFA with virgin olive oil. 2. An SFA-rich diet. 3. A low-fat high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-3 PUFA (α- of plant origin) (CHO-PUFA diet). At the end of each period, after a 12-h fast, the subjects received a meal with a composition similar to the dietary period just completed. We determined the fasting and the postprandial plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP).In the fasting state, we observed lower LPS plasma levels after the consumption of the CHO-PUFA diet (P=0.046) in comparison with the consumption of the Med and SFA-rich diets. In the postprandial measurements, we observed a statistically significant increase in plasma levels of LPS (P=0.044) and a decrease in LBP (P=0.003) after the intake of the CHO-PUFA meal, whereas no postprandial changes were observed after the ingestion of the Med and SFA-rich meals.Our results, together with those obtained in a previous study, support the concept that the consumption of the Med Diet, in contrast to a low-fat PUFA diet, constitutes a more suitable dietary lifestyle for preventing the development of atherosclerosis in a population at risk, such as older adults.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim was to investigate cross-sectional associations of the serum n-6 PUFAs, objective biomarkers for exposure, with serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a key  marker.The study included 1287 generally healthy men aged 42-60 years from the population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, examined in 1984-1989. ANCOVA and logistic regression were used for analyses.In the multivariable-adjusted analyses, both serum total n-6 PUFA and linoleic , the predominant n-6 PUFA, were associated with lower CRP. The mean CRP concentrations in quartiles of linoleic  were 1.86, 1.51, 1.53, and 1.37 mg/L (P-trend = 0.001). The odds ratio for elevated CRP (>3 mg/L) in the highest vs. the lowest quartile was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.87, P-trend = 0.01). Arachidonic  or the mainly endogenously produced n-6 PUFAs, gamma- and dihomo-gamma-, were not associated with higher CRP, either.

AD pathogenesis remains elusive, but may involve complex interplays among skin barrier dysfunction, Th2 , and pruritus. Current treatments for AD are still limited to symptomatic therapies. We previously showed that HR-1 hairless mice fed a special diet (HR-AD) develop AD-like symptoms; however, the ingredient(s) causing dermatitis remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the deficiency of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was involved in the diet-induced AD pathogenesis. In the serum of HR-AD-fed mice, levels of linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) and α- (ALA, 18:3n-3), as well as their metabolites, were markedly decreased. HR-AD-induced AD symptoms were significantly ameliorated by LA supplementation, and to a lesser extent by ALA supplementation. In addition, LA metabolites, such as γ- and arachidonic , had effects similar to those of LA. Further, using semi-purified custom diets, we attempted to reproduce HR-AD-induced AD symptoms. Unexpectedly, a deficiency in unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) alone caused mild symptoms. However, several modifications of fat and carbohydrate components in the diet revealed that dietary deficiencies of UFA and cornstarch were required to fully induce severe AD symptoms. Furthermore, we examined the influence of genetic background on the development of diet-induced AD and found that a hypomorphic mutation in the hairless gene Hr, encoding a nuclear receptor (NR) corepressor, was essential for the complete development of diet-induced pruritic atopic skin. Thus, our findings suggest that certain PUFAs and NRs are new, potential therapeutic targets for treating AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30479041>Protective effect of silkworm pupa oil on hydrochloric /ethanol-induced gastric ulcers.</a></h1><p>Silkworm pupae are a traditional Chinese food, rich in various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids have a certain protective effect against oxidative damage. The present study used an animal model to determine the protective effect of silkworm pupa oil on hydrochloric  / ethanol-induced gastric ulcer.Silkworm pupa oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including palmitoleic  63.4 g kg , oleic  249.1 g kg , linoleic  47.0 g kg , and  337.8 g kg , whereas its unsaturated fatty  content is 700 g kg . Compared to a gastric ulcer control group, high and low doses of pupa oil reduced gastric ulcer area and gastric secretion, whereas gastric pH increased. It also increased serum antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels, somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels, and reduced serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), motilin (MTL), and gastrin (GT) levels.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic  and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

In this study, we applied a methodology developed using rodents to investigate the whole-body, presumably hepatic, synthesis-secretion rates of esterified n-3 PUFA from circulating unesterified ALA in 2 healthy overweight women after 10 weeks of low-linoleate diet exposure. During continuous iv infusion of d5-ALA, 17 arterial blood samples were collected from each subject at -10, 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, and 210 min, and at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 h after beginning infusion. Plasma esterified d5-n-3 PUFA concentrations were plotted against the infusion time and fit to a sigmoidal curve using nonlinear regression. These curves were used to estimate kinetic parameters using a kinetic analysis developed using rodents. Calculated synthesis-secretion rates of esterified eicosapentaenoate, n-3 docosapentaenoate, docosahexaenoic , tetracosapentaenate, and tetracosahexaenoate from circulating unesterified ALA were 2.1 and 2.7; 1.7 and 5.3; 0.47 and 0.27; 0.30 and 0.30; and 0.32 and 0.27 mg/day for subjects S01 and S02, respectively.

Rats were divided into control, tunicamycin (TM)-treated, and TM + tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA)-treated groups. Hepatic ER stress was induced by TM and the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA was injected 30 min before induction of ER stress. Liver THLE-3 cells were treated with TM and TUDCA was administered in advance to decrease cytotoxic effects. Necroinflammation was evaluated in liver sections, while cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit. ER stress was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of C/EBP-homologous protein and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein.

Although a link between diet and periodontal health exists, the relation between diet and healing after periodontal therapy has yet to be investigated.The objective was to determine whether higher intakes of fruits and vegetables or nutrients with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activity are associated with greater healing, measured as reduced probing depth (PD), after scaling and root planing (SRP), a cost-effective treatment to manage periodontal disease and prevent tooth loss.Patients (63 nonsmokers, 23 smokers) with chronic generalized periodontitis who were undergoing SRP participated. Healing was evaluated based on PD, assessed at baseline and 8-16 wk after SRP. Intakes of fruits, vegetables, β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol, α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were estimated using the Block 2005 food frequency questionnaire and a supplement questionnaire. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were also measured. PD (% sites >3 mm) was modeled in multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance by tertile of intake and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), baseline PD, examiner, gingival bleeding, and study duration.In nonsmokers, PD was associated with fruit and vegetable, β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol, EPA, and DHA intakes (P < 0.05). PD was not significantly associated with ALA intake or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Significant associations that included supplements (β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol) were attenuated or lost, depending on the statistical model used. There were no significant associations within the group of smokers.Dietary intakes of fruits and vegetables, β-carotene, vitamin C, α-tocopherol, EPA, and DHA are associated with reduced PD after SRP in nonsmokers, but not smokers, with chronic generalized periodontitis.

Although the disease progression is becoming better understood, current medical interventions can only ameliorate some of the symptoms but cannot slow disease progression. Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the advancement of this disorder, and n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved in both the reduction in and resolution of . These effects may be mediated by the anti-inflammatory and proresolving effects of bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) derived from n-3 PUFAs [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] in fish oil. Although interventions have generally used fish oil containing both EPA and DHA, several studies that used either EPA or DHA alone or specific oxylipins derived from these fatty acids indicate that they have distinct effects. Both DHA and EPA can reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive decline, but EPA positively influences mood disorders, whereas DHA maintains normal brain structure. Fewer studies with a plant-derived n-3 PUFA, α-, suggest that other n-3 PUFAs and their oxylipins also may positively affect AD.

Their topical application in eye drops to deliver fatty  (FA) directly to the ocular surface requires thorough investigation. Being lipids in nature EFAs can interact with tear lipids and affect tear stability. This study aimed at investigating the biophysical interactions of EFAs with Meibomian lipids.Rheology of mixtures of Human Meibomian lipids with EFAs (LA-linoleic , ALA-), OA (oleic ), and GLA (gamma-) was studied using Langmuir trough technology on an artificial tear solution at the ocular surface temperature. Pressure-area profiles were used to determine compressibility and elasticity of the mixed films.LA enhanced spreading of Meibomian lipids and increased their compressibility and elasticity which can be beneficial for tear stability. ALA condensed Meibomian lipids film with less elasticity deemed unfavourable for tear stability. OA expanded Meibomian lipids but decreased elasticity at high compressions making films less stable. GLA had little or no favourable effect on tear stability. Higher concentrations of FAs made films less stable.EFAs or OA in topical ophthalmic preparations can affect spread and stability of the tear film lipid layer. Rheology of mixed films should be tested using Langmuir trough technology to determine suitable type and amount of a lipid additive for therapeutic eye drops. In topical applications, the omega-6 LA (not omega-3 FA) at low concentrations (20 mol%) can be beneficial for enhancing tear stability in dry eye patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, evidence regarding plant-based α- (ALA), the major n-3 PUFA in the Western diet, remains equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of lifelong exposure to plant- or marine-derived n-3 PUFAs on pubertal mammary gland and tumor development in MMTV-neu(ndl)-YD5 mice. It is hypothesized that lifelong exposure to n-3 PUFA reduces terminal end buds during puberty leading to delayed tumor onset, volume and multiplicity. It is further hypothesized that plant-derived n-3 PUFAs will exert dose-dependent effects. Harems of MMTV-FVB males were bred with wild-type females and fed either a (1) 10% safflower (10% SF, n-6 PUFA, control), (2) 10% flaxseed (10% FS), (3) 7% safflower plus 3% flaxseed (3% FS) or (4) 7% safflower plus 3% menhaden (3% FO) diet. Female offspring were maintained on parental diets. Compared to SF, 10% FS and 3% FO reduced (P<.05) terminal end buds at 6 weeks and tumor volume and multiplicity at 20 weeks. A dose-dependent reduction of tumor volume and multiplicity was observed in mice fed 3% and 10% FS. Antitumorigenic effects were associated with altered HER2, pHER-2, pAkt and Ki-67 protein expression. Compared to 10% SF, 3% FO significantly down-regulated expression of genes involved in eicosanoid synthesis and . From this, it can be estimated that ALA was 1/8 as potent as EPA+DHA.

Perilla oil (PO) is a vegetable oil rich in α- (ALA), an n-3 PUFA. In this study, antiatherogenic effects and related mechanisms of PO were investigated in atherosclerotic mice. Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice (male, n = 27) were fed high-cholesterol and high-fat diets containing 10 % w/w lard (LD), PO, or sunflower oil (SO) for 10 weeks. Plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations reduced in the PO and SO groups compared to the concentrations in the LD group (P < 0.05). The PO group showed reduced fatty streak lesion size at the aortic sinus (P < 0.05) compared to the sizes in the LD and SO groups. A morphometric analysis showed enhancement of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the PO group compared to that in the LD group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, aortic protein expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 was diminished in the PO group compared to that in the LD and SO groups (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that PO inhibited the development of aortic atherosclerosis by improving the plasma lipid profile, regulating nitric oxide synthase, and suppressing the vascular inflammatory response in the aorta of ApoE KO mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526097>Abundance of active ingredients in sea-buckthorn oil.</a></h1><p>Vegetable oils are obtained by mechanical extraction or cold pressing of various parts of plants, most often: seeds, fruits, and drupels. Chemically, these oils are compounds of the ester-linked glycerol and higher fatty acids with long aliphatic chain hydrocarbons (min. C14:0). Vegetable oils have a variety of properties, depending on their percentage of saturation. This article describes sea-buckthorn oil, which is extracted from the well characterized fruit and seeds of sea buckthorn. The plant has a large number of active ingredients the properties of which are successfully used in the cosmetic industry and in medicine. Valuable substances contained in sea-buckthorn oil play an important role in the proper functioning of the human body and give skin a beautiful and healthy appearance. A balanced composition of fatty acids give the number of vitamins or their range in this oil and explains its frequent use in cosmetic products for the care of dry, flaky or rapidly aging skin. Moreover, its unique unsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitooleic  (omega-7) and gamma- (omega-6), give sea-buckthorn oil skin regeneration and repair properties. Sea-buckthorn oil also improves blood circulation, facilitates oxygenation of the skin, removes excess toxins from the body and easily penetrates through the epidermis. Because inside the skin the gamma- is converted to prostaglandins, sea-buckthorn oil protects against infections, prevents allergies, eliminates  and inhibits the aging process. With close to 200 properties, sea-buckthorn oil is a valuable addition to health and beauty products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29039280>Very long-chain n-3 fatty acids and human health: fact, fiction and the future.</a></h1><p>EPA and DHA appear to be the most important n-3 fatty acids, but roles for n-3 docosapentaenoic  are now also emerging. Intakes of EPA and DHA are usually low, typically below those recommended. Increased intakes result in higher concentrations of EPA and DHA in blood lipids, cells and tissues. Increased content of EPA and DHA modifies the structure of cell membranes and the function of membrane proteins. EPA and DHA modulate the production of lipid mediators and through effects on cell signalling can alter the patterns of gene expression. Through these mechanisms, EPA and DHA alter cell and tissue responsiveness in a way that often results in more optimal conditions for growth, development and maintenance of health. DHA has vital roles in brain and eye development and function. EPA and DHA have a wide range of physiological roles, which are linked to certain health or clinical benefits, particularly related to CVD, cancer,  and neurocognitive function. The benefits of EPA and DHA are evident throughout the life course. Future research will include better identification of the determinants of variation of responses to increased intake of EPA and DHA; more in-depth dose-response studies of the effects of EPA and DHA; clearer identification of the specific roles of EPA, docosapentaenoic  and DHA; testing strategies to enhance delivery of n-3 fatty acids to the bloodstream; and exploration of sustainable alternatives to fish-derived very long-chain n-3 fatty acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29510469>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Intestinal Damage and  by Regulating Necroptosis and TLR4/NOD Signaling Pathways Following Lipopolysaccharide Challenge in a Piglet Model.</a></h1><p>Flaxseed oil is a rich source of α- (ALA), which is the precursor of the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). This study investigates the protective effect of flaxseed oil against intestinal injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Twenty-four weaned pigs were used in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment with dietary treatment (5% corn oil vs 5% flaxseed oil) and LPS challenge (saline vs LPS). On day 21 of the experiment, pigs were administrated with LPS or saline. At 2 h and 4 h post-administration, blood samples were collected. After the blood harvest at 4 h, all piglets were slaughtered and intestinal samples were collected. Flaxseed oil supplementation led to the enrichment of ALA, EPA, and total n-3 PUFAs in intestine. Flaxseed oil improved intestinal morphology, jejunal lactase activity, and claudin-1 protein expression. Flaxseed oil downregulated the mRNA expression of intestinal necroptotic signals. Flaxseed oil also downregulated the mRNA expression of intestinal toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and its downstream signals myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins 1, 2 (NOD1, NOD2) and its adapter molecule, receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2).These results suggest that dietary addition of flaxseed oil enhances intestinal integrity and barrier function, which is involved in modulating necroptosis and TLR4/NOD signaling pathways.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It suppresses the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and delivers gamma-. The objective of this clinical trial was to determine the effect of Borago officinalis on clinical and physiological findings in moderate persistent asthma.This prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted on patients aged 15-90 years with moderate asthma and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 60-79% of predicted who presented to a sub-specialty clinic of pulmonary medicine. We randomly allocated subjects to receive either Borago extract (5 mL three times a day) or a matched placebo for one month. The primary outcome was the asthma control test (ACT) score and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) test. Secondary outcomes included clinical findings, spirometry, and sputum cytology including inflammatory cells.Thirty-eight subjects with a mean age of 46.8±15.3 years and mean duration of asthma of 71±103 months were enrolled in our study. Cough, dyspnea, wheezing, nocturnal symptoms, and airway hyper-responsiveness reduced significantly in the Borago group after the treatment and ACT scores improved significantly (10.8±5.26 before and 15.4±5.12 after the trial). Flare up of asthma and emergency department visits in the Borago group also decreased significantly (3.6±2.33 to 2±1.86 flare ups per month and 0.62±0.9 to 0.05±0.23 for emergency department visits per month).

However, the clinical significance of omega-6 PUFAs in acute cardiovascular disease remains unknown.We enrolled 417 consecutive patients with acute cardiovascular disease admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit at Juntendo University Hospital between April 2012 and October 2013. We investigated the association between serum PUFA levels and long-term mortality. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast, within 24 h of admission. We excluded patients who received eicosapentaenoic  therapy and those with malignancy, end-stage kidney disease, chronic hepatic disease, and connective tissue disease.Overall, 306 patients (mean age: 66.4 ± 15.0 years) were analysed. During the follow-up period of 2.4 ± 1.2 years, 50 patients (16.3%) died. The dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) levels, arachidonic  (AA) levels, and DGLA/AA ratio were significantly lower in the nonsurvivor group than in the survivor group (DGLA: 23.2 ± 9.8 vs. 31.5 ± 12.0 μg/ml, AA: 151.1 ± 41.6 vs. 173.3 ± 51.6 μg/ml, and DGLA/AA: 0.16 ± 0.05 vs. 0.19 ± 0.06, all p < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that survival rates were significantly higher in the higher DGLA, AA, and DGLA/AA groups than in their lower counterparts (DGLA and AA; p < 0.01, DGLA/AA; p = 0.01), although omega-3 PUFAs were not associated with prognosis. Furthermore, in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), survival rates were significantly higher in the higher DGLA, AA, and DGLA/AA groups than in their lower counterparts (DGLA and AA; p < 0.01, DGLA/AA; p = 0.04). However, among patients with acute coronary syndrome, none of the PUFA levels were associated with prognosis. Among patients with ADHF, after controlling for confounding variables, DGLA and DGLA/AA were associated with long-term mortality [DGLA: hazard ratio (HR), 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-0.99; p = 0.01 and DGLA/AA: HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.97; p < 0.01], whereas AA was not associated with prognosis.Low omega-6 PUFA levels, particularly DGLA, and a low DGLA/AA ratio predict long-term mortality in patients with acute cardiovascular disease and ADHF.UMIN-CTR; UMIN000007555 .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034953>Anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of Dan-Lou tablets in the treatment of coronary heart disease revealed by metabolomics integrated with molecular mechanism studies.</a></h1><p>The Dan-Lou tablet (DLT), a well-known Chinese prescription, has definitive clinical efficacy in the treatment of precordial discomfort and pain caused by coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the pharmacological mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD has not been clearly elucidated and needs to be further explored.We aimed to identify relevant biological pathways by assessing changes in biomarkers in response to DLT intervention in CHD to reveal the potential biological mechanism of DLT treatment for CHD.The major chemical components in DLT were qualitatively analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), and a model of CHD in rats was subsequently established with a high-fat diet and left anterior coronary artery ligation (LADCA) followed by DLT intervention. Next, the metabolic profile of rat serum samples was analyzed using nontargeted metabolomics, wherein changes in the metabolites in serum samples before and after DLT administration were measured by PLS-DA, and two pathways of DLT treatment for CHD were predicted. Finally, predicted metabolomic pathways were verified by detecting and analyzing tissues from the rat model, revealing the mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD.Forty-five major chemical components were identified by the chemical characterization of DLT. In terms of metabolism, 17 biomarkers of CHD in rats were identified. Among these biomarkers, linoleic , γ- and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were found to play an important role in energy metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Protein analysis revealed that EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in CHD rats after DLT treatment, which lowered the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP9, decreased the expression levels of ox-LDL and MDA, and increased the expression of SOD.The mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD involves inhibiting the expression of EGFR and the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism (LPCs) and energy metabolism (linoleic  and γ-). Therefore, -related (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP9) and oxidative stress-related (ox-LDL, MDA, SOD) indicators are affected, leading to the regulation of the oxidative stress state and anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The multi-functional protein scavenger receptor CD36 has also been shown to participate in . However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between CD36 and GLA or LA in LPS-induced  remain unclear. We used small interfering RNA and adenoviral systems to manipulate CD36 expression in primary goat mammary gland epithelial cells (pGMECs), and the results showed that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) levels were significantly decreased by CD36 receptor signaling following treatment with GLA but not LA. GLA inhibited NF-κB activation in LPS-induced pGMECs. However, silencing CD36 or deleting its fatty -binding domain blocked the anti-inflammatory effects of GLA, resulting in an increase in NF-κB activation and disrupting its localization during LPS-induced . The activity of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, which act downstream of NF-κB, was also modulated when CD34 expression was manipulated by the addition of GLA in LPS-induced pGMECs. Our data suggest that GLA, but not LA, may interact with the CD36 fatty -binding domain to regulate the activation and localization of NF-κB in LPS-induced pGMECs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28732439>The Extract of Portulaca oleracea and Its Constituent,  Affects Serum Oxidant Levels and Inflammatory Cells in Sensitized Rats.</a></h1><p>The effects of Portulaca oleracea and its constituent,  on serum oxidant levels and inflammatory cells in sensitized rats were examined.

Serum concentrations of SOD, CAT and thiol were significantly decreased but NO2, NO3 and MDA as well as total WBC number and percentages of eosinophil and neutrophil were increased in sensitized group (p<0.001 for all cases).Treatment of sensitized animals with dexamethasone, high concentrations of the extract and ALA improved all measured variables except monocyte for all three treatment groups and eosinophil for dexamethasone treatment (p<0.01 to p<0.001). In addition, treatment with low and medium extract and low ALA concentrations improved serum levels of NO2, NO3 and total WBC count (p<0.001 for all cases). Neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages and serum level of thiol also improved due to treatment with medium extract and low ALA concentration (p<0.01 to p<0.001).

Given that TLR4 is closely related to atherosclerosis, we hypothesized herein that caprylic  (C8:0) would suppress  via TLR4/NF-κB signaling and further promote the amelioration of atherosclerosis in apoE- deficient (apoE) mice.Fifty 6-week male apoE mice were randomly allocated into five diet groups: a high-fat diet (HFD) without or with 2% caprylic  (C8:0), capric  (C10:0), stearic  (C18:0), or  (C18:3). RAW246.7 cells were treated with caprylic  (C8:0), docosahexenoic  (DHA), palmitic  (C16:0), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without TLR4 knock-down (TLR4-KD). The serum lipid profiles, inflammatory biomolecules, and mRNA and protein expression levels were measured. Atherosclerotic lesions that occurred in the aorta and aortic sinuses were evaluated and quantified.Our results indicated that C8:0 reduced body fat, improved the lipid profiles, suppressed inflammatory cytokine production, downregulated aortic TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IKKα, and IKKβ mRNA expression, and alleviated atherosclerosis in the apoE mice ( < 0.05). In RAW 264.7 cells, C8:0 diminished the inflammatory response and both mRNA and protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, and TNF-α compared to those in the LPS and C16:0 groups ( < 0.05). However, in the TLR4-KD RAW 264.7 cells, C8:0 significantly upregulated NF-κB mRNA and protein expression compared to those in the C16:0 and DHA groups.These results suggest that C8:0 functions via TLR4/NF-κB signaling to improve the outcomes of apoE mice through suppressing  and ameliorating atherosclerosis.

Amounts of LC-PUFA depend on the exogenous intake of their precursors [linoleic (LA) and α- (ALA)] and by rate of their metabolism, which is influenced by activities of enzymes, such as Δ6-desaturase (D6D, FADS2), D5D, FADS1, elongases (Elovl2, -5, 6).Altered activities of D5D/D6D were described in plenty of diseases, e.g. neuropsychiatric (depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, dementia), metabolic (obesity, metabolic syndrome, DM2) and cardiovascular diseases (arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease), inflammatory states and allergy (Crohns disease, atopic eczema) or some malignancies. Similar results were obtained in studies dealing with the associations between genotypes/haplotypes of FADS1/FADS2 and above mentioned diseases, or interactions of dietary intake of LA and ALA on one hand and of the polymorphisms of minor allels of FADS1/FADS2, usually characterized by lower activities, on the other hand.The decrease of the desaturases activities leads to decreased concentrations of products with concomitant increased concentrations of substrates. Associations of some SNP FADS with coronary heart disease, concentrations of plasma lipids, oxidative stress, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory reaction, were described.

Thermodynamic parameters of enzymes, including the melting point (T ) and ∆G values, were obtained from thermal and chemical denaturation curves. Complexes I and II showed a competitive inhibitory effect on MT with K values of 0.45 and 0.29 mM, respectively. The T values were calculated as 328.6, 322.4, and 318 K and the ∆G values as 62.8, 52.9, and 47.1 KJ mol for the enzyme alone and its interaction with complexes I and II, respectively. Intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence techniques showed structural instability of the enzyme in concomitance with a decrease in the regular secondary structure acquired using CD spectrometry. This data clearly prove that the new derivatives show a stronger inhibitory effect than the separate compounds. Molecular docking analysis showed that the best possible interaction condition was achieved for chrysin with n-6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: MT is a suitable model in medicine for the investigation of melanogenesis, skin disorders, and hyperpigmentation because of its accessibility and close structural similarity to mammalian tyrosinase. In recent years, the designing of tyrosinase inhibitors from natural substances for prevention of hyperpigmentation in medicine, skin cosmetics, and undesired browning in agriculture and food industry has risen sharply. Many of the pharmaceutical products based on the use of flavonoids and poly unsaturated acids as natural compounds or on their semi-synthetic derivatives have been interested for investigations because of their usefulness in many pathological conditions such as , cancer, and skin disorders. The limitation of the flavonoids applications are low bioavailability, permeability, and solubility for the cells. In this study, conjugation of chrysin with n-3 and n-6 fatty acids resulted in a stronger inhibitors of MT with a synergic inhibitory effect on its activity.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916975>Flaxseed Oil Supplementation Improve Gene Expression Levels of PPAR-γ, LP(a), IL-1 and TNF-α in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Coronary Heart Disease.</a></h1><p>This study was carried out to determine the effects of flaxseed oil administration on gene expression levels related to insulin, lipid and  in overweight diabetic patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of chia oil (ChOi) supplementation on body composition and insulin signaling in skeletal muscles of obese mice.Male C57 BL/6 mice (n = 8/group) were fed regular control chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 135 d. Another HFD group additionally received ChOi from 90 to 135 d.Consumption of ChOi reduced fat mass accumulation and increased lean mass as evidenced by nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, obese mice treated with ChOi showed higher tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, greater activation of protein kinase B, and increased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 in skeletal muscle tissue in response to insulin. ChOi supplementation improved glucose levels and insulin tolerance; decreased serum insulin, leptin, and triacylglycerols; and increased blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these effects caused by the use of ChOi seemed to be independent of the resolution of  because the markers of  were not altered in animals fed the HFD.The molecular effects observed in muscle tissue together with changes in body composition may have contributed to the increased glucose tolerance and to the healthy phenotype presented by obese animals treated with ChOi.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The results obtained from a number of experimental studies suggest that targeting different components of the inflammatory machinery may result in the improvement of the metabolic phenotype. Unsaturated fatty acids exert antiinflammatory activity through several distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested the capacity of ω3 and ω9 fatty acids, directly from their food matrix, to exert antiinflammatory activity through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 and GPR40 pathways. GPR120 was activated in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues, reverting  and insulin resistance in obese mice. Part of this action was also mediated by GPR40 on muscle, as a novel mechanism described. Pair-feeding and immunoneutralization experiments reinforced the pivotal role of GPR120 as a mediator in the response to the nutrients. The improvement in insulin sensitivity in the high-fat substituted diets was associated with a marked reduction in tissue , decreased macrophage infiltration, and increased IL-10 levels. Furthermore, improved glucose homeostasis was accompanied by the reduced expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and reduced body mass. Thus, our data indicate that GPR120 and GPR40 play a critical role as mediators of the beneficial effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids in the context of obesity-induced insulin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959386>Low eicosapentaenoic  and gamma- levels in breast adipose tissue are associated with inflammatory breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Since it is thought that breast adipose tissue could influence breast cancer clinical presentation, we wanted to characterize specifically the relationship between breast adipose tissue fatty  profile and Inflammatory Breast cancer (IBC).Two hundred thirty-four women presenting with breast cancer were managed in our centre between January 2009 and December 2011.

To compare fatty  profiles and changes in gene expression at different time points after muscle injury, we used an established drop tower-based model with a defined force input to damage the  on the left hind limb of female C57BL/6J mice of normal weight and obese mice. Although most changes in fatty  content in muscle tissue are diet related, levels of eicosaenoic (normal weight) and DHG- (obese) in the phospholipid and docosahexaenoic  (normal weight) in the triglyceride fraction are altered after injury. Furthermore, changes in gene transcription were detected in 3829 genes in muscles of normal weight mice, whereas only 287 genes were altered in muscles of obese mice after trauma. Alterations were found within several pathways, among them notch-signaling, insulin-signaling, sonic hedgehog-signaling, apoptosis related pathways, fat metabolism related cholesterol homeostasis, fatty  biosynthetic process, fatty  elongation, and acyl-CoA metabolic process. We could show that genes involved in fat metabolism are affected 3 days after trauma induction mostly in normal weight but not in obese mice. The strongest effects were observed in normal weight mice for , the activating protein for leukotriene synthesis, and , an enzyme substantial for LDL synthesis. In summary, we show that obesity changes the fat content of skeletal muscle and generally shows a negative impact upon blunt muscle injury on various cellular processes, among them fatty  related metabolism, notch-, insulin-, sonic hedgehog-signaling, and apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145885>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance in Mice by Rescuing the Adaption to ER Stress.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the benefits of α--rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against lipid metabolism abnormality in both rodent models and humans. However, the metabolic response of FO to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is still inconsistent. This study aimed to explore the effect of FO on chronic high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and , mainly focusing on hepatic n-3 fatty  remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response. The results showed that lard-based HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% fat-derived calories) induced whole-body insulin resistance, lipid profile abnormality, and  in mice, which was alleviated by FO in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, FO effectively improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice by modulating the specific location of ALA and its long-chain n-3 fatty acids across hepatic lipid fractions and enhancing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of hepatic insulin receptor subtract-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine 632 and protein kinase B (AKT) ( p < 0.05). Importantly, the differential depositions of ALA and its long-chain n-3 fatty acids in plasma and ER membranes were observed, concomitant with the rescued ER unfolded protein response and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in mice liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28146136>Consumption of Red Meat, but Not Cooking Oils High in Polyunsaturated Fat, Is Associated with Higher Arachidonic  Status in Singapore Chinese Adults.</a></h1><p>High arachidonic  (AA; 20:4 n - 6) status may have adverse effects on  and risk of cardiovascular diseases. Concerns about high intake of n - 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are based on the premise that endogenous conversion from linoleic  (LA; 18:2 n - 6) is an important source of AA, but few population-based studies have investigated dietary determinants of AA status. In this study, we examined habitual food consumption in relation to plasma concentrations of AA and other PUFAs in population-based studies. We used cross-sectional data from 269 healthy, ethnic Chinese participants (25-80 years old) with contrasting intakes of fish and red meat from the Singapore Prospective Study Program and 769 healthy participants (44-74 years old) from the Singapore Chinese Health Study as a validation set. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine PUFA intake (% energy) and food sources of PUFA (fish, red meat, poultry, soy and cooking oils) in relation to plasma PUFAs (AA, LA, dihomo-gamma- (DGLA; 20:3 n - 6),  (ALA; 18:3 n - 3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5 n - 3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6 n - 3)) concentrations. Higher intake of red meat was associated with higher plasma AA concentrations. High intake of PUFA or PUFA-rich oils was associated with higher plasma ALA but not with plasma AA. Higher intakes of soy were associated with higher ALA and fish with higher DHA and EPA concentrations. These associations were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in both studies. Red meat consumption, but not PUFA or PUFA-rich cooking oil, was associated with circulating AA suggesting that intake of pre-formed AA rather than LA is an important determinant of AA status. A diet high in fish, soy products and polyunsaturated cooking oil, and low in red meat may be associated with an optimal plasma profile of PUFA in this Chinese population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26350254>α- (ALA) is an anti-inflammatory agent in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Studies suggest that consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) plays a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease; however, the use of plant-derived oils rich in α- (ALA) has not been widely investigated. The aims of this study were to test the effects of two different sources of (n-3) PUFA, fish and plant-derived oils, in two animal models of experimental colitis and to determine whether the (n-3) PUFA-enriched diets could ameliorate the inflammatory status. Rats were fed diets rich in corn, fish or sage oil with or without vitamin A supplementation for 3weeks then colitis was induced by adding dextran sodium sulfate to the drinking water or by injecting 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic . We show that colitic rats fed the sage oil diets had a lower inflammatory response, improved histological repair and had less necrotic damage in the mucosa when compared to the corn and fish oil groups. Colonic damage and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly lower. Colonic mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including interleukin IL-6, cyclooxygenase 2 and tumor necrosis factor α were markedly down-regulated in rats fed fish and sage oils compared to control. These results were supported by experiments in the human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2, where ALA supplementation was shown to be effective in inhibiting  induced by IL-1β by down-regulating mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-8, COX2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Taken together, these results suggest that plant-derived oil rich in ALA could ameliorate the inflammatory damage in colitis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, average intakes are very low in a large proportion of the UK population. Some groups, such as vegans and vegetarians, purposely omit fish (along with meat) from their diet resulting in zero or trace intakes of long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA. Although the efficacy of dietary fish oil supplementation in the prevention of CVD has been questioned in recent years, the balance of evidence indicates that LC n-3 PUFA exert systemic pleiotropic effects through their influence on gene expression, cell signalling, membrane fluidity and by conversion to specialised proresolving mediators; autacoid lipid mediators that resolve inflammatory events. The long-term impact of reduced tissue LC n-3 PUFA content on cardiovascular health is surprisingly poorly understood, particularly with regard to how low proportions of LC n-3 PUFA in cell membranes may affect cardiac electrophysiology and chronic . Randomised controlled trials investigating effects of supplementation on prevention of CHD in populations with low basal LC n-3 PUFA tissue status are lacking, and so the clinical benefits of supplementing non-fish-eating groups with vegetarian sources of LC n-3 PUFA remain to be determined. Refocusing dietary LC n-3 PUFA intervention studies towards those individuals with a low LC n-3 PUFA tissue status may go some way towards reconciling results from randomised controlled trials with the epidemiological evidence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698923>Anti-inflammatory effects of α- in M1-like macrophages are associated with enhanced production of oxylipins from α- and linoleic .</a></h1><p>Chronic , mediated in large part by proinflammatory macrophage populations, contributes directly to the induction and perpetuation of metabolic diseases, including obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can have profound effects on  through the formation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites called oxylipins. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to the dietary omega-3 PUFA α- (ALA) can dampen the inflammatory properties of classically activated (M1-like) macrophages derived from the human THP-1 cell line and to examine the accompanying alterations in oxylipin secretion. We find that ALA treatment leads to a reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Although ALA is known to be converted to longer-chain PUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), DHA oxylipins were reduced overall by ALA treatment, as was LPS-induced secretion of EPA oxylipins. In contrast, we observed profound increases in oxylipins directly derived from ALA. Lipoxygenase products of linoleic  were also dramatically increased, and LPS-induced production of AA oxylipins, particularly prostaglandin D2, was reduced. These results suggest that ALA may act to dampen the inflammatory phenotype of M1-like macrophages by a unique set of mechanisms distinct from those used by the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Thus, there is strong rationale for investigating the functions of ALA oxylipins and lesser-known LA oxylipins since they hold promise as anti-inflammatory agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to clarify whether fatty  (FA) profiles in EAT are linked to the serum concentration of these adipokines. The relationships between serum adipokine levels and FA profiles in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery were analyzed.Patients ( = 21) undergoing cardiovascular surgery (11 males, 70.4 ± 9.0 years, BMI 26.0 ± 5.1 kg/m) were included. EAT samples were taken. We measured clinical biochemical data and FA profiles in venous blood and EAT samples using gas chromatography. Serum adiponectin and TNFα concentrations were also measured.The adiponectin and TNFα levels were not correlated with any fatty  concentration in serum lipids. In contrast, there was a positive correlation between the serum adiponectin level and epicardial level of nervonic  (C24:1ω9,  = 0.525,  = 0.025). In multiple regression analysis, adiponectin showed a positive association with the epicardial C24:1ω9 concentration after controlling for age and BMI, or TG, non-HDL-C, and BNP. The serum TNFα concentration was negatively correlated with the epicardial C18:3ω3, C12:0 and C18:0 content. In multiple regression analysis, the serum TNFα concentration showed a positive association with the epicardial C18:3ω3 level (β = - 0.575,  = 0.015).These results suggest that there is a close relationship between epicardial FA profiles and serum levels of adiponectin and TNFα.

At week 12, participants who received placebo were assigned a low-potency corticosteroid (fluorometholone [FML] 0.1%, drops, three times per day [tid]) for 2 weeks (week 14).Sixty-five participants completed the primary endpoint. At week 12, contact lens dry-eye questionnaire (CLDEQ-8) score was reduced from baseline with oral fish oil (-7.3 ± 0.8 units, n = 17, P < 0.05), compared with placebo (-3.5 ± 0.9 units, n = 16). FML produced significant reductions in tear IL-17A (-71.1 ± 14.3%, n = 12) and IL-6 (-47.6 ± 17.5%, n = 12, P < 0.05) relative to its baseline (week 12). At week 12, tear IL-17A levels were reduced from baseline in the oral fish oil (-63.2 ± 12.8%, n = 12, P < 0.05) and topical omega-3 (-76.2 ± 10.8%, n = 10, P < 0.05) groups, compared with placebo (-3.8 ± 12.7%, n = 12). Tear IL-6 was reduced with all omega-3 interventions, relative to placebo (P < 0.05) at week 12.CLD was attenuated by oral long-chain omega-3 supplementation for 12 weeks. Acute (2 week) topical corticosteroids and longer-term (12 week) omega-3 supplementation reduced tear levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-6, demonstrating parallels in modulating ocular  with these approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27527582>The impact of fatty  desaturase genotype on fatty  status and cardiovascular health in adults.</a></h1><p>The aim of this review was to determine the impact of the fatty  desaturase (FADS) genotype on plasma and tissue concentrations of the long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA, including EPA and DHA, which are associated with the risk of several diet-related chronic diseases, including CVD. In addition to dietary intakes, which are low for many individuals, tissue EPA and DHA are also influenced by the rate of bioconversion from α- (αLNA). Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase enzymes, encoded for by FADS1 and FADS2 genes, are key desaturation enzymes involved in the bioconversion of essential fatty acids (αLNA and linoleic  (LA)) to longer chained PUFA. In general, carriers of FADS minor alleles tend to have higher habitual plasma and tissue levels of LA and αLNA, and lower levels of arachidonic , EPA and also to a lesser extent DHA. In conclusion, available research findings suggest that FADS minor alleles are also associated with reduced  and CVD risk, and that dietary total fat and fatty  intake have the potential to modify relationships between FADS gene variants and circulating fatty  levels. However to date, neither the size-effects of FADS variants on fatty  status, nor the functional SNP in FADS1 and 2 have been identified. Such information could contribute to the refinement and targeting of EPA and DHA recommendations, whereby additional LC n-3 PUFA intakes could be recommended for those carrying FADS minor alleles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653011>Fatty  Profile and Antioxidant Status Fingerprint in Sarcopenic Elderly Patients: Role of Diet and Exercise.</a></h1><p>Plasma fatty acids (FAs) and oxidant status contribute to the etiology of sarcopenia in the elderly concurring to age-related muscle loss and elderly frailty through several mechanisms including changes in FA composition within the sarcolemma, promotion of chronic low-grade , and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-. Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and oleic  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly. The results indicate the positive beneficial role of supplementation and physical activity on plasma FA status and the antioxidant system as a co-adjuvant approach in sarcopenic, frail, elderly patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30461332>Toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) to THP-1 macrophages: interactions with saturated or unsaturated free fatty acids.</a></h1><p>In a biological microenvironment, free fatty acids (FFA) as ubiquitous biological molecules might interact with nanoparticles (NPs) and consequently change the toxicological responses. However, whether the chemical structures of FFA could influence their interactions with NPs remain unknown. This study investigated the interactions between ZnO NPs and saturated or unsaturated FFA (complexed to BSA), namely stearic  (SA, C18:0), oleic  (OA, C18:1), and α- (ALA, C18:3). It was shown that BSA, SA, OA, and ALA increased the atomic force microscope (AFM) heights as well the polydispersity index (PDI) of ZnO NPs. BSA modestly protected THP-1 macrophages from ZnO NP exposure, whereas OA and ALA led to relatively less cyto-protective effects of BSA. Moreover, only co-exposure to ZnO NPs and SA significantly promoted the release of interleukin-8. BSA, SA, OA, and ALA equally changed intracellular ROS and Zn ions associated with ZnO exposure, but co-exposure to ZnO NPs and OA/ALA particularly activated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis genes. In combination, these results showed that FFA could influence the colloidal aspects and toxicological signaling pathway of ZnO NPs, which is dependent on the number of unsaturated bonds of FFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27559299>Grape Seed Oil Compounds: Biological and Chemical Actions for Health.</a></h1><p>Grape seed oil is rich in phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and vitamins, with economic importance to pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industry.

Our primary aim was to examine in a randomized controlled setting whether diets enriched in fatty fish (FF), lean fish (LF) or ALA-rich camelina sativa oil (CSO) differ in their effects on the mRNA expression response of selected -related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in subjects with impaired fasting glucose.Samples from 72 participants randomized to one of the following 12-week intervention groups, FF (n = 19), LF (n = 19), CSO (n = 17) or a control group (n = 17), were available for the PBMC study. For SAT, 39 samples (n = 8, n = 10, n = 9, n = 12, respectively) were available. The mRNA expression was measured at baseline and 12 weeks by TaqMan® Low Density Array.In PBMCs, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05), which was different (P = 0.06, Bonferroni correction) from the observed increase in the FF group (P < 0.05). Also, compared to the control group, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, the change in ICAM1 mRNA expression correlated positively with the intake of FF (P < 0.05) and negatively with the intake of LF (P < 0.05), independently of study group. A diet enriched in CSO, a rich source of  (ALA), decreased PBMC IFNG mRNA expression (P < 0.01). The intake of CSO in the CSO group, but not the increase in plasma ALA proportions, correlated inversely with the IFNG mRNA expression in PBMCs (P = 0.08). In SAT, when compared with the control group, the effect of FF on decreasing IL1RN mRNA expression was significant (P < 0.03).We propose that CSO intake may partly exert its benefits through immuno-inflammatory molecular regulation in PBMCs, while modulation of ICAM1 expression, an endothelial/vascular-related gene, may be more dependent on the type of fish consumed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413364>Arachidonic  supplementation modulates blood and skeletal muscle lipid profile with no effect on basal  in resistance exercise trained men.</a></h1><p>Arachidonic  (ARA), an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), is the metabolic precursor to the eicosanoid family of lipid mediators. Eicosanoids have potent pro-inflammatory actions, but also act as important autocrine/paracrine signaling molecules in skeletal muscle growth and development. Whether dietary ARA is incorporated into skeletal muscle phospholipids and the resulting impact on intramuscular inflammatory and adaptive processes in-vivo is not known. In the current study, resistance trained men (≥1 year) received dietary supplementation with 1.5g/day ARA (n=9, 24 ± 1.5 years) or placebo (n=10, 26 ± 1.3 years) for 4-weeks while continuing their normal training regimen. Plasma and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected in an overnight fasted state at baseline and week 4. ARA supplementation increased plasma content of ARA and gamma-, while decreasing relative abundance of linoleic , eicosapentaenoic , and dihomo-gamma-. In skeletal muscle, ARA and dihomo-gamma- content increased, whereas  was reduced. Compared to placebo, ARA supplementation reduced circulating platelet and monocyte number, and decreased the mRNA expression of the immune cell surface markers; neutrophil elastase/CD66b and interleukin 1-beta, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In muscle, ARA supplementation increased mRNA expression of the myogenic regulatory factors; MyoD and myogenin, but had no effect on a range of immune cell markers or inflammatory cytokines.

Dietary intake of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids was assessed by food frequency questionnaires. The main analyses were adjusted for the dietary intake of n-3 α- and n-6 linoleic  to account for endogenous synthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Treatment with high doses of pharmacologic-grade omega-3 fatty  (n-3FA) supplements achieves significant reductions in triglycerides (TG), non-high-density lipoprotein- (non-HDL-) and TG-rich lipoprotein- (TRL-) cholesterol levels. n-3FA supplements have significant effects on markers of atherosclerosis risk including endothelial function, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, cellular and humoral markers of , hemodynamic factors, and plaque stabilization. This review summarizes the lipid and cardiometabolic effects of prescription-grade n-3FAs and will discuss clinical trials, national/organizational guidelines, and expert opinion on the impact of supplemental n-3FAs on CV health and disease.Clinical trial evidence supports use of n-3FAs in individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but the data either does not support or is lacking for other types of cardiometabolic risk including prevention of stroke, treatment in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, and for primary prevention in the general population. Despite inconsistent findings to support widespread benefit, there is persistent population-wide enthusiasm for n-3FA as a dietary supplement for its cardiometabolic benefits. Fortunately, there are ongoing clinical trials to assess whether the lipid/lipoprotein benefits may be extended to other at-risk populations and whether lower-dose therapy may provide background benefit for primary prevention of ASCVD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658644>A specific combined long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  supplementation reverses fatty  profile alterations in a mouse model of chronic asthma.</a></h1><p>The immune-modulating potential of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) based on their conversion into lipid mediators in inflammatory situations has been proven by several studies. Respecting the immune-modulative role of lipid mediators in bronchoconstriction, airway  and resolution of inflammatory processes, LCPUFAs play an important role in asthma. To design a disease-specific and most beneficial LCPUFA supplementation strategy, it is essential to understand how asthma alters LCPUFA profiles. Therefore, this study characterizes the alterations of LCPUFA profiles induced by allergic asthma. In addition, this study explores whether a simple eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) alone or a specific combined LCPUFA supplementation could restore imbalanced LCPUFA profiles.Mice were sensitized with a daily dose of 40 μg house dust mite (HDM)-extract in a recall model and fed with either normal diet, EPA or a specific combined (sc)-LCPUFA supplementation containing EPA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), γ - (GLA) and stearidonic  (SDA) for 24 days. After recall with HDM, mice were sacrificed and blood and lung tissue were collected. Fatty  profiles were determined in plasma, blood cells and lung cells of asthmatic mice by capillary gas-chromatography.In lung cells of asthmatic mice, arachidonic  (AA, p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) were increased while dihomo-γ- (DGLA, p < 0.05) was decreased. EPA supplementation increased only EPA (p < 0.001) and docosapentaenoic  (DPA, p < 0.001), but neither DGLA nor DHA in lung cells of asthmatic mice. In contrast, a specific combined dietary supplementation containing n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs could decrease AA (p < 0.001), increase EPA (p < 0.001), DPA (p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) and could reverse the lack of DGLA (p < 0.05).In summary, allergic asthma alters LCPUFA profiles in blood and lung tissue. In contrast to the EPA supplementation, the distinct combination of n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs restored the LCPUFA profiles in lung tissue of asthmatic mice completely. Subsequently, sc-LCPUFA supplementation is likely to be highly supportive in limiting and resolving the inflammatory process in asthma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26137879>Associations of erythrocyte ω-3 fatty acids with biomarkers of ω-3 fatty acids and  in breast tissue.</a></h1><p>There is increasing evidence that chronic  is associated with increased breast cancer risk.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of breast tissue and blood samples from n = 85 women with no history of breast cancer, who underwent breast reduction surgery. Fatty acids of erythrocytes and undissected breast tissues were analyzed by gas chromatography; C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in plasma and tissue were measured by ELISA. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to estimate associations between erythrocyte LCω-3PUFA and breast tissue biomarkers. Women in the highest erythrocyte LCω-3PUFA tertile had LCω-3PUFA concentrations in the breast 73% (95% CI: 31-128%; p trend < 0.0001) higher than women in the lowest tertile. Associations for each individual LCω-3PUFA were similar in magnitude. No significant association was found for the shorter ω-3 PUFA, α-. Although compatible with no association, women in the highest tertile of erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic  had a nonsignificant 32% (95% CI: -23 to 62%) reduced breast tissue CRP.

Our findings provide evidence that erythrocyte ω-3 fatty acids are valid measures of breast tissue concentrations, and limited evidence that inverse associations from prospective epidemiologic studies of blood LCω-3PUFA and breast cancer risk may be partly explained by reductions in breast tissue ; however, these findings require replication.© 2015 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30661600>Lowering the linoleic  to alpha-linoleic  ratio decreases the production of inflammatory mediators by cultured human endothelial cells.</a></h1><p> (ALA) and linoleic  (LA) are precursors for longer-chain more unsaturated fatty acids and for lipid signalling molecules that may influence inflammatory processes through a variety of mechanisms. The actions of LA and ALA may be divergent and interdependent. The aim of this study was to investigate the incorporation and metabolism of ALA and LA in cultured in EA.hy926 endothelial cells and the production of inflammatory mediators (VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-8) by these cells when exposed to different concentrations of ALA, LA and ratios of LA:ALA. Human endothelial cells were cultured with either culture medium or culture medium supplemented with ALA, LA or various ratios of LA:ALA (1:4, 1:1, 4:1, 9:1 or 19:1) followed by 24 h TNF-α stimulation; the total concentration of ALA plus LA was kept constant at 100 μM. The incorporation and metabolism of ALA and LA was measured using gas chromatography. The production of inflammatory mediators in the supernatant was assessed using a Luminex Multi-Analyte kit. Both ALA and LA were incorporated and metabolised by the endothelial cells. Cells incubated with ALA had a statistically significantly lower production of VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 compared to cells incubated without additional ALA. LA was not found to exert pro-inflammatory effects. Cells incubated with low LA:ALA ratios had lower production of VEGF, RANTES, MCP-1 and IL-6 when compared with a LA:ALA ratio of 19:1. These findings suggest that a low LA:ALA ratio exerts anti-inflammatory effects by lowering the production VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 in TNF-α stimulated endothelial cells compared to a high ratio. These effects were likely mediated by ALA, but LA may also possess some anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that plasma concentrations of n-3 PUFAs would be lower and those of n-6 PUFAs higher in subjects with bipolar disorder (BD) compared to healthy controls (HCs), and would correlate with symptom severity in subjects with BD, and that effective treatment would correlate with increased n-3 but lower n-6 PUFA levels. Additionally, we explored clinical correlations and group differences in plasma levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.This observational, parallel group study compared biomarkers between HCs (n = 31) and symptomatic subjects with BD (n = 27) when ill and after symptomatic recovery (follow-up). Plasma concentrations of five PUFAs [linoleic  (LA), arachidonic  (AA),  (ALA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)], two saturated fatty acids (palmitic  and stearic ) and two monounsaturated fatty acids (palmitoleic  and oleic ) were measured in esterified (E) and unesterified (UE) forms. Calculated ratios included UE:E for the five PUFAs, ratios of n-3 PUFAs (DHA:ALA, EPA:ALA and EPA:DHA), and the ratio of n-6:n-3 AA:EPA. Comparisons of plasma fatty  levels and ratios between BD and HC groups were made with Student t-tests, and between the BD group at baseline and follow-up using paired t-tests. Comparison of categorical variables was performed using chi-square tests. Pearson's r was used for bivariate correlations with clinical variables, including depressive and manic symptoms, current panic attacks, and psychosis.UE EPA was lower in subjects with BD than in HCs, with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.86, p < 0.002); however, it was not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. No statistically significant difference was seen in any plasma PUFA concentration between the BD and HC groups after Bonferroni correction for 40 comparisons, at p < 0.001. Neither depressive severity nor mania severity was correlated significantly with any PUFA concentration. Exploratory comparison showed lower UE:E EPA in the BD than the HC group (p < 0.0001). At follow-up in the BD group, UE, E DHA:ALA, and UE EPA:ALA were decreased (p < 0.002). Exploratory correlations of clinical variables revealed that mania severity and suicidality were positively correlated with UE:E EPA ratio, and that several plasma levels and ratios correlated with panic disorder and psychosis. Depressive severity was not correlated with any ratio. No plasma fatty  level or ratio correlated with self-reported n-3 PUFA intake or use of medication by class.A large effect size of reduced UE EPA, and a lower plasma UE:E concentration ratio of EPA in the symptomatic BD state may be important factors in vulnerability to a mood state. Altered n-3 PUFA ratios could indicate changes in PUFA metabolism concurrent with symptom improvement. Our findings are consistent with preclinical and postmortem data and suggest testing interventions that increase n-3 and decrease n-6 dietary PUFA intake.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Another aim was to examine whether chronic supplementation of supranutritional doses of quercetin would result in an accumulation of plasma quercetin concentration over time.In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial, healthy volunteers were randomized to receive 3.6 g/d ALA plus 190 mg/d quercetin or placebo for 8 wk. Data from 67 individuals (34 men, 33 women, mean age: 24.6 y) were assessed.Plasma quercetin, tamarixetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol increased significantly from baseline to study end with ALA + quercetin but not with ALA + placebo. No significant effect on office systolic BP, mean 24 h ambulatory BP (ABP), or mean daytime ABP was seen in either study group. Both interventions significantly decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B to a similar extent. No effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, glucose, uric , oxidized low-density lipoprotein, C-reactive protein, or lipid-adjusted retinol, α-tocopherol, or β-carotene was seen in either group.Although dietary supplements of 3.6 g/d ALA over an 8-wk period improved lipid profiles in healthy adults, antioxidative and oxidative status, , and BP remained unchanged.

While there have been numerous in vitro and in vivo animal models which illustrate that GLA-supplemented diets attenuate inflammatory responses, clinical studies utilizing GLA or GLA in combination with omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs have been much less conclusive. A central premise of this review is that there are critical metabolic and genetic factors that affect the conversion of GLA to dihommo-gamma  (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6), which consequently affects the balance of DGLA- and AA- derived metabolites. As a result, these factors impact the clinical effectiveness of GLA or GLA/(n-3) PUFA supplementations in treating inflammatory conditions. Specifically, these factors include: 1) the capacity for different human cells and tissues to convert GLA to DGLA and AA and to metabolize DGLA and AA to bioactive metabolites; 2) the opposing effects of DGLA and AA metabolites on inflammatory processes and diseases; and 3) the impact of genetic variations within the fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene cluster, in particular, on AA/DGLA ratios and bioactive metabolites. We postulate that these factors influence the heterogeneity of results observed in GLA supplement-based clinical trials and suggest that "one-size fits all" approaches utilizing PUFA-based supplements may no longer be appropriate for the prevention and treatment of complex human diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Some plants belonging to the genus  L. are characterized by biological activity. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine the dependence of biological activity on the chemical composition of various parts of the evening primrose, mainly leaves, stems, and seeds. Common components of all parts of the  plants are fatty acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. In contrast, primrose seeds also contain proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, it is believed that the most interesting sources of biologically active compounds are the seeds and, above all, evening primrose seed oil. This oil contains mainly aliphatic alcohols, fatty acids, sterols, and polyphenols. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is extremely high in linoleic  (LA) (70⁻74%) and γ- (GLA) (8⁻10%), which may contribute to the proper functioning of human tissues because they are precursors of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. EPO supplementation results in an increase in plasma levels of γ- and its metabolite dihomo-γ- (DGLA). This compound is oxidized by lipoxygenase (15-LOX) to 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic  (15-HETrE) or, under the influence of cyclooxygenase (COX), DGLA is metabolized to series 1 prostaglandins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Furthermore, 15-HETrE blocks the conversion of arachidonic  (AA) to leukotriene A₄ (LTA₄) by direct inhibition of 5-LOX. In addition, γ- suppresses  mediators such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cytokine - tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α).

Accumulating evidence suggests that GPR120 activation is a feasible solution to ameliorating chronic  and improving glucose metabolism. In this study we investigated whether ginsenoside Rb2 (Rb2), which exhibited regulatory activities in glucose and lipid metabolism, affected GPR120 expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells, and examined the contribution of GPR120 activation to reducing the LPS-induced inflammatory response. LPS (100 ng/mL) activated the macrophages, resulting in dramatic increases in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and NO production. Treatment with a ω-3 fatty  α- (ALA, 50 μmol/L) produced moderate reduction in LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokines and NO production (TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased by 46% and 42%, respectively). Pre-incubation with Rb2 (1 or 10 μmol/L) for 12 h before ALA treatment dramatically amplified the inhibitory effects of ALA (TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased by 74% and 86%, respectively). Compared to the treatment with ALA alone, pre-incubation with Rb2 resulted in a more prominent reduction in LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS and COX-2 and LPS-stimulated IKK/NF-κB phosphorylation and MAPK pathway activation. Rb2 (0.1-100 μmol/L) dose- and time-dependently increased both mRNA and protein expression of GPR120 in RAW264.7 cells, but treatment with Rb2 alone did not exert anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. In RAW264.7 cells transfected with GPR120 shRNA, the ameliorating effects of Rb2 on LPS-induced  were abolished. In conclusion, Rb2 exerts anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells in vitro by increasing GPR120 expression and subsequently enhancing ω-3 fatty -induced GPR120 activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935107>Essential Fatty Acids Linoleic  and α- Sex-Dependently Regulate Glucose Homeostasis in Obesity.</a></h1><p>To assess the associations of dietary linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in a population-based cohort and further explore the mechanism of action in a high-fat-diet (HFD) induced obese (DIO) mouse model.The occurrence of T2D among 15 100 Chinese adults from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, 1997-2011) were followed up for a median of 14 years. The relations of ALA and LA intakes with T2D risk were modified by BMI, with significant associations restricted to obese/overweight subjects. Among them, relative risks (95% confidence intervals) comparing extreme quartiles of intakes were 0.55 (0.32-0.93) in men and 0.53 (0.34-0.85) in women for ALA, while 0.71 (0.41-1.16) in men and 0.56 (0.36-0.89) in women for LA.

In this study, high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) along with transcriptomics were applied on animal models to draw a mechanistic insight of NAFLD. Wild type (WT) and catalase knockout (CKO) mice were fed with normal fat diet (NFD) or high fat diet (HFD) to identify the changes in metabolic and transcriptomic profiles caused by catalase gene deletion in correspondence with HFD. Integrated omics analysis revealed that cholic  and 3β, 7α-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoate along with cyp7b1 gene involved in primary bile  biosynthesis were strongly affected by HFD.

Within this time span, 45 days were dedicated to examining the effects of the intake of a beverage rich in polyphenols (one serving: 200 mL per day) supplemented in their diet. The beverage was a mixture of citrus juice (95%) and Aronia melanocarpa juice (5%) (ACJ). Fifty-two oxylipins were analyzed in the urine. The quantification was carried out using solid-phase extraction, liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The physical activity decreased the excretion of some PG, IsoP, TX, and LT metabolites from arachidonic , γ-dihomo-, and eicosapentaenoic . The ACJ also reduced the excretion of 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF and 11-dehydro-TXB, although the levels of other metabolites increased after juice supplementation (PGE, 15-keto-15-F-IsoP, 20-OH-PGE, LTE, and 15-epi-15-E-IsoP), compared to the placebo. The metabolites that increased in abundance have been related to vascular homeostasis and smooth muscle function, suggesting a positive effect on the cardiovascular system.

The aims were to examine cellular mechanism(s) through which EEN may suppress  and investigate potential pathways to enhance anti-inflammatory properties of EEN.Glutamine, arginine, vitamin D, and α  (ALA), present in PF, along with curcumin, were identified as immunoactive nutrient therapies. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-exposed HT-29 colonic epithelial cells were used to investigate the immunosuppressive activity of the nutrients by assessing their effect on cell viability, cell activity, chemokine response (interleukin-8 [IL-8]), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IκB kinase (Iκκ), and nitric oxide (NO).Cellular viability and activity were maintained with all nutrient treatments. Glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D, but not ALA, significantly attenuated IL-8 production. Glutamine and arginine led to phosphorylation blockade of the signaling components in NF-κB and P38 pathways, reduction in kinase activity, and enhancement in NO production. Combining glutamine, arginine, and curcumin at optimal concentrations completely abolished the IL-8 response.These data indicate that glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D can suppress  at concentrations equivalent to those used in PF. The mechanisms of this action were mediated through influencing the NF-κB and P38 cascades.

Insight into the changes of the composition of metabolites and dysregulation of target genes and proteins enhances the understanding of the pathophysiology of CKD and its complications, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Chronic interstitial nephropathy is a common cause of CKD. The present study was designed to determine the effect of chronic interstitial nephropathy on the composition of serum metabolites and regulation of oxidative, inflammatory, fibrotic and cytoprotective pathways.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the CKD and control groups ( n  = 8/group). CKD was induced by administration of adenine (200 mg/kg body weight/day) by oral gavage for 3 weeks. The control group was treated with the vehicle alone. The animals were then observed for an additional 3 weeks, at which point they were sacrificed and kidney and serum samples were collected. Serum metabolomic and lipidomic analyses were performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight high-definition mass spectrometry. Kidney tissues were processed for histological and molecular biochemical analyses.CKD rats exhibited increased plasma urea and creatinine concentrations, renal interstitial fibrosis, tubular damage and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant and pro-fibrotic pathways. Comparison of serum from CKD and control rats revealed significant differences in concentrations of amino acids and lipids including 33 metabolites and 35 lipid species. This was associated with marked abnormalities of fatty  oxidation, and γ- and linoleic  metabolism in CKD rats. Logistic regression analysis identified tetracosanoic , docosatrienoic , PC(18:3/14:1) and l -aspartic , tetracosanoic  and docosatrienoic  as novel biomarkers of chronic interstitial nephropathy.Advanced CKD in rats with adenine-induced chronic interstitial nephropathy results in profound changes in the serum metabolome, activation of inflammatory, oxidative and fibrotic pathways, and suppression of cytoprotective and antioxidant pathways.© The Author 2017.

High-fat diets have been implicated in reduced gut microbiota richness, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and several changes at family, genus and species levels. Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and conjugated  fatty acids share important pathways of immune system activation/inhibition with gut microbes, modulating obesogenic and proinflammatory profiles. Mechanisms that link dietary fat, gut microbiota and obesity are mediated by increased intestinal permeability, systemic endotoxemia, and the activity of the endocannabinoid system. Although the probiotic therapy could be a complementary strategy to improve gut microbiota composition, it did not show permanent effects to treat fat-induced dysbiosis. Based upon evidence to date, we believe that high-fat diets and SFA consumption should be avoided, and MUFA and omega-3 PUFA intake should be encouraged in order to regulate gut microbiota and , promoting body weight/fat control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663791>Reduced acute neuroinflammation and improved functional recovery after traumatic brain injury by α- supplementation in mice.</a></h1><p>Adequate consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is vital for normal development and functioning of the central nervous system. The long-chain n-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  are anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in the models of central nervous system injury including traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the present study, we tested whether a higher brain DHA status in a mouse model on an adequate dietary α- (ALA) leads to reduced neuroinflammation and improved spontaneous recovery after TBI in comparison to a moderately lowered brain DHA status that can occur in humans.Mice reared on diets with differing ALA content were injured by a single cortical contusion impact. Change in the expression of inflammatory cytokines was measured, and cellular changes occurring after injury were analyzed by immunostaining for macrophage/microglia and astrocytes. Behavioral studies included rotarod and beam walk tests and contextual fear conditioning.Marginal supply (0.04 %) of ALA as the sole dietary source of n-3 PUFA from early gestation produced reduction of brain DHA by 35 % in adult offspring mice in comparison to the mice on adequate ALA diet (3.1 %). The DHA-depleted group showed significantly increased TBI-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the brain as well as slower functional recovery from motor deficits compared to the adequate ALA group. Despite the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, adequate ALA diet did not significantly alter either microglia/macrophage density around the contusion site or the relative M1/M2 phenotype. However, the glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was reduced in the injured cerebral cortex of the mice on adequate ALA diet, indicating that astrocyte activation may have contributed to the observed differences in cellular and behavioral responses to TBI.Increasing the brain DHA level even from a moderately DHA-depleted state can reduce neuroinflammation and improve functional recovery after TBI, suggesting possible improvement of functional outcome by increasing dietary n-3 PUFA in human TBI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061538>Cosmetic and Therapeutic Applications of Fish Oil's Fatty Acids on the Skin.</a></h1><p>Fish oil has been broadly reported as a potential supplement to ameliorate the severity of some skin disorders such as photoaging, skin cancer, allergy, dermatitis, cutaneous wounds, and melanogenesis.

On the other hand, PUFAs in fish oil can be the regulators that affect the synthesis and activity of cytokines for promoting wound healing. A systemic review was conducted to demonstrate the association between fish oil supplementation and the benefits to the skin. The following describes the different cosmetic and therapeutic approaches using fatty acids derived from fish oil, especially ALA, LA, DHA, and EPA. This review summarizes the cutaneous application of fish oil and the related fatty acids in the cell-based, animal-based, and clinical models. The research data relating to fish oil treatment of skin disorders suggest a way forward for generating advances in cosmetic and dermatological uses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27535180>15-Lipoxygenase metabolites of α-, [13-(S)-HPOTrE and 13-(S)-HOTrE], mediate anti-inflammatory effects by inactivating NLRP3 inflammasome.</a></h1><p>The ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) appears to be critical in the regulation of various pathophysiological processes and to maintain cellular homeostasis. While a high proportion of dietary intake of ω-6 PUFAs is associated with various inflammatory disorders, higher intake of ω-3 PUFAs is known to offer protection. It is now well established that beneficial effects of ω-3 PUFAs are mediated in part by their oxygenated metabolites mainly via the lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. However, the down-stream signaling pathways that are involved in these anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 PUFAs have not been elucidated. The present study evaluates the effects of 15-LOX metabolites of α- (ALA, ω-3 PUFA) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced  in RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. Further, the effect of these metabolites on the survival of BALB/c mice in LPS mediated septic shock and also polymicrobial sepsis in Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) mouse model was studied. These studies reveal the anti-inflammatory effects of 13-(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic  [13-(S)-HPOTrE] and 13-(S)-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic  [13-(S)-HOTrE] by inactivating NLRP3 inflammasome complex through the PPAR-γ pathway. Additionally, both metabolites also deactivated autophagy and induced apoptosis. In mediating all these effects 13-(S)-HPOTrE was more potent than 13-(S)-HOTrE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298541>Rosa Mosqueta Oil Prevents Oxidative Stress and  through the Upregulation of PPAR-α and NRF2 in C57BL/6J Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p> Rosa mosqueta (RM) oil is characterized by high concentrations of antioxidants and α- (ALA; 18:3n-3). We have previously demonstrated in male C57BL/6J mice that RM decreases hepatic steatosis, a condition strongly associated with oxidative stress and . We studied the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of RM in preventing high-fat diet (HFD)-induced oxidative stress and . Male C57BL/6J mice aged 28 d and weighing 12-14 g were divided into the following groups and fed for 12 wk: control diet (CD; 10% fat, 20% protein, and 70% carbohydrates); CD + RM (1.94 mg ALA ⋅ g body weight ⋅ d administered by oral gavage); HFD (60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrates); and HFD + RM. General parameters (body weight, visceral fat, and histology); glucose metabolism [homeostasis model assessment and blood glucose area under the curve (AUC)]; oxidative stress [hepatic nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like-2 (NRF2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) concentrations]; and  [hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1) concentrations, blood tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) concentrations, and  and  mRNA expression in liver and visceral adipose tissue] were evaluated. In the HFD + RM mice, the final body weight (24.8 ± 1.1 g) was 19% lower than in the HFD mice (30.6 ± 2.8 g) ( < 0.05). Visceral fat was 34% lower in the HFD + RM mice than in the HFD mice ( < 0.05). The blood glucose AUC was 29% lower and  and  expression levels were 47% and 59% lower, respectively, in the HFD + RM mice than in the HFD mice ( < 0.05). HFD + RM mice had 40% less hepatic steatosis ( < 0.05) and lower upregulation of PPAR-α (33%), ACOX1 (50%), NRF2 (39%), and HO-1 (68%) protein concentrations than did the HFD mice ( < 0.05). Our findings suggest that RM supplementation prevents the obese phenotype observed in HFD-fed mice by downregulating inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion and stimulating hepatic antioxidant and fatty  oxidation markers.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233865>Cytokines, angiogenic, and antiangiogenic factors and bioactive lipids in preeclampsia.</a></h1><p>Preeclampsia is a low-grade systemic inflammatory condition in which oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction occurs. Plasma levels of soluble receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-1, also known as sFlt1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), an antiangiogenic factor have been reported to be elevated in preeclampsia. It was reported that pregnant mice deficient in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity show a preeclampsia-like phenotype due to a deficiency or absence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME), a natural metabolite of estradiol that is elevated during the third trimester of normal human pregnancy. Additionally, autoantibodies (AT1-AAs) that bind and activate the angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor) also have a role in preeclampsia. None of these abnormalities are consistently seen in all the patients with preeclampsia and some of them are not specific to pregnancy. Preeclampsia could occur due to an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. VEGF, an angiogenic factor, is necessary for the transport of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to endothelial cells. Hence reduced VEGF levels decrease the availability of PUFAs to endothelial cells. This leads to a decrease in the formation of anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factors: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins from PUFAs. Lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, and PUFAs suppress insulin resistance; activation of leukocytes, platelets, and macrophages; production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α; and oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction; and enhance production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). Estrogen enhances the formation of lipoxin A4 and NO. PUFAs also augment the production of NO and inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and antagonize the actions of angiotensin II. Thus, PUFAs can prevent activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor). Patients with preeclampsia have decreased plasma phospholipid concentrations of arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the precursors of lipoxins (from AA), resolvins (from EPA and DHA), and protectins (from DHA) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 from DGLA: dihomo-γ-) and prostacyclin (PGI2 derived from AA). Based on these evidences, it is proposed that preeclampsia may occur due to deficiency of PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory products: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ROS and RNS can directly damage biomacromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids. Lipid peroxidation, however, can result in reactive carbonyl species (RCS) that can also modify proteins and DNA. In contrast to an extensive literature on the modification of proteins and DNA from omega-6 fatty acids, there are few studies on RCS generation from other fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, which are frequently consumed from the diet and diet supplements. Therefore, a comparison between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids has been conducted. LC-MS/MS analysis of carbonyl-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) standards yielded characteristic fragment ions. Autoxidation products of α- and linoleic  were then derivatized with DNPH and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results showed that α-, an omega-3 fatty , generated more acrolein and crotonaldehyde than did linoleic , an omega-6 fatty . Omega-3 fatty acids might be easily degraded to smaller monoaldehydes or dicarbonyls. Omega-3 fatty acids have been considered as health improvement components for a long time. However, on the basis of the results presented here, use of omega-3 fatty acids should be re-evaluated in vivo for safety purposes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968772>Targeting n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of triacylglycerides in the absence of alcohol consumption, in association with oxidative stress (OS), a pro-inflammatory state and insulin resistance (IR), which are attenuated by n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) C20-C22 (LCPUFAs) supplementation. Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of lipogenesis due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and  resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in NASH, a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives. Clinical trials establishing optimal dosages, intervention times, type of patients and possible synergies with other natural products are needed in future studies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p></html>
