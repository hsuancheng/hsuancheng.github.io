The first group (n = 68 women) was treated from the preconceptional period until the 24th week of pregnancy with 1.75 g/day myo-inositol, 250 mg/day D-chiro-inositol, 12.5 mg/day Zinc pidolate, 100 mg/day methylsulfonylmethane, 120 mg/day Vitamin C and 400 mcg/day ()-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. The control group (n = 72) was only treated with 400 mcg/day folic acid. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of maternal GDM. Secondary outcome measures were the prevalence of NTDs and fetal macrosomia.A significant difference was found regarding body mass index (BMI), fasting oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), after 1-h-glucose OGTT, 2-h-glucose OGTT, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum folate, between the two groups. Five infants, in the control group, weighted greater than 4 kg. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between HbA1c and OGTT at the 24th week of pregnancy.This study shows the efficacy of preconceptional supplementation of inositol to reduce the risk of the onset of GDM and to confirm the importance of folic acid supplementation to avoid NTDs development. Moreover, the positive correlation between HbA1c and OGTT may be useful to consider the use of HbA1c as a single tool for GDM prevention and diagnosis in selected woman in pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281143>Coulometric differential FFT admittance voltammetry determination of Amlodipine in pharmaceutical formulation by nano-composite electrode.</a></h2><p>An electrochemical detection technique based on combination of was coulometric differential fast Fourier transformation admittance voltammetry (CDFFTAV) and nano-composite film modified glassy carbon electrode was successfully applied for sensitive determination of Amlodipine. The nano-composite film was made by a mixture of ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4), multiwall carbon nanotube and Au nanoparticles as electrochemical mediators. Studies reveal that the irreversible oxidation of Amlodipine was highly facile on the electrode surface. The electrochemical response was established on calculation of the charge under the admittance peak, which was obtained by discrete integration of the admittance response in a selected potential range, obtained in a flow injection analysis. Once established the best operative optimum conditions, the resulting nano-composite film electrode showed a catalytic effect on the oxidation of the analyte. The response is linear in the Amlodipine concentration range of 1.0 × 10(-9) to 2.0 × 10(-7)M with a detection limit of 1.25 × 10(-10)M. Moreover, the proposed technique exhibited high sensitivity, fast response time (less than ) and long-term stability and reproducibility around 96%, and it was successfully used to the determination of Amlodipine content in the pharmaceutical formulation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Arginine is a substrate for NO, whereas the methylated arginines-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA)-are endogenous by-products of proteolysis that inhibit NO production.We investigated if high-plasma levels of ADMA, SDMA, and arginine/ADMA ratio were associated with 90-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.We included 267 adult patients admitted to intensive care unit with severe sepsis or septic shock. The patients had previously been included in the randomized controlled trial "Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock ()." ADMA, SDMA, and arginine/ADMA ratio were measured in plasma. The risk of death within 90 days was estimated in multivariate Cox regression analyses adjusted for gender, age ≥65 years, major cardiovascular disease, , hypertension, respiratory failure, vasopressor treatment, highest quartile of creatinine and bilirubin, and lowest quartile of platelet count. In the regression analyses missing values were estimated using multiple imputation.Twenty-five patients had missing data in one or more of the baseline variables and 44 patients had missing methylarginine values. Both ADMA and SDMA were independently associated with 90-day mortality (ADMA: hazard ratio 1.54; 95% CI, 1.00-2.38; P = 0.046, and SDMA: hazard ratio 1.78; 95% CI, 1.14-2.72; P = 0.011). Arginine/ADMA ratio was not associated with 90-day mortality neither in univariate nor in multivariate analyses. The difference in mortality between patients with high and low ADMA was most pronounced in the first week after inclusion.High levels of ADMA and SDMA in plasma were associated with increased 90-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Interfering with the methylarginine-NO systems may be a novel target in these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27312018>[Hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk: advantages and limitations of current treatment options].</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death in Europe. High blood cholesterol is one of the major cardiovascular risk factors and plays a crucial role in causing cardiovascular disease. A strong positive and linear association between total and LDL cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events has been widely documented. Every 1.0 mmol/l decrease in LDL cholesterol levels results in a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. Lipid-lowering guidelines suggest as first step the use of statins as monotherapy and, in case of failure to achieve the recommended targets, combination therapy of statins with other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as ezetimibe. The results from the recent IMPROVE-IT trial provide evidence that further LDL-cholesterol lowering beyond the recommended targets significantly reduces the rate of cardiovascular events, supporting the concept that "Lower Is Better" while additional long-term data are collected. Non-adherence to statin therapy, often due to adverse drug reactions, results in an increased risk for cardiovascular events. In a non-negligible proportion of patients with hypercholesterolemia receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy, the residual risk remains high. In addition, statin use has been associated with accelerated onset of  in individuals already predisposed to developing . In conclusion, it is clear that statins are not the universal solution to the problem of high cholesterol levels, and the optimization of lipid-lowering therapy remains a therapeutic challenge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711144>A dimeric urea of the bisabolene sesquiterpene from the Okinawan marine sponge Axinyssa sp. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays an important role as a negative regulator of the insulin and leptin signaling pathways.

Of these, compound 1 was the most potent inhibitor of PTP1B activity (IC50=1.9μM) without cytotoxicity at 50μM in two human cancer cell lines, hepatoma Huh-7 and bladder carcinoma EJ-1 cells. Compound 1 also moderately enhanced the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation levels of Akt in Huh-7 cells. Therefore, compound 1 has potential as a new type of anti-diabetic drug candidate possessing PTP1B inhibitory activity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Diabetic patients, referred by their primary care physicians to a DR community screening program, were included. A Topcon TRC NW- camera was used to obtain 45-degree digital color fundus images. Images were interpreted by retina specialists using a quality rating system. Patients with retinal findings or unreadable photographs were referred for a complete examination. Outcome measures were attendance rates, photograph quality, DR prevalence, and associated risk factors.A total of 948 diabetic patients were sent for camera screening, with an attendance rate of 65.6%, which increased during the study period. The mean age was 55.8 ± 11.6 years, the majority (56.9%) were Hispanic, and 43.5% were uninsured. Overall photograph quality rating was relatively high, with 81.7% graded as good or fair. Thirty photographs (2.9%) were unreadable. The prevalence of newly diagnosed DR was 11.1%. Independent DR-associated risk factors included Hispanic race (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29), lack of health insurance (OR = 2.49), longer duration of  (OR = 1.07), higher HbA1c levels (OR = 1.19), presence of diabetic complications (OR = 2.93), and lack of previous eye examination (OR = 13.22).Nonmydriatic fundus camera is an effective and feasible screening tool for the early detection of DR in a safety net institution. It should be considered in areas with limited access to health care to improve quality of care and potentially reduce vision loss rates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30470350>Invited commentary.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29847374>Vertical Inset of the Latissimus Dorsi Flap Improves Reconstruction Aesthetics by Reducing Scar Burden in the "Social Breast".</a></h2><p>The skin paddle of the latissimus dorsi flap is typically inset horizontally (HILD) in breast reconstruction. We describe our experience with the vertical inset of the latissimus dorsi (VILD) and its aesthetic benefit.We performed a case-control study comparing the most recent cases of both VILD and HILD. Scar, as seen on anterior-posterior photographs, was digitally measured and compared from 3 clinically relevant areas: (1) all visible scarring ("mirror view"), (2) scarring above the nipple ("self-view"), and (3) scarring above or medial to the nipple ("social view"). Demographics and outcomes were statistically compared.Fifty of the most recent patients receiving HILD or VILD were selected for each group. Average patient age was 55.6 and 51.6 years (P = 0.32), and average follow-up was 531.6 and 606.7 days (P = 0.20), respectively. The VILD scar-length ratios were decreased by 17% in the mirror view (P ≤ 0.01), 37% in the self-view (P ≤ 0.01), and 37% in the social view (P ≤ 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding smoking (P = 0.75),  (P = 0.70), body mass index (P = 0.74), seroma (P = 0.46), infection (P = 1.0), or flap necrosis (P = 0.70).The VILD is safe and reliable. Measurements from anterior-posterior photographs illustrate statistically significant decreases in overall scar burden (mirror view) and statistically significant reductions in the highly visible self-view and social view. Our study is the first to quantify a reduction in scar burden by using VILD technique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29914830>Clinical factors that influence the cellular responses of saphenous veins used for arterial bypass.</a></h2><p>When an autogenous vein is harvested and used for arterial bypass, it suffers physical and biologic injuries that may set in motion the cellular processes that lead to wall thickening, fibrosis, stenosis, and ultimately graft failure. Whereas the injurious effects of surgical preparation of the vein conduit have been extensively studied, little is known about the influence of the clinical environment of the donor leg from which the vein is obtained.We studied the cellular responses of fresh saphenous vein samples obtained before implantation in 46 patients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass surgery. Using an ex vivo model of response to injury, we quantified the outgrowth of cells from explants of the adventitial and medial layers of the vein. We correlated this cellular outgrowth with the clinical characteristics of the patients, including the Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection classification of the donor leg for ischemia, wounds, and infection as well as smoking and .Cellular outgrowth was significantly faster and more robust from the adventitial layer than from the medial layer. The factors of leg ischemia (P < .001), smoking (P = .042), and leg infection (P = .045) were associated with impaired overall outgrowth from the adventitial tissue on multivariable analysis. Only ischemia (P = .046) was associated with impaired outgrowth of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the medial tissue. Co-culture of adventitial cells and SMCs propagated from vein explants revealed that adventitial cells significantly inhibited the growth of SMCs, whereas SMCs promoted the growth of adventitial cells. The AA genotype of the -838C>A p27 polymorphism (previously associated with superior graft patency) enhanced these effects, whereas the factor of smoking attenuated adventitial cell inhibition of SMC growth. Comparing gene expression, the cells cultured from the media overexpress Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways associated with inflammation and infection, whereas those from the adventitia overexpress gene families associated with development and stem/progenitor cell maintenance.The adverse clinical environment of the leg may influence the biologic behavior of the cells in the vein wall, especially the adventitial cells. Chronic ischemia was the most significant factor that retards adventitial cell outgrowth. The cells arising from the vein adventitia may be key players in determining a healthy adaptive or a pathologic response to the injuries associated with vein grafting.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) and cardiomyopathy (DC) are major causes of death. The pathophysiology of DN/DC includes inflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms. NF-κB is one of the transcription factor that mediates signal transduction processes. Nowadays, it is suggested that inhibition of NF-κB activation could delay the development of DN and DC. 6-shogaol was reported to modulate NF-κB besides its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, it is worth testing it against diabetic complications. Rats were divided to 4 groups: Normal control (NC), 6-shogaol (), diabetic control (DC), diabetic rats treated with 6-shogaol (DC+). BGL, BUN, serum creatinine, total urine protein, creatine kinase (CK), LDH, NO, TNF-α NF-κB were determined in serum. Heart and kidney tissues were isolated for GSH, MDA, SOD measurement and histopathology. NF-κB was estimated in kidney tissues using immunohistopathology and western blot techniques. Results showed that diabetic rats left untreated for 16 weeks showed kidney injury as evidenced from elevated BUN, serum creatinine, urine protein, TNF-α and NF-κB. Heart tissue damage was evidence from elevated CK, LDH. Diabetic rats simultaneously treated with 6-shogaol showed a protective effect on both kidney and heart as evidenced biochemically and histopathologically. Therefore, using 6-shogaol may be of value in protection against diabetic complications in kidney and heart of rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561106>Design, synthesis, in-vitro evaluation and molecular docking studies of novel indole derivatives as inhibitors of SIRT1 and SIRT2.</a></h2><p>Sirtuins (SIRTs), class III HDAC (Histone deacetylase) family proteins, are associated with cancer, , and other age-related disorders. SIRT1 and SIRT2 are established therapeutic drug targets by regulating its function either by activators or inhibitors. Compounds containing indole moiety are potential lead molecules inhibiting SIRT1 and SIRT2 activity. In the current study, we have successfully synthesized 22 indole derivatives in association with an additional triazole moiety that provide better anchoring of the ligands in the binding cavity of SIRT1 and SIRT2. In-vitro binding and deacetylation assays were carried out to characterize their inhibitory effects against SIRT1 and SIRT2. We found four derivatives, 6l, 6m, 6n, and 6o to be specific for SIRT1 inhibition; three derivatives, 6a, 6d and 6k, specific for SIRT2 inhibition; and two derivatives,  and 6t, which inhibit both SIRT1 and SIRT2. In-silico validation for the selected compounds was carried out to study the nature of binding of the ligands with the neighboring residues in the binding site of SIRT1. These derivatives open up newer avenues to explore specific inhibitors of SIRT1 and SIRT2 with therapeutic implications for human diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Food consumption was evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire of thirteen items, related to the consumption in the last week. We evaluated quality of the diet using the Adult Diet Quality Index (IQD-A). Healthy food received increasing scores while unhealthy food received decreasing scores, according to consumption frequency, amounting to scores from zero to 30. The total score was divided into tertiles. Individuals of the third tertile were classified with better quality of the diet. We investigated the association between quality of the diet and independent variables using multinomial logistic regression.We interviewed 1,519 individuals with mean IQD-A of 17.1 points (SD = 3.3) and a median of 17.0 (range of 10 to 25 points). Although the population studied kept the consumption of staple foods, the intake of industrialized food such as soft drinks, artificial juices, and unhealthy foods such as sweets was high. Older individuals presented seven times (95%CI 4.20-12.48) more chance of having a better quality of the diet. Women, individuals with higher economic status, those who worked in the sale of animals, or those who had  were approximately twice as likely to be in the group with the best quality of the diet. Individuals whose families worked with fishing presented a 70% lower chance of being in the group of better quality of the diet.We identified that men, younger adults, individuals of lower socioeconomic level, and fishing families were in the group of higher vulnerability for the consumption of a diet with worse quality. Thus, public policies, especially educational policies, are needed to promote healthy eating in this group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753580>Acceleration of diabetic wound healing with adipose-derived stem cells, endothelial-differentiated stem cells, and topical conditioned medium therapy in a swine model.</a></h2><p>The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), endothelial-differentiated ASCs (EC/ASCs), and various conditioned media (CM) on wound healing in a diabetic swine model. We hypothesized that ASC-based therapies would accelerate wound healing. was induced in four Yorkshire swine through intravenous injection of streptozotocin. ASCs were harvested from flank fat and cultured in either M199 or EGM-2 medium. A duplicate series of seven full-thickness dorsal wounds were surgically created on each swine. The wounds in the cellular treatment group underwent injection of low-dose or high-dose ASCs or EC/ASCs on day 0, with a repeat injection of one half of the initial dose on day 15. Wounds assigned to the topical CM therapy were covered with 2 mL of either serum-free M199 primed by ASCs or human umbilical vein endothelial cells every 3 days. Wounds were assessed at day 0, 10, 15, 20, and 28. The swine were sacrificed on day 28. ImageJ software was used to evaluate the percentage of wound healing. The wounded skin underwent histologic, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examinations to evaluate markers of angiogenesis and inflammation.We found an increase in the percentage of wound closure rates in cell-based treatments and topical therapies at various points compared with the untreated control wounds (P < .05). The results from the histologic, messenger RNA, and protein analyses suggested the treated wounds displayed increased angiogenesis and a diminished inflammatory response.Cellular therapy with ASCs, EC/ASCs, and topical CM accelerated diabetic wound healing in the swine model. Enhanced angiogenesis and immunomodulation might be key contributors to this process.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

For a majority of techniques, the most common long-term complication is pseudoptosis. It has previously been proposed that upper breast suspensory ligaments (SL) are weaker than lower breast SL. We tested this hypothesis through anthropometry of the proxies for upper and lower SL strength: the sternal notch-nipple (SN-N) distance and the nipple-inframammary fold (N-IMF) distance, respectively.An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty in an academic faculty practice between 2008 and 2015 was conducted. Patient demographics included age, race, and body mass index (BMI); patient comorbidities included smoking status, , and hypertension. Breast anthropometric measurements included SN-N and N-IMF. Sternal notch-nipple was used as the primary metric of the upper SL strength, whereas N-IMF was used as the primary metric of the lower SL strength. Intraoperative details included reduction technique and resection mass. Postoperative complications were recorded, including nipple areola complex necrosis and hematoma. Linear regression analysis was performed with the primary endpoint of the relationship between SN-N and N-IMF distance in macromastia.Data from 208 patients, totaling 400 individual breast measurements, were collected. The mean SN-N length was 35.1 cm, mean N-IMF length was 16.0 cm, and mean resection weight was 1094 g. Linear regression found that N-IMF distance could be predicted as 45% of the SN-N distance (N-IMF = 0.454 * SN-N). This was a strong relationship, demonstrated by univariate analysis of SN-N and N-IMF (R, 0.624; P < 0.001). A Wise pattern was used in 89.9% of cases; an inferior pedicle was used in 83.7% of cases. Nipple areola complex necrosis occurred in 15 breasts (3.75%). Sternal notch-nipple (R, 0.127; P = 0.011) and N-IMF (R, 0.119; P = 0.017) were both predictive of nipple areola complex necrosis (Table 4).In our series, the N-IMF distance increased 0.45 cm for every 1 cm increase in the SN-N distance. This relationship strengthens our primary hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. Taking this into consideration, we suggest that surgeons seeking to minimize pseudoptosis rates should favor techniques that minimally disrupt the lower SL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30104096>Reversible secretome and signaling defects in diabetic mesenchymal stem cells from peripheral arterial disease patients.</a></h2><p>Regenerative medicine seeks to stall or to reverse the pathologic consequences of chronic diseases. Many people with  have peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which increases their already high risk of major amputation. Cellular therapies are a promising regenerative medicine approach to PAD that can be used to focally inject regenerative cells to endangered tissue beds. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to promote tissue regeneration through stromal support and paracrine stimulation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Whereas little is known about human diabetic MSCs (dMSCs), particularly those from patients with PAD, dMSCs have a limited expansion capacity but can be improved with human platelet lysate (PL) supplementation. PL is rich in many growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is known to be important to cell proliferation and survival signaling pathways. We hypothesize that dMSCs have a reversible defect in EGF receptor pathways. The objective of this work was to test this hypothesis using dMSCs from PAD patients.The secretome expression of EGF and prominent angiogens was characterized from bone marrow (BM)-derived and adipose tissue-derived (ATD) dMSCs from five patients (six limbs) undergoing major amputation. Western blot was used to characterize the AKT and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 expression in dMSCs under standard culture (5% fetal bovine serum plus fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF2]), 5% human PL, or 5% fetal bovine serum plus EGF. Healthy donor MSCs were control cells. The angiogenic activity of BM- and ATD-dMSCs was tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs). Paired t-test, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate.Both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had typical MSC surface marker expression and similar expansion profiles, and they did not express EGF in their secretome. PL supplementation of dMSCs improved AKT signaling, but they were resistant to FGF2 activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2. EGF supplementation led to similar AKT expression as with PL, but PL had greater phosphorylation of AKT at 30 and 60 minutes. The conditioned media from both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had robust levels of prominent angiogens (vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, hepatocyte growth factor), which stimulated EC proliferation and migration, and the co-culture of dMSCs with ECs led to significantly longer EC sprouts in three-dimensional gel than EC-alone pellets.PL and EGF supplementation improves AKT expression in dMSCs over that of FGF2, but PL improved pAKT over that of EGF. Thus, PL supplementation strategies may improve AKT signaling, which could be important to MSC survival in cellular therapies. Furthermore, BM- and ATD-dMSCs have similar secretomes and robust in vitro angiogenic activity, which supports pursuing dMSCs from both reservoirs in regenerative medicine strategies.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive endogenous dicarbonyl metabolite derived from multiple sources such as glucose and lipids and is thought to contribute greatly to protein glycation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that both [6]-shogaol () and [6]-gingerol (6G), the major active components in ginger, markedly trapped MGO in vitro and consequently formed mono-MGO adducts, -MGO and 6G-MGO, which were purified from the respective chemical reaction and characterized as novel compounds by NMR experiments and LC-MS/MS approaches. We revealed that the α-carbon of the carbonyl group in the side chain of  or 6G is the major active site for trapping MGO. We also demonstrated that  and 6G could effectively inhibit the formation of MGO-induced AGEs via trapping MGO in a time-dependent manner in the human serum albumin (HSA)-MGO system.

As aberrant CS-PNN formations have been linked to a range of pathological states, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia, the analysis of CS-GAGs in brain tissue at the disaccharide level has great potential to enhance disease diagnosis and prognosis. Two mass-spectrometry (MS)-based approaches were adapted to detect CS disaccharides from minute fixed tissue samples with low picomolar sensitivity and high reproducibility. The first approach employed a straightforward, quantitative direct infusion (DI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technique to determine the percentages of Δ4S- and Δ-CS disaccharides within the 4S/-CS ratio, while the second used a comprehensive liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS technique to determine the relative percentages of Δ0S- Δ4S- Δ- Δ4S6S-CS, and Δ2S6S-CS disaccharides, with internal validation by full chondroitin lyase activity. The quantitative accuracy of the five primary biologically-relevant CS disaccharides was validated using a developmental time course series in fixed rodent brain tissue. We then analyzed the CS disaccharide composition in formalin-fixed human brain tissue, thus providing the first quantitative report of CS sulfation patterns in human brain. The ability to comprehensively analyze the CS disaccharide composition from fixed brain tissue provides a means with which to identify alterations in the CS-GAG composition in relation to the onset and/or progression of neurological diseases.© The Author(s) 2019.

Both EPCs and MSCs are critical to the wound repair process, which is hindered in .  has been shown to decrease the function of these progenitor cells, whereas estrogen has beneficial wound healing effects. However, the role of estrogen in modulating EPC and MSC biology in  is unknown. We investigated the effect of estrogen on improving bone marrow (BM)-derived EPC and MSC function using a murine diabetic wound healing model.Female diabetic db/db and nondiabetic control mice were wounded cutaneously and treated with topical estrogen or placebo cream. On day 5 after wounding, BM cells were harvested to quantify EPC number and colony-forming units of EPCs and MSCs. Wound healing rate was concurrently studied. Vessel density and scar density were then quantified using whole body perfusion and laser confocal microscopy. EPC recruitment was documented by immunohistochemistry to identify CD34- and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-positive cells in the vessel wall. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance.Topical estrogen significantly increased colony-forming units of both EPCs and MSCs compared with placebo treatment, indicating improved viability and proliferative ability of these cells. Consistently, increased recruitment of EPCs to diabetic wounds and higher vessel density were observed in estrogen-treated compared with placebo-treated mice. Consequently, topical estrogen significantly accelerated wound healing as early as day 6 after wounding. In addition, scar density resulting from collagen deposition was increased in the estrogen-treated group, reflecting increased MSC activity and differentiation.Estrogen treatment increases wound healing and wound neovascularization in diabetic mice. Our data implicate that these beneficial effects may be mediated through improving the function of BM-derived EPCs and MSCs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Apoptosis, inflammatory and ROS production are among the factors that are involved in the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. 6-shogaol is reported to inhibit apoptosis and reduce inflammatory and ROS production. This study aimed to study the effect of 6-shogaol () on the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy in vitro. To develop DC model, H9c2 cell line was exposed to high glucose (HG) level (33 M glucose) for 24 h and used as a model for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Another set of H9c2 cell lines were 1 h pretreated with different conc. of 6-shogaol (5-20 μM). Cell viability, apoptosis, ROS production, IL-6, TNF-alpha and NF-κB were estimated in these cell lines treated with HG level or pretreated with 6-shgoal before HG. Exposing cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells to HG produced dramatic changes in cell biology and chemistry. There is a significant reduction in cell viability and enhancement in cell apoptosis as compared with control. In addition, ROS production, IL-6, TNF-α levels were increased in H9c2 line treated with HG. Also, there is overexpression of NF-κB in cells treated with HG levels alone. On the other hand, pretreatment of cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells with 6-shogaol (5-20μM) significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis, in addition,  at a dose of 10 μM abrogated the deleterious effects of HG on oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters via modulation of NF-κB pathway. Therefore,  has a potential protective effect against hyperglycemia-induced DC in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25611733>The extracellular RNA complement of Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>The secretion of biomolecules into the extracellular milieu is a common and well-conserved phenomenon in biology. In bacteria, secreted biomolecules are not only involved in intra-species communication but they also play roles in inter-kingdom exchanges and pathogenicity. To date, released products, such as small molecules, DNA, peptides, and proteins, have been well studied in bacteria. However, the bacterial extracellular RNA complement has so far not been comprehensively characterized. Here, we have analyzed, using a combination of physical characterization and high-throughput sequencing, the extracellular RNA complement of both outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-associated and OMV-free RNA of the enteric Gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 substrain MG1655 and have compared it to its intracellular RNA complement. Our results demonstrate that a large part of the extracellular RNA complement is in the size range between 15 and 40 nucleotides and is derived from specific intracellular RNAs. Furthermore, RNA is associated with OMVs and the relative abundances of RNA biotypes in the intracellular, OMV and OMV-free fractions are distinct. Apart from rRNA fragments, a significant portion of the extracellular RNA complement is composed of specific cleavage products of functionally important structural noncoding RNAs, including tRNAs, 4.5S RNA,  RNA, and tmRNA. In addition, the extracellular RNA pool includes RNA biotypes from cryptic prophages, intergenic, and coding regions, of which some are so far uncharacterised, for example, transcripts mapping to the fimA-fimL and ves-spy intergenic regions. Our study provides the first detailed characterization of the extracellular RNA complement of the enteric model bacterium E. coli. Analogous to findings in eukaryotes, our results suggest the selective export of specific RNA biotypes by E. coli, which in turn indicates a potential role for extracellular bacterial RNAs in intercellular communication.© 2015 The Authors.

To further validate this method, this analysis was applied to mice fed with synthetic diets whose carbohydrate components consisted solely of either glucose or fructose.Eight glucose-fed and 12 fructose-fed mice were given  H O followed by ad libitum feeding overnight. Mice were then euthanized, hepatic glycogen was isolated and derivatized to monoacetone glucose, and  H-enrichment of positions 2, 5, and 6 were measured by  H NMR. From these data, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance from the direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling and indirect pathway were estimated. Indirect pathway fractions were resolved into Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources-the latter including contributions from fructose metabolism.After overnight feeding, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance derived from direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling in glucose-fed-mice was 63 ± 1%. For the indirect pathway, Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources contributed 22 ± 1% and 15 ± 1%, respectively. For fructose-fed-mice, glycogen appearance was dominated by triose-phosphate sources (60 ± 2%) with lesser contributions from Krebs cycle (14 ± 1%) and direct and/or glycogen cycling (26 ± 2%).

The potential association between glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and cognitive performance was scarcely studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive performance levels across different degrees of kidney function.We analyzed 240 outpatients in a nephrology service, classified according to eGFR: Advanced (≤ 30ml/min/1.73m2), Moderate (30,1ml/min/1.73m2 to ≤ 60ml/min/1.73m2), and Mild CKD (> 60ml/min/1.73m2). Word list memory, Semantic fluency, Mental State Mini Exam and Trail Making Test (TMT) were applied to evaluate cognitive performance. In the TMT, lower scores are associated with better cognition. In linear regression, cognitive function was considered as dependent variables while groups based on eGFR were considered explanatory variables. The group with eGFR > 60ml/min was the reference and models were adjusted for confounding factors.In our population (n = 240) 64 patients (26.7%) were classified as having advanced, 98(40,8%) moderate, and 78(32,5%) mild. There was no statistical difference among them in MMSE or in the verbal fluency test. However, comparing to mild, patients with advanced CKD presented significantly worse cognitive performance measured by TMTA [50,8s ± 31.1s versus 66, ± 35,7s (p = 0.016)] and TMTB [92,7s ± 46,2s versus 162,4s ± 35,7s (p < 0.001)]. Significantly lower TMTB scores (CI95%) 33,0s (4,5-61,) were observed in patients with mild compared to advanced CKD in the multivariate analysis adjusting for age, education, sex, , and alcohol use.Advanced CKD is independently associated with poorer cognitive performance measured by an executive performance test compared to mild CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26378235>The Responses of Hyperglycemic Dividing Mesangial Cells to Heparin Are Mediated by the Non-reducing Terminal Trisaccharide.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies showed: (i) that growth-arrested G0/G1 rat mesangial cells stimulated to divide in hyperglycemic medium initiate intracellular hyaluronan synthesis that induces autophagy and the cyclin D3-induced formation of a monocyte-adhesive extracellular hyaluronan matrix after completing cell division; and (ii) that heparin inhibits the intracellular hyaluronan and autophagy responses, but after completing division, induces hyaluronan synthesis at the plasma membrane with the formation of a larger monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrix. This study shows: (i) that the non-terminal trisaccharide of heparin is sufficient to initiate the same responses as intact heparin, (ii) that a fully sulfated tetrasaccharide isolated from bacterial heparin lyase 1 digests of heparin that contains a Δ-2S-iduronate on the non-reducing end does not initiate the same responses as intact heparin, and (iii) that removal of the Δ-2S-iduronate to expose the fully sulfated trisaccharide (GlcNS()-IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS()) does initiate the same responses as intact heparin.

Life expectancy is dominated by cardiovascular risk, which is the leading cause of death in these patients. Up to one third of diabetic patients will develop diabetic nephropathy related to micro-angiopathy. Renal impairment further increases cardiovascular risk. Reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is a major public health issue, as well as early preventing and managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Good glycemic control prevents the micro-vascular complications of the disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, etc.) and, more recently recognized through prolonged monitoring of the VADT cohort, prevents cardiovascular complications. Control of blood pressure and dyslipidemia are essential in primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention. In addition, the blockers of the renin-angiotensin system slow down the progression of the MRC. Elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) form another growing group of the nephrologist daily patient pool. Especially for very elderly patients with comorbidities, the question of favoring conservative treatment rather than starting or pursuing dialysis may arise. Survival and quality of life are indeed not necessarily better in elderly patients undergoing dialysis, complications can occur eventually leading to discontinuation, and are occasionally associated with a feeling of stubbornness. Creation of prognostic score is a useful tool to help the decision-making process. However, dialogue with the patient and his/her family, as well as multidisciplinary collaboration remain fundamentals to determine the most suitable care.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the effect of preoperative hypoglycemia before TF injection or release is currently unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of preoperative hypoglycemia on infection incidence after TF injection or release.A retrospective cohort review between 2007 and 2015 was conducted using a national private payer database within the PearlDiver Supercomputer. Preoperative, fasting, glucose levels were collected for each patient, and these ranged from 20 to 219 mg/dL. Surgical site infection (SSI) rates were determined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes.The query of the PearlDiver database returned 153,479 TF injections, of which 3479 (2.27%) and 6276 (4.09%) had infections within 90 days and 1 year after procedure, respectively. There were 70,290 TF releases identified, with 1887 (2.68%) SSIs captured within 3 months after surgery and 3144 (4.47%) within 1 year after surgery. There was a statistically significant increase in SSI rates in patients with hypoglycemia within 90-day (P = 0.006) and 1-year (P < 0.001) time intervals post-TF injection. Likewise, a statistically significant increase in SSI rate in patients with hypoglycemia undergoing TF release within 1 year after release was seen (P = 0.003).Hypoglycemia before TF injection or release increases the risk for SSI. Tight glycemic control may be warranted to mitigate this risk. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of hypoglycemia as an independent risk factor for SSI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352715>Invited commentary.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463394>Interactions cardiorénales.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is common in patients with chronic renal disease particularly those with .

Long nerve gaps have been traditionally hard to study because of low incidence. The advent of the RANGER registry, a large, institutional review board-approved, active database for PNA (Avance Nerve Graft; AxoGen, Inc, Alachua, FL) has allowed evaluation of lower incidence subsets. The RANGER database was queried for digital nerve repairs of 25 mm or greater. Demographics, injury, treatment, and functional outcomes were recorded on standardized forms. Patients younger than 18 and those lacking quantitative follow-up data were excluded. Recovery was graded according to the Medical Research Council Classification for sensory function, with meaningful recovery defined as S3 or greater level. Fifty digital nerve injuries in 28 subjects were included. There were 22 male and 6 female subjects, and the mean age was 45. Three patients gave a previous history of , and there were 6 active smokers. The most commonly reported mechanisms of injury were saw injuries (n = 13), crushing injuries (n = 9), resection of neuroma (n = 9), amputation/avulsions (n = 8), sharp lacerations (n = 7), and blast/gunshots (n = 4). The average gap length was 35 ± 8 mm (range, 25-50 mm). Recovery to the S3 or greater level was reported in 86% of repairs. Static 2-point discrimination (s2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWF) were the most common completed assessments. Mean s2PD in 24 repairs reporting 2PD data was 9 ± 4 mm. For the 38 repairs with SWF data, protective sensation was reported in 33 repairs, deep pressure in 2, and no recovery in 3. These data compared favorably with historical data for nerve autograft repairs, with reported levels of meaningful recovery of 60% to 88%. There were no reported adverse effects. Processed nerve allograft can be used to reconstruct long gap nerve defects in the hand with consistently high rates of meaningful recovery.

Despite clear advances in the prevention and treatment of CVD, the impact of T2DM on CVD outcome remains high and continues to escalate. Available evidence indicates that the risk of macrovascular complications increases with the severity of hyperglycemia, thus suggesting that the relation between  disturbances and vascular damage is approximately linear. Although current antidiabetic drugs are highly effective for the management of hyperglycemia, most T2DM patients remain exposed to a substantial and concrete risk of CVD. Over the last decade many glucose-lowering agents have been tested for their safety and efficacy in T2DM with CVD. Noteworthy, most of these studies failed to show a significant benefit in terms of CV morbidity and mortality, despite intensive glycemic control.

Implant-based reconstruction in this patient population with the traditional horizontal elliptical skin-sparing mastectomy tends to have aesthetically displeasing qualities secondary to skin flap redundancy and blunting of the breast contour. Wise-pattern closures have been described with submuscular direct-to-implant and 2-stage reconstructions, with more favorable complication profile when staged. Our study aims to report outcomes and safety of a prepectoral 2-stage wise-pattern closure technique in the obese and/or ptotic population.A retrospective chart review was performed to identify all overweight, obese, and/or grade III ptotic patients who have undergone a 2-stage, wise-pattern skin closure with prepectoral placement of tissue expander by a single surgeon. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative descriptors were reported. Delayed wound healing, infection, seroma formation, and explantation or reoperation were recorded for each patient involved in the study.Thirty-seven obese and/or ptotic breasts among 21 patients underwent immediate prepectoral tissue expander placement with wise-pattern skin reduction closure with mean body mass index of 35.3 kg/m, and 25% of patients were diabetic The most common complication rates by breast were seroma formation (50%) and wound/dehiscence at T-point (28.6%), which all ultimately healed with intervention as described.

Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric oxygen) has not been established. Regenerative medicine approaches (eg, cell, gene therapies) for CLTI should be restricted to rigorously conducted randomizsed clinical trials. The GVG promotes standardization of study designs and end points for clinical trials in CLTI. The importance of multidisciplinary teams and centers of excellence for amputation prevention is stressed as a key health system initiative.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery and European Society for Vascular Surgery.

In the present study, we investigated the in vitro binding characteristics and in vivo analgesic effects of mirogabalin compared with those of pregabalin, a standard  ligand. Mirogabalin showed potent and selective binding affinities for the  subunits, while having no effects on 186 off-target proteins. Similar to pregabalin, mirogabalin did not show clear subtype selectivity (-1 vs. -2) or species differences (human vs. rat). However, in contrast to pregabalin, mirogabalin showed greater binding affinities for human -1, human -2, rat -1, and rat -2 subunits; further, it had a slower dissociation rate for the -1 subunit than the -2 subunit. Additionally, in experimental neuropathic pain models, partial sciatic nerve ligation rats and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, mirogabalin showed more potent and longer lasting analgesic effects. In safety pharmacological evaluations, mirogabalin and pregabalin inhibited rota-rod performance and locomotor activity in rats; however, the safety indices of mirogabalin were superior to those of pregabalin. In conclusion, mirogabalin shows potent and selective binding affinities for the human and rat  subunits, and slower dissociation rates for the -1 subunit than the -2 subunit. It shows potent and long-lasting analgesic effects in rat models of neuropathic pain, and wider safety margins for side effects of the central nervous system. These properties of mirogabalin can be associated with its unique binding characteristics.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526182>Pharmacologic Management of Type 2 : Available Therapies.</a></h2><p>Choices for the treatment of type 2  (T2DM) have multiplied as our understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic defects has evolved. Treatment should target multiple defects in T2DM and follow a patient-centered approach that considers factors beyond glycemic control, including cardiovascular risk reduction. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology and the American  Association recommend an initial approach consisting of lifestyle changes and monotherapy, preferably with metformin. Therapy choices are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, particularly effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost. Balancing management of hyperglycemia with the risk of hypoglycemia and consideration of the effects of pharmacotherapy on weight figure prominently in US-based T2DM recommendations, whereas less emphasis has been placed on the ability of specific medications to affect cardiovascular outcomes. This is likely because, until recently, specific glucose-lowering agents have not been shown to affect cardiorenal outcomes. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2  Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), the Liraglutide Effect and Action in : Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, and the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2  6 (SUSTAIN-6) recently showed a reduction in overall cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin, liraglutide, and semaglutide treatment, respectively. Moreover, empagliflozin has become the first glucose-lowering agent indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. Results from cardiovascular outcomes trials have prompted an update to the 2017 American  Association standards of care, which now recommend consideration of empagliflozin or liraglutide for patients with suboptimally controlled long-standing T2DM and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because these agents have been shown to reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality when added to standard care.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

Likewise, in pen cartridges, Ins in the clear phase of NPH(R-) was<1%, but 182±33%, 204±22% and 229±62% in the cloudy phases of Novo, Lilly and Sanofi NPH. Time needed to resuspend NPH (spent in tipping) in vials was brief with both Novo (5±1s) and Lilly NPH (6±1s), but longer with all pen cartridges (50±8s, 40± and 30±4s from Novo, Lilly and Sanofi, respectively; P=0.022). Time required for 50% separation into cloudy and clear parts of NPH was longer with Novo (60±7min) vs. Lilly (18±3min) in vials (P=0.021), and affected by temperature, but not by the different diameter sizes of the vials. With pen cartridges, separation into clear and cloudy parts was significantly faster than in vials (P<0.01).Ins in NPH preparations varies depending on their resuspension or not. Thus, subcutaneous injection of the same number of units of NPH in patients with  may deliver different amounts of insulin depending on its prior NPH resuspension.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The least follow-up time was 1 year. Medical documentations were in respect of patient's baseline characteristics, associated history, presence of comorbidities, follow-up time, and condition of wounds. Patients were divided into success group (healed or healing with wound reduction), stagnate group, and failure group (amputation or infection, need in-hospital medical service) in accordance with the treatment response of wounds. χ Test, Fisher exact test, and 1-way analysis of variance were used for variables in 3-group comparison, whereas Student t test was applied in 2-group comparison. The predictive factors with P value less than 0.1 were further investigated using the model of univariate logistic regression.With 3-group stratification according to treatment response-failure (n = 8), stagnate (n = 22), and success (n = 70)-the occurrence rate of retinopathy was higher in the treatment stagnate group (42.1%) than in the treatment failure (14.3%) and success groups (12.5%; P = 0.019); the rate of previous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) history was higher in the treatment failure group (25%) than in the treatment stagnate (4.8%) and success groups (1.5%; P = 0.020). With 2-group stratification-failure (n = 8) versus nonfailure (n = 92), and success (n = 70) versus nonsuccess (n = 30)-PTA history was strongly associated with treatment failure (odds ratio [OR], 14.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-120.32; P = 0.014), whereas retinopathy (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.65; P = 0.006) was the major negative predictor for treatment success. Previous debridement met borderline significance to predict treatment nonsuccess (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-1.01; P = 0.051). Sex, age, associated history, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease and wound condition had no statistical significance.Previous PTA and retinopathy, which indicated preexisting severe vasculopathy, are univariate predictive factors for treatment failure and nonsuccess, respectively, in patients with King classification III DFU. With the subdivision of King classification III DFU, medical history taking and fundus examination are acceptable methods for risk screening at an outpatient clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526181>EMPA-REG OUTCOME: The Cardiologist's Point of View.</a></h2><p>Cardiologists could view empagliflozin as a cardiovascular drug that also has a beneficial effect on reducing hyperglycemia in patients with type 2  (T2DM). The effects of empagliflozin in lowering the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in T2DM patients with high cardiovascular risk during the recent Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2  Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial may be explained principally in terms of changes to cardiovascular physiology; namely, by the potential ability of empagliflozin to reduce cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering blood pressure, improving aortic compliance, and improving ventricular arterial coupling. These concepts and hypotheses are discussed in this report.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patients were identified using Current Procedural Terminology code 19318 specific for reduction mammoplasty. Only patients undergoing bilateral procedures were included, and no reconstructive procedures were included. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and 30-day complications were analyzed. Comparative analysis was performed between patients younger than 60 years and patients 60 years and older, identifying risk factors associated with complications in the geriatric population.A total of 9110 patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty were identified. Of these 1442 (15.83%) were patients older than 60 years. Mean age of all patients was 42 years (range, 18-85 years). Eighty hundred fifty-nine patients were active smokers. Four hundred eighty-two patients were diabetic. Overall, 798 complications occurred with an incidence of 8.7%. Group 1 (<60 years) mean age was 39 years (range, 18-59). Group 2 (>60 years) mean age was 66 years (range, 60-85 years). The geriatric population showed a higher risk of cerebral vascular accidents (P < 0.00006), myocardial infarction (P < 0.02), and readmission (P < 0.03). Smoking was found to be a statistically significant risk factor for superficial surgical site infection, and deep space infection.  was found to be a statistically significant risk factor for readmission.Reduction mammoplasty is a common surgical procedure. It is not uncommon for patients older than 60 years to undergo elective reduction mammoplasty (15.83% incidence), resulting in a cumulative complication rate of 11.65% in the geriatric population compared with 8.89% in the group of patients younger than 60 years. Smoking and  were found to be independent risk factors for complications, regardless of age.</p></html>
