Its genome contains 177 unique O islands (OIs), which contribute largely to the high virulence and pathogenicity although most OI genes remain uncharacterized. In the current study, we demonstrated that OI-19 is required for EHEC O157:H7 adherence to host cells. Z0442 (OI-encoded virulence regulator A [OvrA]) encoded in OI-19 positively regulated bacterial adherence by activating locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) gene expression through direct OvrA binding to the gene promoter region of the LEE gene master regulator Ler. Mouse colonization experiments revealed that OvrA promotes EHEC O157:H7 adherence in mouse intestine, preferentially the colon. Finally, OvrA also regulated virulence in other non-O157 pathogenic E. coli, including EHEC strains O145:H28 and O157:H16 and enteropathogenic E. coli strain O55:H7. Our work markedly enriches the understanding of bacterial adherence control and provides another example of laterally acquired regulators that mediate LEE gene expression.© The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term functional outcomes after Ta-IPAA versus transabdominal IPAA (Abd-IPAA) in UC.A multicentre cohort analysis was done between March 2002 and September 2017. Patient characteristics, surgical details and postoperative outcomes were compared. CGQL (Cleveland global quality of life) score at 12 months with a functioning pouch was considered the primary endpoint.A total of 374 patients (100 Ta-IPAA vs 274 Abd-IPAA) were included. Ta-IPAA demonstrated a comparable overall quality of life (CGQL score) to Abd-IPAA (0.75 ± 0.11 vs 0.71 ± 0.14; respectively, p=0.1). Quality of life (7.71 ± 1.17 vs 7.30 ± 1.46; p=0.04) and energy level items (7.16 ± 1.52 vs 6.66 ± 1.68; p=0.03) were significantly better after Ta-IPAA, while the quality of health item was comparable (7.68 ± 1.26 vs 7.64 ± 1.44; p=0.96). Analysis excluding anastomotic leaks did not change the overall CGQL scores. Stool frequencies (>10/ 24 hrs:22% vs 21%; p=1.0) and the rate of single episode of major incontinence during the 12-month period (27% vs 26%; p=0.89) were similar. The differences in thirty-day morbidity rates (33% vs 41%; p=0.2) and the anastomotic leak rates were not significant (6% vs 13%; p=0.09).This study provides evidence of comparable long-term functional outcome and quality of life after Ta-IPAA and Abd-IPAA for UC.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

We investigated IL-33-mediated colonic homeostasis using a mechanistic method. Il33 mice were more tolerant to dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute  than the wild type and also showed delayed recovery from  with recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) administration. Unexpectedly, microarray analysis identified significant downregulation of the Abcg5/8 genes in mouse colons following rIL-33 treatment. ABCG5/8 are known cholesterol transporters in the small intestine and liver, though their colon activities have not been elucidated, thus their role in IL-33-mediated inflammation was investigated. In vitro, toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation upregulated ABCG5/8 mRNA expression in Caco2 and HCT-15 cells, with subsequent downregulation by rIL-33, while inhibition of ABCG5/8 along with their siRNA increased TLR-stimulated IL-8 production. Together, these results indicated that colonic ABCG5/8 play a regulatory role in TLR-induced inflammation, while histological inflammation in human UC was correlated positively with the level of mucosal IL-33 and inversely with that of colonic ABCG5/8. This is the first report of IL-33-mediated downregulation of colonic ABCG5/8 in a  recovery phase, indicating their involvement in UC pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental .</a></h2><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced .  was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after  induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental  even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645725>Structural basis of species-selective antagonist binding to the succinate receptor.</a></h2><p>The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate is involved in metabolic processes and plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative , liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.</a></h2><p>IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) is a chronic, non-specific, inflammatory gastrointestinal disease that mainly consists of Crohn's disease and ulcerative . However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are still unclear. B10 (IL-10 producing regulatory B) cells, a subset of regulatory B cells, are known to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the aberrant frequency of B10 cells is associated with IBD. We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced IBD model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease  severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production by ManLAM-treated B cells contributes to keeping the balance between CD4 T cell subsets and protect mice from DSS-induced IBD.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656567>Recent advances in monoclonal antibody therapy in IBD: practical issues.</a></h2><p>The advent of monoclonal antibody therapies has revolutionised inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment and delivered great benefits to patients. The optimal use of this class of drugs requires careful management and a clear understanding of their properties. In this review article, we consider how to maximise the benefit of our most novel biological agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. For each agent, we consider practical aspects including dose flexibility, evidence for use in combination with a conventional immunomodulator and the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring. We also address positioning of the various mechanisms and agents in treatment algorithms as well as important aspects of managing patients receiving monoclonal antibodies, such as disease reassessment. Finally, we look ahead to the future of monoclonal antibodies, where not only have biosimilars increased the number of agents available but there are also a range of novel mechanisms currently in late phase clinical trials.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We here characterized its anti-inflammatory mechanism in UC.Luminal cobitolimod administration was evaluated in an experimental DSS-induced  model. Cultured blood and mucosal cells from UC patients were treated with cobitolimod and analyzed via microarray, qRT-PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry. Intestinal slides of cobitolimod treated UC patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.Cobitolimod administration markedly suppressed experimental  activity and microarrays analyses demonstrated mucosal IL10 upregulation and suppression of IL17 signaling pathways. Cobitolimod treatment was associated with significant induction of mucosal IL10+ Tr1 and Treg cells and suppression of Th17 cells. TLR9 knockout mice indicated that cobitolimod requires TLR9 signaling for IL10 induction. In UC patients, mucosal TLR9 levels correlated with severity of inflammation. Cobitolimod inhibited IL17A and IL17F, but increased IL10 and FoxP3 expression in cultured intestinal UC T cells. Cobitolimod-mediated suppression of intestinal IL17+ T cells was abrogated by IL10 blockade. Furthermore, cobitolimod led to heightened IL10 production by wound healing macrophages. Immunohistochemistry in intestinal biopsies of cobitolimod treated UC patients indicated increased presence of IL10+ mononuclear and regulatory T cells, as well as reduction of IL17+ cells.Our studies suggest that activation of TLR9 via cobitolimod might represent a novel therapeutic approach in UC, as it suppresses Th17 cells and induces anti-inflammatory IL10+ macrophages and regulatory T cells, thereby modifying the dysregulated intestinal cytokine balance.© European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673718>Stereotactic body radiotherapy for ventricular tachycardia (cardiac radiosurgery) : First-in-patient treatment in Germany.</a></h2><p>Single-session cardiac stereotactic body radiotherapy, called cardiac radiosurgery (CRS) or radioablation (RA), may offer a potential treatment option for patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm who are otherwise ineligible for catheter ablation. However, there is only limited clinical experience. We now present the first-in-patient treatment using (CRS/RA) for VT in Germany.A 78-year-old male patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and significantly reduced ejection fraction (15%) presented with monomorphic VT refractory to poly-anti-arrhythmic medication and causing multiple implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions over the course of several weeks, necessitating prolonged treatment on an intensive care unit. Ultra-high-resolution electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) revealed a re-entry circuit in the cardiac septum inaccessible for catheter ablation. Based on the EVM, CRS/RA with a single session dose of 25 Gy (83% isodose) was delivered to the VT substrate (8.1 cc) using a c-arm-based high-precision linear accelerator on November 30, 2018.CRS/RA was performed without incident and dysfunction of the ICD was not observed. Following the procedure, a significant reduction in monomorphic VT from 5.0 to 1.6 episodes per week and of ICD shock interventions by 81.2% was observed. Besides periprocedural nausea with a single episode of vomiting, no treatment-associated side effects were noted. Unfortunately, the patient died 57 days after CRS/RA due to sepsis-associated cardiac circulatory failure after Clostridium difficile-associated  developed during rehabilitation. Histopathologic examination of the heart as part of a clinical autopsy revealed diffuse fibrosis on most sections of the heart without apparent differences between the target area and the posterior cardiac wall serving as a control.CRS/RA appears to be a possible treatment option for otherwise untreatable patients suffering from refractory VT and electrical storm. A relevant reduction in VT incidence and ICD interventions was observed, although long-term outcome and consequences of CRS/RA remain unclear. Clinical trials are strongly warranted and have been initiated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644188>Vancomycin.</a></h2><p>Vancomycin (van" koe mye' sin) is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Streptococcus orientalis with primary activity against gram positive bacteria. Vancomycin has a large, complex and unusual structure and is believed to act by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis via binding to the cell wall precursor molecules. Vancomycin is active against, and its major use is in therapy of, infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), including antibiotic-induced pseudomembranous , staphylococcal enterocolitis, bacterial endocarditis, and sepsis. For systemic infections, vancomycin is given intravenously. For localized or nonsystemic infections, other routes of administration are used, including oral, rectal, topical, inhalational, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, and intraventricular. The recommended parenteral dosage in adults is 500 mg iv every 6 hours or 1000 mg every 12 hours, with modification to achieve a therapeutic range as needed. The recommended oral dosage in the treatment of antibiotic induced pseudomembranous enterocolitis is 125 to 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days. Vancomycin is available generically and under several commercial names including Vancoled, Vancor, Lyphocin, and Vancocin in 125 and 250 mg pulvules and as power for injection or oral administration. Vancomycin was first approved for use in the United States in 1958 and it continues to be widely used, particularly with the recent rise in incidence of serious MRSA infections. Vancomycin is largely well tolerated; common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, nephrotoxicity and neutropenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644942>Healing effects of Cornus mas L. in experimentally induced ulcerative  in rats: From ethnobotany to pharmacology.</a></h2><p>The ethnobotanical studies conducted in Turkey and other countries have revealed that Cornus mas L., from the family Cornaceae have been used against stomachache, diarrhea and .The objective the present study is to determine the possible activity of C. mas in experimentally induced ulcerative  in rats and to identify its phytochemical feature.2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced  model was induced in rats. The rats were orally treated with different doses (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of C. mas 80% methanol extract for 14 days. Increase in body weight, consumed amount of feed, form of the stool, presence of rectal prolapse were followed every day. At the end of the experiment, colon tissues were removed and wet weights for each animal were measured and colon damages were scored. Total antioxidant and total oxidant status, cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) and protein levels of colon tissues were evaluated and histopathological analyses were carried out. After the detection of the effective dose as 400 mg/kg, the aqueous methanol extract was fractionated by using liquid-liquid fractionation technique and the sub-extracts were also tested for in vivo biological activities. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analyses were conducted to determine the phytochemical profile of the active crude extract and n-butanol sub-extract.Amount of feed consumed per day and increase in body weight were the lowest in the control group, while those values were determined to be the highest in 80% methanol extract (at 400 mg/kg dose), n-butanol sub-extract and reference groups. Following  induction, it was determined that the fecal form was yellow-slippery in all groups and returned to normal after the treatment with C. mas extracts. Rectal prolapse score was less in the extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract treated groups. Total antioxidant, total oxidant status, cytokine and protein levels were found to be in parallel with macroscopic findings. 80% methanol extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract provided the best healing according to the wet weight measurements and colon damage scoring performed on the removed colon tissues. These findings supported the results of histopathological analysis. According to the chromatographic analysis, ellagic acid was determined in both extracts and its amount was quantified.The present study has verified the ethnomedical use of C. mas for the treatment of ulcerative .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates  induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic  scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating . This article is protected by copyright.

However, the action mechanisms of sword bean have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, the whole parts of a ripened sword bean (RSB) and the green sword bean (GSB) containing bean pod were extracted with ethanol by reflux extraction. The two crude extracts (RSBE and GSBE) from RSB and GSB were validated by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of gallic acid as a reference chemical. The anti-inflammatory effects of two sword bean extracts were extensively investigated using LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. First, RSBE and GSBE significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandinE (PGE), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RSBE and GSBE showed no cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. In addition, the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased by RSBE and GSBE. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis showed that RSBE and GSBE inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-B subunits, which correlated with the inhibitory effects on inhibitor kappa B (IB) degradation. In dextran sulfated sodium (DSS)-induced  mice model, RSBE restored body weight, colon length, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-6, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon- (IFN-).

There are limited data available regarding CDI in hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease-related ileal pouch.This study aimed to evaluate the demographics, clinical features, risk factors, and admission outcomes among hospitalized patients with CDI-related pouchitis (CDP).Retrospective chart review was performed for patients who were admitted to our institute for pouchitis between 2013 and 2016 to identify patients with CDP. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors associated with CDP.A total of 160 subjects with pouchitis had a total of 218 admissions during the study period. Primary admission diagnosis was pouchitis or inflammatory bowel disease flare-up for 202 (93%) admissions. Clostridium difficile was tested at least once for 72 patients, and the diagnosis of CDP was established for 16 (10%) patients. All patients with CDP were symptomatic, 13 (81%) had diarrhea, 8 (50%) had abdominal pain, 7 (44%) had nausea/vomiting, and 2 (13%) had gastrointestinal bleeding. On multivariable analysis, only body mass index > 25 (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06-0.94, p = 0.048) was significantly associated with decreased risk of CDP.

Primary symptoms of UC are well known, yet similarities and differences of disease experience in adults and adolescents are not well characterized.To understand the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptomatic experience of UC, in-depth interviews were conducted in the US with 21 adults (20-70 years) and 14 adolescents (12-17 years). Eligibility and medical history were confirmed by clinician report. A previously conducted literature review and resultant conceptual model informed the discussion guide to explore symptoms and HRQoL. Age appropriate creative tasks ("animal" task and collage) were employed to facilitate discussion. Transcripts and collages were subjected to thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti software.Clinician-reported UC severity included 24% mild, 38% moderate, 38% severe among adults; and 64% mild, 29% moderate, 7% severe among adolescents. Among adults, 52% were female, 67% were white. Among adolescents, 50% were female, 71% were white. During analysis it was noted that all participants reported stomach/abdominal pain. Other key symptoms identified were frequent bowel movements, diarrhea, blood in stools, sudden need for bowel movement, stomach cramping, bloating, and feeling gassy/passing gas (≥75% of participants). Key impacts identified were embarrassment, dietary limitations, having to plan around UC, worry/fear, anger, low mood/depression, and relationship with others, (≥75% of participants). In creative tasks, animals were chosen to represent their UC and content included in the collages reflected the most commonly discussed themes from the interviews.

In recent years, the immunomodulating effects of vitamin D have gained a huge interest in its possible pathogenic influence on the pathophysiology of IBD. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent among patients with IBD. Several clinical studies have pointed to a critical role for vitamin D in ameliorating disease outcomes. Although causation versus correlation unfortunately remains an overwhelming issue in the illusive chicken versus egg debate regarding vitamin D and IBD, here we summarise the latest knowledge of the immunological effects of vitamin D in IBD and recommend from available evidence that physicians regularly monitor serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with IBD. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for optimising vitamin D status in patients with IBD in clinical practice. Awaiting well-powered controlled clinical trials, we consider vitamin D supplementation to be an affordable and widely accessible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate IBD clinical outcomes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) are molecular oxygen sensors that control adaptive gene expression through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Emerging evidence supports PHDs as being therapeutic targets in intestinal inflammation. However, pharmacological inhibition of PHDs has not been validated as a treatment strategy in pouchitis.PHD1-3 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed in mucosal pouch and prepouch ileal patient biopsies. After establishment of a preclinical IPAA model in rats, the impact of the pan-PHD small-molecule inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced pouchitis was studied. Clinical and molecular parameters were investigated.PHD1, but not PHD2 or PHD3, was overexpressed in pouchitis in biopsies of patients with IPAA for UC but not FAP. In addition, PHD1 expression correlated with disease activity. DMOG treatment profoundly mitigated DSS-induced pouchitis in a rodent IPAA model. Mechanistically, DMOG restored intestinal epithelial barrier function by induction of tight junction proteins zona occludens-1 and claudin-1 and alleviation of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, thus attenuating pouch inflammation.Together, these results establish a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting PHD1 with small-molecule inhibitors in pouchitis after IPAA for UC.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Over the same time, patients receiving government drug benefits received infliximab or adalimumab at a combined rate of 2.2% in 2003 which increased to 18.8% of eligible patients by 2014.Rates of hospitalisations, ED visits and in-patient surgeries markedly declined in Ontario over the study period, while rates of biologic medication use increased markedly for those receiving public drug benefits.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656564>Microscopic : diagnosis and management.</a></h2><p>Microscopic  (MC) is a common cause of chronic, non-bloody, watery diarrhoea in older patients. The diagnosis depends on characteristic histological findings. Bile acid malabsorption and autoimmune conditions, including coeliac disease, are more frequently found in patients with MC, but colorectal neoplasia and mortality are not increased. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton-pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and smoking tobacco confer an increased risk of developing MC.

NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0.5 h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner. These experiments suggest that NX-13 is safe and well-tolerated in rats given oral doses as high as 1000 mg/kg with a favorable gastrointestinal localized pharmacokinetic profile, confirming NX-13 as a promising therapeutic for Crohn's disease and ulcerative .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630178>Persistent colonization of non-lymphoid tissue-resident macrophages by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has revealed that lymphoid-tissue-resident commensal bacteria (e.g., Alcaligenes spp.) survive within dendritic cells. We extended our previous study by investigating microbes that persistently colonize colonic macrophages. 16S rRNA-based metagenome analysis using DNA purified from murine colonic macrophages revealed the presence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The in situ intracellular colonization by S. maltophilia was recapitulated in vitro by using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Co-culture of BMDMs with clinically isolated S. maltophilia led to increased mitochondrial respiration and robust IL-10 production. We further identified a 25-kDa protein encoded by the gene assigned as smlt2713 (recently renamed as SMLT_RS12935) and secreted by S. maltophilia as the factor responsible for enhanced IL-10 production by BMDMs. IL-10 production is critical for maintenance of the symbiotic condition, because intracellular colonization by S. maltophilia was impaired in IL-10-deficient BMDMs, and smlt2713-deficient S. maltophilia failed to persistently colonize IL-10-competent BMDMs. These findings indicate a novel commensal network between colonic macrophages and S. maltophilia that is mediated by IL-10 and smlt2713.© The Author(s) 2019.

The global incidence of IBD is increasing, and more patients are exploring diet as a means to explain and treat their IBD. In fact, many patients strongly believe diet plays a fundamental role in the onset and management of their IBD. However, a significant proportion of patients report limited nutritional education from their provider, and providers report limited nutritional resources to aid in discussions with patients. This imbalance between supply and demand likely reflects the previous paucity of available literature characterizing the influence of diet in IBD. To address this gap in knowledge, we review the available literature to characterize the role of diet in the pathogenesis, exacerbation, and treatment of IBD. We aim to provide patients and providers with resources to better understand and discuss the role of diet in IBD, with the overall goal of improving patient care and satisfaction.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) have been proposed as alternative, noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for IBD. The current study aimed to assess and compare the potential of fecal and urinary VOC as diagnostic biomarkers for pediatric IBD in an intention-to-diagnose cohort. In this cohort study, patients aged 4-17 years, referred to the outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral center under suspicion of IBD, were eligible to participate. The diagnosis was established by endoscopic and histopathologic assessment, participants who did not meet the criteria of IBD were allocated to the control group. Participants were instructed to concurrently collect a fecal and urinary sample prior to bowel lavage. Samples were analyzed by means of gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry. In total, five ulcerative  patients, five Crohn's disease patients, and ten age and gender matched controls were included. A significant difference was demonstrated for both fecal (-value, area under the curve; 0.038, 0.73) and urinary (0.028, 0.78) VOC profiles between IBD and controls.

In this study, we evaluated the frequency of PNI in -associated cancer (CAC) and sporadic cancer.We retrospectively reviewed 778 colorectal cancers with pathological T3-T4 in 761 patients all of whom were surgically resected without preoperative treatment. The lesions were classified into either CAC or sporadic cancer based on the clinical information. Clinicopathological findings including PNI were compared between CACs and sporadic cancers. Moreover, we analyzed the risk factors for positive PNI by multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model.Ten of the cancers (1.3%) were diagnosed as CACs, and the remaining 768 as sporadic cancers. CACs were characterized by being nonobstructive and predominantly located in the rectum. The CACs had a larger size and more frequent undifferentiated histology than sporadic cancers. PNI was observed more frequently in CACs (90%) than in sporadic cancers without obstruction (45%, P = .007).

Diagnostic criteria of AIBD included positive direct immunofluorescence studies and/or positive serology with clinically suggestive features.A total of 22 cases of AIBDs provoked by the use of BAs were found. The most commonly implicated agents were tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (n = 14). The mean age of onset of AIBD was 59.4 years (median 61.5 years, range 31-82). Average time to onset of AIBD following initiation of the suspected BA was 33.7 ± 43.8 weeks (range 3 days to 152 weeks). Psoriasis was the most common associated condition for which the BA was prescribed (n = 11), followed by rheumatoid arthritis (n = 6) and ulcerative  (n = 5). Of the 21 cases reporting AIBD outcome, 17 reported remission or complete resolution upon stopping treatment with the involved BA. Four cases reported continued bullae formation without worsening of disease following cessation of the BA or systemic corticosteroids used to treat the AIBD. Five cases rechallenged the patient with the involved BA and four of the five reported recurrence, often with quicker onset and more severe symptoms.BAs may be suspected in patients developing AIBD while being treated for chronic inflammatory diseases.

Interleukin (IL)-33 is involved in various immune responses, with reported proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which may be associated with  and -associated cancer. IL-33 induces the inflammatory cascade through its receptor, suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (ST-2). Binding of IL-33 to membrane-bound ST-2 (mST-2) recruits the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and activates intracellular signaling pathways. However, whether IL-33/ST-2 is triggered by  infection and whether this interaction occurs in lipid rafts remain unclear. Our study showed that both IL-33 and ST-2 expression levels were significantly elevated in -infected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that ST-2 mobilized into the membrane lipid rafts during infection. Depletion of membrane cholesterol dampened -induced IL-33 and IL-8 production. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed IL-33/ST-2 upregulation, and severe leukocyte infiltration was observed in gastric tissues infected with .

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of many cytoprotective genes, plays a protective role in carcinogenesis. Recent studies have identified a specific gene-expression signature regulated by the Nrf2 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma and head-and-neck squamous cell cancer. However, the roles of Nrf2 in the development of -associated colorectal cancer (CACC) have not been well characterized. Nrf2 target genes as prognostic biomarkers in CACC remain to be explored. Thus, this work aimed to identify the molecular changes that occur during mouse CACC progression to facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.The CACC model was established using azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in BALB/c mice for 3 weeks to induce -associated adenoma (CAA, early stage) and for 9 weeks to induce -associated carcinoma (CAC, late stage). Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses we examined the mRNA expression profiles of 6 groups: wild-type control (WT-C), WT-CAA, WT-CAC, Nrf2 knockout control (Nrf2KO-C), Nrf2KO-CAA, and Nrf2KO-CAC.In the AOM/DSS model of -associated tumorigenesis, Nrf2 mice showed a phenotype similar to WT mice, but with significantly more tumors and a much higher percentage of adenocarcinomas. We identified 47 novel Nrf2 genes via gene expression profiling of tumor samples. Survival analysis showed that 23 of these genes were biomarkers of a poor prognosis in colon cancer patients.Nrf2 target genes deserve exploration as prognostic and therapeutic targets for CRC.Copyright © 2019.

These cases were mostly included in larger cohorts of PI patients without extractable data on presentation or outcomes in the IBD subpopulation.Ours appears to be the first reporting of presentations and outcomes, outside of case reports, for those with PI and IBD. The high mortality for those with CD and PI of the small bowel appears to define a group requiring more than supportive medical care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626694>MicroRNA23a Overexpression in Crohn's Disease Targets Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibitor Protein 3, Increasing Sensitivity to TNF and Modifying the Epithelial Barrier.</a></h2><p>Mucosal healing is important in Crohn's disease therapies. Epithelial homeostasis becomes dysregulated in Crohn's, with increased permeability, inflammation, and diarrhoea. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and show changes in inflammatory bowel disease. Tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] inhibitor protein 3 is raised in Crohn's and regulates TNFα-mediated activation of NFκB. We investigated TNFα regulation by microRNA in Crohn's disease [CD], and studied effects on epithelial permeability and inflammation.Colonic epithelium from CD and healthy donor biopsies was isolated using laser capture microdissection, and microRNA was quantified. Tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor protein 3 was characterised immunohistochemically on serial sections. Expression effect of microRNA was confirmed with luciferase reporter assays. Functional barrier permeability studies and innate cytokine release were investigated with cell and explant culture studies.MicroRNA23a levels significantly increased in colonic Crohn's epithelium compared with healthy epithelium. Luciferase reporter assays in transfected epithelial cells confirmed that microRNA23a repressed expression via the 3' untranslated region of tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor protein 3 mRNA, coinciding with increased NFκB-mediated transcription. Immunohistochemical staining of TNFAIP3 protein in colonic biopsies was reduced or absent in adjacent Crohn's sections, correlating inversely with microRNA23a levels and encompassing some intercohort variation. Overexpression of microRNA23a increased epithelial barrier permeability in a colonic epithelial model and increased inflammatory cytokine release in cultured explant biopsies, mimicking Crohn's disease characteristics.MicroRNA23a overexpression in colonic Crohn's epithelium represses tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor protein 3, enhancing sensitivity to TNFα, with increased intestinal permeability and cytokine release.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Information about disease control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by disease activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and 5% for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe disease activity compared to patients with mild or no disease activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/2.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed IBD treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and 5-ASA compounds (77.5%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe IBD activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of IBD surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

Phyto-ingredients have been evaluated for their ability to protect against IBD because of their anti-inflammatory activities. In our previous study, we identified a novel derivative of chrysin (HE-chrysin) using irradiation technology, which exhibited stronger anti-cancer activity in human colorectal cancer cells than the original chrysin. Here, to determine whether HE-chrysin is a new therapeutic candidate for IBD, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of HE-chrysin on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and dextran sodium salt (DSS)-induced  in mice. HE-chrysin more effectively inhibited BMDC maturation compared to chrysin, as demonstrated by the decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, surface molecules, antigen-presenting ability, and T cell proliferation/activation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMDCs. These anti-inflammatory effects of HE-chrysin were regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, oral administration of HE-chrysin attenuated DSS-induced  symptoms and clinical signs in the mouse model. The protective effects of HE-chrysin treatment against  were mediated by decreasing Th1- and Th17-type cytokine levels. These results indicate that HE-chrysin is attractive candidate for IBD therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for  remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of  colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Ral regulates tumorigenesis and invasion/metastasis of some cancers; however, the role of Ral in -associated cancer (CAC) has not been investigated. We aimed to elucidate the role of Ral in the mechanism of CAC.We used wild-type (WT) mice and RalGAPα2 knockout (KO) mice that exhibited Ral activation, and bone marrow chimeric mice were generated as follows; WT to WT, WT to RalGAPα2 KO, RalGAPα2 KO to WT, and RalGAPα2 KO to RalGAPα2 KO mice. CAC was induced in these mice by intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane followed by dextran sulfate sodium intake. Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from colon tissues, and we performed cDNA microarray analysis. Cytokine expression in normal colon tissues and CAC was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Bone marrow chimeric mice showed that immune cell function between WT mice and RalGAPα2 KO mice was not significantly different in CAC mechanism. RalGAPα2 KO mice had a significantly larger tumor number and size and a significantly higher proportion of tumors invading the submucosa than WT mice. Higher expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-13 were observed in RalGAPα2 KO mice than in WT mice. The expression levels of IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 were apparently elevated in the tumors of RalGAPα2 KO mice compared to WT mice. NLRP3 inhibitor reduced the number of invasive tumors.Ral activation participates in the mechanism of CAC development via NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Taking advantage of this possibility, TuMV virus-like particles (VLPs) have been genetically derivatized with a peptide from the chaperonin Hsp60, a protein described to be involved in inflammation processes and autoimmune diseases. Antibodies against the peptide have been previously shown to have a diagnostic value in at least one autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. The functionalized Hsp60-VLPs showed their significant increase in sensing potency when compared to monoclonal antibody detection of the peptide in a conventional immunoassay. Additionally, the developed Hsp60-VLPs allowed the detection of autoantibodies against the Hsp60 peptide in an in vivo mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced . The detection of minute amounts of the autoantibodies allowed us to perform the analysis of their evolution during the progression of the disease. The anti-Hsp60 autoantibody levels in the sera of the inflamed mice went down during the induction phase of the disease. Increased levels of the anti-HSP60 autoantibodies were detected during the resolution phase of the disease. An extension of a previously proposed model for the involvement of Hsp60 in inflammatory processes is considered, incorporating a role for Hsp60 autoantibodies. This, and related models, can now be experimentally tested thanks to the autoantibody detection hypersensitivity provided by the functionalized VLPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634872>Cannabidiol As A Novel Therapeutic Strategy For Oral Inflammatory Diseases: A Review Of Current Knowledge And Future Perspectives.</a></h2><p>The high frequency and painful profile of inflammatory oral lesions and the lack of an effective drug protocol for their management stimulate the search for pharmacological alternatives for the treatment of these conditions. Cannabidiol is the major non-psychotropic constituent of Cannabis sativa, receiving lately scientific interest because of its potential in the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as asthma,  and arthritis. There is little published in the current literature about the use of cannabidiol in oral health. Among its many protective functions, the ability to attenuate inflammation through the modulation of cytokines and its antiedema and analgesic effects may be important features in the treatment of oral lesions.

However, data on the natural history of perianal fistulizing CD (pfCD) in this population are scarce. In a population-based cohort study, we described the prevalence, natural history and treatment of pfCD in patients with elderly-onset CD vs. patients with pediatric-onset CD.All patients diagnosed with CD at or after the age of 60 between 1988 and 2006 were included (n=372). Logistic regression, Cox models, and a nested case-control method were used to identify factors associated with pfCD.Thirty-four elderly patients (9%) had pfCD at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 6 years [IQR: 3-10], 59 patients (16%) had pfCD; the same prevalence (16%) was observed in pediatric-onset patients. At last follow-up, anal incontinence was more frequent in elderly patients with pfCD than in elderly patients without pfCD (22% vs. 4%, respectively; p<10-4). Rectal CD at diagnosis was associated with pfCD (hazard ratio [95% CI]=2.8 [1.6-5.0]). Although 37% of the patients received immunosuppressants and 17% received anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, 24% (14 out of 59) had a definitive stoma at last follow-up.During the first 6 years of disease, the prevalence of pfCD was similar in elderly and pediatric patients. Rectal involvement was associated with the appearance of pfCD in elderly-onset patients. Around a quarter of patients with elderly-onset CD will have a stoma. Our results suggest that treatment with biologics should be evaluated in these patients.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627210>Characterizing Clinical Features and Creating a Gene Expression Profile Associated With Pain Burden in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>There is often dissociation between inflammatory activity and abdominal pain in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting other factors may play a role in the pain experience.Patients (8 to 17 years) newly diagnosed with IBD were enrolled in the ALLAY Study: Assessing Risk Factors for Abdominal Pain in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (). At diagnostic colonoscopy, 3 rectal biopsies were collected, and gene expression analysis was performed using Qiagen RT2 Profiler Neuropathic and Inflammatory Pain PCR Array. Relative fold difference in gene expression for 84 pain-associated genes was calculated using the 2-ΔΔ Cq method compared with pain-free controls. Factors affecting pain burden (Pain Burden Interview; PBI) were analyzed, including age, sex, rectal inflammation, and gene expression. Data were analyzed using multiple stepwise linear regression and 2-tailed t tests (P ≤ 0.05).Thirty-nine newly diagnosed IBD patients were included (65% male, mean age 12.75 years [SD 2.63], 23 Crohn's disease, 16 ulcerative ), along with 3 controls. Mean PBI score was 7.73 (SD 6.4, range 0 to 23) for all patients. Age and sex were not predictive of pain burden, but disease activity score was (P = 0.03). Expression of TRPV3, OPRM1, P2X3, SCN9A, PTGS2, and MAPK14 were associated with PBI score. Subsequent 2-tailed t tests comparing patients with no pain (PBI score ≦ 2, N = 11) to those with pain (PBI > 2, N = 28) confirmed differential expression of TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 was in patients with pain (all P < 0.05).Pain burden in newly diagnosed IBD patients may be linked to TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 expression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for managing pain in IBD.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s &  Foundation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666502>Gadd45β promotes regeneration after injury through TGFβ-dependent restitution in experimental .</a></h2><p>Dysregulated immune responses and impaired function in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45β) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory symptoms. However, the role of Gadd45β in IBD is completely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Gadd45β in IBD. Gadd45β-KO mice exhibited drastically greater susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  and mortality than C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution.

Most QoC projects or consensus statements are designed from the health care professional point of view. Having QoC indicators designed for and fully evaluable by patients may provide a key tool for external evaluation of QoC improvement measures. The aim of the IQCARO project was to identify indicators to measure QoC from the IBD patient's point of view.An extensive review of the literature to identify indicators of QoC was performed; first the identified indicators were reviewed by a steering committee including patients, nurses, IBD specialists, and methodologists. Then 2 focus groups of IBD patients analyzed the QoC indicators to determine whether they could be understood and evaluated by patients. The final QoC indicators were selected by a group of IBD patients using a Delphi consensus methodology.An initial list of 54 QoC indicators was selected by the steering committee. The QoC indicators were evaluated by 16 patients who participated in 2 focus groups. They identified 21 indicators that fulfilled the understandability and evaluability requirements. The 10 most relevant QoC indicators were selected by 26 patients with IBD using a Delphi consensus. The selected items covered important aspects of QoC, including professionalism, patients' autonomy, information, accessibility, and continuity of care.The present Delphi consensus identified QoC indicators that are useful for developing and measuring improvement strategies in the management of IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

We hypothesized that mRNA profiles could (1) identify genes and pathways involved in disease pathogenesis; (2) identify a molecular signature that differentiates IBD from other conditions; (3) provide insight into systemic and colon-specific dysregulation through study of the concordance of the gene expression.Children (8-18 years) were prospectively recruited at the time of diagnostic colonoscopy for possible IBD. We used transcriptome-wide mRNA profiling to study gene expression in colon biopsies and paired whole blood samples. Using blood mRNA measurements, we fit a regression model for disease state prediction that was validated in an independent test set of adult subjects (GSE3365).Ninety-eight children were recruited [39 Crohn's disease, 18 ulcerative , 2 IBDU, 39 non-IBD]. There were 1,118 significantly differentially (IBD vs non-IBD) expressed genes in colon tissue, and 880 in blood. The direction of relative change in expression was concordant for 106/112 genes differentially expressed in both tissue types. The regression model from the blood mRNA measurements distinguished IBD vs non-IBD disease status in the independent test set with 80% accuracy using only 6 genes. The overlap of 5 immune and metabolic pathways in the two tissue types was significant (p<0.001).Blood and colon tissue from patients with IBD share a common transcriptional profile dominated by immune and metabolic pathways. Our results suggest that peripheral blood expression levels of as few as 6 genes (IL7R, UBB, TXNIP, S100A8, ALAS2, and SLC2A3) may distinguish patients with IBD from non-IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634419>Healthy Eating Index-2015 as a Predictor of Ulcerative  Risk in a Case-Control Cohort.</a></h2><p>There is substantial compelling clinical evidence implicating certain dietary components in the development and clinical course of progression in ulcerative  (UC).

However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients.To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist's interview on IBD patients' acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®.After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients' association (Association François Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars.93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02-0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01-1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07-2.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient's opinion on biosimilars.This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient's acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the risk of new onset IBD in patients with COPD and new onset COPD in IBD patients.We performed a systematic review of observational studies exploring the risk of both associations. Two independent reviewers explored the EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS and DOAJ databases, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBBINS-I tool. Data from included studies was pooled in a random effect meta-analysis following a DerSimonian-Laird method. The quality of the evidence was ranked using GRADE criteria.Four studies including a pooled population of 1355 new cases were included. We found association between new onset IBD in COPD population. The risk of bias was low in most of them. Only one study reported tobacco exposure as a potential confounding factor. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for a new diagnosis of IBD in COPD patients was 2.02 (CI, 1.56 to 2.63), I = 72% (GRADE: low). The subgroup analyses for Crohn's disease and ulcerative  yielded RRs of 2.29 (CI, 1.51 to 3.48; I = 62%), and 1.79 (CI, 1.39 to 2.29; I = 19%.), respectively.According to our findings, the risk of new onset IBD was higher in populations with COPD compared to the general population without this condition. Based on our analysis, we suggest a potential association between IBD and COPD; however, further research exploring the potential effect of confounding variables, especially cigarette smoking, is still needed.

In advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, there have been few reports about the correlation between irAEs and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30.5 days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.5). The median progression-free survival was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.5) in the irAE group and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.11, p < 0.001). The median overall survival was 16.8 months (95% CI, 4.4 to not reached) in the irAE group and 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.1) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.17, p < 0.001).

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in IBD. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative  (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650411>Increased risk of herpes zoster infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study is to better characterize this possible association by conducting a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of relevant literature until April 30, 2019, was performed. Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with IBD and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative  (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.88). Steroid users and anti-TNFα users were at increased risk of HZ in UC, with RRs of 1.99 (95% CI 1.64-2.42) and 2.29 (95% CI 1.52-3.45), respectively. Begg's test and Egger's test suggested no publication bias. There was a 74% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with CD and 40% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with UC compared with that in non-IBD. IBD patients with high risk of HZ infection may benefit from an HZ vaccine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619213>Novel genetic variant of HPS1 gene in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome with fulminant progression of pulmonary fibrosis: a case report.</a></h2><p>Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is associated with oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, granulomatous , and highly penetrant pulmonary fibrosis in some subtypes. Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathological variants in HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, and several other genes lead to clinical manifestation of the disease.A 57-year-old female was admitted with congenital oculocutaneous albinism, thrombocytopathy and late-onset accelerated pulmonary fibrosis (first symptoms from age 50 onwards). Chest high-resolution computed tomography identified thickening of peribronchovascular interstitium, bronchiectasis, reticulations, honeycombing, ground glass opacities and lung parenchyma consolidations. HPS was clinically suspected. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES), a form of massive parallel sequencing, of proband-parents trio. Whole exome libraries were processed using KAPA Hyper Prep Kit, SeqCap EZ MedExome Enrichment Kit and HyperCap Bead Kit according to the SeqCap EZ HyperCap Workflow. The paired-end 2 × 75 bp sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 Sequencer (Illumina Inc., USA). Furthermore, obtained variants by WES were evaluated using a virtual panel of genes: HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, DTNBP1, BLOC1S3, and PLDN. We identified a compound heterozygous genotype in HPS1 gene in the proband. We identified a pathogenic frameshift variant c.1189delC; p.(Gln397Serfs*2), resulting in a premature stop codon. This variant has been previously associated with HPS. Furthermore, we characterized previously undescribed nonsense variant c.1507C > T; p.(Gln503*), resulting in a premature stop codon and mRNA degradation through nonsense-mediated decay. Sanger sequencing validated the presence of both variants and simultaneously confirmed the heterozygous carrier status of parents. Unfortunately, the patient died due to fulminant progression of pulmonary fibrosis 2 months after diagnostics.Compound heterozygous mutations in HPS1 in the proband lead to disruption of HPS1 gene and clinical manifestation of HPS with severe pulmonary fibrosis. This case illustrates the need to consider HPS in differential diagnostics of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a common cause of death in HPS patients. Earlier diagnosis may enable better treatment for these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648921>Are we choosing wisely for inflammatory bowel disease care? The IG-IBD choosing wisely campaign.</a></h2><p>The "Choosing Wisely" campaigns have the aim of promoting a better clinician-patient relationship.The Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD) conducted a choosing wisely campaign for IBD.Ten IG-IBD panellists conducted the campaign through a modified Delphi process. All IG-IBD members were asked to submit five statements starting with "Do not…" addressing any IBD-related procedure or treatment the necessity of which should be questioned. All recommendations were evaluated by the panellists who prioritised each item. The top ten recommendations were prioritised again by IG-IBD members, and the top five recommendations were identified.110 members (mean age 42 ± 12; 62 males) participated in the campaign. The top five recommendations were as follow: 1. Do not use corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, or without a clear indication; 2. Do not forget venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalised patients with active disease; 3. Do not treat perianal Crohn's disease with biologics without prior surgical evaluation; 4. Do not discontinue IBD-related medications during pregnancy unless specifically indicated; 5. Do not delay surgery.The IG-IBD promoted a campaign with a bottom-up approach, identifying five recommendations that could be useful for providing a better IBD care, especially among non-IBD experts.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Forty patients were randomized in two study arms, in which bowel purgation was performed either before or after PET-MR enterography. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsies after PET-MR within 24 h. Diagnostic performance of MR morphological parameters (MRmorph), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET in detecting histological inflammation determined by the Nancy index was compared with each other and between study arms. Correlation between PET and histological inflammatory severity was calculated.In study arm without previous bowel purgation, SUV ratio of bowel segment (relative to SUV of the liver) facilitated the highest specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared with MRmorph and DWI. Bowel cleansing led to markedly increased metabolic activity of bowel segments, resulting in significantly reduced specificity of PET compared with study arm without purgation (0.808 vs. 0.966, p = 0.007, respectively). Inter-observer concordance for assessing MRmorph was clearly increased after bowel cleansing (Cohen's κ, 0.847 vs. 0.665; p = 0.013, respectively), though diagnostic performance of MRmorph was not significantly improved. Our findings suggested that the change of metabolic status was mainly associated with the grade of neutrophil infiltrate and less dependent on chronic infiltrate.PET-MR enterography was an excellent non-invasive diagnostic method in the assessment of histological active inflammation in ulcerative  without the need of previous bowel purgation.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634546>Leukocyte-specific siRNA delivery revealing IRF8 as a potential anti-inflammatory target.</a></h2><p>Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) protein plays a critical role in the differentiation, polarization, and activation of mononuclear phagocytic cells. In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in inflammatory leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C + inflammatory leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an IBD mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = 5, PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of colon-morphology as assessed by colon-length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS  model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in inflammatory leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We used multiplexed mass spectrometry to collect high-content information on protein phosphorylation in two different mouse models of IBD. Because the biological function of the vast majority of phosphorylation sites remains unknown, we developed Substrate-based Kinase Activity Inference (SKAI), a methodology to infer kinase activity from phosphoproteomic data. This approach draws upon prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to construct custom lists of kinases and their respective substrate sites, termed kinase-substrate sets that employ prior knowledge across organisms. This expansion as much as triples the amount of prior knowledge available. We then used these sets within the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis framework to infer kinase activity based on increased or decreased phosphorylation of its substrates in a dataset. When applied to the phosphoproteomic datasets from the two mouse models, SKAI predicted largely non-overlapping kinase activation profiles. These results suggest that chronic inflammation may arise through activation of largely divergent signaling networks. However, the one kinase inferred to be activated in both mouse models was mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment of mice with active  with ATI450, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the MK2 pathway, reduced inflammatory signaling in the colon and alleviated the clinical and histological features of inflammation. These studies establish MK2 as a therapeutic target in IBD and identify ATI450 as a potential therapy for the disease.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term. Future studies are required to assess the impact of  deletion in other conditions such as experimental .-Aranda, C. J., Arredondo-Amador, M., Ocón, B., Lavín, J. L., Aransay, A.

The newly discovered commensal Propionibacterium strain, P. UF1, regulates the intestinal immunity against pathogen challenge. However, the molecular events driving intestinal phagocytic cell response, including colonic dendritic cells (DCs), by this bacterium are still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the glycosylation of bacterial large surface layer protein A (LspA) by protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (Pmt1) regulates the interaction with SIGNR1, resulting in the control of DC transcriptomic and metabolomic machineries. Programmed DCs promote protective T cell response to intestinal Listeria infection and resist chemically induced  in mice. Thus, our findings may highlight a novel molecular mechanism by which commensal surface glycosylation interacting with SIGNR1 directs the intestinal homeostasis to potentially protect the host against proinflammatory signals inducing colonic tissue damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620491>Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Mimicking an Ulcerative  Flare.</a></h2><p>We present a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the rectum in a 41-year-old African American male with a 1 year history of ulcerative  and no previous immunomodulatory therapy. The patient presented with a 10-day history of hematochezia, for which endoscopy was performed with gross findings indicative of ulcerative  flare. Tissue biopsy, however, demonstrated significant lymphoid infiltrating regions with histologic findings suggestive of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases of colorectal cancer. Associated risk factors have been previously reported but, were absent in the patient's history.

Yet our understanding of IEC-intrinsic regulatory pathways remains incomplete. Here, we identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RABGEF1 as a regulator of intestinal homeostasis and innate pathways dependent on IECs. Mice with IEC-specific Rabgef1 deletion (called Rabgef1 mice) developed a delayed spontaneous  associated with the local upregulation of IEC chemokine expression. In mouse models of  based on Interleukin-10 deficiency or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) exposure, we found that IEC-intrinsic RABGEF1 deficiency exacerbated development of intestinal pathology and dysregulated IEC innate pathways and chemokine expression. Mechanistically, we showed that RABGEF1 deficiency in mouse IECs in vitro was associated with an impairment of early endocytic events, an increased activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway, and increased chemokine secretion. Moreover, we provided evidence that the development of spontaneous  was dependent on microbiota-derived signals and intrinsic MYD88-dependent pathways in vivo. Our study identifies mouse RABGEF1 as an important regulator of intestinal inflammation, MYD88-dependent IEC-intrinsic signaling, and chemokine production. This suggests that RABGEF1-dependent pathways represent interesting therapeutic targets for inflammatory conditions in the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665283>Deficient Resident Memory T-Cell and Cd8 T-Cell Response to Commensals in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Aims: The intestinal microbiota is closely associated with resident memory lymphocytes in mucosal tissue. We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and  Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623956>Solitary Peutz⿿Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp in the transverse colon of an adolescent with ulcerative .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654314>Pain in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Is Not Improved During Hospitalization: The Impact of Opioids on Pain and Healthcare Utilization.</a></h2><p>Most patients with IBD experience pain, especially during acute disease exacerbations.

For each patient, the average and maximum of each day's pain scores were used to measure changes in pain from admission to discharge using mixed model regression, with opiate use as a time-dependent covariate.The daily average pain score over the entire hospitalization was 4.23 ± 2.09, and the maximum pain score was 8.28 ± 1.75. Among opioid users (n = 51), the daily average pain score was 4.65 ± 2.16 and the maximum pain score was 7.53 ± 2.56. Across all cases from admission to discharge, there was less than a 1-point change in daily average pain (- 0.96 ± 2.03, p = 0.0009), and no change in maximum pain (- 0.89 ± 3.59, p = 0.0671). Opioid users, a subset of the overall cohort, had a similar less than one-point drop in daily average pain (- 0.94 ± - 0.29, p = 0.0024) and no change in daily maximum pain scores (- 0.81 ± - 0.47, p = 0.0914).

This 30-year period was divided into seven periods (A-G), ranging from 2 to 7 years each and based on the infection control methods used in each period. We then compared the rates of incisional surgical site infection (SSI) and organ/space SSI; remote infection (RI) including respiratory tract infection (RTI), intravascular catheter-related infection, and urinary tract infection (UTI); and antibiotic-associated  caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) enteritis or Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile-associated disease (CDAD) among the seven periods.In periods B (September 1990-August 1997) and E (November 2004-July 2007), when a unique antibiotic therapy devised in our department was in use, MRSA was isolated from only 0.3% and 0.4% of surgical patients, respectively, and these rates were significantly lower than those in the other periods (p < 0.05). The rate of CDAD increased during period F (August 2007-July 2014), but in period G (August 2014-August 2017), restrictions were placed on the use of antibiotics with a strong anti-anaerobic action and, in this period, the rate of CDAD was only 0.04%, which was significantly lower than that in period F (p < 0.05).Limiting the use of antibiotics that tend to disrupt the intestinal flora may reduce the rates of MRSA infection and CDAD after gastroenterological surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633167>Mucosal Eosinophilia Is an Independent Predictor of Vedolizumab Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>Peripheral and mucosal eosinophilia may be associated with more aggressive disease in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Vedolizumab blocks T lymphocytes, eosinophil adhesion, and extravasation in the gastrointestinal tract. It is not known if mucosal eosinophilia is a predictor for the therapeutic efficacy of vedolizumab.This was a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients with ileal or colonic biopsies who were off steroids before starting vedolizumab. Biopsies were rereviewed by pathologists, and mean eosinophil density was quantified. Patient characteristics and steroid-free clinical response 6 months after beginning vedolizumab were determined. Features were compared between nonresponders and responders, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of clinical response.Of 251 IBD patients starting vedolizumab therapy, 65 patients (48% Crohn's disease, 52% ulcerative ) met inclusion criteria. All IBD patients not responding to vedolizumab were more likely to have a higher baseline mean eosinophil count (340 ± 156 vs 236 ± 124; P = 0.004), be previously exposed to an anti-TNF (96% vs 56%; P = 0.001), and be male (58% vs 28%; P = 0.02). Mean eosinophil counts were significantly increased in colonic biopsies in UC nonresponders (438 ± 149 vs 299 ± 145; P = 0.01). A similar trend was seen in CD nonresponders. On multivariable analysis, colonic eosinophil density and prior anti-TNF exposure-and the combination of both-were independent predictors of response.In ulcerative , colonic eosinophilia and prior anti-TNF exposure were independent predictors of 6-month clinical nonresponse to vedolizumab. Mucosal eosinophil density as a novel biomarker should be explored in larger patient cohorts.Aside from the previous anti-TNF exposure, eosinophil density in the colon of patients with UC is a negative predictor for a steroid-free long-term response to vedolizumab. The degree colonic eosinophilia may be a novel biomarker that should be further explored.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Several systemic inflammatory conditions have been linked to an increased risk of ASCVD; however, this has not been well established in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD is comprised of Ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, both of which involve chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, often with evidence of systemic involvement. Several ASCVD risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, poor diet and the presence of obesity may increase the risk of ASCVD in patients suffering from IBD, despite a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Medications used to treat IBD and target inflammation, such as steroids, may also accelerate the risk of the risk for ASCVD heart failure while exacerbating ASCVD risk factors. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in these patients, most notably in women and in younger patients. Some cohort studies have also suggested a link between IBD and both atrial fibrillation and heart failure, particularly during periods of active flares. All IBD patients, particularly younger individuals, should be screened for ASCVD risk factors with aggressive risk factor modification to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to identify how to prevent and treat cardiovascular events that occur in patients with IBD, particularly during active flares.Copyright © 2019.

Vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are environmental factors that are associated by several pathways, including changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome, with the development and course of IBD. : This review explores the interaction of vitamin D, and UVR, with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune systems, and how they may influence the gut microbiome and the subsequent development, and progression, of IBD. : Vitamin D and UVR both regulate innate and adaptive immunity through a combination of common and independent mechanisms, with the overall effect being the promotion of immune tolerance. Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal microbiome either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal immunity, fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host immunity and the gut microbiome. Further research and increased understanding of environment-host interactions is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of preventing and curing IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619605>Dietary Tricin Suppresses Inflammation-Related Colon Carcinogenesis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Tricin present in rice and wheat exhibits antigrowth activity in several human cancer cell lines and anti-inflammatory potential. However, the chemopreventive activity has not yet been elucidated in preclinical animal models. This study was designed to determine whether dietary tricin exerts inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Male Crj: CD-1 mice were initiated with a single i.p. injection of AOM (10 mg/kg bw) and followed by a 1-week exposure to DSS (1.5%, w/v) in drinking water to induce colonic neoplasms. They were then given the experimental diet containing 50 or 250 ppm tricin. The experiment was terminated at week 18 to determine the chemopreventive efficacy of tricin. The effects of dietary tricin on the expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were also assayed. Feeding with tricin at both doses significantly inhibited the development of colonic tumors. Dietary tricin also significantly reduced the proliferation index and the numbers of mitoses/anaphase bridging of adenocarcinoma cells. Tricin feeding significantly suppressed the TNF-α expression in the normal appearing crypts. Our findings may suggest a potential use of tricin for clinical trials of colorectal cancer chemoprevention in the inflamed colon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667468>Elevated Pretreatment Plasma Oncostatin M Is Associated With Poor Biochemical Response to Infliximab.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that elevations of plasma Oncostatin M (OSM) would be associated with infliximab nonresponse.Plasma OSM was measured in Crohn disease patients pre-infliximab with biochemical response (>50% reduction in fecal calprotectin) as the primary outcome.The median OSM in biochemical responders was 86 (69-148) pg/mL compared with 166 (74-1766) pg/mL in nonresponders ( = 0.03).

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful, bowel preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative  and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± 2.88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486.5 μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616911>Successful Treatment With Ustekinumab for Enterocutaneous Fistulas in Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663424>Antitumor properties of triptolide: phenotype regulation of macrophage differentiation.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which generally exhibit an M2-like phenotype, play a critical role in tumor development. Triptolide exerts a unique bioactive spectrum of anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to determine whether triptolide has any effect on the activation of TAMs and the production of tumor-promoting mediators. ICR-1 mice with azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colon tumors and BALB/c mice co-inoculated with 4T1 cells and M2-polarized RAW264.7 cells were used to examine whether the inhibitory effect of triptolide on tumor progression was mediated by the targeting of TAMs. Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry assays were performed to determine the expression of cell surface markers and cytokine production. The results showed that triptolide inhibited macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype and abolished M2 macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the expression of M2 markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of M2-polarized macrophages and TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity. Our findings provide important information for the potential clinical application of triptolide in cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628021>A single faecal microbiota transplantation modulates the microbiome and improves clinical manifestations in a rat model of .</a></h2><p>Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel potential therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases, but it is poorly characterised.We evaluated the performance of the mouse and rat as a pre-clinical model for human microbiota engraftment. We then characterised the effect of a single human stool transfer (HST) on a humanised model of DSS-induced . Colonic and faecal microbial communities were analysed using the 16S rRNA approach and clinical manifestations were assessed in a longitudinal setting.The microbial community of rats showed greater similarity to that of humans, while the microbiome of mice showed less similarity to that of humans. Moreover, rats captured more human microbial species than mice after a single HST. Using the rat model, we showed that HST compensated faecal dysbiosis by restoring alpha-diversity and by increasing the relative abundance of health-related microbial genera. To some extent, HST also modulated the microbial composition of colonic tissue. These faecal and colonic microbial communities alterations led to a relative restoration of colon length, and a significant decrease in both epithelium damage and disease severity. Remarkably, stopping inflammation by removing DSS before HST caused a faster and greater recovery of both microbiome and clinical manifestation features.Our results indicate that the rat outperforms the mouse as a model for human microbiota engraftment and show that the efficacy of HST can be enhanced when inflammation stimulation is withdrawn.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS  model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated -associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

We detected the expression of circ-SOD2 in Caco2 and NCM460 cells after being treated with inflammatory factors (LPS, TNF-α, IL1-β). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the cellular location of circ-SOD2 in the UC colorectal mucosal tissues. The circ-SOD2 overexpression vector was constructed and produced and then transfected into Caco2 cells to examine the cells' trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), permeability of FITC-dextran and the alterations of epithelial barrier related molecules.We found 264 circRNAs (111 increased and 153 decreased) differentially expressed in the inflamed colon mucosa compared with normal colon mucosa using a P-value <0.05 and a >1.5-fold change cutoff. To validate the circRNA microarray results, we selected some circRNAs to perform qRT-PCR based on the following criteria: (1) circRNAs raw data >100 in each sample, (2) fold-change >2, (3) P<0.05. We identified 10 dysregulated circRNA, among them, circ-SOD2 was upregulated with maximum fold-change in the UC inflamed colorectal mucosa tissues.

Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: 5.10-153.89).

Avoiding complications, surgery and malignancy, alongside minimising the side effects of medications are vital. However, the reality of treatment involves patients losing response to therapy, or developing complications requiring cessation of medication. The reasons for this are numerous and include medication and host-related influences. Underpinning the response to medication, long-term outcomes and loss of response are individual aetiological factors including the molecular cause of disease and individual pharmacogenomic influences.  In this review we discuss the long-term outcome of inflammatory bowel disease, with a focus on paediatric-onset illness and discuss the factors leading to loss of treatment response and briefly consider the future of personalised therapy as a strategy to improve long-term outcome.  research findings are now moving towards clinical translation, including application of new medications targeting new pathways, alongside the integration of biological and multiomic data to predict disease outcome and personalise therapeutic response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647207>Autophagy: A Novel Mechanism Involved in the Anti-Inflammatory Abilities of Probiotics.</a></h2><p>Deregulation of the complex interaction among host genetics, gut microbiota and environmental factors on one hand and aberrant immune responses on the other hand, are known to be associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative  patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of . The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of  that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

The benefits of targeted delivery of 5-ASA to the large intestine are well known, resulting in reduced systemic absorption and increased local concentrations at the disease site. In the present study, a 5-ASA colon delivery system based on the time-dependent strategy, exploiting the relatively consistent small intestinal transit time (SITT), was manufactured and evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo. The system was obtained by successive spray-coating of an immediate-release tablet core with low-viscosity HPMC and Eudragit® L. The enteric film was effective in preventing release during the acidic stage of the in vitro test, while the HPMC coating brought about reproducible lag phases prior to release in phosphate buffer medium. A γ-scintigraphy investigation pointed out that, following administration to fasted and fed volunteers, disintegration of the units never occurred prior to colon arrival. In all cases, a lag time preceded the appearance of the drug and its N-acetyl metabolite in the bloodstream, which was found to correlate with the time of disintegration in a linear mode. The plasma levels of the drug and metabolite as well as their cumulative urinary recovery were relatively low with respect to those reported when 5-ASA is delivered to the small bowel.Copyright © 2019.

Chitooligosaccharides (COS), are oligomer that are depolymerized from chitosan and possess a wide range of biological activities. In this study, the effects of COS on colorectal cancer (CRC) development were evaluated using azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) induced mouse model of CRC (CACM).

In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit  by modulating gut microbiota. L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced  model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut microbiota. Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced  and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent inflammation activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut microbiota disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut microbiota was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced . Lastly, Caco-2 cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti-inflammation effect in DSS-induced . These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota regulated by L-Arabinose.

However, the activity and function of mTORC2 in distinct cells within malignant tissue in vivo is insufficiently explored. Surprisingly, in primary human and mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) samples, mTORC2 signaling could not be detected in tumor cells. In contrast, only macrophages in tumor-adjacent areas showed mTORC2 activity, which was downregulated in stromal macrophages residing within human and mouse tumor tissues. Functionally, inhibition of mTORC2 by specific deletion of Rictor in macrophages stimulated tumorigenesis in a -associated CRC mouse model. This phenotype was driven by a proinflammatory reprogramming of mTORC2-deficient macrophages that promoted  via the cytokine SPP1/osteopontin to stimulate tumor growth. In human CRC patients, high SPP1 levels and low mTORC2 activity in tumor-associated macrophages correlated with a worsened clinical prognosis. Treatment of mice with a second-generation mTOR inhibitor that inhibits mTORC2 and mTORC1 exacerbated experimental colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo. In conclusion, mTORC2 activity is confined to macrophages in CRC and limits tumorigenesis. These results suggest activation but not inhibition of mTORC2 as a therapeutic strategy for -associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650020>The Role of Adaptor Protein CARD9 in -Associated Cancer.</a></h2><p>The adaptor protein CARD9 plays an important role in anti-fungal immunity responses, linking detection of fungi by surface receptors to activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).

Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying diseases, disease locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult IBD patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with IBD [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying disease type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at 2 h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying disease type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

While pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a well-defined disease with established guidelines, Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic  (EoC) remain a clinical enigma with evidence based on limited anecdotal case reports. Large cross-sectional studies in US defined a prevalence of EoG and EoGE ranging from 1,5 to 6,4/100.000 and from 2,7 to 8,3/100.000 subjects respectively, while prevalence of EoC ranges from 1,7 to 3,5/100.000 subjects. Regarding the pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that EGIDs result from the interplay between genetic predisposition, intestinal dysbiosis and environmental triggers. Clinically, EGIDs might present with different and nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the involved intestinal tract and the extension of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The diagnosis of EGIDs requires: 1. recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, 2. increased eosinophils for high power field in biopsy specimens, 3. absence of secondary causes of gastrointestinal eosinophilia. No validated guidelines are available on the clinical management of patients with EGIDs. Evidence from case reports and small uncontrolled case series suggests the use of dietary and corticosteroids as the first-line treatments. Considering the clinical follow-up of EGIDs, three different patterns of disease course are identified: single flare, recurring course-disease and chronic course-disease. This review will focus on pediatric EGIDs distal to esophagus, including Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic  (EoC).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633157>Injury Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease After Trauma: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.</a></h2><p>The clinical course of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after trauma is largely unknown.

Seventy-five patients with IBD were identified. Cases were matched to controls by age, sex, injury severity, and mechanism using 4:1 propensity score-matching analysis. Injury characteristics, clinical course, and infectious and noninfectious complications were compared using bivariate and multivariate analysis.Participants had a mean age of 56 years and mean injury severity score of 15. Of the 75 cases, 44% had ulcerative , 44% had Crohn's disease, and 12% had undetermined type. More cases were on an immunosuppressant (19% vs 2%, P < 0.01) or steroids (8% vs 2%, P = 0.02) on admission compared with controls. More cases had prior abdominal surgery (P = 0.01). Cases had fewer brain injuries (P = 0.02) and higher admission Glasgow Coma Scale (P < 0.01) but required more neurosurgical intervention (P = 0.03).

In multivariable analysis, IBD was associated with increased odds of operative intervention, pain management consultation, venous thromboembolism, and longer hospital stay (P < 0.05). Patients on immunosuppressants had increased odds of requiring surgery (P = 0.04), particularly orthopedic surgery (P < 0.01).Baseline factors associated with inflammatory bowel disease may place patients at higher risk for surgery and complications after trauma.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells play important roles in the development of immune‑mediated hepatitis and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Tofacitinib, a new Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is under investigation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; it is also helpful in treating ulcerative  and psoriasis. The roles of tofacitinib were investigated in conferring protection against immune‑mediated liver injury in mice. T cell‑mediated hepatitis was induced by concanavalin A (ConA). The mice in the treatment groups were administered with tofacitinib intragastrically before the ConA injection. Histopathological examination was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the serum transaminase and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined using an automatic biochemistry analysis apparatus or cytometric bead array (CBA) kits. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect Tregs and Th17 cells. Tofacitinib significantly decreased the hepatic injury induced by ConA and prominently decreased the liver transaminase level. The secretion of several anti‑inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)‑10 was upregulated in mice from the treatment group, compared to that in mice treated with ConA alone, while the expression of interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ) and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) decreased. Tofacitinib treatment increased the number of Tregs and reduced the number of Th17 cells. Furthermore, tofacitinib could relieve liver fibrosis under conditions of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The present results indicated that tofacitinib improved immune‑mediated hepatitis and restored the impaired Treg/Th17 cell ratio, which suggests that it may serve as a novel treatment approach for immune‑mediated liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669103>Protective effects of flavonoid composition rich P. subpeltata Ortega. on indomethacin induced experimental ulcerative  in rat models of inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>Polyphenolics (flavonoid and phenolic) rich plants are the effective source for the treatment of acute and chronic degenerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.This study was aimed to examine the effects of polyphenolics rich leaf acetone extract of P. subpeltata against the indomethacin induced ulcerative  in rats.Two consecutive days administration of indomethacin produced chronic inflammation in GIT tissues of rats.

Disruption of function or frequency of either cell type can lead to fatal autoimmunity. We previously described that mice constitutively lacking DCs (∆DC) develop autoimmunity characterized by reduced body weight, autoantibodies, and pronounced intestinal inflammation. In this study, we show that lack of DCs leads to an altered gene expression profile in peripheral but not thymic Tregs with increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The suppressive function of Tregs from ΔDC mice was impaired in T cell cocultures. In a model of transfer , Tregs from ∆DC mice were only functional in the presence of DCs in recipient mice. Lack of MHC class II on DCs also resulted in upregulation of inhibitory receptors on Tregs, reduced body weight, and elevated serum IgA levels. Further analysis of the IgA response revealed an expansion of IgA germinal center B cells and plasma cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and more IgA-coated commensal bacteria in feces of ∆DC mice. Thus, we show a critical role for DCs to establish intestinal homeostasis by regulating Treg function for prevention of spontaneous inflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623977>Cytomegalovirus disease in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, experience over 8 years.</a></h2><p>Cytomegalovirus infection and disease are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The present work attempted to assess the efficacy and mechanisms of Berberis lycium Royle fruit extract (BLFE) in mitigating chemical-induced  in mice. was induced in Balb/C mice using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) and protective effects of BLFE were examined. Several oxi-inflammatory parameters, histopathological changes, epithelial barrier integrity and activation of NF-κB/c-Jun/MAPKs in colon tissue were determined. Splenic T cell subpopulations were also gauged to evaluate the systemic effects of BLFE in the modulation of immune responses.BLFE treatment effectively improved animal survival rate, DAI score, colon length and structural damage in DSS-exposed mice. Expression of oxi-inflammatory markers such as MPO, IgE, iNOS, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and RANTES as well as Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines were decreased in BLFE treated animals. On the other hand, an increased mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4/IL-10), tight junction proteins and IgA levels were also observed during BLFE treatment. BLFE appeared to modulate intestinal epithelial cell proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (Bcl2/Bax), thereby suggesting its role in the maintenance of intestinal integrity. Analysis of inflammatory signalling pathways indicated robust activation and expression of NF-κB/c-Jun/MAPKs (JNK and p38) in DSS treated animal which was strongly abrogated by BLFE treatment.

However, dose-limiting sequelae amongst patients receiving cyclosporine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have not been as significant. As a result, the fear of renal toxicity as an adverse effect is less of a concern in IBD patients. The goal of this manuscript is to emphasize the need for future research to explore optimal drug dosing and extended use of cyclosporine therapy in the treatment of IBD-given its pathophysiology, efficacy, and safety profile in patients with IBD.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

Whether the essential oil from  (ECB) and its active constituents have anti-proliferative activities in lung cancer is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of ECB in A549 and NCI-H358 human lung cancer cells. Culture of A549 and NCI-H358 cells with ECB induced apoptotic cell death, as revealed by an increase in annexin V staining. ECB treatment reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), disrupted the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and activated caspase-8, -9, and -3, as assessed by western blot analysis. Interestingly, pretreatment with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) significantly attenuated ECB-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of ECB identified six compounds. Among them, β-caryophyllene exhibited a potent anti-proliferative effect, and thus was identified as the major active compound. β- Caryophyllene induced G cell cycle arrest by downregulating cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) -2, -4, and -6, and RB phosphorylation, and by upregulating p21 and p27. These results indicate that β-caryophyllene exerts cytotoxic activity in lung cancer cells through induction of cell cycle arrest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626205>[Morphology of the thymus and the specific features of its cellular composition in experimental acute and chronic ulcerative ].</a></h2><p>To investigate morphological changes in the thymus, the subpopulation composition of lymphocytes and its non-lymphoid cells in dextran-induced experimental acute ulcerative  and in different periods of chronic ulcerative .Acute and chronic ulcerative  was simulated in C57BL/6 mice, by replacing drinking water with a 1% aqueous dextran sulfate sodium solution. Thymic changes were morphometrically assessed; the number and absolute area of thymic corpuscles and epithelial cells were calculated; and the subpopulation composition of lymphocytes and thymic stromal cells was determined using flow cytofluorimetry; the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney test were used to compare the groups.In acute catarrhal and ulcerative , there was acute accidental thymic involution with devastation of the cortical substance and with a decline in its volume fraction, with an increase in the levels of cells dying through the mechanism of apoptosis, and with a decrease in the absolute number of lymphocytes, T-helper cells, cytotoxic T-cells, regulatory T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, with a rise in the index of the area of thymic corpuscles and in the content of late-phase corpuscles among them, and with the appearance of thymic corpuscles as cyst-like cavities. In chronic ulcerative , the cortex was expanded and the area of thymic corpuscles and the count of medullary epithelial cells increased. The cyst-like thymic corpuscles formed clusters, the count of dendritic cells increased in early-stage chronic ulcerative , but the levels of macrophages decreased in both periods of its development.There is acute accidental involution and thymic hyperplasia with an increase in medullary epithelial cells and thymic corpuscles consisting of cytokeratin 19 in the epithelial cells in experimental acute and chronic ulcerative , respectively. The more pronounced epithelial cell response found in end-stage experimental chronic ulcerative  reflects the enhanced differentiation of regulatory T-lymphocytes and the larger number of which is observed in peripheral blood and in the focus of inflammation in patients with ulcerative , according to the literature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671188>Risk Factors for Medication Nonadherence to Self-Injectable Biologic Therapy in Adult Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC), nonadherence to biologic therapy increases risk of disease flare. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy. In patients with CD, the probability of nonadherence increased as the number of risk factors increased.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s &  Foundation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660640>Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and dose escalation for patients with ulcerative : results from OCTAVE Open.</a></h2><p>For patients with UC, flexible maintenance dosing therapy may confer advantages for safety, efficacy, costs and patient preference. Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of UC.To assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and escalation in patients with UC.We evaluated data (November 2017 data cut-off) from OCTAVE Open, an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension study. The dose de-escalation group comprised 66 tofacitinib induction responders in remission following 52 weeks' tofacitinib 10 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently de-escalated to 5 mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open. The dose escalation group comprised 57 tofacitinib induction responders who experienced treatment failure while receiving 5 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently escalated to 10 mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open.After tofacitinib de-escalation, 92.4% (61/66) and 84.1% (53/63) of patients maintained clinical response and 80.3% (53/66) and 74.6% (47/63) maintained remission, at months 2 and 12, respectively. After dose escalation, 57.9% (33/57) and 64.9% (37/57) of patients recaptured clinical response and 35.1% (20/57) and 49.1% (28/57) were in remission, at months 2 and 12, respectively. The incidence rate of herpes zoster with dose escalation (7.6 patients with events/100 patient-years) was numerically higher than in the overall tofacitinib UC programme.Following tofacitinib de-escalation in patients already in remission on 10 mg b.d., most maintained remission, although 25.4% lost remission, at month 12. For induction responders who dose-escalated following treatment failure on 5 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, 49.1% achieved remission by month 12. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: ).© 2019 The Authors.

CD90+ (myo-)fibroblasts (MFs) are abundant cells in the normal (N) intestinal mucosa contributing to mucosal tolerance via suppression of Th1 cell activity through cell surface membrane-bound PD-L1 (mPD-L1). CD-MFs have a decreased level of mPD-L1. Consequently, mPD-L1-mediated suppression of Th1 cells by CD-MFs is decreased, yet the mechanism responsible for the reduction in mPDL-1 is unknown. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been reported in CD. Herein we observed that when compared to N- and ulcerative  (UC)-MFs, CD-MFs increase in LPS-inducible levels of MMP-7 and -9 with a significant increase in both basal and inducible MMP-10. A similar pattern of MMP expression was observed in the CD-inflamed mucosa. Treatment of N-MFs with a combination of recombinant human MMP-7, -9 and -10 significantly decreased mPD-L1. In contrast, inhibition of MMP activity with MMP inhibitors or anti-MMP-10 neutralizing antibodies restores mPD-L1 on CD-MFs. CD-MFs demonstrated reduced capacity to suppress Th1 and Th17 responses from activated CD4+ T cells. By contrast, supplementation of the CD-MF:T-cell co-cultures with MMP inhibitors or anti-MMP neutralizing antibodies restored the CD-MF-mediated suppression. Our data suggest that (i) increased MMP-10 expression by CD-MFs and concomitant cleavage of PD-L1 from the surface of CD-MFs are likely to be one of the factors contributing to the decrease of mPD-L1-mediated suppression of Th1/Th17 cells in CD; and (ii) MMPs are likely to have a significant role in the intestinal mucosal immune responses.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2019.

Non-invasive diagnostic techniques are lacking in IBD. Currently, faecal calprotectin is a sensitive marker of gut inflammation however is not specific to Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC) alone. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were shown to have potential in IBD diagnosis. : This systematic review aimed to examine the next-generation diagnosis of IBD in adults and children using VOCs. An in-depth literature-based search of current clinical studies of VOCs in the diagnosis of IBD was undertaken. Accuracy of IBD detection varied according to the technologies applied. Breath VOCs studies were pooled giving an overall sensitivity of 85% (95%CI: 79-89%) and specificity of 79% (95%CI 73-84%) whilst pooled faecal VOCs studies revealed a sensitivity of 87% (95%CI 77-93%) and specificity of 91% (95%CI 82-96%). Studies were limited by the variance of techniques applied in VOCs detection and the absence of well-designed longitudinal studies. : VOCs can be consistently and effectively detected in urine, breath, and stool in IBD patients. The sensitivity of breath VOCs in detecting IBD was comparable to faeces. However, optimal VOCs detection methodology and biological sampling still need to be standardised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628570>DDS Profile: Maria T.

The aim of this study is to clarify whether the measurement of FC has changed the number of ultrasound and endoscopic procedures, drug modifications, as well as FC re-measurements in IBD patients.This retrospective study included 242 IBD patients with available FC values (case cohort) and 46 patients without an available FC value (control cohort). Clinical consequences such as carrying out abdominal ultrasound, endoscopy, drug modification or FC re-measurement at the next ambulatory presentation or during in-patient stay were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between clinical decision-making and patient's characteristics, especially FC value.Overall, 192 (67%) clinical consequences were noted in both cohorts. In the case cohort 174 (91%) implications were noted compared to 18 (9%) in the control cohort (P < 0.001). In the case cohort, significantly more clinical consequences were detected in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) as well as in ulcerative  (UC) patients with a FC value > 250 mg/Kg than in patients with a value of ≤ 250 mg/Kg. In CD patients with high FC values significantly increased numbers of abdominal ultrasounds, endoscopies and FC re-measurements were noted. In UC patients with high FC values significantly increased numbers of abdominal ultrasounds, drug modifications and FC re-measurements were noted.Measurement of FC may alter physician's clinical decision-making in IBD patients beside other clinical and diagnostic parameters.

Long-term treatment maintenance with aminosalicylates and higher therapeutic requirements were recorded. The cumulative incidence of treatment escalation was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of treatment with immunomodulators, biological agents or surgery.A total of 457 patients were included, of whom 28% ( = 126) were non-responders to aminosalicylates. The cumulative probability for a step-up approach within 20 years of follow up was 35%, mainly due to steroid-dependent . Risk factors for treatment escalation were age ≤27 years (hazard ratio 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.36-3.92), extensive  (hazard ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.60), Mayo endoscopic subscore ≥2 (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.06) and extraintestinal manifestations (hazard ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.03-4.05).Aminosalicylates represent an effective maintenance therapy.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative  (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients after LT from a tertiary center case series and an updated literature review.Inflammatory bowel disease patients undergoing LT between 1985 and 2018 and requiring combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were identified from the London Health Sciences Transplant Registry (Ontario, Canada). Safety outcomes were extracted by medical chart review. For an updated literature review, EMBASE, Medline, and CENTRAL were searched to identify studies evaluating the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients.In the case series, 19 patients were identified. Most underwent LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; 14/19, 74%) treated with anti-integrins (8/19, 42%) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) antagonists (6/19, 32%). Infections occurred in 11/19 (58%) patients, most commonly Clostridium difficile (4/19, 21%). Two patients required colectomy, and 1 patient required re-transplantation. In the literature review, 13 case series and 8 case reports reporting outcomes for 122 IBD patients treated with biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were included. PSC was the indication for LT in 97/122 (80%) patients, and 91/122 (75%) patients were treated with TNF antagonists. Infections occurred in 32/122 (26%) patients, primarily Clostridium difficile (7/122, 6%).Inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT appeared to be at increased risk of Clostridium difficile. Compared with the general liver transplant population in the published literature, there was no increased risk of serious infection.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the microbiota to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative  patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's disease patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal probiotics Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative .

This prospective observational study aimed to analyze the effect of perianal disease on anorectal function and quality of life in IBD patients.  Patient assessment included full clinical examination, validated scores, anorectal manometry, three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography, and endoscopy. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire was adopted to evaluate patients' quality of life.  From January to November 2016, 37 consecutive IBD patients (30 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative ) and 20 controls were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients had a history of perianal fistula, 9 reported fecal incontinence, and 2 had anal fissure. Fecal incontinent patients were older, had a longer disease duration, and higher bowel movement number than continent patients. Endoanal ultrasound findings were normal in all volunteers, while pathological features were found in 31/37 patients. Rectal sensory testing and anal pressure did not differ between the IBD patients and controls. However, the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was normally elicited in all controls vs. 32/37 (86%) IBD patients; 25/37 (68%) IBD patients showed manometric features of dyssynergic defecation. Rectal inflammation and incontinence were associated with low maximum anal resting pressure. The quality of life score was lower in ulcerative  patients than in Crohn's patients and significantly lower in fecal incontinent patients.  Anorectal function is impaired in IBD patients with perianal disease. Fecal incontinence correlates with poorer quality of life.

Although metagenomic analysis shows that the intestine of healthy humans and animals harbors various commensal viruses and the dysbiosis of these viruses can be associated with inflammatory diseases, there is still a lack of causal data and underlying mechanisms to understand the physiological role of commensal viruses in intestinal homeostasis. In the present study, we show that commensal viruses are essential for the homeostasis of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Mechanistically, the cytosolic viral RNA-sensing receptor RIG-I in antigen-presenting cells can recognize commensal viruses and maintain IELs via a type I interferon-independent, but MAVS-IRF1-IL-15 axis-dependent, manner. The recovery of IELs by interleukin-15 administration reverses the susceptibility of commensal virus-depleted mice to dextran sulfate sodium-induced . Collectively, our results indicate that commensal viruses maintain the IELs and consequently sustain intestinal homeostasis via noncanonical RIG-I signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619442>A Phase I Trial of Berberine in Chinese with Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The Chinese natural product, berberine, has biological properties supporting potential efficacy as a colon cancer prevention agent. Its longstanding use in China to treat gastrointestinal tract and rheumatologic disorders is generally regarded as safe, supporting initial investigations in an at-risk population, such as individuals with ulcerative  (UC). However, the safety of berberine in this population is not established. Individuals living in China with biopsy-proven UC, ≤ grade 2 dysplasia, and with a UC disease activity index (UCDAI) score ≤ 1 on mesalamine, were randomized 3:1 in a double-blind phase I trial to berberine 900 mg/day or placebo for 3 months, with the primary objective of assessing safety. Blood samples and biopsies of the colorectum, from prespecified locations, were collected prior to and following therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in UCDAI score, and in tissue and plasma markers of inflammation. Of toxicities at least possibly related, one episode of grade 3 elevation in transaminases and one episode of grade 1 nausea were observed among 12 individuals on berberine, and none were observed among 4 on placebo. The mean plasma berberine concentration was 3.5 nM after berberine treatment, significantly higher than 0.5 nM with placebo. Berberine significantly decreased the Geboes grade in colonic tissue, but had a nonsignificant effect on other tissue or blood biomarkers related to cell growth and inflammation. The combination of berberine and mesalamine is well tolerated in Chinese with UC, and may enhance mesalamine's anti-inflammatory effects in colonic tissue.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659674>Biofilm Formation and Virulence Determinants of Klebsiella oxytoca Clinical Isolates from Patients with Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Biofilm formation has made the therapy of bacterial infections more difficult.

The virulence properties and biofilm formation among the isolates were investigated by phenotypic, PCR, and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) techniques.The bla (20%), bla (11%), bla (33%), and AmpC encoding CIT (2%) ESBL genes, carbapenemase-encoding genes blaIM (4%) and bla (2%), and colistin-resistant mcr-1 gene (2.5%) were detected. The virulence-encoding genes including fimA (80%), pilQ (100%), matB (100%), mrkA (80%), and npsB (100%) were amplified. Therefore, PDR K. oxytoca containing adhesins and toxin-encoding genes with ability of biofilm formation causing AAHC and CRC were isolated. There was a significant difference between healthy and patients with CRC regarding the presence of K. oxytoca (p = 00.221).Bacterial enteric pathogens possibly play a role in CRC. Biofilm formation by K. oxytoca strains prevents the efficient infection elimination; therefore, rapid identification and control measure are chief requirements.

In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro-inflammatory factors. These data highlight the negative impact of chronic gut inflammation on bone as well as the therapeutic potential of irisin as an anti-inflammatory treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665832>Nutritional approach as therapeutic manipulation in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Malnutrition is observed more frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than in the general population and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This study aimed to review the current knowledge regarding the efficacy of dietary and nutritional intervention in IBD patients. Exclusive enteral nutrition might be inferior to corticosteroid treatment in adults with active Crohn's disease (CD) but might even be superior considering the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment in children. Total parenteral nutrition has no advantage over enteral nutrition, which is considered a more physiologic modality in organ function. Current guidelines do not yet recommend ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for the prevention and maintenance of remission in IBD patients. Dietary fiber supplementation could be effective in the relief of symptoms and maintenance of remission in ulcerative  (UC). Although vitamin D may be favorable to clinical course of IBD and bone density. Probiotic supplementation has proven to be effective in preventing and treating pouchitis for UC but is less effective in treating CD. Nutritional interventions not only correct nutritional deficiencies but also improve symptoms and clinical courses of the disease. Hence, nutritional approaches need to be developed to significantly evaluate the effectiveness of dietary interventions used to treat IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657664>Cyanidin-3--Glucoside and Cyanidin Protect Against Intestinal Barrier Damage and 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid-Induced .</a></h2><p>Anthocyanin-rich extracts have shown anti-inflammation activity in mouse  models. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti-inflammatory activity in both  mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti-inflammatory effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, C3G or Cy could be potential preventive agents or supplementary medicines for inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635181>Geographic Distribution, Phenotype and Epidemiological Tendency in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients in Romania.</a></h2><p> The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) over the past years in Romania has been on the rise, but epidemiologic data are lacking. The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of IBD, the trends and phenotype among IBD patients in Romania.  We conducted a prospective study over a period of 12 years, from 2006 to 2017. All patients diagnosed with IBD on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features were included. We divided the country into eight regions: west (W), north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE), south-west (SW), south (S), central (C) and Bucharest-Ilfov (B), and data were analyzed accordingly.  A total of 2724 patients were included in this database, but only 2248 were included in the final analysis, with all data available. Of the 2248 patients, 935 were Crohn's disease (CD), 1263 were ulcerative  (UC) and 50 were IBD-undetermined. In UC phenotypes we observed more frequent left-sided  (50.5%,  < 0.0001), and in CD phenotype we observed more frequent colonic and ileo-colonic localization (37.8% and 37.6%,  < 0.0001). The region with the most IBD cases was NE (25.1%) and with the least IBD cases was SW (4.9%). UC was found more frequently in NE (32%), while CD was found more frequently in Bucharest (28.6%).  In Romania, ulcerative  is more frequent than CD. UC is predominant in the northern part of Romania, while CD has become predominant in the southern part of the country. IBD occurs more in the male population, and in urban and industrialized areas. There are differences between the regions in Romania regarding IBD phenotypes, gender distributions, age distribution, treatment, smoking status and complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657260>Corneal Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>: To evaluate detailed corneal parameters of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) patients, and to assess associations between anterior segment values and other clinical variables.: This prospective cross-sectional case-control study at a tertiary referral center included 30 CD patients, 36 UC patients and 80 age- and gender-matched controls with no ocular symptoms or ocular surface disorders. All study participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation with special interest in dry eye disease (DED). Corneal parameters were evaluated by Pentacam.: The mean age of CD patients, UC patients, and controls was 45.80 ± 11.55 years, 52.00 ± 16.05, and 50.68 ± 14.62, respectively. The average disease duration was 12.72 ± 5.83 years for CD patients and 15.94 ± 10.09 years for UC patients. All pachymetric (center, apex and thinnest) and corneal volume (CV) measurements were significantly decreased, while anterior chamber angle width (ACA) values were significantly increased on both sides in all IBD patients compared to those in controls ( < .05). In addition, several anterior segment parameters were altered unilaterally in CD or UC patients. Negative correlations were found between corneal parameters and Schirmer I test values.: Our investigations suggest that IBD patients have thinner corneas compared to that of controls. The coexistence of reduced tear quantity seems to have an additional impact on the thinning of the cornea in IBD patients. Early recognition of corneal impairments, a possible extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, should be included in the disease checkup to reduce vision-threatening developments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633731>VEDOLIZUMAB IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES: A BRAZILIAN OBSERVATIONAL MULTICENTRIC STUDY.</a></h2><p>There is scarce data regarding efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel diseases in Latin America.To describe the first observational real-world experience with vedolizumab in Latin American inflammatory bowel diseases patients.Retrospective observational multicentric study of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) who used vedolizumab at any phase of their treatment. Clinical remission and response (according to Harvey-Bradshaw index for CD and Mayo score for UC), mucosal healing, need for surgery and adverse events were evaluated.A total of 90 patients were included (52 with CD and 38 with UC), the majority with previous exposure to anti-TNF agents (88.46% in CD and 76.31% in UC). In CD (as observed analysis) remission rates at weeks 12, 26 and 52 were 42.89% (21/49), 61.9% (26/42) and 46.15% (12/26), respectively. In UC, remission rates at weeks 12, 26 and 52 were 28.94% (11/38), 36.66% (11/30) and 41.17% (7/17). Mucosal healing rates were 36.11% in CD and 43.4% in UC.

This research points to the daily challenges that patients experience which can relate to their physical and psychological health, as well as their social wellbeing, and may impact negatively on their lives. To date, there has been little attempt to synthesise these studies, and little is known about how patients manage the challenges they experience.A meta-synthesis was conducted, based on guidelines developed by Sandelowski and Barroso (2007) and PRISMA (Moher et al. 2009).Searches were conducted within the CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection and SocINDEX databases to locate qualitative and mixed methodology studies. The retrieved articles were screened against pre-determined inclusion criteria. Quality appraisal was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for qualitative research (Lockwood et al. 2015).Thematic analysis resulted in three themes: the unpredictability of living with IBD, the emotional turmoil of living with IBD and striving to maintain a normal life in managing IBD.The greatest challenges for patients identified in this meta-synthesis were the physical symptoms associated with IBD. These impacted negatively on their psychological and social wellbeing and reduced their quality of life. There is a notable gap in research on patient experiences of managing the challenges identified in everyday life and to what extent they receive support from healthcare professionals.The results of this meta-synthesis offer insights into how the physical challenges of living with IBD, particularly in relation to symptoms, impact adversely on patients' psychological and social wellbeing. These insights are clinically relevant to healthcare professionals as a basis for supporting patients to manage their challenges.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626699>Is Ulcerative  Associated With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis an Undertreated Condition?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663272>Pyoderma gangrenosum at multiple sites in a post-colostomy ulcerative  patient with chronic hepatitis B virus: A case report.</a></h2><p>Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon ulcerative cutaneous lesion manifesting as rapidly progressing single or multiple skin ulcers.

Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early (intervention) and late/no (comparator) biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is reported in Swiss francs (CHF). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed.Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention (CHF384,607; 16.84 QALYs) compared to comparator (CHF340,800; 16.75 QALYs) strategy, resulting in high ICERs (health system: CHF887,450 per QALY; societal: CHF449,130 per QALY). Assuming a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY, in probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention strategy had a 0.1 and 0.25 probability of being cost-effective from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In addition, ICERs improved when we assumed a 30% reduction in biologic prices (health system: CHF134,502 per QALY; societal: intervention dominant).Early biologic use was not cost-effective considering a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY compared to late/no biologic use. However, early identification of patients likely to need biologics and future drug price reductions through increased availability of biosimilars may improve the cost-effectiveness of an early treatment approach.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

During the same time, expansion of autoimmunological disorders was noticed. Among other are Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) including ulcerative  and Crohn's disease which are chronic and relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Absence of effective treatment in standard therapies effects the search for alternative opportunities. As per hygienic hypothesis increasing number of cases of autoimmune diseases is as a result of reduced exposure to pathogens, especially parasites. Thus, one of the promising remedial acts against IBD and other allergic and autoimmune disorders is "helminth therapy". Cure with helminths seems to be the most effective therapy of IBD currently proposed. Helminth therapy focuses on advantageous results that have been obtained from the clinical trials, but its mechanisms are still unclear.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether anxiety, sleep quality, and self-efficacy of patients have mediating effects in the relationship of patient-reported physician empathy and inflammatory factor in ulcerative  (UC) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 242 patients attended by 45 doctors. Self-reported doctors' empathy ability was measured at patient admission (T1), and patient-reported physician empathy was measured 3 months later (T2). Patient anxiety, general self-efficacy, sleep, and inflammatory factor (IL-6) were measured on T1 and T2. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between self-reported doctor empathy ability and patient indices on T1 and T2. The relationships between anxiety, sleep quality, self-efficacy, IL-6, and patient-reported physician empathy were measured by Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling. RESULTS On T1, no significant correlation was reported between self-reported doctors' empathy ability and indices of the patients (P>0.05). On T2, self-reported doctors' empathy ability was significantly positively correlated with patient sleep and self-efficacy (P<0.01), and significantly negatively correlated with patient anxiety and IL-6 (P<0.01). Moreover, on T2, patient-reported physician empathy was negatively correlated with anxiety and IL-6 and was positively correlated with self-efficacy and sleep quality. The effect of patient-reported physician empathy on IL-6 was mediated by anxiety, sleep quality, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS The anxiety, self-efficacy, and sleep quality of UC patients had mediating effects in the relationship between patient-reported physician empathy and IL-6.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645712>Epithelial EP4 plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in colon.</a></h2><p>Colonic epithelial cells comprise the mucosal barrier, and their dysfunction promotes microbial invasion from the gut lumen and induces the development of intestinal inflammation. The EP4 receptor is known to mediate the protective effect of prostaglandin (PG) E in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the exact role of epithelial EP4 in intestinal pathophysiology remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of epithelial EP4 in maintaining colonic homeostasis by characterizing the intestinal epithelial cell-specific EP4 knockout (EP4 cKO) mice. Mice harboring the epithelial EP4 deletion showed significantly lower colonic crypt depth and lower numbers of secretory cell lineages, as well as impaired epithelial cells in the colon. Interestingly, EP4-deficient colon epithelia showed a higher number of apoptotic cells. Consistent with the defect in mucosal barrier function of colonic epithelia and secretory cell lineages, EP4 cKO colon stroma showed enhanced immune cell infiltration, which was accompanied by increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, EP4-deficient colons were susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced . Our study is the first to demonstrate that epithelial EP4 loss resulted in potential "inflammatory" status under physiological conditions. These findings provided insights into the crucial role of epithelial PGE/EP4 axis in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622979>The ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative: Design, Implementation, and Validation of a Disease-specific Module.</a></h2><p>Surgery for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a complex interplay between disease, surgery, and medications, exposing patients to increased risk of postoperative complications. Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect disease-specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in IBD.A collaborative of 13 high-volume IBD surgery centers was convened to collect 5 IBD-specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The 2 most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All 5 novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first disease-specific collaborative within NSQIP. The selected variables were demonstrated to be reliably collected, and this collaborative will facilitate high-quality, large case-volume research specific to the IBD patient population.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

The role of endoscopists, pathologists, and patients are investigated. Colorectal cancer is linked to poor compliance with therapy, and attention may be better directed at improving adherence to treatment than strengthening current surveillance programs. Clearly, 5-ASA compounds, particularly mesalazine, are the most appropriate agents to choose, but there may also be a place for the daily intake of folic acid. Currently, the evidence in support of ursodeoxycholic acid is mixed, and it cannot be recommended, in general, to patients for the prophylaxis of colorectal cancer risk. An alternative approach through better concordance with medications is considered. The situation in Crohn's  is less clear. Although the risk of colorectal cancer mirrors that in ulcerative , there are no published community-based studies that exclusively assess the effects of surveillance on the early detection of cancer, and the benefits of 5-ASA compounds in treatment seem less certain than in ulcerative . In addition, there have been no assessments of the effects of any medications on cancer risk in Crohn's disease.© 2019 The Authors.

However, significant challenges still exist in Latin America to facilitate the access of biological agents for physicians and patients.The aim of this review was to summarize current evidence on penetration of biological agents for CD and UC in Latin America.Data are derived from a previous complete systematic review that explored different characteristics of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in Latin America. The studies fully included in this previous systematic review which contained detailed descriptions of the percentage of use of biological agents in different cohorts throughout Latin American and Caribbean countries were included, and descriptive findings were compiled, describing CD and UC penetration of these drugs in different patient cohorts from different countries.From the 61 studies included in the original systematic review, only 19 included data of the percentage of patients treated with biological agents. Anti-TNF use in CD varied from 1.51% in Mexico up to 46.9% in Colombia, with most of the studies describing anti-TNF use in approximately 20%-40% of CD patients. On the other side, the frequency of the use of biologics was clearly lower in UC, varying from 0% in 2009 to up 16.2% in 2018, according to two different Mexican studies. Only two studies described the penetration of anti-TNF agents in IBD overall: 13.4% in a Colombian and 37.93% in a Brazilian study. No studies described percentage of use of new biologic agents (vedolizumab and ustekinumab).Penetration of anti-TNF agents in Latin America is comparable to the rest of the world in CD, but lower in UC. With the increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD, specific strategies to increase access to anti-TNF agents in UC and new biological agents overall are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620010> Alleviates DSS-Induced  by Reprograming Intestinal Microbiota and Influencing Serum Metabolome in Murine Model.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of  on the microbial community and serum metabolome in  induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).

However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative . Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative  owing to the presence of inflammatory polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for 2 years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in 5 of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative , inflammatory polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-2,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the inflammatory polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative  activity, but due to other lesions such as inflammatory polyps. This fact must be taken into account before carrying out relevant changes such as step-up therapy to immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs in patients with confirmed high calprotectin levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

A multivariate test identified 260 DEGs associated with IBD, 53 of which were not found in any of the disorders. We identified important molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, such as the JAK/STAT and interferon-gamma signaling pathways, genes involved in cell adhesion, apoptosis and carcinogenesis.

However, monitoring individual VWR performance usually requires single housing, which itself might have a negative effect on wellbeing. In consideration of the 3Rs principle, VWR behaviour was evaluated under group-housing conditions. To test the applicability for severity assessment, this readout was evaluated in a dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced  model. For continuous monitoring, an automated system with integrated radio-frequency identification technology was used, enabling detection of individual VWR. After a 14-day adaptation period mice demonstrated a stable running performance. Analysis during DSS treatment in combination with repeated facial vein phlebotomy and faecal sampling procedure resulted in significantly reduced VWR behaviour during the course of  and increased VWR during disease recovery. Mice submitted to phlebotomy and faecal sampling but no DSS treatment showed less reduced VWR but a longer-lasting recovery. Application of a cluster model discriminating individual severity levels based on VWR and body weight data revealed the highest severity level in most of the DSS-treated mice on day 7, but a considerable number of control mice also showed elevated severity levels due to sampling procedures alone. In summary, VWR sensitively indicated the course of DSS  severity and the impact of sample collection. Therefore, monitoring of VWR is a suitable method for the detection of disturbed wellbeing due to DSS  and sampling procedure in group-housed female laboratory mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665969>Defining body-weight reduction as a humane endpoint: a critical appraisal.</a></h2><p>In many animal experiments scientists and local authorities define a body-weight reduction of 20% or more as severe suffering and thereby as a potential parameter for humane endpoint decisions. In this study, we evaluated distinct animal experiments in multiple research facilities, and assessed whether 20% body-weight reduction is a valid humane endpoint criterion in rodents. In most experiments (restraint stress, distinct models for epilepsy, pancreatic resection, liver resection, caloric restrictive feeding and a mouse model for Dravet syndrome) the animals lost less than 20% of their original body weight. In a glioma model, a fast deterioration in body weight of less than 20% was observed as a reliable predictor for clinical deterioration. In contrast, after induction of chronic diabetes or acute  some animals lost more than 20% of their body weight without exhibiting major signs of distress. In these two animal models an exclusive application of the 20% weight loss criterion for euthanasia might therefore result in an unnecessary loss of animals. However, we also confirmed that this criterion can be a valid parameter for defining the humane endpoint in other animal models, especially when it is combined with additional criteria for evaluating distress. In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that experiment and model specific considerations are necessary for the rational integration of the parameter 'weight loss' in severity assessment schemes and humane endpoint criteria. A flexible implementation tailored to the experiment or intervention by scientists and authorities is therefore highly recommended.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634104>Clinical Guideline Highlights for the Hospitalist: Clostridium difficile Infections in Children.</a></h2><p>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Clostridium difficile Infection in Adults and Children: 2017 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA).February 15, 2018 PRIOR VERSIONS: Cohen SH, Gerding DN, Johnson S, et al; Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America; Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The existence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in colon tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic acid into the large colon through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632213>A SPECIAL MEETING REVIEW EDITION: Highlights in Inflammatory Bowel Disease From the 14th Congress of ECCO: A Review of Selected Presentations From the 14th Congress of the European Crohn's and  Organisation (ECCO) • March 6-9, 2019 • Copenhagen, Denmark• VARSITY: A Double-Blind, Double-Dummy, Randomized Controlled Trial of Vedolizumab Versus Adalimumab in Patients With Active Ulcerative • Analyses of Data From the VISIBLE 1 and 2 Trials: Vedolizumab in Patients With Ulcerative  or Crohn's Disease• Improved Endoscopic Outcomes and Mucosal Healing of Upadacitinib as an Induction Therapy in Adults With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative : Data From the U-ACHIEVE Study• Long-Term Safety of Vedolizumab in Ulcerative  and Crohn's Disease: Final Results From the GEMINI LTS Study• Pediatric Crohn's Disease Adalimumab Level-Based Optimization Treatment (PAILOT) Randomized Controlled Trial• Maintenance Treatment With Mirikizumab, a P19-Directed IL-23 Antibody: 52-Week Results in Patients With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative • Real-World Effectiveness and Safety of Vedolizumab and Anti-TNF Therapy in Biologic-Naive Patients With Ulcerative  or Crohn's Disease: Results From the EVOLVE Study• A Randomized, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of a Targeted-Release Oral Cyclosporine Formulation in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative : Efficacy Results• Real-World Analyses of Patients With IBD Treated With Vedolizumab  Professor of MedicineDivision of Gastroenterology and HepatologyMayo ClinicRochester, Minnesota.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639187>Can we Improve the Prognostic Value of Phenotype at Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632373>Administration of  Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative  in Mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) develop as a result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota.

A review of the English literature over the last 15 years was performed using Embase and Medline. Search terms were ischaemic OR ischemic,  OR colon. Two reviewers screened the papers against pre-determined eligibility criteria. A senior consultant surgeon performed a final overview. Three hundred sixty-eight papers were identified on the initial search; 318 were irrelevant and 17 were conference abstracts; both were excluded. Thirty-three full articles were assessed for suitability; nine were further excluded. Twenty-four articles were included in the final analysis and cross-referenced against those listed in the systematic reviews. There is a large clinical heterogeneity in inclusion criteria (histological, radiological, endoscopic, surgical specimen). Twelve out of 24 articles included patients only based on histological diagnosis. The definition of right and left (or nonright) ischaemic  was variable based on whether hepatic or splenic flexure was used as the cut-off point. Five retrospective case series highlighted that patients with isolated right-sided ischaemic  had a worse prognosis than those with left-sided  (higher mortality, need for surgery, length of hospital stay).

This study was directed to explore the prophylactic effect of  fruit peel extract against irradiation-induced  in rats. GC/MS analysis of the petroleum ether extract led to recognition of 33 compounds in the unsaponifiable fraction and 15 fatty acid methyl esters in the saponifiable part. Thirteen terpenes and sterols were isolated and identified from which ten compounds were not isolated from any part of this species before. Data showed that irradiation induced colon injury as manifested by elevated contents of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nuclear factor kappa B, while it reduced superoxide dismutase activity and interleukin 10 content in colonic tissues, which was confirmed by histopathological examination. Pretreatment with  extract attenuated the alteration in the measured parameters. It could be concluded that  fruit peel extract can be regarded as a potential agent in limiting colonic complications due to irradiation, possibly by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636473>Sirtuin 1 alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent protein deacetylase that is involved in various diseases, including cancers, metabolic diseases, and inflammation-associated diseases. However, the role of SIRT1 in ulcerative  (UC) is still confusing.To investigate the role of SIRT1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in UC and further explore the underlying mechanisms.We developed a coculture model using macrophages and Caco-2 cells. After treatment with the SIRT1 activator SRT1720 or inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM), the expression of occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) was assessed by Western blot analysis. Annexin V-APC/7-AAD assays were performed to evaluate Caco-2 apoptosis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  mice were exposed to SRT1720 or NAM for 7 d. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were conducted to assess apoptosis in colon tissues. The expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12, caspase-9, and caspase-3 in Caco-2 cells and the colon tissues of treated mice were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot.SRT1720 treatment increased the protein levels of occludin and ZO-1 and inhibited Caco-2 apoptosis, whereas NAM administration caused the opposite effects. DSS-induced  mice treated with SRT1720 had a lower disease activity index ( < 0.01), histological score ( < 0.001), inflammatory cytokine levels ( < 0.01), and apoptotic cell rate ( < 0.01), while exposure to NAM caused the opposite effects. Moreover, SIRT1 activation reduced the expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, cleaved caspase-12, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 in Caco-2 cells and the colon tissues of treated mice.SIRT1 activation reduces apoptosis of IECs  the suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis-associated molecules CHOP and caspase-12.

Several stool neutrophil-related proteins are currently used as biomarkers for MH. However, the sensitivity and specificity are not sufficient to avoid unnecessary endoscopic evaluations.Novel serum neutrophil-related markers (neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 [NGAL-MMP-9 complex], cathelicidin LL-37 and chitinase 3-like 1 [CHI3L1]), together with C-reactive protein [CRP] and neutrophil counts were studied. Serum samples were obtained from 176 anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF]-treated UC patients (145 infliximab [IFX] and 31 adalimumab [ADM]) at baseline and after a median of 9.5 weeks. All patients had active disease prior to treatment (Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≥ 2), and MH was defined as MES ≤ 1. Serum was also obtained from 75 healthy controls. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to generate the Ulcerative  Response Index [UCRI]. The performance of individual markers and UCRI was tested with receiver operating characteristic analysis.All neutrophil-related markers were significantly higher in active UC patients compared to healthy controls. In the IFX cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly after treatment and all marker levels were significantly lower in healers compared to non-healers following IFX. In the ADM cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly only in healers. UCRI [including CRP, CHI3L1, neutrophil count and LL-37] accurately detected MH in both IFX-treated (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and ADM-treated [AUC = 0.79] patients.The new UCRI index accurately detects MH after treatment with IFX and ADM. This panel is useful for monitoring MH in UC patients under anti-TNF treatment.This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Natural products derived from plants that are rich in bioactive compounds are used by many patients with IBD. Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of 5 mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice.

For norverapamil, C and AUC were significantly greater (2.8 times and 2.5 times, respectively), and Cl was significantly lower (by 45%). But, pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and norverapamil after oral administration of 50 mg/kg were no significant differences between UC and normal rats.The better absorption and poor excretion for low-dose verapamil may be attributed to down-regulation of P-gp expression in the intestine and kidney. No significant differences of pharmacokinetic parameters for high-dose verapamil may be explained as the saturation of an efflux mechanism.The findings of this study suggested that in UC patients, doses of verapamil should be decreased when low-dose verapamil was orally administrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on  and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 8 (Lypd8), a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein selectively expressed on colonic enterocytes, promotes this segregation by inhibiting bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer and colonic epithelia. However, it remains unclear whether Lypd8 prevents infection with enteric bacterial pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Lypd8 strongly contributes to early-phase defense against Citrobacter rodentium, which causes  by inducing attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on colonic epithelia. Lypd8 inhibits C. rodentium attachment to intestinal epithelial cells by binding to intimin, thereby suppressing the interaction between intimin and translocated intimin receptor. Lypd8 deficiency leads to rapid C. rodentium colonization in the colon, resulting in severe  with Th17-cell and neutrophil expansion in the lamina propria.

Charts were reviewed to determine complications and pouch failure rates after index and redo IPAA. Long-term pouch survival and quality of life (QoL) were compared between index and redo IPAAs.There were 305 patients, 253 with an index IPAA and 52 having a redo IPAA. Their median ages were 33 years (index IPAA) and 32 years (redo IPAA) (p = 0.91); there were 47% and 53% men in each group, respectively (p = 0.54). Pouch salvage with redo IPAA was possible in 75% of redo pouches. Biologic agents were given in 8% of index IPAA and 34% redo IPAA patients (p < 0.01). Cumulative Kaplan Meier 5-year pouch survival was 80% vs. 60% in index and redo IPAA (p < 0.0001), at 10 years 74% vs. 38%, respectively (p < 0.0001). When queried, 78% who underwent redo pouch surgery would have it again and 86% would recommend this surgery to others.IPAA can be offered to selected patients with isolated colonic CD. Failure in this group of patients is related mainly to recurrent CD, not surgical complications.

However, its role in  and  associated colon cancer is still controversial. This study was designed to evaluate the role and mechanisms of inflammatory cytokines-activated-MSCs in mice  and colon cancer.We selected two well-characterized pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), to expand the inflammatory microenvironment of MSCs. The severity of  and colon cancer was evaluated by measuring colon length, Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Western Blot, Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence. These techniques were also performed to analyze the mechanisms of inflammatory cytokines-activated-MSCs in mice  and colon cancer. Real-time PCR and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were used to measure the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors.We found that the incubation of MSCs with TNF-α and IFN-γ aggravates , where high levels of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, were secreted. Furthermore, this phenomenon was associated with the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription three (STAT3) pathway. In addition, our study demonstrated that TNF-α and IFN-γ pretreated MSCs synergistically exacerbated mice colon cancer, which was closely associated with angiogenesis.Taken together, these results indicate that TNF-α and IFN-γ pretreatment effectively inhibited the repair ability of MSCs and accelerated inflammation and tumor progression involving NF-κB/STAT3 pathway and angiogenesis-related factors.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640889>Dasatinib-induced : a case report.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650683>Toll-like receptor 4 regulates spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis by up-regulating IL-6 and GM-CSF.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is as an important component of intestinal tumorigenesis. The activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling promotes inflammation in  of mice, but the role of TLR4 in intestinal tumorigenesis is not yet clear. About 80%-90% of colorectal tumours contain inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) tumour suppressor, and intestinal adenoma carcinogenesis in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is also closely related to the germline mutations in Apc. The Apc (multiple intestinal neoplasia) model mouse is a well-utilized model of FAP, an inherited form of intestinal cancer. In this study, Apc intestinal adenoma mice were generated on TLR4-sufficient and TLR4-deficient backgrounds to investigate the carcinogenic effect of TLR4 in mouse gut by comparing mice survival, peripheral blood cells, bone marrow haematopoietic precursor cells and numbers of polyps in the guts of Apc WT and Apc TLR4 mice. The results revealed that TLR4 had a critical role in promoting spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. Significant differential genes were screened out by the high-throughput RNA-Seq method. After combining these results with KEGG enrichment data, it was determined that TLR4 might promote intestinal tumorigenesis by activating cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in cancer signalling pathways. After a series of validation experiments for the concerned genes, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF (CSF2), IL11, CCL3, S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly decreased in gut tumours of Apc TLR4 mice compared with Apc WT mice. In the functional study of core down-regulation factors, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF, IL11, CCL3 and S100A8/9 increased the viability of colon cancer cell lines and decreased the apoptosis rate of colon cancer cells with irradiation and chemical treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to assess patients with UC-PSC or UC alone and describe differences in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and long-term clinical outcomes.This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of UC from 1962 through 2015. We evaluated clinical factors associated with UC-PSC vs UC alone and assessed associations by using multivariable logistic regression models.Among 522 patients with UC, 56 (10.7%) had PSC. Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], 2.35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal 5-aminosalicyte acid (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

The aim of this study was to determine the association with disease activity and intestinal permeability.Uc.261 level in colon mucosa and Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) were evaluated in 20 active CD patients. Uc.261 expression and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were determined in Caco2 and T84 cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. Body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological index (HI), intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran, uc.261, and tight junction proteins (TJPs) levels were evaluated in BALB/C mice treated with saline enema, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol enema, and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody injection, respectively.Uc.261 expression was overexpressed in CD patients, TNF-α treated cells, and  mice. Uc.261 expression was positively correlated with HBI ( = 0.582,  = 0.007) in CD patients, and positively correlated with TNF-α concentration and negatively correlated TEER in Caco2 and T84 cells (all  < 0.05). Furthermore, uc.261 was positively correlated with DAI ( = 0.824,  = 0.008), HI ( = 0.672,  = 0.021), and intestinal permeability ( = 0.636,  = 0.012), while negatively correlated with body weight ( = -0.574,  = 0.035), colon length ( = -0.866,  = 0.017), and TJP expression (all  < 0.05) in  mice.Uc.261 expression was closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in CD. Anti-TNF-α treatment may play its role through suppressing uc.261 expression in  mice.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660620>Up-regulated IL-17A Secretion and CCR6 Co-expression in Treg subsets are Related to the Imbalance of Treg/Th17 cells in Active UC patients.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterized with overactive immune response. It is well established that the imbalance between Tregs and Th17 cells play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of UC. In this study, we investigated the impact of functional changes in Treg subsets on Treg/Th17 ratio, and further explored their clinical significance in the activity of UC. Treg subsets were comprehensively analyzed using flow cytometry and in vitro cultured in both active and remission UC patients, of which nine active UC patients were further followed up. The correlation analyses were performed to explore the potential associations between Treg subsets and clinical indicators, as well as the impact of serum cytokines, detected by ELISA, on IL-17A secretion and CCR6 co-expression of Treg subsets. In active UC patients, we found CD45RA FoxP3 Tregs were obviously decreased and inversely correlated with disease activity, while CD45RA FoxP3 Tregs were increased and positively correlated with disease activity. Meanwhile, IL-17A secretion and CCR6 co-expression levels in Tregs were significantly increased in active UC. Moreover, Tregs co-expressing CCR6 possess higher level of IL-17A secretion. In nine followed-up patients, we observed down-regulated IL-17A secreting and CCR6 co-expression when achieving remission from active stage. In addition, IL-17A FoxP3 and IL-17A FoxP3 CCR6 Tregs were positively correlated with serum IL-21 and disease activity, respectively. These findings suggested that up-regulated IL-17A secretion and CCR6 co-expression in Treg subsets may be related to the imbalance between Treg and Th17 cells, and associated with the disease activity in UC patients.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640916>Long-term outcome of immunomodulator use in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>In the era where new biologicals are entering the market, the place of immunomodulators in the treatment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) needs to be reassessed.All children with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC) followed at our center over the last 10 years were reviewed. Children who received conventional therapy (including 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176 IBD patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [2.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.2% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up. Higher CRP [1.006 (1.001-1.011)], lower albumin [1.050 (1.012-1.086)] and growth impairment [1.214 (1.014-1.373)] in CD patients and higher PUCAI score [1.038 (1.006-1.072)] and low iron [1.023 (1.003-1.043)] in UC patients were associated with treatment failure (all p < 0.05).Only 32% pediatric IBD patients will remain free of biologics or surgery 5-years after diagnosis. Especially children with a high disease burden at diagnosis were more likely to fail conventional therapy.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p></html>
