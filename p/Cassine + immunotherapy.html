Beyond the effect on megakaryopoiesis, the drug also showed a stimulating effect on the hematopoietic stem cell with consistent clinical efficacy in aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Eltrombopag is highly effective in ITP and less so in AA and MDS. This observation underlines the importance of residual normal hematopoiesis, which is maximal in ITP, minimal/absent in AA, and dysregulated in MDS. In ITP, the drug at 50-75 mg daily induced up to 85% responses both in clinical trials and real-life studies, with the possibility of tapering and discontinuation. In AA, eltrombopag at 150 mg daily was effective in about 40% of cases relapsed/refractory to standard immunosuppression or ineligible for bone marrow transplant. In MDS, the drug seems less effective, with responses in about a quarter of patients at various schedules. The efficacy of eltrombopag in ITP, AA, and MDS suggests the existence of common immune-pathological mechanisms in these diseases, including autoimmunity against peripheral blood cells and bone marrow precursors, as well as a possible evolution of one condition into the other. Additional mechanisms of action emerging from the clinical use of eltrombopag include modulation of T-regulatory cells, restoration of Fc-γ receptor balance in phagocytes, and an iron-mobilizing effect. In this review, we analyzed the most recent literature on eltrombopag use and efficacy in patients with ITP, AA, and MDS, exploring the basis for different dosing, combined treatments, and discontinuation in each context.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238902>Dietary Therapy for Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Elimination and Reintroduction.</a></h2><p>Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a food antigen-mediated disorder of the esophagus characterized by eosinophil predominant inflammation and symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Dietary antigen elimination induces clinical and histological remission in patients with EoE. The most restrictive of elimination diets (the elemental diet) removes all possible food antigens while empiric elimination diets remove all (or a subset) of food antigens most commonly reported to cause esophageal eosinophilia and food allergies (milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, or legumes). Elimination diets are effective treatments for EoE but pose psychosocial and financial challenges to patients and consequently may impair quality of life. Foods that are commonly eliminated, especially milk, are also nutrient-dense and therefore their elimination may result in inadequate nutrient intake or deficiencies without careful diet planning to include nutritionally comparable and safe food substitutes. After remission is achieved with elimination diets, foods can be reintroduced sequentially to identify specific food triggers, but this reintroduction is not standardized. Food elimination and food reintroductions should consider the patient's lifestyle, nutrition needs, and skills and ideally be managed by a team with knowledge of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders and nutrition.</p></html>
