Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in FFAs accumulation and its modulation could drive the development of potential therapies for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of picroside II, a phytoactive found in , on fatty  accumulation vis-à-vis silibinin, a known hepatoprotective phytoactive from .HepG2 cells were loaded with FFAs (:palmitic /2:1) for 20 hours to mimic hepatic steatosis. The FFAs concentration achieving maximum fat accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity (500 μM) was standardized. HepG2 cells were exposed to the standardized FFAs concentration with and without picroside II pretreatment.Picroside II pretreatment inhibited FFAs-induced lipid accumulation by attenuating the expression of fatty  transport protein 5, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Preatreatment with picroside II was also found to decrease the expression of forkhead box protein O1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.These findings suggest that picroside II effectively attenuated fatty  accumulation by decreasing FFAs uptake and lipogenesis. Picroside II also decreased the expression of gluconeogenic genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123455>The Compound of Mangiferin-Berberine Salt Has Potent Activities in Modulating Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms in HepG2 Cells.</a></h1><p>The mangiferin-berberine (MB) salt was synthesized by ionic bonding of mangiferin (M) and berberine (B) at an equal molecular ratio. This study aimed to investigate the activities of MB salt in modulating lipid and glucose metabolisms in HepG2 cells. After 24 h treatment of the studying compounds, cellular AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) protein levels and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1 activities, intracellular lipid contents, mRNA expression levels of target genes, glucose consumption, and glucose production amounts were determined. Compound C (CC) was used in the blocking experiments. Our results showed that MB salt increased p-AMPKα (Thr172)/p-ACC (Ser79) levels and CPT1 activity and suppressed - (OA-) induced lipid accumulation and upregulation of lipogenic genes potently in HepG2 cells. The above activities of MB salt were AMPK dependent and were superior to those of M or B when administered at an equal molar concentration. MB salt enhanced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and suppressed  more potently than M or B alone. The inhibiting activity of MB salt on cellular  was AMPK dependent. Our results may support MB salt as a new kind of agent for the development of novel lipid or glucose-lowering drugs in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26794005>Pu-erh tea extract ameliorates high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and insulin resistance by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling in mice.</a></h1><p>Pu-erh tea, made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, possesses activities beneficial for human health, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-obesity properties.We investigated the effects of a pu-erh tea extract (PTE) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects.Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks, during which PTE was simultaneously administered in drinking water. Body weight, hepatic inflammation, steatosis, insulin sensitivity, expression of lipogenesis- and -associated genes, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation were examined. The anti-steatotic effects of PTE and/or interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated in HepG2 cells. The lipid accumulation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes were analyzed.PTE inhibited HFD-induced obesity and significantly attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and liver inflammation, and prevented against liver injury. PTE treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PTE treatment maintained the intact insulin signal and significantly decreased expression of -related genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. PTE treatment strikingly enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in the livers of HFD-fed mice. Consistent with this increase in STAT3 phosphorylation, pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with PTE enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and attenuated -induced steatosis in a STAT3-dependent manner. In contrast, PTE inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in macrophages.PTE ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance in mice with HFD-induced NASH, presumably by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26875874>The zinc cluster transcriptional regulator Asg1 transcriptionally coordinates oleate utilization and lipid accumulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>In this study, we characterize a new function for activator of stress response genes (Asg1) in fatty  utilization. Asg1 is required for full activation of genes in several pathways, including β-oxidation (POX1, FOX2, and POT1),  (PCK1), glyoxylate cycle (ICL1), triacylglycerol breakdown (TGL3), and peroxisomal transport (PXA1). In addition, the transcriptional activator Asg1 is found to be enriched on promoters of genes in β-oxidation and  pathways, suggesting that Asg1 is directly involved in the control of fatty  utilizing genes. In agreement, impaired growth on non-fermentable carbons such as fatty acids and oils and increased sensitivity to some oxidative agents are found for the Δasg1 strain. The lipid class profile of the Δasg1 cells grown in oleate displays approximately 3-fold increase in free fatty  (FFA) content in comparison to glucose-grown cells, which correlates with decreased expression of β-oxidation genes. The ∆asg1 strain grown in glucose also exhibits higher accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) during log phase, reaching levels typically observed in stationary phase cells. Altered TAG accumulation is partly due to the inability of the Δasg1 cells to efficiently break down TAGs, which is consistent with lowered expression of TGL3 gene, encoding triglycerol lipase. Overall, these results highlight a new role of the transcriptional regulator Asg1 in coordinating expression of genes involved in fatty  utilization and its role in regulating cellular lipid accumulation, thereby providing an attractive approach to increase FFAs and TAGs content for the production of lipid-derived biofuels and chemicals in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27311564>Modulation of  and lipid production in an engineered oleaginous Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformant.</a></h1><p>We previously created an oleaginous Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformant as a dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1p lacking 29 amino acids at the N-terminal (Dga1∆Np). Because we have already shown that dga1 disruption decreases the expression of ESA1, which encodes histone acetyltransferase, the present study was aimed at exploring how Esa1p was involved in lipid accumulation. We based our work on the previous observation that Esa1p acetylates and activates phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) encoded by PCK1, a rate-limiting enzyme in , and subsequently evaluated the activation of Pck1p by yeast growth with non-fermentable carbon sources, thus dependent on . This assay revealed that the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np had much lower growth in a glycerol-lactate (GL) medium than the wild-type strain overexpressing Dga1∆Np. Moreover, overexpression of Esa1p or Pck1p in mutants improved the growth, indicating that the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np had lower activities of Pck1p and  due to lower expression of ESA1. In vitro PEPCK assay showed the same trend in the culture of the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np with 10 % glucose medium, indicating that Pck1p-mediated  decreased in this oleaginous transformant under the lipid-accumulating conditions introduced by the glucose medium. The growth of the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np in the GL medium was also improved by overexpression of acetyl-CoA synthetase, Acs1p or Acs2p, indicating that supply of acetyl-CoA was crucial for Pck1p acetylation by Esa1p. In addition, the ∆dga1 mutant without Dga1∆Np also showed better growth in the GL medium, indicating that decreased lipid accumulation was enhancing Pck1p-mediated . Finally, we found that overexpression of Ole1p, a fatty  ∆9-desaturase, in the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np improved its growth in the GL medium. Although the exact mechanisms leading to the effects of Ole1p were not clearly defined, changes of palmitoleic and  contents appeared to be critical. This observation was supported by experiments using exogenous palmitoleic and  acids or overexpression of elongases. Our findings provide new insights on lipid accumulation mechanisms and metabolic engineering approaches for lipid production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27490779>Swertiamarin ameliorates  induced lipid accumulation and oxidative stress by attenuating  and lipogenesis in hepatic steatosis.</a></h1><p>Swertiamarin, a bitter secoiridoid glycoside, is an antidiabetic drug with lipid lowering activity meliorates insulin resistance in Type 2 Diabetes condition. Therefore, the study was designed to explore the antioxidant and hypolipidemic activity of swertiamarin in ameliorating NAFLD caused due to hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and insulin resistance. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells by supplementing 1mM  (OA) for 24h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipid droplets. This was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining and triglyceride accumulation. Swertiamarin (25μg/ml) decreased triglyceride content by 2 folds and effectively reduced LDH release (50%) activity by protecting membrane integrity thus, preventing apoptosis evidenced by reduced cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP1. We observed that swertiamarin significantly increased the expressions of major insulin signaling proteins like Insulin receptor (IR), PI(3)K, pAkt with concomitant reduction in p307 IRS-1. AMPK was activated by swertiamarin action, thus restoring insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes. In addition, qPCR results confirmed OA up-regulated Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP)-1c and fatty  synthase (FAS), resulting in increased fatty  synthesis. Swertiamarin effectively modulated PPAR-α, a major potential regulator of carbohydrate metabolism which, in turn, decreased the levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK, further restricting hepatic glucose production and fatty  synthesis. Cumulatively, swertiamarin targets potential metabolic regulators AMPK and PPAR-α, through which it regulates hepatic glycemic burden, fat accumulation, insulin resistance and ROS in hepatic steatosis which emphasizes clinical significance of swertiamarin in regulating metabolism and as a suitable candidate for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We previously found that administration of glycerol, a substrate for , transactivates G6Pase in the mouse liver. To clarify its cell-autonomous transcriptional activation in hepatocytes, we examined the mechanism of expression of the gene G6pc, which encodes G6Pase, in rat hepatoma cell line FAO cells. Endogenous G6pc expression in FAO cells was increased by glycerol administration as well as by the fatty  oleate. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that the ~2.0 kb mouse G6pc promoter contains the element(s) responsible for glycerol-stimulated G6pc transactivation. Using several deletion- or chimeric-constructs of G6pc promoter, we found that the DNA response element for hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) (-77/-65) in the G6pc promoter is essential for transactivation by glycerol. Similarly to glycerol, oleate also increased G6pc expression through its action on the HNF4α element (-77/-65). Furthermore, the reporter activities were higher in the cells co-treated with glycerol plus oleate than in those singly treated with glycerol or oleate. In addition, the temporal profiles of G6pc expression differed between glycerol and oleate administration. Our present results suggest that glycerol and oleate induce G6pc expression both via the HNF4αelement (-77/-65) and also through other regulatory mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880507>Metformin inhibits both -induced and CB1R receptor agonist-induced lipid accumulation in Hep3B cells: The preliminary report.</a></h1><p>Fatty liver is characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits  and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261661>Fc Gamma Receptor IIb Expressed in Hepatocytes Promotes Lipid Accumulation and .</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver, usually combined with hepatic insulin resistance. Fc-gamma receptor-IIb (FcγRIIb) and its ligand are reported to be associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As knowledge about FcγRIIb in the literature is mostly generated from studies on skeletal muscle tissue, the expression and function of FcγRIIb in the liver and hepatocytes are largely unknown. In this study, we identified the expression of FcγRIIb in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes: FcγRIIb was upregulated in response to  (OA) in a dose dependent manner. FcγRIIb knockdown using shRNA suppressed the lipid and triglyceride accumulation, and mRNA expression of , , , , and  in OA-treated HepG2 cells. FcγRIIb deficiency mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower liver weight and liver to body weight ratio, as well as less triglyceride accumulation in the livers. In glycometabolism, FcγRIIb hindered insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1, and in turn upregulated  and  mRNA expression, suggesting that FcγRIIb promotes  by suppressing the AKT/FOXO1// pathway in hepatocytes. This study reveals a novel role for FcγRIIb in regulating lipid metabolism and glycometabolism, and provides a new therapeutic target to improve NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128353>Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mediates lipogenesis and contributes to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive disease and poses a high risk of severe liver damage. However, the pathogenesis of NASH is still unclear. Accumulation of lipid droplets and insulin resistance is the hallmark of NASH. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) plays key role in glucose metabolism via regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, we demonstrated a novel of PDK4 in NASH by regulating hepatic steatosis and insulin signaling pathway in methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH model. Hepatic PDK4 levels were highly induced in human patients with NASH and MCD diet fed mice, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . The glucose and lipid metabolism were impaired in Pdk4 mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis significantly in NASH mice. Pdk4-MCD mice had reduced liver weights and triglyceride (TG) levels. And Pdk4 deficiency dramatically reduced the expression of genes related to fatty  uptake, synthesis and . In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-SAPK/JNK and diminished p-ERK, p-P38, p-Akt and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed. In conclusion, our data indicated that PDK4 potentially contributes to the hepatic steatosis in NASH via regulating several signaling pathway and PDK4 may be a new therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The only known functional fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) in Mtb is encoded by the glpX gene and belongs to the Class II sub-family of FBPase. We describe herein the generation of a ΔglpX strain using homologous recombination. Although the growth profile of ΔglpX is comparable to that of wild type Mtb when grown on the standard enrichment media, its growth is dysgonic with individual gluconeogenic substrates such as , glycerol and acetate. In mice lung CFU titers of ΔglpX were 2-3 log10 lower than the wild-type Mtb strain. The results indicate that glpX gene encodes a functional FBPase and is essential for both in vitro and in vivo growth and survival of Mtb. Loss of glpX results in significant reduction of FBPase activity but not complete abolition. These findings verify that the glpX encoded FBPase II in Mtb can be a potential target for drug discovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107687>MiR-150 deficiency ameliorated hepatosteatosis and insulin resistance in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via targeting CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) increased rapidly in the world. However, the pathogenesis of is still unclear. Hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance are considered to be central to the pathophysiology of NAFLD. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs and has been reported to be involved in pathogenesis of NAFLD and related metabolic diseases. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which miR-150 regulate hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in high fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD model. The expression of miR-150 was up-regulated dramatically in both human NAFLD patients and HFD mice model, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . miR-150 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance significantly in NAFLD mice. miR-150 deficiency decreased the expression of genes related to fatty  uptake, synthesis and , while increased the expression of genes related to fatty  β-oxidation. Further, we identified that CFLAR is a direct downstream target of miR-150. Overexpression of miR-150 reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of CFLAR in vitro. And overexpression of miR-150 significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of CFLAR 3'-UTR, while the effect of miR-150 was blocked when the binding site of miR-150 within the CFLAR 3'-UTR was mutated. We also found that miR-150 deficiency decreased the expression of p-Jnk1 and p-Ask1, while the effect of miR-150 on steatosis and insulin signaling was blocked by CFLAR overexpression. In conclusion, our data indicated that miR-150 potentially contributes to the hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD. miR-150/CFLAR pathway may be a new therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study was conducted to examine the therapeutic effect of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a naturally occurring curcuminoid and a metabolite of curcumin, on  (OA)-induced steatosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. HepG2 cells were incubated with OA to induce steatosis, and then treated with various concentrations of THC. The results showed that THC treatment significantly decreased lipid accumulation in OA-treated HepG2 cells, possibly, by inhibiting the expression of the lipogenic proteins, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS), and fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4). Moreover, THC attenuated OA-induced hepatic lipogenesis in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, which was reversed by pretreatment with an AMPK inhibitor. THC promoted lipolysis and upregulated the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation. Glucose uptake and insulin signaling impaired in HepG2 cells incubated with OA were abated by THC treatment, including phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and downstream signaling pathways, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which are involved in  and glycogen synthesis, respectively. Altogether, these results demonstrated the novel therapeutic benefit of THC against hepatic steatosis and, consequently, a potential treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018.

To present a system-level understanding of erythromycin stress and degradation, proteome, phospholipids and membrane potentials were investigated after the erythromycin degradation. Bacillus thuringiensis could effectively remove 77% and degrade 53% of 1 µM erythromycin within 24 h. The 36 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in spore germination, chaperone and nucleic  binding. Up-regulated ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase and ribosomal proteins confirmed that the synthesis of protein, DNA and RNA were enhanced after the erythromycin degradation. The reaction network of /gluconeogenesis was activated, whereas, the activity of spore germination was decreased. The increased synthesis of phospholipids, especially, palmitoleic  and , altered the membrane permeability for erythromycin transport. Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase and palmitoleic  could be biomarkers to reflect erythromycin exposure. Lipids, disease, pyruvate metabolism and citrate cycle in human cells could be the target pathways influenced by erythromycin. The findings presented novel insights to the interaction among erythromycin stress, protein interaction and metabolism network, and provided a useful protocol for investigating cellular metabolism responses under pollutant stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
