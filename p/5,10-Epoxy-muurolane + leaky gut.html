Supporting the translational significance of this, a meta-analysis showed that anti-inflammatory drugs may have antidepressant effects. Here, we argue that inflammation and depression research needs to get onto a new track. Firstly, the choice of inflammatory biomarkers in depression research was often too selective and did not consider the broader pathways. Secondly, although mild inflammatory responses are present in depression, other immune-related pathways cannot be disregarded as new drug targets, e.g., activation of cell-mediated immunity, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) pathways, autoimmune responses, bacterial translocation, and activation of the toll-like receptor and neuroprogressive pathways. Thirdly, anti-inflammatory treatments are sometimes used without full understanding of their effects on the broader pathways underpinning depression. Since many of the activated immune-inflammatory pathways in depression actually confer protection against an overzealous inflammatory response, targeting these pathways may result in unpredictable and unwanted results. Furthermore, this paper discusses the required improvements in research strategy, i.e., path and drug discovery processes, omics-based techniques, and systems biomedicine methodologies. Firstly, novel methods should be employed to examine the intracellular networks that control and modulate the immune, O&NS and neuroprogressive pathways using omics-based assays, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, immunoproteomics and metagenomics. Secondly, systems biomedicine analyses are essential to unravel the complex interactions between these cellular networks, pathways, and the multifactorial trigger factors and to delineate new drug targets in the cellular networks or pathways. Drug discovery processes should delineate new drugs targeting the intracellular networks and immune-related pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30213697>Food intolerance in patients with manifest autoimmunity. Observational study.</a></h2><p>In the professional medical and scientific world, there is not many interest in the correlation of food intolerance and autoimmune diseases. However there is a lot of evidence that e.g. gluten or gliadine can induce autoimmmune diseases: example the interest in coeliac disease and autoimmunity. There is however a lot of informationavailable about   and autoimmunity. We performed an observational study in our data base;, where we selected 100 patients with manifest autoimmune disease with clear symptoms and autoimmune antibodies in the form of positive anf more tehn 160 titer. These patients were compared with 25 control patients without any autoimmunity. We could clearly find a difference in food intolerance profiles when we compared AI patients with people without any AI. Overall there is a much greater reaction to several food epitopes, which can be observed on the level of specific antibodies tot he food epitopes. These igG levels for specific food antibodies are significantly higher in the patient group then in the control group. We can also see that some food epitopes provocate a very pronounced reaction, while other show no increased level of igG. Among the most reactive food epitopes are caseine, cow milk, wheat, gliadine, white of egg and rice. A variable reaction can bes een on nuts e.g.; walnuts and almonds. Almost no antibody reaction is noticed on vegetables, fish and meat products, who seem tob e immunologially very neutral. We conclude that food intolerance test is very important tool in patients with AI disease, and should be performed in each patient to tailor an individual diet program, which if properly followed, could relieve symptoms and probably stop or slow the the progression of the autoimmune disease. Also interesting for global research in AI disease is the fact that food is probably an important trigger for autoimmunity in vulnerable patients. More research on great scale and multicenter around this topic is mandatory and urgent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As there is limited literature on in vivo biomarkers to assess increased IP in chickens, the objective of this study was to identify a reliable biomarker of IP using DSS ingestion and fasting models. Male Ross chickens (n = 48) were reared until day 14 on the floor pen in an animal care facility, randomized into the following groups: control, DSS and fasting (each with n = 16), and then placed in metabolism cages. DSS was administered in drinking water at 0.75% from days 16 to 21, while controls and fasted groups received water. All birds had free access to feed and water except the birds in the fasting group that were denied feed for 19. h on day 20. On day 21, all chickens were given two separate oral gavages comprising fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d, 2.2 mg in 1 ml/bird) at time zero and lactulose, mannitol and rhamnose (LMR) sugars (0.25 g L, 0.05 g M and 0.05 g R in 2 ml/bird) at 60 min. Whole blood was collected from the brachial vein in a syringe 90 min post-LMR sugar gavage. Serum FITC-d and plasma LMR sugar concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry and high-performance ion chromatography respectively. Plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty acid binding protein, diamine oxidase, tight junction protein (TJP), d-lactate and faecal α-antitrypsin inhibitor concentration were also analysed by ELISA. FITC-d increased significantly (p < 0.05) after fasting compared with control. L/M and L/R ratios for fasting and L/M ratio for DSS increased compared with control chickens (p < 0.05). TJP in plasma was significantly increased due to fasting but not DSS treatment, compared with controls. Other tests did not indicate changes in IP (p > 0.05). We concluded that FITC-d and LMR sugar tests can be used in chickens to assess changes in IP.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060311>Role of  Microbiota in Hepatocarcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has a causal nexus with liver injury, inflammation, and regeneration that accumulates over decades. Observations from recent studies have accounted for the involvement of the -liver axis in the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for HCC. The human intestine nurtures a diversified colony of microorganisms residing in the host ecosystem. The intestinal barrier is critical for conserving the normal physiology of the  microbiome. Therefore, a rupture of this barrier or dysbiosis can cause the intestinal microbiome to serve as the main source of portal-vein endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide, in the progression of hepatic diseases. Indeed, increased bacterial translocation is a key sign of HCC. Considering the limited number of clinical studies on HCC with respect to the microbiome, we focus on clinical as well as animal studies involving the  microbiota, with the current understandings of the mechanism by which the intestinal dysbiosis promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. Future research might offer mechanistic insights into the specific phyla targeting the  , as well as microbial dysbiosis, and their metabolites, which represent key pathways that drive HCC-promoting microbiome-mediated liver inflammation and fibrosis, thereby restoring the  barrier function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26707044>Increased expression of activation antigens on CD8+ T lymphocytes in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: inverse associations with lowered CD19+ expression and CD4+/CD8+ ratio, but no associations with (auto)immune,  , oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers.</a></h2><p>There is now evidence that specific subgroups of patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) suffer from a neuro-psychiatric-immune disorder. This study was carried out to delineate the expression of the activation markers CD38 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR on CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes in ME/CFS.Proportions and absolute numbers of peripheral lymphocytes expressing CD3+, CD19+, CD4+, CD8+, CD38+ and HLA-DR+ were measured in ME/CFS (n=139), chronic fatigue (CF, n=65) and normal controls (n=40).The proportions of CD3+, CD8+, CD8+CD38+ and CD8+HLA-DR+ were significantly higher in ME/CFS patients than controls, while CD38+, CD8+CD38+, CD8+HLA-DR+ and CD38+HLA-DR+ were significantly higher in ME/CFS than CF. The percentage of CD19+ cells and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly lower in ME/CFS and CF than in controls. There were highly significant inverse correlations between the increased expression of CD38+, especially that of CD8+CD38+, and the lowered CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD19+ expression. There were no significant associations between the flow cytometric results and severity or duration of illness and peripheral blood biomarkers of oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS, i.e. IgM responses to O&N modified epitopes),   (IgM or IgA responses to LPS of  commensal bacteria), cytokines (interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α), neopterin, lysozyme and autoimmune responses to serotonin.The results support that a) increased CD38 and HLA-DR expression on CD8+ T cells are biomarkers of ME/CFS; b) increased CD38 antigen expression may contribute to suppression of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD19+ expression; c) there are different immune subgroups of ME/CFS patients, e.g. increased CD8+ activation marker expression versus inflammation or O&NS processes; and d) viral infections or reactivation may play a role in a some ME/CFS patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25847918> intestine and impaired microbiome in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence has demonstrated that intestinal homeostasis and the microbiome play essential roles in neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons and muscle atrophy. Currently, there is no effective treatment. Most patients die within 3- years due to respiratory paralysis. Although the death of motor neurons is a hallmark of ALS, other organs may also contribute to the disease progression. We examined the  of an ALS mouse model, G93A, which expresses mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G93A)), and discovered a damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability with a significant reduction in the expression levels of tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Furthermore, our data demonstrated increased numbers of abnormal Paneth cells in the intestine of G93A mice. Paneth cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells that can sense microbes and secrete antimicrobial peptides, thus playing key roles in host innate immune responses and shaping the  microbiome. A decreased level of the antimicrobial peptides defensin  alpha was indeed found in the ALS intestine. These changes were associated with a shifted profile of the intestinal microbiome, including reduced levels of Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens, Escherichia coli, and Fermicus, in G93A mice. The relative abundance of bacteria was shifted in G93A mice compared to wild-type mice. Principal coordinate analysis indicated a difference in fecal microbial communities between ALS and wild-type mice. Taken together, our study suggests a potential novel role of the intestinal epithelium and microbiome in the progression of ALS.© 2015 The Authors.

Women with RPL show higher prevalence of undiagnosed  disorders. Furthermore, in endometrial tissues of RPL women, higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Nalp-3 inflammasome has been observed. Aim of this study was to investigate whether an abnormal  permeability might occur in RPL women and allow passage into systemic circulation of pro-inflammatory molecules able to induce endometrial inflammation.70 women with idiopathic RPL and 30 healthy women were recruited at the Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Outpatient Unit of the Gemelli Hospital of Rome from March 2013 to February 2017. Enrolled women underwent Cr-ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid absorption test to evaluate intestinal permeability. Sera obtained from enrolled women were analysed for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by ELISA. Anxiety and depression state were evaluated by administering STAI-Y and Zung-SDS tests, respectively. Of all recruited individuals, 35 women with idiopathic RPL and 20 healthy controls accepted to undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. Endometrial lysates were investigated for inflammasome Nalp-3 by Western blot analysis, and caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 by ELISA, respectively.Higher prevalence of abnormal intestinal permeability (P < 0.0001), increased circulating levels of LPS (P < 0.05), anxiety (P < 0.05) and depression (P < 0.05) were observed in RLP women compared to controls. Endometrial expression of Nalp-3, caspase-1 and IL-1β was significantly increased in RPL group (P < 0.0001; P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). IL-18 endometrial levels were not found to be higher in RPL cases. Statistically significant association between higher intestinal permeability and abnormally increased expression of endometrial Nalp-3, was observed in RPL (P < 0.01). Furthermore, higher LPS serum levels, a bacterial-derived activator of Nalp-3 complex, was shown to be statistically associated to abnormal endometrial expression of Nalp-3 inflammasome (P < 0.01) in RPL women.In women with RLP,   might occur and allow passage into circulation of immune triggers, potentially able to elicit endometrial innate immune response and, thus, to contribute to miscarriage pathogenesis. Diagnosis and treatment of intestinal disorders underlying   might improve endometrial environment and pregnancy outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29034530>Gene expression and morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa associated with increased permeability induced by short-term fasting in chickens.</a></h2><p>Short-term fasting for 4. and 9 hr has been demonstrated to increase intestinal permeability (IP) in chickens. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 0, 4., 9 and 19. hr fasting on intestinal gene expression and villus-crypt architecture of enterocytes in jejunal and ileal samples. On day 38, Ross-308 male birds were fasted according to their group and then euthanised. Two separate intestinal sections (each 2 cm long, jejunum and ileum) were collected. One section was utilised for villus height and crypt depth measurements. The second section was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of tight junction proteins (TJP) including claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin, zonula occludens (ZO-1, ZO-2), junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) and E-cadherin. Additionally genes involved in enterocyte protection including glucagon-like peptide (GLP-2), heat-shock protein (HSP-70), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), toll-like receptors (TLR-4), mucin (MUC-2), cluster differentiation (CD-36) and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP-6) were also analysed. Normally distributed data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance ANOVA. Other data were analysed by non-parametric one-way ANOVA. Villus height and crypt depth were increased (p < .05) only in the ileum after fasting for 4. and 9 hr compared with non-fasting group. mRNA expression of claudin-3 was significantly reduced in the ileum of birds fasted for 9 and 19. hr, suggesting a role in IP modulation. However, all other TJP genes examined were not statistically different from control. Nevertheless, ileal FABP-6 of all fasted groups was significantly reduced, which could possibly be due to reduced bile acid production during fasting.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29708627>Effect of humic acids on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction model to induce intestinal permeability in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of humic acids (HA) on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction (FR) model to induce intestinal permeability in chickens. One-day-old male Cobb-Vantress broilers were randomly allocated to one of two groups (n = 25 chickens), with or without 0.2% of isolated HA from worm-compost, and placed in brooder batteries. Chicks had ad libitum access to water and feed for 14 days. Intestinal permeability was induced by 24 hr FR starting at 14 days. At 15 days of age, chickens in both groups were given an appropriate dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) by oral gavage. Intestine and liver samples were also collected to evaluate viscosity and bacterial translocation (BT), respectively. An increase (p < .05) in intestinal viscosity was observed in the experimental group consuming 0.2% of HA and was confirmed in a published in vitro digestion model that simulates the chemical and physical conditions of the crop, proventriculus and intestine of chickens. Furthermore, the treated group also showed a significant reduction in FITC-d, liver BT and ammonia in the manure. These results suggest that HA have a positive impact in intestinal integrity in chickens.© 2018 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328774>Performance, intestinal permeability, and gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in broiler chickens fed reduced protein diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, and glycine subjected to a   model.</a></h2><p>Changing dietary protein and amino acids may impact intestinal barrier function. Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed  dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; ) RP diet supplemented with  g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce  . Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2, Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

Mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) are found in liver, blood and intestinal mucosa and are a key component of antibacterial host defences. Their role in ALD is unknown.We analysed frequency, phenotype, transcriptional regulation and function of blood MAIT cells in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), alcohol-related cirrhosis (ARC) and healthy controls (HC). We also examined direct impact of ethanol, bacterial products from faecal extracts and antigenic hyperstimulation on MAIT cell functionality. Presence of MAIT cells in colon and liver was assessed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry/gene expression respectively.In ARC and SAH, blood MAIT cells were dramatically depleted, hyperactivated and displayed defective antibacterial cytokine/cytotoxic responses. These correlated with suppression of lineage-specific transcription factors and hyperexpression of homing receptors in the liver with intrahepatic preservation of MAIT cells in ALD. These alterations were stronger in SAH, where surrogate markers of bacterial infection and microbial translocation were higher than ARC. Ethanol exposure in vitro, in vivo alcohol withdrawal and treatment with  had no effect on MAIT cell frequencies, whereas exposure to faecal bacteria/antigens induced functional impairments comparable with blood MAIT cells from ALD and significant MAIT cell depletion, which was not observed in other T cell compartments.In ALD, the antibacterial potency of MAIT cells is compromised as a consequence of contact with microbial products and microbiota, suggesting that the ''  observed in ALD drives MAIT cell dysfunction and susceptibility to infection in these patients.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The mean Mini Mental State Examination score was 18. ± 7.7. Biomarkers of immune activation - serum neopterin and tryptophan breakdown - as well as  inflammation markers and microbiota composition in fecal specimens were analyzed in 18 patients before and after probiotic supplementation for 4 weeks.After treatment a decline of fecal zonulin concentrations and an increase in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii compared to baseline were observed. At the same time, serum kynurenine concentrations increased (p <0.05). Delta values (before - after) of neopterin and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratios (Kyn/Trp) correlated significantly (p <0.05).Results show that the supplementation of Alzheimer's disease patients with a multispecies probiotic influences  bacteria composition as well as tryptophan metabolism in serum. The correlation between Kyn/Trp and neopterin concentrations points to the activation of macrophages and/or dendritic cells.

In ulcerative colitis, diarrhea and antigen entry into the mucosa occurs. Claudin-2 is upregulated but data on other claudins are still limited or vary (e.g., claudin-1 and -4). Apart from that, tight junction changes contribute to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism, while protection against antigen entry disappears behind epithelial gross lesions (erosions) and apoptotic foci. Crohn's disease is additionally characterized by a claudin- and claudin-8 reduction which plays an active role in antigen uptake already before gross lesions appear. In microscopic colitis (MC), upregulation of claudin-2 expression is weak and a reduction in claudin-4 may be only passively involved, while sodium malabsorption represents the main diarrheal mechanism. However, claudin- is removed from MC tight junctions which may be an active trigger for inflammation through antigen uptake along the so-called   concept. In celiac disease, primary barrier defects are discussed in the context of candidate genes as PARD3 which regulate cell polarity and tight junctions. The loss of claudin- allows small antigens to invade, while the reductions in others like claudin-3 are rather passive events. Taken together, the specific role of single tight junction proteins for the onset and perpetuation of inflammation and the recovery from these diseases is far from being fully understood and is clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the background of the other tight junction components, the transport activity of the mucosa, and the presence of other barrier features like gross lesions, an orchestral interplay which is discussed in this article.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476152>The effect of recovery from heat stress on circulating bioenergetics and inflammatory biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) jeopardizes animal productivity and health. The intestinal barrier is sensitive to HS and heat-induced hyperpermeability plays a key role in its pathophysiology. However, the biology of recovery following HS is less understood. Thus, study objectives were to determine the temporal pattern of metabolic, inflammatory, and intestinal histological parameters during HS recovery. Female pigs (n = 32; 19. ± 0. kg BW) were sacrificed following exposure to 1 of 4 environmental treatments: 1) constant thermoneutral (TN) conditions (TNC; 24.2 ± 0.°C), 2) no TN recovery post HS (0D), 3) 3 d of TN recovery post HS (3D), and 4) 7 d of TN recovery post HS (7D). The HS protocol was cyclical (33.6 ± 1.8 to 37.4 ± 2.1°C) and lasted for 3 d for all HS treatments. During the 3 d of HS, rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rates were increased (1.3°C, 4.8°C, and 77 breaths/min, respectively; P < 0.01) and ADFI was decreased (27%; P < 0.01) compared to TNC pigs. Skin temperature tended to be decreased 0.6°C in 3D pigs during days 1-3 of recovery (P = 0.06) and was decreased 1.6 and 0.7°C during days 1-3 and 4-7 of recovery, respectively, in 7D pigs (P ≤ 0.03) compared to TNC. Relative to TNC pigs, ADFI remained 14% decreased during days 1-3 of recovery in both 3D and 7D pigs, and 17% decreased during days 4-7 in 7D pigs (P ≤ 0.01). Plasma glucose was decreased (10%; P = 0.03) for 0D and 3D relative to TNC pigs. Circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein was increased in 3D and 7D vs. TNC pigs (110 and 147%, respectively; P = 0.01) and tended to increase linearly with increasing recovery time (P = 0.08). Circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha was decreased (15%) in 0D pigs and increased linearly with advancing recovery time (P < 0.01). Jejunum and ileum villus height were reduced 17 and 11% in 0D vs. TNC pigs and increased linearly with progressive recovery time (P < 0.01). Jejunum and ileum mucosal surface areas were reduced 17 and 9% in 0D pigs and remained decreased in the jejunum while the ileum recovered to TNC levels by day 3 of recovery. Relative to TNC pigs, goblet cell area was similar in jejunum and colon of 0D pigs but was reduced in the ileum of 0D pigs and in jejunum, ileum, and colon of 3D and 7D relative to TNC pigs (P < 0.01). In summary, HS has deleterious effects on intestinal morphology that seem to improve with recovery time. In contrast, feed consumption remained suppressed and inflammatory biomarkers indicative of   increased following the heat load.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552634>In Schizophrenia, Increased Plasma IgM/IgA Responses to  Commensal Bacteria Are Associated with Negative Symptoms, Neurocognitive Impairments, and the Deficit Phenotype.</a></h2><p>Increased  permeability ( ) with increased translocation of Gram-negative bacteria plays a role in the -brain axis through effects on systemic immune-inflammatory processes. Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by an immune-inflammatory response combined with a deficit in natural IgM antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), which are a first-line defense against bacterial infections. This study measured plasma IgA/IgM responses to  Gram-negative bacteria in association with IgM responses to malondialdehyde (MDA) and azelaic acid in 80 schizophrenia patients (40 with the deficit syndrome and 40 without) and in 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly increased IgA responses to Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia. The presence of deficit schizophrenia was highly predicted by increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas putida and IgM responses to all five Gram-negative bacteria and lowered natural IgM to MDA and azelaic acid with a bootstrap area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.960 (2000 random curves). A large proportion of the variance (41.%) in the negative subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was explained by the regression on IgA responses to K. pneumoniae and IgM responses to the five enterobacteria coupled with lowered IgM antibodies to azelaic acid. There were significant associations between IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria and Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston naming test, Verbal Fluency, and Word List Memory test scores. These findings provide further evidence that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by an increased impact of Gram-negative commensal bacteria coupled with a deficit in natural IgM, pointing to aberrations in B1 cells. It is concluded that increased bacterial translocation and deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) may drive negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments, which are hallmarks of deficit schizophrenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600633>IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes, but not nitrosylated adducts, are significantly decreased in pregnancy: association with bacterial translocation, perinatal and lifetime major depression and the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway.</a></h2><p>Immunoglubulin (Ig)M responses directed to oxidative specific epitopes (OSEs) and nitric oxide (NO)-adducts are significantly associated with major depression and physio-somatic symptoms. End of term serum IgM responses to OSEs and NO-adducts were assayed in pregnant women with (n = 24) and without prenatal depression (n = 25) as well as in 24 non-pregnant women. Associations of IgM/IgA responses to Gram-negative  commensal bacteria (  index) and IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) were analyzed. IgM responses to OSEs, but not NO-adducts, were significantly reduced at the end of term. There were no significant associations between IgM responses to OSEs and perinatal depression, whilst IgM responses to NO-adducts, especially NO-cysteinyl, were significantly associated with a lifetime major depression. IgM responses to OSEs and NO-cysteinyl were significantly associated with IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria, especially Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter koseri. IgM responses to NO-adducts and OSEs, especially malondialdehyde and myristic acid, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were inversely associated with TRYCAT pathway activity, whilst a lifetime depression and Pseudomonas putida were positively associated. The attenuation of natural IgM-mediated responses to OSEs at the end of term may indicate lowered activity of this part of the compensatory (anti-)inflammatory reflex system and may be partly explained by lowered bacterial translocation. Increased IgM responses to NO-cysteinyl is a biomarker of lifetime depression and may be induced by bacterial translocation. Natural IgM-mediated autoimmune responses, increased nitrosylation and higher CRP levels may have negative regulatory effects on the TRYCAT pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256966>Effects of zinc amino acid complex on biomarkers of  integrity and metabolism during and following heat stress or feed restriction in pigs.</a></h2><p>Study objectives were to determine the effects of zinc (Zn) amino acid complex (Availa Zn, Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN) on metabolism, biomarkers of  , and inflammation during and following heat stress (HS) and nutrient restriction. Crossbred gilts (n = 50; 50 ± 2 kg BW) were blocked by initial BW and randomly assigned to one of five treatments: 1) thermoneutral (TN) and ad libitum fed a control diet (TNCtl), 2) TN and pair-fed a control diet (PFCtl), 3) TN and pair-fed a Zn-supplemented diet (PFZn), 4) HS and ad libitum fed a control diet (HSCtl), and ) HS and ad libitum fed a Zn-supplemented diet (HSZn). The study consisted of 3 experimental periods (P): during P1 (7 d), all pigs were fed their respective diets ad libitum and housed in TN conditions (20.84 ± 0.03 °C, 47.11 ± 0.42% relative humidity). During P2 (7 d), HSCtl and HSZn pigs were exposed to progressive cyclical HS conditions (27 to 30 °C, 41.9 ± 0.% relative humidity), while TNCtl, PFCtl, and PFZn pigs remained in TN conditions and were fed ad libitum or pair-fed to their respective HSCtl and HSZn counterparts. During P3 ( d; "recovery phase"), all pigs were housed in TN conditions and fed ad libitum. Pigs exposed to HS had overall increased rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rate (0.33 °C, 3.76 °C, and 27 bpm, respectively; P < 0.01). Relative to TN controls, HS decreased ADFI and ADG (28 and 35%, respectively; P < 0.05), but these variables were unaffected by dietary treatment. Additionally, circulating insulin did not differ between HS and TN pigs (P = 0.41), but was decreased in PF relative to TN pigs (P < 0.01). During recovery, no differences were observed in rectal temperature or respiration rate across treatments, but HSZn pigs had decreased skin temperature relative to TN, PF, and HSCtl pigs (P < 0.01). During P3, no Zn effects were observed in production parameters; however, PF pigs had increased ADFI and ADG relative to TN and HS treatments (P < 0.01). During P3, circulating insulin was increased in pigs that were HS relative to TN and PF pigs (75%, P < 0.05). Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels were decreased during P3 (P = 0.04) in Zn relative to Ctl-fed pigs. Circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein was not different among periods (P > 0.10). In summary, Zn reduced TNFα (regardless of HS), and the stimulatory effect of HS on insulin secretion is amplified during HS recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868181>Oral spore-based probiotic supplementation was associated with reduced incidence of post-prandial dietary endotoxin, triglycerides, and disease risk biomarkers.</a></h2><p>To determine if 30-d of oral spore-based probiotic supplementation could reduce dietary endotoxemia.Apparently healthy men and women ( = 75) were screened for post-prandial dietary endotoxemia.

Fecal dysbiosis, characterized by an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in autochthonous non-pathogenic bacteria, becomes prominent with the progression of liver cirrhosis. In cirrhotic patients, disruption of the intestinal barrier causes intestinal hyperpermeability (i.e.  ), which is closely related to  dysmotility, dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may induce pathological bacterial translocation. Although the involved microbial taxa are somewhat different between the cirrhotic patients from the East and the West, the common manifestation of a shortage of bacteria that contribute to the production of short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids may facilitate intestinal inflammation,   and  dysbiosis. Translocated endotoxin and bacterial DNA are capable of provoking potent inflammation and affecting the metabolic and hemodynamic systems, which may ultimately enhance the progression of liver cirrhosis and its various complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), variceal bleeding, infection and renal disturbances. Among studies on the microbiome-based therapeutics, findings of probiotic effects on HE have been contradictory in spite of several supportive results. However, the effects of synbiotics and prebiotics are substantially documented. The background of their effectiveness should be evaluated again in relation to the cirrhosis-related changes in  microbiome and their metabolic effects. Strict indications for the antibiotic rifaximin remain unestablished, although its effect is promising, improving HE and other complications with little influence on microbial populations. The final goal of microbiome-based therapeutics is to adjust the -liver axis to the maximal benefit of cirrhotic patients, with the aid of evolving metagenomic and metabolomic analyses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264758>Lipopolysaccharide responsiveness is an independent predictor of death in patients with chronic heart failure.</a></h2><p>The origin of pro-inflammatory activation in chronic heart failure (HF) remains a matter of debate. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may enter the blood stream through the morphologically altered and   barrier. We hypothesized that lower LPS reactivity would be associated with worse survival as compared to normal or higher LPS reactivity.LPS responsiveness was studied in 122 patients with chronic HF (mean±SD: age 67.3±10.3 years, 24 female, New York Heart Association class [NYHA] class: 2.±0.8, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]: 33.±12.%) and 27 control subjects of similar age (63.7±7.7 years, p>0.05). Reference LPS was added at increasing doses to ex vivo whole blood samples and necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was measured. Patients were subgrouped into good- and poor-responder status according to their potential to react to increasing doses of LPS (delta TNFα secretion). The optimal cut-off value was calculated by receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.A total of 56 patients with chronic HF died from any cause during follow-up. At 24 months, cumulative mortality was 16.4% (95% confidence interval 16.0-16.7%). The delta TNFα value representing the optimal cut-off for the prediction of mortality was 1522 pg/mL (24 months) with a sensitivity of 49.3% (95% confidence interval 37.2-61.4%) and specificity of 81.% (95% confidence interval 61.9-93.6%). LPS responder status remained an independent predictor of death after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio 0.09 for good- vs. poor-responders, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.67, p<0.05).LPS responsiveness in patients with chronic HF is an independent predictor of death.Copyright © 2015.

However, little is known about the factors contributing to altered  permeability in these diseases. Our objective was to determine the genetic determinants of altered  permeability as measured by the lactulose mannitol fractional excretion ratio (LacMan ratio) in 1075 healthy first-degree relatives of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). In a targeted analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes associated with intestinal barrier function related or not to inflammatory bowel disease, we did not find a significant association with intestinal permeability. In an untargeted genome-wide association analysis, the top 100 associations were located in 22 genomic loci, although they were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (raw P values [1.8 × 10-7 - 1.4 × 10-]. The lowest P value was obtained for rs9616637 (22q13.33, C22orf34), for which the minor allele A was associated with a decreased LacMan ratio. These results suggest that host genetic background has limited contribution toward intestinal permeability. Despite this, our study is currently the largest of its kind assessing  permeability in vivo. It remains possible that smaller genetic effect sizes on LacMan ratio are not detectable in this sized cohort.

The source of inflammation is unclear, although increased gastrointestinal permeability is a likely contributory factor. Whether a ""  leads to penetration of the systemic circulation by -derived pathogens is at least partly dependent on Kupffer cell function. These resident liver macrophages are an important part of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and there is evidence for Kupffer cell and reticuloendothelial dysfunction in chronic kidney disease. These observations are compatible with the inflammatory milieu of chronic kidney disease being of  origin. Measuring  permeability in chronic kidney disease is challenging. Use of fecal biomarkers and other novel serum biomarkers represent potential alternative tools. One such marker is (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan, a polysaccharide constituent of many fungal, bacterial, and plant cell walls; levels of (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan are elevated in hemodialysis patients. Gastrointestinal permeability and impaired removal by the RES may contribute to these high levels, suggesting potential importance as a biomarker. High levels of (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan also falsely elevate endotoxin measurements. Measuring the contribution of gastrointestinal permeability and RES dysfunction to systemic inflammation may be an important step in designing therapies to reduce systemic inflammation in chronic kidney disease.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077000>Breakdown of the Paracellular Tight and Adherens Junctions in the  and Blood Brain Barrier and Damage to the Vascular Barrier in Patients with Deficit Schizophrenia.</a></h2><p>Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by  intestinal tight and adherens junctions and bacterial translocation. Here we examine whether (deficit) schizophrenia is accompanied by  paracellular, transcellular, and vascular barriers in the  and blood-brain barriers. We measured IgA responses to occludin, claudin-, E-cadherin, and β-catenin (paracellular pathway, PARA); talin, actin, vinculin, and epithelial intermediate filament (transcellular pathway, TRANS); and plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP, vascular pathway) in 78 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. IgA responses to claudin-, E-cadherin, and β-catenin, the sum of the four PARA proteins, and the ratio PARA/TRANS were significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia patients than in nondeficit schizophrenia patients and controls. A large part of the variance in PHEMN (psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, and negative) symptoms, psychomotor retardation, formal thought disorders, verbal fluency, word list memory, word list recall, and executive functions was explained by the PARA/TRANS ratio coupled with plasma IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria, IgM to malondialdehyde, CCL-11 (eotaxin), IgA levels of the ratio of noxious to more protective tryptophan catabolites (NOX/PRO TRYCATs), and a plasma immune activation index. Moreover, IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria were significantly associated with IgA to E-cadherin, β-catenin, and PLVAP, while IgA levels to claudin- were significantly predicted by IgA to E-cadherin, NOX/PRO TRYCAT ratio, Gram-negative bacteria, and CCL11.

While alcohol ingestion can affect many organs and systems, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that alcohol ingestion can cause a ' ' syndrome which in turn contributes to infection and systemic organ dysfunction. This study investigated the acute effect of alcohol on  barrier function. Using an in vivo isolated  sac model of naïve male rats, each individual  sac was injected with different concentrations (0, , 10, 20, and 40%, v/v) of alcohol. After different times of alcohol exposure, each isolated  segment was harvested and intestinal permeability and mucosal surface hydrophobicity (a physiologic marker of mucus barrier function) were measured as well as luminal DNA, mucus, protein and free fatty acids. The results showed that alcohol caused dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in  permeability and decreases in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, with significant changes to be observed  min after treatment with 10% alcohol. In addition, it is further found that these changes in permeability and hydrophobicity are more closely associated with increased intestinal luminal free fatty acids levels but not protein or DNA levels. These results suggest that alcohol may cause loss of  barrier function by extracting and dissolving lipids from the mucus with a resultant decrease in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, which is a critical component of  barrier function.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The effectiveness of the available antidepressant therapies is limited. Data from the literature suggest that some subtypes of depression may be associated with chronic low grade inflammation. The uncovering of the role of intestinal microbiota in the development of the immune system and its bidirectional communication with the brain have led to growing interest on reciprocal interactions between inflammation, microbiota and depression. Our purpose is to review the state of knowledge on these interactions.We carried out a literature search on Pubmed, Go pubmed, psyC info, Elsevier, Embase until August 13, 2016 using the keywords "depression", "microbiota" and "inflammation".Dysbiosis reported in patients suffering from depression seems to contribute to low grade systemic inflammation which in turn feeds back depression. The hypothetical mechanisms behind these interactions are multiple:  , hyperreactivity of the corticotropic axis, disturbed neurotransmission. Abnormal microbial exposure during childhood and perinatal stress are reported to influence both the maturation of the immune system and the microbiota hence contributing to the ethiopathogeny of depression. There is no evidence in the literature to support a role for diet.The evidence supporting a causal relationship between dysbiosis and depression through low grade inflammation is limited and precludes us from drawing firm conclusions.

Two experiments were conducted in broilers to evaluate the effect of three concentrations of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1; 2, 1., or 1 ppm) on gastrointestinal leakage and liver bacterial translocation (BT). In experiment 1, 240 day-of-hatch male broilers were allocated in two groups, each group had six replicates of 20 chickens (n = 120/group): Control feed or feed + 2 ppm AFB1. In experiment 2, 240 day-of-hatch male broilers were allocated in three groups, each group had five replicates of 16 chickens (n = 80/group): Control feed; feed + 1 ppm AFB1; or feed + 1. ppm AFB1.

At day 21, all chicks received an oral gavage dose of FITC-d (4.16 mg/kg) 2. h before collecting blood samples to evaluate gastrointestinal leakage of FITC-d. In experiment 2, a hematologic analysis was also performed. Liver sections were aseptically collected and cultured using TSA plates to determine BT. Cecal contents were collected to determine total colony-forming units per gram of Gram-negative bacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), or anaerobes by plating on selective media. In experiment 2, liver, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius were removed to determine organ weight ratio, and also intestinal samples were obtained for morphometric analysis. Performance parameters, organ weight ratio, and morphometric measurements were significantly different between Control and AFB1 groups in both experiments.  leakage of FITC-d was not affected by the three concentrations of AFB1 evaluated (P > 0.05). Interestingly, a significant reduction in BT was observed in chickens that received 2 and 1 ppm AFB1.

Fourteen lactating Holstein cows (parity 2.6 ± 0.3; 117 ± 18 d in milk) were enrolled in 2 experimental periods. Period 1 ( d) served as the baseline for period 2 (7 d), during which cows received 1 of 2 i.v. treatments twice per day: sterile saline or a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI; 1. mg/kg of body weight). Gamma-secretase inhibitors reduce intestinal barrier function by inhibiting crypt cell differentiation into absorptive enterocytes. During period 2, control cows receiving sterile saline were pair-fed (PF) to the GSI-treated cows, and all cows were killed at the end of period 2. Administering GSI increased goblet cell area 218, 70, and 28% in jejunum, ileum, and colon, respectively. In the jejunum, GSI-treated cows had increased crypt depth and reduced villus height, villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, cell proliferation, and mucosal surface area. Plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein increased with time, and tended to be increased 42% in GSI-treated cows relative to PF controls on d  to 7. Circulating haptoglobin and serum amyloid A concentrations increased (585- and 4.4-fold, respectively) similarly in both treatments. Administering GSI progressively reduced dry matter intake (66%) and, by design, the pattern and magnitude of decreased nutrient intake was similar in PF controls. A similar progressive decrease (42%) in milk yield occurred in both treatments, but we observed no treatment effects on milk components. Cows treated with GSI tended to have increased plasma insulin (68%) and decreased circulating nonesterified fatty acids (29%) compared with PF cows. For both treatments, plasma glucose decreased with time while β-hydroxybutyrate progressively increased. Liver triglycerides increased 221% from period 1 to sacrifice in both treatments. No differences were detected in liver weight, liver moisture, or body weight change. Intentionally compromising intestinal barrier function caused inflammation, altered metabolism, and markedly reduced feed intake and milk yield.

All patients reduced their weight to a mean ± SD BMI of 36.4 ± .1 within 12 mo. We assessed barrier functions by the oral Lac:Man and the fecal zonulin tests. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostatic model assessment index (HOMA), and liver steatosis by sonography and the fatty liver index (FLI).The Lac:Man ratio and circulating interleukin (IL) 6 concentration decreased during intervention from 0.080 (95% CI: 0.073, 0.093) to 0.027 (95% CI: 0.024, 0.034; P < 0.001) and from 4.2 ± 1.4 to 2.8 ± 1.6 pg/mL (P < 0.01), respectively. At study start, the Lac:Man ratio was higher in patients with moderate or severe steatosis than in those without any steatosis (P < 0.001). The Lac:Man ratio tended to correlate with HOMA (ρ = 0.55, P = 0.052), which correlated with FLI (ρ = 0.75, P < 0.01). A multiple-regression analysis led to a final model explaining FLI best through BMI, waist circumference, and the Lac:Man ratio.Intestinal permeability is increased in obese patients with steatosis compared with obese patients without.

We investigated whether impaired intestinal permeability contributes to these symptoms.We performed a prospective study of intestinal permeability, measured by endoscopic confocal laser endomicroscopy in 110 consecutive subjects (31 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 57 with Crohn's disease [CD], and 22 healthy individuals [controls]) in Sydney, Australia from May 2009 and September 2015. Symptomatic CD was defined by a CD Activity Index score of 150 or more and symptomatic UC by a partial Mayo score of 2 or more. Mucosal healing was defined as CD Endoscopic Index of Severity of 0 in CD or Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0-1 for patients with UC. Intestinal permeability was quantified by the Confocal Leak Score (CLS; range: 0=no impaired permeability to 100=complete loss of barrier function). The primary endpoint was intestinal permeability in patients with symptomatic IBD in mucosal healing vs patients with asymptomatic IBD in mucosal healing. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of CLS in determining symptoms based on receiver operating characteristic analysis.Ongoing bowel symptoms were present in 16.3% of patients with IBD and mucosal healing (15.4% of patients with CD, 17.4% with UC). Patients with symptomatic IBD had a significantly higher median CLS (19.0) than patients with asymptomatic IBD (7.3; P < .001) or controls (.9, P < .001). There were no significant differences between patients with IBD in remission vs controls (P = .261). Median CLS was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic CD (17.7 vs 8.1; P = .009) and patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic UC (22.2 vs 6.9; P = .021). A CLS of 13.1 or more identified ongoing bowel symptoms in patients with IBD and mucosal healing with 95.2% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity; the receiver operating characteristic area under curve value was 0.88. Based on this cutoff, 36.2% of patients with IBD in mucosal healing have increased intestinal permeability. On regression analysis, every increase in CLS of 1.9 correlated with an additional diarrheal motion per day (P = .008).In a prospective study of intestinal permeability in patients with IBD and mucosal healing, we associated impaired intestinal permeability with ongoing bowel symptoms; increases in permeability correlated with increased severity of diarrhea.

Immunosuppressants used in treatment put patients at a higher risk of infections. New knowledge of disease modulators, such as symbiotic bacteria, can enable fine-tuning of parts of the immune system, rather than suppressing it altogether.Dysbiosis of  microbiota promotes autoimmune disorders that damage extraintestinal organs. Here we report a role of  microbiota in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction in lupus. Using a classical model of lupus nephritis, MRL/lpr, we found a marked depletion of Lactobacillales in the  microbiota. Increasing Lactobacillales in the  improved renal function of these mice and prolonged their survival. We used a mixture of  Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus gasseri), but L. reuteri and an uncultured Lactobacillus sp. accounted for most of the observed effects. Further studies revealed that MRL/lpr mice possessed a "" , which was reversed by increased Lactobacillus colonization. Lactobacillus treatment contributed to an anti-inflammatory environment by decreasing IL-6 and increasing IL-10 production in the . In the circulation, Lactobacillus treatment increased IL-10 and decreased IgG2a that is considered to be a major immune deposit in the kidney of MRL/lpr mice. Inside the kidney, Lactobacillus treatment also skewed the Treg-Th17 balance towards a Treg phenotype. These beneficial effects were present in female and castrated male mice, but not in intact males, suggesting that the  microbiota controls lupus nephritis in a sex hormone-dependent manner.This work demonstrates essential mechanisms on how changes of the  microbiota regulate lupus-associated immune responses in mice.

Interestingly, functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases are often reported as a comorbidity in ASDs, indicating -brain axis as a novel emerging approach. Recently, a central role for peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α has been addressed in neurological functions, associated with the behaviour. Among endogenous lipids, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a PPAR-α agonist, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory effects both at central and peripheral level. Based on this background, the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of PEA on autistic-like behaviour of BTBR T+tf/J mice and to shed light on the contributing mechanisms. Our results showed that PEA reverted the altered behavioural phenotype of BTBR mice, and this effect was contingent to PPAR-α activation. Moreover, PEA was able to restore hippocampal BDNF signalling pathway, and improve mitochondrial dysfunction, both pathological aspects, known to be consistently associated with ASDs. Furthermore, PEA reduced the overall inflammatory state of BTBR mice, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at hippocampal, serum, and colonic level.

This finding together with PEA effect on  microbiota composition suggests an involvement of microbiota--brain axis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated a therapeutic potential of PEA in limiting ASD symptoms, through its pleiotropic mechanism of action, supporting neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, and the modulation of -brain axis.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Results of an uncontrolled observational study with 1,020 patients].</a></h2><p>Patients with migraine often also suffer from gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. All these diseases share increased intestinal permeability (" ") and thus increased inflammatory activity. There is an increase in proinflammatoric cytokines in the serum, which in turn can trigger migraine attacks. Probiotics can have a positive effect on the intestinal epithelium and reduce inflammatory activity. A first uncontrolled, small study of 39 migraineurs showed a decrease in the rate of attacks under the daily intake of a probiotic.In an uncontrolled observational study, the influence of a specially formulated multispecies probiotic on the frequency of migraine attacks and the intensity of migraine-associated complaints was recorded. The self-assessment of 1,020 patients was evaluated.Over the treatment period of 8 weeks, the number of headache days was reduced from 2 to 1.4 days per week. The headache intensity decreased from .1 to 2.1 points (0 = not present to 6 = very intensive). The migraine-associated complaints were reduced and the use of painkillers halved. All results were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001).It can be suggested that this multispecies probiotic formulation has a positive influence on intensity and frequency of migraine attacks. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are required for further confirmation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26207424>The Role of miR-212 and iNOS in Alcohol-Induced Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction and Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Alcoholic liver disease is commonly associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction. Alcohol-induced dysregulation of intestinal tight junction proteins, such as Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), plays an important role in alcohol-induced  leakiness. However, the mechanism of alcohol-induced disruption of tight junction proteins is not well established. The goal of this study was to elucidate this mechanism by studying the role of microRNA 212 (miR-212) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in alcohol-induced  leakiness.The permeability of the Caco-2 monolayer was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance and flux of fluorescein sulfonic acid. miR-212 was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The wild-type, iNOS knockout, and miR-212 knockdown mice were fed with alcohol diet (29% of total calories, 4.% v/v) for 8 weeks. The LNA-anti-miR-212 was used to inhibit miR-212 expression in mice. The alcohol-induced intestinal permeability, miR-212 expression, and liver injuries in mice were measured.Our in vitro monolayer and in vivo mice studies showed that: (i) alcohol-induced overexpression of the intestinal miR-212 and intestinal hyperpermeability is prevented using miR-212 knockdown techniques; and (ii) iNOS is up-regulated in the intestine by alcohol and that iNOS signaling is required for alcohol-induced miR-212 overexpression, ZO-1 disruption,  leakiness, and steatohepatitis.These studies thus support a novel miR-212 mechanism for alcohol-induced  leakiness and a potential target that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention to prevent   and liver injury in alcoholics.Copyright © 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25869282>The effects of the multispecies probiotic mixture Ecologic®Barrier on migraine: results of an open-label pilot study.</a></h2><p>Migraine prevalence is associated with gastrointestinal disorders. Possible underlying mechanisms could be increased  permeability and inflammation. Probiotics may decrease intestinal permeability as well as inflammation, and therefore may reduce the frequency and/or intensity of migraine attacks. Therefore we assessed feasibility, possible clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions of probiotic treatment in migraine patients. 29 migraine patients took 2 g/d of a probiotic food supplement (Ecologic(®)Barrier, 2.×10(9) cfu/g) during 12 weeks. Participants recorded frequency and intensity of migraine in a headache diary and completed the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Compliance was measured every 4 weeks by counting the remaining sachets with probiotics. The study was completed by 27/29 (93%) patients who took 95% of the supplements. Obstipation was reported by 4 patients during the first 2 weeks of treatment only. The mean±standard deviation (SD) number of migraine days/month decreased significantly from 6.7±2.4 at baseline to .1±2.2 (P=0.008) in week -8 and .2±2.4 in week 9-12 (P=0.001). The mean±SD intensity of migraine decreased significantly from 6.3±1. at baseline to .±1.9 after treatment (P=0.005). The MIDAS score improved from 24.8±25. to 16.6±13. (P=0.031). However, the mean HDI did not change significantly. In conclusion, probiotics may decrease migraine supporting a possible role for the intestine in migraine management.

Patients present with diarrhea and immune responses lead to complications like arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. Although studies exist in animal and cell models, we aimed at a functional and structural characterization of intestinal dysfunction and the involved regulatory mechanisms in human colon. First, in patients' colonic biopsies, sodium malabsorption was identified as an important diarrheal mechanism resulting from hampered epithelial ion transport via impaired epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) β- and γ-subunit. In addition, barrier dysfunction from disrupted epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1, -3, -4, -, and -8), epithelial apoptosis, and appearance of lesions was detected, which cause leak-flux diarrhea and can perpetuate immune responses. Importantly, these effects in human biopsies either represent direct action of Campylobacter jejuni (ENaC impairment) or are caused by proinflammatory signaling (barrier dysfunction). This was revealed by regulator analysis from RNA-sequencing (cytometric bead array-checked) and confirmed in cell models, which identified interferon-γ, TNFα, IL-13, and IL-1β. Finally, bioinformatics' predictions yielded additional information on protective influences like vitamin D, which was confirmed in cell models. Thus, these are candidates for intervention strategies against C. jejuni infection and post-infectious sequelae, which result from the permissive barrier defect along the  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26191211>Abnormal intestinal permeability and microbiota in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic, progressive, and immunologically mediated inflammatory liver disorder. The etiology of AIH still remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and intestinal microbiome in patients with AIH and to evaluate the correlations of those changes with the stages of the disease.24 patients with autoimmune hepatitis and 8 healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. We assessed (1) the integrity of tight junctions within the  by immunohistochemical analysis of zona occludens-1 and occludin expression in duodenal biopsy specimens; (2) changes in the enteric microbiome by 16S rDNA quantitative PCR; and (3) the presence of bacterial translocation by the level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using ELISA.Increased intestinal permeability, derangement of the microbiome and bacterial translocation occurred in AIH, which correlated with the severity of the disease.Autoimmune hepatitis is associated with   and intestinal microbiome dysbiosis.

Here, an overview of the associations between migraine and GI disorders is presented, as well as possible mechanistic links and clinical implications. People who regularly experience GI symptoms have a higher prevalence of headaches, with a stronger association with increasing headache frequency. Children with a mother with a history of migraine are more likely to have infantile colic. Children with migraine are more likely to have experienced infantile colic compared to controls. Several studies demonstrated significant associations between migraine and celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IBS. Possible underlying mechanisms of migraine and GI diseases could be increased  permeability and inflammation. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to investigate these mechanisms further in migraine patients. These mechanisms also give a rationale to investigate the effects of the use of pre- and probiotics in migraine patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085297>Sodium butyrate ameliorates insulin resistance and renal failure in CKD rats by modulating intestinal permeability and mucin expression.</a></h2><p>The associated increase in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has shifted the way we focus on intestinal microbiota. This study shows that a disruption of the intestinal barrier in CKD promotes leakage of LPS from the , subsequently decreasing insulin sensitivity. Butyrate treatment improved the intestinal barrier function by increasing colonic mucin and tight junction (TJ) proteins. This modulation further ameliorated metabolic functions such as insulin intolerance and improved renal function.Renal failure was induced by /6th nephrectomy (Nx) in rats. A group of Nx and control rats received sodium butyrate in drinking water. The Nx groups were compared with sham-operated controls.The Nx rats had significant increases in serum creatinine, urea and proteinuria. These animals had impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and increased gluconeogenesis, which corresponded with decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. The Nx animals suffered significant loss of intestinal TJ proteins, colonic mucin and mucin 2 protein. This was associated with a significant increase in circulating LPS, suggesting a   phenomenon. 'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, known to modulate epithelial TJs and glucose metabolism, was significantly reduced in the intestine of the Nx group. Anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10, anti-bacterial peptide and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide were also lowered in the Nx cohort. Butyrate treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation, improved renal function and controlled hyperglycemia.Butyrate improves AMPK phosphorylation, increases GLP-1 secretion and promotes colonic mucin and TJ proteins, which strengthen the  wall. This decreases LPS leakage and inflammation. Taken together, butyrate improves metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and markers of renal failure in CKD animals.© The Author(s) 2018.

The realization that most stunting cannot be explained by poor diet or by diarrhoea, nor completely reversed by optimized diet and reduced diarrhoea has led to the hypothesis that a primary underlying cause of stunting is subclinical  disease. Essentially, ingested microbes set in motion two overlapping and interacting pathways that result in linear growth impairment. Firstly, partial villous atrophy results in a reduced absorptive surface area and loss of digestive enzymes. This in turn results in maldigestion and malabsorption of much needed nutrients. Secondly, microbes and their products make the  , allowing luminal contents to translocate into systemic circulation. This creates a condition of chronic immune activation, which (i) diverts nutrient resources towards the metabolically expensive business of infection fighting rather than growth; (ii) suppresses the growth hormone-IGF axis and inhibits bone growth, leading to growth impairment; and (iii) causes further damage to the intestinal mucosa thereby exacerbating the problem. As such, the unhygienic environments in which infants and young children live and grow must contribute to, if not be the overriding cause of, this environmental enteric dysfunction. We suggest that a package of baby-WASH interventions (sanitation and water improvement, handwashing with soap, ensuring a clean play and infant feeding environment and food hygiene) that interrupt specific pathways through which feco-oral transmission occurs in the first two years of a child's life may be central to global stunting reduction efforts.© 2016 The Authors.

Disaccharidase activity, intestinal inflammation, and permeability were analyzed in 61 children with autism and 50 nonautistic individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms.All patients had duodenal biopsies assayed for lactase, sucrase, maltase, and palatinase activity. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by rhamnose/lactulose test and measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Intestinal inflammation was evaluated by fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and histology.Some children with autism had mild levels of mucosal inflammation on intestinal biopsy. Disaccharidase activity was not different in autistic and nonautistic individuals. Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin were similar in both groups. Differences between lactulose and rhamnose recovery and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in urine were not statistically different in patients with and without autism.The present study supports the observation that children with autism who have symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders have objective findings similar to children without autism. Neither noninvasive testing nor endoscopic findings identify gastrointestinal pathology specific to autism, but may be of benefit in identifying children with autism who have atypical symptoms.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25877409>Poultry enteric inflammation model with dextran sodium sulfate mediated chemical induction and feed restriction in broilers.</a></h2><p> inflammation is a cardinal event occurring in various gastrointestinal diseases regardless of etiology. A potential mechanism of action for antibiotic growth promoters and probiotics is alleviation or attenuation of such inflammation. In vivo inflammation models and markers to quantify changes in inflammation, such as paracellular leakage and tight junction function, are necessary tools in the search for methods to reduce enteric inflammation. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and feed restriction (FRS), and fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d; 3 to  kDa) marker were evaluated for induction and assessment of enteric inflammation in broilers. Three independent experiments were conducted where birds received an inflammation inducer treatment and an oral gavage of FITC-d (2.2 mg/bird) 2. h before killing on d 4, followed by measurement of serum FITC-d levels and release of FITC-d from different regions of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to evaluate tight junction function. Experiment 1 tested control (CON) and DSS; Experiments 2 and 3 evaluated CON, DSS, and FRS. In all experiments DSS, as well as FRS in Experiments 2 and 3, showed higher (P<0.05) leakage of FITC-d into serum than CON, but FRS was not different from DSS. The amount of FITC-d retained in duodenal and cecal tissue was affected (P<0.05) by FRS in Experiments 2 and 3, and DSS affected FITC-d retention in duodenum only, suggesting differences in  passage or absorption/adsorption. In conclusion, DSS oral gavage and FRS could induce  , with changes in serum FITC-d and migration of FITC-d from GIT.© 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29939312>Intestinal barrier disruption and dysregulated mucosal immunity contribute to kidney fibrosis in chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is associated with diverse pathological processes. In this study we demonstrated intestinal barrier disruption and aberrant mucosal immunity in /6 nephrectomized mice and the effect of probiotics on chronic kidney disease (CKD).CKD was induced in 6-week-old mice by /6 nephrectomy. They were fed a lactobacilli mixture for 8 weeks.

Although the percentage of regulatory T cells did not differ between CKD and control mice, cytokine expression and the ratio of CX3CR1intermediate:CX3CR1high pro-inflammatory/resident macrophages increased in the colon of CKD mice. Orally administered lactobacilli partially mitigated the CKD-induced ' '; restored colon epithelial HSP70, claudin-1 and claudin-2 expression and decreased apoptosis. Probiotic treatment also restored the CX3CR1intermediate:CX3CR1high macrophage ratio and increased circular dichroism (CD)103+CD11c+ regulatory dendritic cells in the colon. These changes suppressed systemic inflammation and kidney fibrosis.Our results suggest that intestinal dysbiosis-associated  barrier disruption and aberrant mucosal immunity are important for the systemic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of CKD.

Alcohol and smoking contribute to changes in the stomach and affect H pylori-related disorders including the risk of gastric cancer. In the small intestine and in the colon alcohol causes depletion of bacteria with anti-inflammatory activity, eventually resulting in intestinal damage with " ". These changes contribute to hepatic damage in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and have been associated with other disorders. Lactobacillus GG and A. muciniphila exert a protective effect in this setting. Smoking leads to modifications of the  microbiome linked with a protective effect toward ulcerative colitis and deleterious for Crohn's disease. The exact cause-effect relation between alcohol and smoking and changes of the gastrointestinal microbiome needs further exploration with high throughput methodologies, and controlled studies are necessary to define the role of microbiome modulation on the immune response and systemic activation of pro-inflammatory pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
