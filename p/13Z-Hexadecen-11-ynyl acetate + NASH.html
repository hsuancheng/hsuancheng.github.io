Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) aggravates inflammation in the pathogenesis of allergic reactions, such as allergic rhinitis (AR). To confirm an active compound of BS, we investigated the effect of sulfur, a compound of BS, on the levels of TSLP in a human mast cell line, HMC-1 cells and a mouse model of AR using hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor, sodium hydrosulfide (). We treated  or BS in HMC-1 cells and activated the HMC-1 cells with phorbol myristate  and calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI). ELISA for the production measurement of TSLP, PCR for the mRNA expression measurement of TSLP, and western blot analysis for the expression measurement of upstream mediators were performed. Mice were treated with  and sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). The levels of TSLP were measured in serum and nasal mucosa tissue in an OVA-induced AR mouse model.  or BS diminished the production and mRNA expression of TSLP as well as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the PMACI-activated HMC-1 cells.  or BS diminished the level of intracellular calcium in the PMACI-activated HMC-1 cells.  or BS reduced the expression and activity of caspase-1 in the PMACI-activated HMC-1 cells. And  or BS inhibited the expression of receptor interacting protein-2 and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the PMACI-activated HMC-1 cells. The translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus as well as the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in the cytoplasm were diminished by  or BS in the PMACI-activated HMC-1 cells. Furthermore,  inhibited the production of TSLP, IL-6, and IL-8 in TNF-α-activated HMC-1 cells. Finally, the administration of  showed a decrease in number of rubs on mice with OVA-induced AR. And the levels of immunoglobulin E and TSLP in the serum and the level of TSLP in the nasal mucosa tissue of the OVA-induced AR mice were reduced by . In conclusion, these findings show that H2S, as an active compound of BS is a potential agent to cure allergic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900399>The effect of synbiotics  and milk oligosaccharides on shaping gut microbiota community structure and  treatment.</a></h2><p>Probiotic  subspecies  () consumes human milk oligosaccharides (MO) and protects intestinal permeability thereby having anti-inflammatory effects (Underwood et al., 2015; Bode, 2006; Asakuma et al., 2011) [1-3]. Via the gut-liver axis, gut barrier disruption and dysbiosis lead to hepatic inflammation (Sheng et al., 2017; Jena et al., 2017) [4,5,6]. Our published data revealed that butyrate, as well as synbiotics of  in combination with MO, had protective effects against cancer-prone non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () mouse models, i.e., Western diet (WD)-fed bile acid receptor FXR (farnesoid x receptor) knockout (KO) mice (Jena et al., 2018) [6,7]. In addition, MO was particularly effective in increasing the blooming of butyrate-generating bacteria (Jena et al., 2018) [7]. In the present study, we further showed that the reduced ileal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) signaling found in WD-fed FXR KO mice could be reversed by  and/or MO treatment. Moreover, ileal mRNA levels of SCFA receptors i.e.  (),  (), and  () were increased in  and/or MO-treated mice suggesting increased SCFA signaling (Fig. 1). Further, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data revealed that MO and is plus MO increased intestinal , propionate, butyrate, and valerate levels (Fig. 2). In addition,  and/or MO reduced the abundance of genus  and the relative copy number of bacterial genes including dissimilatory sulfite reductase () and methyl coenzyme M reductase A (), which were all increased in cancer-prone FXR KO mice (Fig. 3).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883724>Alisol A 24- ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis by inhibiting oxidative stress and stimulating autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway.</a></h2><p>Alisol A 24- (AA), a natural triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Rhizoma Alismatis, has various therapeutic effects. We investigated the anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () effect of AA and its underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks to induce . The mice were simultaneously treated with a daily dose of AA (15, 30, and 60 mg kg, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, the animals were sacrificed and plasma and liver tissue were collected. Serum and liver tissue biochemical analyses and histological observation were performed. The human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 was used to build  models by culturing with conditioned medium from WRL-68 liver cells after exposure to MCD medium in vitro. Liver oxidative stress and inflammatory indices and autophagy markers were examined. The results showed that AA suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation in a  mouse model and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines and ROS in LX-2 cells in MCD medium. Furthermore, we found AA stimulated autophagy in mice liver and LX-2, which could be the underlying mechanism of AA in . To further investigate the role of autophagy in LX-2 cells, we found that AA regulated autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway and dorsomorphin, a selective AMPK inhibitor, led to the suppression of AA-induced autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that AA could be a possible therapy for  by inhibiting oxidative stress and stimulating autophagy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results for the viscoelastic properties of O/W emulsions that are stabilised with partially hydrolysed poly(vinyl ) that is commonly referred to as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with 4% vinyl  are given. The effect of the oil volume fraction, addition of electrolytes and increasing temperature is described. This allows one to obtain various parameters such as the adsorbed layer thickness, the critical flocculation concentration of electrolyte (CFC) and critical flocculation temperature (CFT) at constant electrolyte concentration. The viscoelastic properties of O/W emulsions stabilised with an A-B-A block copolymer of polyethylene oxide (A) and polypropylene oxide (B) are described. These emulsions behave as viscoelastic liquids showing a cross-over-point between G' (the elastic component of the complex modulus) and G″ (the viscous component of the complex modulus) at a characteristic frequency. Plots of G' and G″ versus oil volume fraction ϕ show the transition from predominantly viscous to predominantly elastic response at a critical volume fraction ϕ(c). The latter can be used to estimate the adsorbed layer thickness of the polymeric surfactants. Results are also shown for W/O emulsions stabilised with an A-B-A block copolymer of polyhydroxystearic acid (PHS, A) and polyethylene oxide (PEO, B). The viscosity volume fraction curves could be fitted to the Dougherty-Krieger equation for hard-spheres. The results could be applied to give an estimate of the adsorbed layer thickness Δ which shows a decrease with increase of the water volume fraction. This is due to the interpenetration and/or compression of the PHS layers on close approach of the water droplets on increasing the water volume fraction. The last section of the review gives an example of O/W emulsion stability using an AB(n) graft copolymer of polyfructose (A) to which several C12 alkyl chains are grafted. The emulsions are stable both at high temperature and in the presence of high electrolyte concentrations (2 mol dm(-3) NaCl). This high stability is due to the strong adsorption ("anchoring") of the graft copolymer with several C12 alkyl chains and the strong hydration of the polyfructose chains both in water and in the presence of high electrolyte concentrations and temperature. Evidence for this high stability is obtained using disjoining pressure measurements which show a highly stable film between the emulsion droplets and absence of its rupture up to high pressures.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The studies had a similar goal, i.e., to characterize mitochondrial oxidative function. These efforts could have a direct impact on our ability to understand metabolic abnormalities that affect the pathophysiology of fatty liver and allow us to examine mechanisms surrounding potential therapeutic interventions. Briefly, one method couples the continuous infusion of [(13)C] with direct real-time measurements of [(13)C]glutamate labeling in liver; the other method administers [(13)C]propionate, in combination with other tracers, and subsequently measures the (13)C labeling of plasma glucose and/or acetaminophen-glucuronide. It appears that a controversy has arisen, since the respective methods yielded different estimates of the anaplerotic/TCA flux ratio (VANA:VTCA) in "control" subjects, i.e., the [(13)C]- and [(13)C]propionate-derived VANA:VTCA flux ratios appear to be ∼1.4 and ∼5, respectively. While the deep expertise in the respective groups makes it somewhat trivial for each to perform the tracer studies, the data interpretation is inherently difficult. The current perspective was undertaken to examine potential factors that could account for or contribute to the apparent differences. Attention was directed toward 1) matters of practicality, 2) issues surrounding stoichiometry, and 3) hidden assumptions. We believe that the [(13)C] method has certain weaknesses that limit its utility; in contrast, the [(13)C]propionate method likely yields a more correct answer. We hope our discussion will help clarify the differences in the recent reports. Presumably this will be of interest to investigators who are considering tracer-based studies of liver metabolism.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574320>Fecal SCFAs and SCFA-producing bacteria in gut microbiome of human NAFLD as a putative link to systemic T-cell activation and advanced disease.</a></h2><p>Intestinal microbiota and their metabolites (e.g. short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)) may influence nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The objective of this article is to analyze gut bacterial diversity together with fecal SCFA concentrations and immunophenotyping of peripheral blood in histology-proven NAFLD patients.Thirty-two NAFLD patients (14 nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), 18 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ()) and 27 healthy controls (HCs)) were included in this study. Bacterial communities in feces were profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region. Fecal SCFA levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. patients were characterized by higher abundance of Fusobacteria and Fusobacteriaceae compared to NAFL and HCs. Conforming to our finding that NAFLD patients had higher fecal  and propionate levels, taxonomical differences of fecal bacteria were dominated by SCFA-producing bacteria. Higher fecal propionate and  levels were associated with lower resting regulatory T-cells (rTregs) (CD4+CD45RA+CD25++) as well as higher Th17/rTreg ratio in peripheral blood as immunological characteristics of  patients. patients are characterized by a different gut microbiome composition with higher fecal SCFA levels and higher abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria in NAFLD. These changes are associated with immunological features of disease progression. Our data suggest an important role of the intestinal microbiome and immunomodulatory bacterial metabolites in human NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533197>Ketone body production is differentially altered in steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in obese humans.</a></h2><p>Levels of ketone bodies have been reported to be both increased and decreased in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We investigated whether the metabolism of ketone bodies is different in simple steatosis and in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Serum low molecular weight molecules including ketone bodies were measured using high-throughput proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance in 116 (76 categorized unequivocally to those with normal liver, simple steatosis or ) morbidly obese individuals [age 47.3 ± 8.7 (mean ± SD) years, body mass index 45.1 ± 6.1 kg/m(2) , 39 men and 77 women] with histological assessment of  and analysis of gene expression in the liver.

Lower levels of β-OHB were associated with the  predicting score in the METSIM study (P = 0.001). Liver inflammation correlated with mRNA expression of genes regulating ketolysis in the liver (Spearman correlation 0.379-0.388, P < 0.0006 for ACAT1, ACSS2 and BDH1).Lower levels of ketone bodies in individuals with  compared to individuals with simple steatosis suggest a decrease in ketone body metabolism in .© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We investigated reliable contraceptive use at baseline and six months in key-populations in Uganda, during two Simulated HIV Vaccine Efficacy trials (SiVETs). SiVETs were nested within observational cohorts of Fisherfolk (2012-2014) and Female sex workers (2014-2017). Women in the observational cohorts were screened and enrolled into the SiVET. The trial administered a licensed Hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months. Contraceptive use data were recorded at baseline and follow-up clinic visits. Reliable contraceptives (injectable Depot Medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA), implant, pills, and intrauterine device (IUD)) were promoted and provided to women not using a reliable method at enrolment. Overall, 367 women were enrolled. At baseline 203 (55%) reported use of reliable contraceptive. Of the 164 women not using a reliable method at enrolment, 131 (80%) started using them during follow-up bringing the overall number to 334 (91%) at the end of follow-up. Young age (≤35 years) was an independent predictor of reliable contraceptive use at both time points while other factors varied. Promotion and provision of reliable contraceptives increased the proportion using them and could help reduce the risk of pregnancy in future HIV prevention trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30041691>Prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma mansoni among a population-based sample of school-age children in Amhara region, Ethiopia.</a></h2><p>From 2011 to 2015, seven trachoma impact surveys in 150 districts across Amhara, Ethiopia, included in their design a nested study to estimate the zonal prevalence of intestinal parasite infections including soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and Schistosoma mansoni.A multi-stage cluster random sampling approach was used to achieve a population-based sample of children between the ages of 6 and 15 years. Stool samples of approximately 1 g were collected from assenting children, preserved in 10 ml of a sodium -acetic acid-formalin solution, and transported to the Amhara Public Health Research Institute for processing with the ether concentration method and microscopic identification of parasites. Bivariate logistic and negative binomial regression were used to explore associations with parasite prevalence and intensity, respectively.A total of 16,955 children were selected within 768 villages covering 150 districts representing all ten zones of the Amhara region. The final sample included 15,455 children of whom 52% were female and 75% reported regularly attending school. The regional prevalence among children of 6 to 15 years of age was 36.4% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34.9-38.0%) for any STH and 6.9% (95% CI: 5.9-8.1%) for S. mansoni. The zonal prevalence of any STH ranged from 12.1 to 58.3%, while S. mansoni ranged from 0.5 to 40.1%. Categories of risk defined by World Health Organization guidelines would indicate that 107 districts (71.3%) warranted preventive chemotherapy (PC) for STH and 57 districts (38.0%) warranted PC for schistosomiasis based solely on S. mansoni. No statistical differences in the prevalence of these parasites were observed among boys and girls, but age and school attendance were both associated with hookworm infection (prevalence odds ratio, POR: 1.02, P = 0.03 per 1 year, and POR: 0.81, P = 0.001, respectively) and age was associated with infection by any STH (POR: 1.02, P = 0.03). Age was also associated with reduced intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides infection (unadjusted rate ratio: 0.96, P = 0.02) and increased intensity of hookworm infection (unadjusted rate ratio: 1.07, P < 0.001).These surveys determined that between 2011 and 2015, STH and Schistosoma mansoni were present throughout the region, and accordingly, these results were used to guide PC distribution to school-age children in Amhara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27773935>Alisol B 23- protects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice via farnesoid X receptor activation.</a></h2><p>Alisol B 23- (AB23A) is a natural triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine rhizoma alismatis, which exhibits a number of pharmacological activities, including anti-hepatitis virus, anti-cancer and antibacterial effects. In this study we examined whether AB23A protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in mice, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects.  was induced in mice fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. The mice were simultaneously treated with AB23A (15, 30, and 60 mg·kg·d, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, blood samples and livers were collected. Serum liver functional enzymes, inflammatoru markers were assessed. The livers were histologically examined using H&E, Oil Red O, Masson's trichrome and Sirius Red staining. Mouse primary hepatocytes were used for in vitro experiments. The mechanisms underlying AB23A protection were analyzed using siRNA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot assays. AB23A treatment significantly and dose-dependently decreased the elevated levels of serum ALT and AST in MCD diet-fed mice. Furthermore, AB23A treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic fibrosis in the mice. AB23A-induced decreases in serum and hepatic lipids were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis through decreasing hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1 and SCD1 and increased lipid metabolism via inducing PPARα, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. The reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration corresponded to deceased serum levels of mKC and MCP-1 and decreased hepatic gene expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis was correlated with decreased hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers. The protective effects of AB23A were FXR-dependent, because treatment with the FXR agonist CDCA mimicked AB23A-induced hepato-protection in the mice, whereas co-administration of FXR antagonist guggulsterone abrogated AB23A-induced hepato-protection. In mouse primary hepatocytes, FXR gene silencing abrogated AB23A-induced changes in gene expression of Apo C-II, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. AB23A produces protective effects against  in mice via FXR activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935340>Stress up-regulates oxidative burst in juvenile Chinook salmon leukocytes.</a></h2><p>When fish perceive stressful scenarios, their hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis is activated resulting in the release of corticotropin releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and finally cortisol. The physiologic stress response of fish has most often been linked to the reduced performance of the immune system, with a few exceptions where the immune system is activated. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that oxidative burst activity levels in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are altered when the fish is presented with a stressor. Fish were subjected to a stressor for 3 h and then allowed to recover for 20 h following the stressor. Plasma and spleens were collected from euthanized fish before the stressor, at the end of a 3 h stressor, and 23 h after the start of the experiment. Plasma was held at -80 °C until cortisol radioimmunoassay analysis was performed to confirm stress. Spleens were held in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium overnight and analyzed the day following collection. Oxidative burst activity was measured in splenic leukocytes after being stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-. We found a significant increase in activated oxidative burst from fish subjected to the stressor as compared to unstressed fish. Speculation is given to ACTH being the leukocyte priming agent in this experiment rather than the cortisol itself.Copyright © 2018.

Herein we report the design of a new multifunctional MOL, Hf-Ir-Ni, by laterally linking Hf secondary building units (SBUs) with photosensitizing Ir(DBB)[dF(CF)ppy] [DBB-Ir-F, DBB = 4,4'-di(4-benzoato)-2,2'-bipyridine; dF(CF)ppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine] bridging ligands and vertically terminating the SBUs with catalytic Ni(MBA)Cl [MBA = 2-(4'-methyl-[2,2'-bipyridin]-4-yl)] capping agents. Hf-Ir-Ni was synthesized in a bottom-up approach and characterized by TEM, AFM, PXRD, TGA, NMR, ICP-MS, UV-vis, and luminescence spectroscopy. The proximity between photosensitizing Ir centers and catalytic Ni centers (∼0.85 nm) in Hf-Ir-Ni facilitates single electron transfer, leading to a 15-fold increase in photoredox reactivity. Hf-Ir-Ni was highly effective in catalytic C-S, C-O, and C-C cross-coupling reactions with broad substrate scopes and turnover numbers of ∼4500, ∼1900, and ∼450, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26726030>Aristolochia manshuriensis Kom ethyl  extract protects against high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by regulating kinase phosphorylation in mouse.</a></h2><p>Aristolochia manshuriensis Kom (AMK) is an herb used as a traditional medicine; however, it causes side effects such as nephrotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, AMK can be applied in specific ways medicinally, including via ingestion of low doses for short periods of time. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () induced the hepatocyte injury and inflammation. The protective effects of AMK against  are unclear; therefore, in this study, the protective effects of AMK ethyl  extract were investigated in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  model. We found decreased hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as well as increased levels of lipoproteins during AMK extract treatment. We also observed decreased hepatic lipid peroxidation and triglycerides, as well as suppressed hepatic expression of lipogenic genes in extract-treated livers. Treatment with extract decreased the activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). These results demonstrate that the protective effect of the extract against HFD-induced  occurred via reductions in reactive oxygen species production, inflammation suppression, and apoptosis related to the suppression of JNK1/2 activation and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

However, there are inadequate phytoassessment studies conducted using EDTA in Vetiver grass. Hence, this study evaluates the phytoassessment (growth performance, accumulation trends, and proficiency of metal uptake) of Vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides (Linn.)  in both single and mixed heavy metal (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn)-disodium EDTA-enhanced contaminated soil. The plant growth, metal accumulation, and overall efficiency of metal uptake by different plant parts (lower root, upper root, lower tiller, and upper tiller) were thoroughly examined. The relative growth performance, metal tolerance, and phytoassessment of heavy metal in roots and tillers of Vetiver grass were examined. Metals in plants were measured using the flame atomic absorption spectrometry (F-AAS) after acid digestion. The root-tiller (R/T) ratio, biological concentration factor (BCF), biological accumulation coefficient (BAC), tolerance index (TI), translocation factor (TF), and metal uptake efficacy were used to estimate the potential of metal accumulation and translocation in Vetiver grass. All accumulation of heavy metals were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in both lower and upper roots and tillers of Vetiver grass for Cd + Pb + Cu + Zn + EDTA treatments as compared with the control. The single Zn + EDTA treatment accumulated the highest overall total amount of Zn (8068 ± 407 mg/kg) while the highest accumulation for Cu (1977 ± 293 mg/kg) and Pb (1096 ± 75 mg/kg) were recorded in the mixed Cd + Pb + Cu + Zn + EDTA treatment, respectively. Generally, the overall heavy metal accumulation trends of Vetiver grass were in the order of Zn >>> Cu > Pb >> Cd for all treatments. Furthermore, both upper roots and tillers of Vetiver grass recorded high tendency of accumulation for appreciably greater amounts of all heavy metals, regardless of single and/or mixed metal treatments. Thus, Vetiver grass can be recommended as a potential phytoextractor for all types of heavy metals, whereby its tillers will act as the sink for heavy metal accumulation in the presence of EDTA for all treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630414>First-in-class fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-2640 reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis in males with metabolic abnormalities.</a></h2><p>Elevated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a key distinguishing characteristic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C - IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function.
