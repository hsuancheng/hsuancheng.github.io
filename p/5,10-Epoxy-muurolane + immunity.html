The starter intake and body weight (BW) of lambs was recorded weekly from birth to 63 days of age. Diarrhea rate of lambs was measured from birth to 35 days. Six randomly selected lambs from each treatment were slaughtered at 26, 35, and 63 days of age, respectively. Ruminal pH, NH-N, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, as well as serum parameters including , antioxidant status, and inflammatory parameters from randomly selected lambs from each treatment were measured. There was no difference in BW at birth and day 21 between the two groups of lambs ( > 0.05). However, BW of the lambs in the EW group was significantly lower than those in the CON group ( < 0.01) from 28 to 49 days of age. Average daily gain (ADG) of the lambs in the EW group was significantly lower than those in the CON group ( < 0.01) at three weeks after early weaning. Starter intake of the lambs in the EW group was obviously higher than that in the CON group ( < 0.01) from day 28 to 49. In addition, the diarrhea rate was significantly higher than that in the CON group from day  to 14 after weaning ( < 0.01). The EW group had heavier carcasses ( < 0.01) and rumen relative to whole stomach weights ( < 0.01). Rumen pH was increased by age ( < 0.01) and was not affected by early weaning ( > 0.05). Early weaning decreased abomasum relative to whole stomach weight ( < 0.01) and increased total VFA concentrations ( < 0.01) at day 26. There was no difference in lambs'  and stress indicators ( > 0.05). The results indicated that lambs weaned at 21 days of age had decreased ADG and higher diarrhea rate, although the overall  was not compromised. Long-term study is needed to further validate the feasibility of early weaning strategy in lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627764>Seroprevalence of an antibody against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis among the elderly in Khon Kaen, Thailand.</a></h2><p>Owing to a declining birth rate and longer lifespan, the number of elderly people (≥ 60 years) in Thailand has grown rapidly. However, the elderly are at significant risk of infectious diseases because they have never been immunized, because they have not been completely immunized, or because their  has waned.  against infectious diseases in the elderly is an important means of controlling diseases in the community. Our objective was to evaluate the seroprotective rate against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in the elderly Thai population.In total, 430 healthy individuals from the northeastern region of Thailand were enrolled in this study and stratified into five age groups: 60-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, and > 80 years. Serum samples were collected and quantitatively analyzed for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis IgG antibody by using commercial ELISA kits. For anti-diphtheria toxoid and anti-tetanus toxoid ELISA, values < 0.01 IU/ml were interpreted as seronegative, and for anti-Bordetella pertussis toxin ELISA, values <  IU/ml were interpreted as seronegative; these definitions were in accord with previous studies.For diphtheria toxoid Ab, the majority of the population had antibody levels > 0.01 IU/ml. For tetanus anti-toxoid Ab, the majority of the population had antibody levels of > 0.01 IU/ml, of which approximately 34% had durable antibody protection levels (DAPL) of ≥ 1 IU/ml. Meanwhile, nearly 45% of the population had an Ab level against pertussis lower than the protectivity level.In total, 97.2%, 83.%, and 55.8% of the population had a higher antibody level than the minimal protective level for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, respectively. In order to prevent an outbreak of these diseases in the future, the elderly should be administered with Tdap revaccination to provide diphtheria herd  in the population; this will increase cocoon phenomenon for pertussis and protect the population from tetanus-prone injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618225>Identification and characterisation of capidermicin, a novel bacteriocin produced by Staphylococcus capitis.</a></h2><p>One hundred human-derived coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) were screened for antimicrobial activity using agar-based deferred antagonism assays with a range of indicator bacteria. Based on the findings of the screen and subsequent well assays with cell free supernatants and whole cell extracts, one strain, designated CIT060, was selected for further investigation. It was identified as Staphylococcus capitis and herein we describe the purification and characterisation of the novel bacteriocin that the strain produces. This bacteriocin which we have named capidermicin was extracted from the cell-free supernatant of S. capitis CIT060 and purified to homogeneity using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis revealed that the capidermicin peptide has a mass of ,464 Da. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) experiments showed that capidermicin was active in the micro-molar range against all the Gram-positive bacteria that were tested. Antimicrobial activity was retained over a range of pHs (2-11) and temperatures (10-121°C x 15 mins). The draft genome sequence of S. capitis CIT060 was determined and the genes predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of capidermicin were identified. These genes included the predicted capidermicin precursor gene, and genes that are predicted to encode a membrane transporter, an  protein and a transcriptional regulator. Homology searches suggest that capidermicin is a novel member of the family of class II leaderless bacteriocins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661527>Factors associated with pneumococcal carriage and density in infants and young children in Laos PDR.</a></h2><p>Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a precursor to pneumococcal disease. Several host and environmental factors have been associated with pneumococcal carriage, however few studies have examined the relationship between host factors and pneumococcal carriage density. We sought to identify risk factors for pneumococcal carriage and density using data from cross-sectional pneumococcal carriage surveys conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic before and after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected infants from aged -8 weeks old (n = 999) and children aged 12-23 months (n = 1,010), pneumococci detected by quantitative PCR, and a risk factor questionnaire completed. Logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and pneumococcal carriage and density. In infants aged -8 weeks, living in a household with two or more children under the age of five years (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.39-2.79) and low family income (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 0.99-2.72) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. For children aged 12-23 months, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (aOR 2.64; 95% CI 1.97-3.53), two or more children under five in the household (aOR 2.40; 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and rural residence (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35-2.50) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. PCV13 vaccination was negatively associated with carriage of PCV13 serotypes (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83). URTI symptoms (p < 0.001), current breastfeeding (p = 0.005), rural residence (p = 0.012), and delivery by Caesarean section (p = 0.035) were associated with higher mean pneumococcal density in pneumococcal carriers (both age groups combined). This study provides new data on pneumococcal carriage and density in a high disease burden setting in southeast Asia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658371>Macronutrients modulate survival to infection and  in Drosophila.</a></h2><p>1.  and nutrition are two essential modulators of individual fitness. However, while the implications of immune function and nutrition on an individual's lifespan and reproduction are well established, the interplay between feeding behaviour, infection, and immune function, remains poorly understood. Asking how ecological and physiological factors affect immune responses and resistance to infections is a central theme of eco-immunology. 2. In this study, we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate how infection through septic injury modulates nutritional intake, and how macronutrient balance affects survival to infection by the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. 3. Our results show that infected flies maintain carbohydrate intake, but reduce protein intake, thereby shifting from a protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of ~1:4 to ~1:10 relative to non-infected and sham-infected flies. Strikingly, the proportion of flies dying after M. luteus infection was significantly lower when flies were fed a low-P high-C diet, revealing that flies shift their macronutrient intake as means of nutritional self-medication against bacterial infection. 4. These results are likely due to the effects of the macronutrient balance on the regulation of the constitutive expression of innate immune genes, as a low-P high-C diet was linked to an up-regulation in the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. . Together, our results reveal the intricate relationship between macronutrient intake and resistance to infection, and integrate the molecular cross-talk between metabolic and immune pathways into the framework of nutritional immunology.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we generated TAM molecular signatures from K14cre;Cdh1;Trp53 (KEP) and MMTV-NeuT (NeuT) transgenic mice that resemble human invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and HER2 tumors, respectively. Determination of TAM-specific signatures requires comparison with healthy mammary tissue macrophages to avoid overestimation of gene expression differences. TAMs from the two models feature a distinct transcriptomic profile, suggesting that the cancer subtype dictates their phenotype. The KEP-derived signature reliably correlates with poor overall survival in ILC but not in triple-negative breast cancer patients, indicating that translation of murine TAM signatures to patients is cancer subtype dependent. Collectively, we show that a transgenic mouse tumor model can yield a TAM signature relevant for human breast cancer outcome prognosis and provide a generalizable strategy for determining and applying immune cell signatures provided the murine model reflects the human disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The update further provides a new database infrastructure featuring two additional analysis modes that facilitate database querying and real-world data analysis. The increased yield of TCR specificity identification methods and the overall increase in the number of studies in the field has allowed us to expand the database more than -fold. Furthermore, several new analysis methods are included. For example, batch annotation of TCR repertoire sequencing samples allows for annotating large datasets on-line. Using recently developed bioinformatic methods for TCR motif mining, we have built a reduced set of high-quality TCR motifs that can be used for both training TCR specificity predictors and matching against TCRs of interest. These additions enhance the versatility of the VDJdb in the task of exploring T-cell antigen specificities. The database is available at https://vdjdb.cdr3.net.© The Author(s) 2019.

In pivotal studies, the efficacy of the new vaccine varied very little with the age of the vaccinee and decreased only by -10% in the 3. years after immunization. This nonlive vaccine was successfully administered to small cohorts of immunocompromised individuals; initial trials showed efficacy of >60-80% in several such settings. Potential drawbacks include the requirement for 2 vaccine doses separated by 2-6 months, local and systemic reactogenicity that is significantly greater than observed with commonly used vaccines, and the inclusion of a strong adjuvant that has been minimally studied in clinical settings where it might be problematic, such as in people with autoimmune diseases. Postmarketing studies are underway to address some of the drawbacks.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

The optical fiber arrangement incorporates a low-coherence Fabry-Perot cavity operating in dual response. The system provides a phase modulation for a total fat range from 0.97% to 4.36%. Here, the protein remains constant at 3%. The data indicate that maximum sensitivity close to 616 pm/%fat could be achieved at optimal wavelength operation (500 nm).

According to various estimates, 10-20% of all human cancers are caused by viruses. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B and C viruses, human papillomavirus (HPV), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), and Merkel cell polyomavirus were implicated in initiating tumors. At the same time, the long period between viral infection and the manifestation of cancer significantly complicates the search for a causal relationship between the presence of a virus in the human organism and the malignant transformation. For this reason, the role of certain viruses in the initiation of neoplastic processes in humans remains an unresolved issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609922>Effects of Brief Mood-Improving Interventions on : A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Positive mood has been associated with enhanced immune function. Interventions that improve mood could, therefore, provide a mechanism for optimising immune related health outcomes. Brief interventions that improve mood, also known as mood inductions, potentially offer a pragmatic approach to enhancing immune function for suor surgery). This review sought to systematically examine the evidence regarding the effects of brief, single-session positive mood interventions on .Systematic searches of electronic databases were performed from earliest records to 25 July 2018. We identified 42 interventions suitable for inclusion, six of which were tested in multiple sub-populations. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for pre-post experimental group immune outcomes measured in at least  intervention studies.While interventions were heterogeneous, 81% resulted in a statistically significant change in at least one immune parameter following the positive mood intervention for one or more of the sub-populations examined. However, studies were, in general, of low-to-moderate quality with small sample sizes (median n=32) and did not examine the persistence, or clinical relevance of the immune changes observed. Random effects meta-analyses showed a significant medium-sized effect of interventions on increasing secretory IgA concentration (g=0.65), a small but statistically significant effect for increased IL-6 production (g=0.12) and non-significant effects on NK cell activity (g=0.15).The current literature suggests that improvements in mood resulting from brief interventions can influence some immune parameters in ways indicative of enhanced immune function. However, there is a need for higher quality research in this area that focuses on clinically relevant immune outcomes and mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655126>IκBα phosphorylation and associated NF-κB activation are essential events in lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and anti-bacterial adaptive immune response of Nile tilapia.</a></h2><p>Inhibitory protein IκBα plays a crucial role in the inflammatory process and immune response by regulating the activity of transcription factor NF-κB. In teleost, great progress has been achieved regarding NF-κB signaling for innate , but whether this pathway modulates adaptive , and how, remains largely unclear. In this study, after characterizing the sequence, structure, and phylogeny of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus IκBα (defined as On-IκBα), we investigated the association between IκBα-regulated NF-κB activation and the lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immune response in Nile tilapia. We found that On-IκBα was evolutionarily conserved, and its mRNA was expressed widely in various tissues, with most abundance in the trunk kidney. mRNA expression of On-IκBα was significantly upregulated in spleen at both innate and adaptive immune stages after Aeromonas hydrophila infection. Moreover, phosphorylation of On-IκBα and the downstream On-NF-κB p65 was obviously elevated in spleen leukocytes at 3, , or 8 days after A. hydrophila infection, indicating the activation of NF-κB signaling. Correlating with the augmented protein phosphorylation, leukocyte proliferation was enhanced during the same immune stage, suggesting the potential association of IκBα and IκBα-regulated NF-κB signaling in the primary adaptive immune response. Although lymphocyte activation by the T cell-specific mitogen PHA did not alter On-IκBα mRNA expression significantly, lymphocyte activation by the agonist PMA obviously elevated On-IκBα and On-NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in spleen leukocytes. Together, the results suggest that IκBα phosphorylation and its regulated NF-κB activation are essential events associated with lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and anti-bacterial adaptive immune response in Nile tilapia.

Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression and risk of colon cancer (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of American Indian populations.The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and association analyses.CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 ± 0.05, p<1.3 X 10-20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x 10-7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes 2, , 6(2 loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7.2 X 10-4.In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other chromosomes that warrant further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593708>NK-lysin, dicentracin and hepcidin antimicrobial peptides in European sea bass. Ontogenetic development and modulation in juveniles by nodavirus.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered to be amongst the most powerful tools for the fight against pathogens in fish, since they form part of the innate immune response, which is especially vital in eggs and early larval stages, when the immune system is developing. The fish responsible for a large part of the profits in Mediterranean aquaculture is European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a species greatly susceptible to nodavirus (NNV), especially in the larval and juvenile stages. In this work, polyclonal antibodies were developed and used to detect and quantify NK-lysin, dicentracin and hepcidin AMPs in European sea bass eggs and during larval development, as well as to evaluate their regulation in juvenile specimens upon NNV infection. Basal and detectable levels of all the AMPs studied were present in eggs, confirming the maternal transfer of peptides, which increased in one or two waves during larval development up to 69 days post-fertilization. After NNV infection, the mRNA of all the AMPs analysed was up-regulated five days after infection in most of the tissues, whilst peptide quantification of all three AMPs decreased in the brain, the target tissue for NNV, but increased in the head-kidney  days after infection. Further research should be carried out to ascertain the role of AMPs in fish innate  and to understand how NNV evades the immune response to be disseminated.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8 T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and immunotherapy. Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8 T cell . Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot. These findings are relevant for genotoxic and immune therapies for cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, few studies have been performed to characterize the IL-1β in lower vertebrates. Herein, we distinguished the Scophthalmus maximus IL-1β (SmIL-1β) from three IL-1β like sequences and found that SmIL-1β was cleaved by S. maximus caspase at a non-conserved Asp, then targeted to the plasma membrane. Moreover, during the immersion infection of Edwardsiella piscicida, we found that E. piscicida were mainly colonized in gills at early time points and invaded to systemic sites after  days post infection, which was consistent with the dynamic up-regulated transcription of SmIL-1β. Furthermore, knockdown of SmIL-1β promotes the bacterial colonization in gills at early time points and result into systemic colonization, while overexpression of SmIL-1β hampers the bacterial colonization in both spleen and kidney. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of SmIL-1β and reveal its role in limiting bacterial infection in vivo, which will support the idea for better understanding the evolutionary of IL-1β functions in teleost.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated intravacuolar-network-associated dense granule (GRA) proteins GRA1, GRA2, GRA4, GRA6, GRA9, and GRA12 during cyst development  after differentiation of the tachyzoite-stage parasitophorous vacuole. By day 1 postdifferentiation, GRA1, GRA4, GRA6, GRA9, and GRA12 colocalized with  agglutinin stain at the cyst periphery. In contrast, GRA2 remained in the cyst matrix. By day 2 postdifferentiation, coinciding with localization of GRA2 to the cyst periphery, GRA1, GRA4, GRA6, and GRA9 established a continuous matrix pattern in the cyst. In contrast, GRA2 and GRA12 were colocalized in prominent cyst matrix puncta throughout cyst development. While GRA2, GRA6, and GRA12 localized in outer and inner layers of the cyst wall, GRA1, GRA4, and GRA9 localized predominantly in the inner layers of the cyst wall. GRA2 and GRA12 were colocalized in the cyst wall by day 7 postdifferentiation. However, by day 10 postdifferentiation, GRA12 was relocalized from the cyst wall to puncta in the cyst matrix. Differentiation of Δ parasites revealed a defect in the ability to establish a normal cyst matrix. In addition, the deletion of any intravacuolar-network-associated GRA protein, except GRA1, reduced the rate of accumulation of cyst wall proteins at the cyst periphery relative to the cyst interior.

The United Kingdom (UK) has a high prevalence of AD, affecting 11-20% of children and -10% of adults. Approximately 2% of all cases of childhood AD in the UK are severe. Despite this, most AD treatments are performed at home, with little contact with healthcare providers or services. Here, we discuss the course of AD, treatment practices, and unmet need in the UK. Although the underlying etiology of the disease is still emerging, AD is currently attributed to skin barrier dysfunction and altered inflammatory responses. Management of AD focuses on avoiding triggers, improving skin hydration, managing exacerbating factors, and reducing inflammation through topical and systemic immunosuppressants.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence  and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the microbiota may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Ryan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592762> sp. nov., a moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from a marine solar saltern.</a></h2><p>A facultatively anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative and non-gliding bacterium, designated F01, was isolated from marine solar saltern in Weihai, PR China. Cells of F01 were 0.2-0.4 µm wide and 1.4-4.1 µm long, weakly catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. Growth of F01 was determined to occur at 4-40 °C (optimum, 33-37 °C), pH 6.-8. (optimum, 7.0-8.0), and with 0.-18.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 3.0-6.0 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that F01 represented a member of the genus  within the family . Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolate was most closely related to  DSM 16394, with a sequence similarity of 97. %. The DNA G+C content of the isolate was 57.6 mol%. The major respiratory quinone of F01 was ubiquinone-9 (Q-9) and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C, C and Cω9.

Here, we present the first GWAS on non-severe malaria designed to identify genetic variants involved in innate  or innate resistance mechanisms. Our study was performed on two cohorts of infants from southern Benin (525 and 250 individuals used as discovery and replication cohorts, respectively) closely followed from birth to 18-24 months of age, with an assessment of a space- and time-dependent environmental risk of exposure. Both the recurrence of mild malaria attacks and the recurrence of malaria infections as a whole (symptomatic and asymptomatic) were considered. Post-GWAS functional analyses were performed using positional, eQTL, and chromatin interaction mapping to identify the genes underlying association signals. Our study highlights a role of PTPRT, a tyrosine phosphatase receptor involved in STAT3 pathway, in the protection against both mild malaria attacks and malaria infections (p = 9.70 × 10 and p = 1.78 × 10, respectively, in the discovery cohort). Strong statistical support was also found for a role of MYLK4 (meta-analysis, p = .29 × 10 with malaria attacks), and for several other genes, whose biological functions are relevant in malaria infection. Results shows that GWAS on non-severe malaria can successfully identify new candidate genes and inform physiological mechanisms underlying natural protection against malaria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658992>Kinetic analysis of IFIT1 and IFIT5 interaction with different native and engineered RNAs and its consequences for designing mRNA-based therapeutics.</a></h2><p>In response to foreign RNA cellular antiviral mechanisms stimulate high expression of Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs). Two members of the IFIT protein family: IFIT1 and IFIT5 are capable of binding the very terminal ' end of mRNA. In eukaryotes these mRNA termini contain a cap structure (m7GpppN, cap 0) that is often subjected to further modifications. Here, we performed a thorough examination of IFIT1 and IFIT5 binding to a wide spectrum of differently capped as well as fully uncapped mRNAs. The kinetic analysis of IFIT1 and IFIT5 interactions with mRNA ligands indicates that the cap structure modifications considerably influence the stability of IFIT1/RNA complexes. The most stable complexes were formed between IFIT1 and GpppG/A- and m7GpppG/A-RNAs. Unexpectedly, we found that NAD+- and NADH-capped RNAs associate with IFIT5 with kinetic parameters comparable to pppG-RNA. Finally, we measured interactions of IFIT1 with mRNAs bearing modified synthetic cap analogs that start to become the important tools in biotechnological and medicinal research. We found that incorporation of modified cap analogs to the RNA protects the latter, to a certain degree, from the translational inhibition caused by IFIT1 protein.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612130>Identification of Ixodid Tick-Specific Aquaporin-1 Potential Anti-tick Vaccine Epitopes: An  Analysis.</a></h2><p>Ticks are arthropod vectors of pathogens of both Veterinary and Public health importance. Acaricide application, which is currently the mainstay of tick control, is hampered by high cost, the need for regular application and a selection of multi-acaricide resistant tick populations. In light of this, future tick control approaches are poised to rely on the integration of rational acaricide application and other methods, such as vaccination. To contribute to systematic research-guided efforts to produce anti-tick vaccines, we carried out an  analysis of tick aquaporin-1 (AQP1) protein in order to identify tick-specific AQP1 peptide motifs that can be used in future peptide anti-tick vaccine development. We carried out multiple sequence alignment (MSA), motif analysis, homology modeling, and structural analysis to identify tick-specific AQP1 peptide motifs. BepiPred, Chou and Fasman-Turn, Karplus and Schulz Flexibility, and Parker-Hydrophilicity prediction models were used to predict these motifs' potential to induce B cell mediated immune responses. The tick AQP1 (GenBankID: QDO67142.1) protein was largely similar to the bovine AQP1 (PDB:1J4N) (23 % sequence similarity; Structural superimposition of the homology model and 14JN homotetramers gave an RMSD = 3.269 while superimposition of a single chain gave an RMSD = 1.475). Tick and bovine AQP1 transmembrane domains were largely similar while their extracellular and cytoplasmic domain loops showed variation. Two tick-specific AQP1 peptide motifs; M7 (residues 106-125,  = .4e-25), and M8 (residues 85-104,  = 3.3e-24) were identified. These two motifs are located on the extra-cellular AQP1 domain. Motifs; M7 and M8 showed the highest Parker-Hydrophilicity prediction immunogenicity scores of 1.784 and 1.536, respectively. These two motifs can be a good starting point for the development of potential tick AQP1 peptide-based anti-tick vaccines. Further analyses such as molecular dynamics,  assays, and  immunization assays are required to validate these findings.Copyright © 2019 Ndekezi, Nkamwesiga, Ochwo, Kimuda, Mwiine, Tweyongyere, Amanyire and Muhanguzi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606145>Effect of Long-term Exposure to Peptides on Mono- and Multispecies Biofilms in Dentinal Tubules.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibiofilm effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) and peptides 1018 and DJK- used either alone or in a mixture (peptide and 2% CHX) against Enterococcus faecalis and multispecies biofilms in dentin canals after short-term and long-term exposure.One hundred eighty dentin blocks were prepared and filled with E. faecalis or multispecies bacteria by centrifugation. Three-week-old biofilms in dentin were subjected to 2% CHX, DJK- (10 μg/mL), 1018 (10 μg/mL), DJK- + 2% CHX, or 1018 + 2% CHX for short-term (1 or 3 minutes), short-term exposure after 24 hours, and long-term exposure (24 hours of exposure). The antibacterial efficacy was determined by live/dead bacterial viability staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy.Peptide DJK- with or without CHX was the most effective agent against all the biofilms (P < .05), killing 77% of biofilm bacteria in 1 minute. No significant difference in bacterial killing was detected between the first 3 minutes of exposure (>81%) and after 24 hours of exposure (83%) to DJK- or DJK- + CHX. Chlorhexidine and peptide 1018 had a weaker antibiofilm effect than DJK-, and their effect was time dependent (P < .05) with a maximum killing of 60% after 24 hours of exposure.Peptide DJK- alone and together with CHX had a rapid antibacterial effect against dentin infection. An additional antibacterial effect by CHX and peptide 1018 was achieved after a 24-hour long-term exposure.Copyright © 2019 American Association of Endodontists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Extrinsic factors such as diet and host  are insufficient to explain the constituents of this community, and direct interactions between co-resident microorganisms have been implicated as important drivers of microbiome composition. The genomes of bacteria derived from the gut microbiome contain several pathways that mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism. Many members of the Gram-negative order Bacteroidales encode the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which facilitates the delivery of toxic effector proteins into adjacent cells. Here we report the occurrence of acquired interbacterial defence (AID) gene clusters in Bacteroidales species that reside within the human gut microbiome. These clusters encode arrays of  genes that protect against T6SS-mediated intra- and inter-species bacterial antagonism. Moreover, the clusters reside on mobile elements, and we show that their transfer is sufficient to confer resistance to toxins in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, we identify and validate the protective capability of a recombinase-associated AID subtype (rAID-1) that is present broadly in Bacteroidales genomes. These rAID-1 gene clusters have a structure suggestive of active gene acquisition and include predicted  factors of toxins derived from diverse organisms. Our data suggest that neutralization of contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism by AID systems helps to shape human gut microbiome ecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661479>[Mouse Models of Sepsis and Septic Shock].</a></h2><p>An extensive network of regulation of systemic inflammation makes development of a reproducible experimental model of sepsis a complex task.

Such a method is still used to measure potency of live Oral Poliovirus Vaccine during vaccine development and production and in some clinical trials. However, the conventional method is not suited to identify and titrate virus in the large numbers of fecal samples generated during clinical trials. Determining titers of each of the three Sabin strains co-existing in Oral Poliovirus Vaccine presents an additional challenge.A new assay using quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction as an endpoint instead of cytopathic effect was developed to overcome these limitations. In the multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay, cell cultures were infected with serial dilutions of test samples, lysed after two-day incubation, and subjected to a quantitative multiplex one-step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All three serotypes of poliovirus were identified in single samples and titers calculated. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was reproducible, robust and sensitive. Its lower limits of titration for three Sabin strains were 1- cell culture 50% infectious doses per ml. We prepared different combinations of three Sabin strains and compared titers obtained with conventional and multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assays. Results of the two assays correlated well and showed similar results and sensitivity. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was completed in two to 3 days instead of 10 days for the conventional assay.The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration (MPBT) is the first quantitative assay that identifies and titrates each of several different infectious viruses simultaneously in a mixture. It is suitable to identify and titrate polioviruses rapidly during the vaccine manufacturing process as a quality control test, in large clinical trials of vaccines, and for environmental surveillance of polioviruses. The MPBT assay can be automated for high-throughput implementation and applied for other viruses including those with no cytopathic effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665637>STING-Mediated IFI16 Degradation Negatively Controls Type I Interferon Production.</a></h2><p>γ-interferon-inducible protein-16 (IFI16), a key DNA sensor, triggers downstream STING-dependent type I interferon (IFN-I) production and antiviral . However, it is still unclear how to negatively regulate IFI16 to avoid excessive IFN-I production and autoimmunity. Here, we find that STING directly interacts with IFI16 and facilitates IFI16 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by recruiting the E3 ligase TRIM21. The 1-pyrin region of IFI16 is responsible for the IFI16-STING interaction, and the first three lysines in the N-terminal region of IFI16 are the key sites that lead to STING-mediated IFI16 ubiquitination and degradation. Compared to wild-type IFI16, a higher level of viral DNA triggered IFN-β and antiviral IFN-stimulated gene expression, and thus less HSV-1 infection, was observed in the cells transfected with IFI16-K3/4/6R, an IFI16 mutant that is resistant to degradation.

Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a downstream effector of inflammasomes, which are supramolecular complexes that activate inflammatory caspases (-1, -4, and - in human and -1 and -11 in mouse). GSDMD contains a functionally important N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N), a C-terminal domain, and a linker in between that is recognized and cleaved by the activated inflammatory caspases. Upon cleavage, the GSDMD-N fragments translocate on the membrane and oligomerize to form membrane-embedded pores after specifically binding to acidic lipids such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), and cardiolipin. The pore exhibits strong membrane-disrupting cytotoxicity in mammalian cells by disrupting the osmotic potential and also serves as a gate for extracellular release of mature IL-1β and IL-18 during pyroptosis.

We conducted a trial in 200 healthy Slovak adults aged 24-65 years, immunised against diphtheria in childhood and against tetanus at regular 10-15 year intervals, and receiving a dose of a tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccine. The response was determined by ELISA antibody concentrations of paired sera before and at 4 weeks post-vaccination. A seroprotection rate of 21% (95% confidence interval, CI 15.6-27.3%) was found in adults up to 59 years since the last vaccination with seroprotective levels of antibodies against diphtheria ≥0.1 IU/mL and a geometric mean concentration of 0.05 IU/mL. Conversely, seropositive levels ≥0.01 IU/mL were observed in 98% of adults (95% CI 95-99.%). Booster-induced seroprotection was achieved in 78% of adults (95% CI 71.6-83.%) clearly depending on pre-booster antibody levels correlating with age and time since the last vaccination. Moreover, only 54.2% of smokers and 53.3% of patients on statins exhibited seroprotection.

In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin-which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection-is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell  against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this -rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs-causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1). Mice with natural  against MmuPV1 after colonization and acquired  through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8 T cells from unaffected human skin.

Barcoded viruses are generated by inserting a small, genetically unique tag into the viral genome, which is retained in progeny virus. We recently reported barcoding the well-characterized molecular clone SIVmac239, resulting in a synthetic swarm (SIVmac239M) containing approximately 10,000 distinct viral clonotypes for which all genetic differences where within a 34-base barcode that can be tracked using next generation deep sequencing. Here, we assessed the population size, distribution, and authenticity of individual viral clonotypes within this synthetic swarm using samples from 120 rhesus macaques infected intravenously. The number of replicating barcodes in plasma correlated with infectious inoculum dose, and the primary viral growth rate was similar in all infected animals regardless of inoculum size. Overall, 97% of detectable clonotypes in the viral stock were identified in the plasma of at least one infected animal. Additionally, we prepared a second generation barcoded SIVmac239 (SIVmac239M2), with over 16-times the number of barcoded variants of the original stock, and an additional barcoded stock with suboptimal nucleotides corrected (SIVmac239Opt5M). We also generated four barcoded stocks from subtype B and C SHIV clones. These new SHIV clones may be particularly valuable models to evaluate Env-targeting approaches to study viral transmission or viral reservoir clearance. Overall, this work further establishes the reliability of the barcoded virus approach and highlights the feasibility of adapting this technique to other viral clones. We recently developed and published a description of a barcoded simian immunodeficiency virus that has a short random sequence inserted directly into the viral genome. This allows for the tracking of individual viral lineages with high fidelity and ultradeep sensitivity. This virus was used to infect 120 rhesus macaques and we report here the analysis of the barcodes of these animals during primary infection. We found that the vast majority of barcodes were functional in vivo. We then expanded the barcoding approach in a second generation SIVmac239 (SIVmac239M2), with over 16-times the number of barcoded variants of the original stock, and a barcoded stock of SIVmac239Opt5M that has  changes from wild type SIVmac239.

SIRT3 and SIRT5 regulate metabolism and redox homeostasis and have been involved in age-associated metabolic, neurologic and oncologic diseases. We have previously shown that single deficiency in either SIRT3 or SIRT5 had no impact on host defenses in a large panel of preclinical models of sepsis. However, SIRT3 and SIRT5 may compensate each other considering that they share subcellular location and targets. Here, we generated a SIRT3/ double knockout mouse line. SIRT3/ deficient mice multiplied and developed without abnormalities. Hematopoiesis and immune cell development were largely unaffected in SIRT3/ deficient mice. Whole blood, macrophages and neutrophils from SIRT3/ deficient mice displayed enhanced inflammatory and bactericidal responses. In agreement, SIRT3/ deficient mice showed somewhat improved resistance to  infection. Overall, the double deficiency in SIRT3 and SIRT5 has rather subtle impacts on immune cell development and anti-microbial host defenses unseen in single deficient mice, indicating a certain degree of overlap between SIRT3 and SIRT5. These data support the assumption that therapies directed against mitochondrial sirtuins, at least SIRT3 and SIRT5, should not impair antibacterial host defenses.Copyright © 2019 Heinonen, Ciarlo, Le Roy and Roger.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606586>Prevalence of baseline HCV NS5A resistance associated substitutions in genotype 1a, 1b and 3 infection in Australia.</a></h2><p>Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have revolutionised hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, and most regimens include an NS5A inhibitor. Certain amino-acid substitutions confer resistance to NS5A inhibitors, termed resistance-associated substitutions (RAS). If present at baseline, they can reduce virological response rates. Population-based sequencing (PBS) is generally used for baseline sequencing, however next generation sequencing (NGS) reduces the threshold for detection of sequences encoding RAS from 20% to %. We determined the prevalence of NS5A RAS at baseline amongst Australian chronically infected with genotype (GT)1a, GT1b and GT3 HCV, using both PBS and NGS.Samples from DAA-naïve individuals were received at the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory between June 2016 and December 2018.

A subset of GT1 HCV samples were processed using NGS technology (Vela Diagnostics, Singapore) to determine the improvement in sensitivity.In total, 672 samples were analysed using PBS. The baseline prevalence of NS5A RAS was 7.6% for GT1a (n = 25/329), 15.7% for GT1b (n = 8/51) and 15.1% for GT3 (n = 44/292).

The function of LPAP is still unknown. Studies of the LPAP interactome may reveal new details of how C45 and lymphocyte signaling in general are regulated. LPAP binding partners were sought using coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, stabilization of protein complexes with chemical crosslinkers, and Blue Native electrophoresis. In addition to CD45, several proteins were identified as LPAP partners, including CD71, CD98, cytoskeletal proteins, the amino acid transporter SLC1A4, and the cell signaling component HS1. It was confirmed that more than 70% of LPAP molecules were bound with CD45 in a 1 : 1 complex. The effect of CD45 on LPAP was studied in CEM and Jurkat cells with a CD45 knockout. The LPAP levels in the cells were 10% of the level in wild-type cells. In the absence of CD45, LPAP phosphorylation at Ser-153 and Ser-163 was not affected, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-99 and Ser-172 decreased significantly.

In contrast, extracellular dsRNA is internalized into endosomes and recognized by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which triggers signaling via the Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1). Poly I:C is a synthetic dsRNA analog and increases the expression of  (), , and  () mRNAs during pluripotency induction. However, the mechanism underlying this increase is unclear. Here, we focused on the mechanism of poly I:C-induced expression of stem cell-specific genes in human somatic cells. Addition of poly I:C to human fibroblast culture medium did not increase  mRNA expression, but poly I:C transfection markedly increased  expression and induced nuclear localization of the OCT3/4 protein, implying that not TLR3, but RIG-I and MDA5 are required for  expression. Moreover, although cytoplasmic dsRNA increased  mRNA, cytoplasmic dsDNAs, such as salmon-sperm DNA and poly dA:dT, did not. Interestingly, the expression of NANOG, SOX2, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and proto-oncogene c-Myc was also increased by cytoplasmic dsRNA. Of note, siRNAs that silenced MAVS and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression reduced  levels after stimulation with poly I:C; however, an NF-κB inhibitor and siRNA-mediated knockdown of proto-oncogene c-Jun did not significantly reduce the mRNA levels. We conclude that cytoplasmic dsRNA increases the expression of stem cell-specific genes in human somatic cells in a MAVS- and IRF1-dependent manner.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661483>[Body's Own Epitopes among Foreign Ones: T Cells and Autoantigens].</a></h2><p>T cells play a key role in adaptive  reactions, recognizing antigens using variable TCRs. Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing immunotherapy and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells. The fact that the efficacious immunotherapy of tumors is often accompanied by adverse autoimmune reactions currently seems to be the inevitable price paid by using this approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637821>Temporal trends of population viral suppression in the context of Universal Test and Treat: the ANRS 12249 TasP trial in rural South Africa.</a></h2><p>The universal test-and-treat (UTT) strategy aims to maximize population viral suppression (PVS), that is, the proportion of all people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral treatment (ART) and virally suppressed, with the goal of reducing HIV transmission at the population level. This article explores the extent to which temporal changes in PVS explain the observed lack of association between universal treatment and cumulative HIV incidence seen in the ANRS 12249 TasP trial conducted in rural South Africa.The TasP cluster-randomized trial (2012 to 2016) implemented six-monthly repeat home-based HIV counselling and testing (RHBCT) and referral of PLHIV to local HIV clinics in 2 × 11 clusters opened sequentially. ART was initiated according to national guidelines in control clusters and regardless of CD4 count in intervention clusters. We measured residency status, HIV status, and HIV care status for each participant on a daily basis. PVS was computed per cluster among all resident PLHIV (≥16, including those not in care) at cluster opening and daily thereafter. We used a mixed linear model to explore time patterns in PVS, adjusting for sociodemographic changes at the cluster level.8563 PLHIV were followed. During the course of the trial, PVS increased significantly in both arms (23.% to 46.2% in intervention, +22.8, p < 0.001; 26.0% to 44.6% in control, +18.6, p < 0.001). That increase was similar in both arms (p = 0.514). In the final adjusted model, PVS increase was most associated with increased RHBCT and the implementation of local trial clinics (measured by time since cluster opening). Contextual changes (measured by calendar time) also contributed slightly. The effect of universal ART (trial arm) was positive but limited.PVS was improved significantly but similarly in both trial arms, explaining partly the null effect observed in terms of cumulative HIV incidence between arms. The PVS gains due to changes in ART-initiation guidelines alone are relatively small compared to gains obtained by strategies to maximize testing and linkage to care. The achievement of the 90-90-90 targets will not be met if the operational and implementational challenges limiting access to care and treatment, often context-specific, are not properly addressed.

The transcriptional alterations of major cytokines and immunoregulators were analyzed in this study through gene expression profiling in clinically defined subgroups of  patients. Malaria patients were included from Dhalai district hospital of Tripura with uncomplicated malaria (UC) and severe malaria (SM) and healthy controls from endemic and non-endemic areas of India. qPCR gene expression analysis was performed for all factors and they were grouped into three clusters based on their altered expressions. The first cluster was downregulated with an increased parasitic burden which included T-BET, GATA3, EOMES, TGF-β, STAT4, STAT6 and cytokines IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-4, IL-, and IL-13. RANTES, IL-8, CCR8, and CXCR3 were decreased in the SM group. The second cluster was upregulated with severity and included TNF-α, IL-10, IL-1β and IL-7. PD-1 and BCL6 were increased in the SM group.

It is now widely appreciated that the innate immune system, and in particular Toll-like receptors (TLRs), contributes to pathological changes in OA joint tissues. Furthermore, it is now also increasingly recognized that TLR signaling plays a key role in initiating and maintaining pain. Here, we reviewed the literature of the past  years with a focus on how TLRs may contribute to joint damage and pain in OA. We discuss biological effects of specific damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which act as TLR ligands in vitro, including direct effects on pain-sensing neurons. We then discuss the phenotype of transgenic mice that target TLR pathways, and provide evidence for a complex balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways activated by OA DAMPs. Finally, we summarize clinical evidence implicating TLRs in OA pathogenesis, including polymorphisms and surrogate markers of disease activity. Our review of the literature led us to propose a model where multi-directional crosstalk between connective tissue cells (chondrocytes, fibroblasts), innate immune cells, and sensory neurons in the affected joint may promote OA pathology and pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615935>High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Triggers Immune Sensitization of Refractory Murine Neuroblastoma to Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy promises unprecedented benefits to cancer patients. However, the majority of cancer types, including high-risk neuroblastoma remain immunologically unresponsive. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive technique that can mechanically fractionate tumors, transforming immunologically 'cold' tumors into responsive 'hot' tumors.We treated <2% of tumor volume in previously unresponsive, large, refractory murine neuroblastoma tumors with mechanical HIFU, and assessed systemic immune response using flow-cytometry, ELISA, and gene sequencing. In addition, we combined this treatment with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to study its effect on the immune response and long-term survival.Combining HIFU with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 significantly enhances anti-tumor response, improving survival from 0 to 62.%. HIFU alone causes upregulation of splenic and lymph node NK cells and circulating IL-2, IFN-Ɣ, and DAMPs, whereas immune regulators like CD4+Foxp3+, IL-10, and VEGF-A are significantly reduced. HIFU combined with checkpoint inhibitors induced significant increases in intratumoral CD4+, CD8ɑ+, and CD8α+CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ in regional lymph nodes, and decrease in circulating IL-10 compared to untreated group. We also report significant abscopal effect following unilateral treatment of mice with large, established bilateral tumors using HIFU and checkpoint inhibitors compared to tumors treated with HIFU or checkpoint inhibitors alone (61.1% survival, p<0.0001). This combination treatment significantly also induces CD4+CD44+CD62L+ and, CD8α+CD44+CD62L+ population and are adoptively transferable imparting , slowing subsequent  tumor engraftment.Mechanical fractionation of tumors using HIFU can effectively induce immune sensitization in a previously unresponsive murine neuroblastoma model, and promises a novel yet efficacious immuno-adjuvant modality to overcome therapeutic resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666701>The clinical KRAS(G12C) inhibitor AMG 510 drives anti-tumour .</a></h2><p>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer and encodes a key signalling protein in tumours. The KRAS(G12C) mutant has a cysteine residue that has been exploited to design covalent inhibitors that have promising preclinical activity. Here we optimized a series of inhibitors, using novel binding interactions to markedly enhance their potency and selectivity. Our efforts have led to the discovery of AMG 510, which is, to our knowledge, the first KRAS(G12C) inhibitor in clinical development. In preclinical analyses, treatment with AMG 510 led to the regression of KRAS tumours and improved the anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents. In immune-competent mice, treatment with AMG 510 resulted in a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment and produced durable cures alone as well as in combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Cured mice rejected the growth of isogenic KRAS tumours, which suggests adaptive  against shared antigens. Furthermore, in clinical trials, AMG 510 demonstrated anti-tumour activity in the first dosing cohorts and represents a potentially transformative therapy for patients for whom effective treatments are lacking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626319>A Comparison of Pneumococcal Nasopharyngeal Carriage in Very Young Fijian Infants Born by Vaginal or Cesarean Delivery.</a></h2><p>Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage is a prerequisite for pneumococcal disease. The main transmission route is from toddlers, who commonly carry pneumococci. However, neonatal pneumococcal disease case reports suggest that vertical pneumococcal transmission may also occur.To describe and compare pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage and density by infant mode of delivery in young Fijian infants.Annual cross-sectional surveys were performed in Suva, Fiji, before the introduction of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10), from September 14 to December 20, 2012, and after PCV10 was introduced, from July 11 to November 19, 2013; July 15 to December 9, 2014; and August 13 to November 19, 2015. Caregivers of 2006 infants aged  to 8 weeks participated in the surveys. Statistical analysis was performed from May 24, 2018, to August 12, 2019.Caregivers provided data on infant mode of delivery and demographics via interviewer-led survey.Pneumococci in swab samples were detected and quantified by lytA quantitative polymerase chain reaction with molecular serotyping by microarray. Pneumococci were categorized as PCV10 or non-PCV10 serotypes.Of the 2006 infants (976 girls and 1030 boys; mean [SD] age, 6.1 [0.02] weeks]), 1742 (86.8%) were born vaginally and 264 were born by cesarean delivery. Infants delivered vaginally, compared with those born by cesarean delivery, had a higher prevalence of overall pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage (470 of 1722 [27.3%; 95% CI, 25.2%-29.4%] vs 47 of 260 [18.1%; 95% CI, 13.6%-23.3%]; P = .002), PCV10 carriage (113 of 1698 [6.7%; 95% CI, .%-7.9%] vs 8 of 256 [3.1%; 95% CI, 1.4%-6.1%]; P = .03), and non-PCV10 carriage (355 of 1698 [20.9%; 95% CI, 19.0%-22.9%] vs 38 of 256 [14.8%; 95% CI, 10.7%-19.8%]; P = .02), and had higher median densities of overall pneumococci (4.9 log10 genome equivalents [GE]/mL [interquartile range, 4.8-.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4. log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.1-4.6 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 pneumococci (4.9 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.7-.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4.4 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.0-4.7 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01). Vaginal delivery was associated with overall (adjusted odds ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.10-2.23]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.01-2.20]; P = .04]) pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage. Vaginal delivery was not associated with PCV10 carriage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.80-3.51]; P = .17). After adjustment, vaginal delivery was not associated with density.Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence and density were higher in infants delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean birth. After adjustment, vaginal delivery was associated with pneumococcal carriage. Differences in carriage by mode of delivery may be due to differential exposure to the vaginal microbiota during delivery and the effect of intrapartum antibiotics during cesarean delivery on the infant microbiome. Our findings also raise the hypothesis that vertical transmission may contribute to pneumococcal acquisition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663692>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 and hepatocellular carcinoma: A retrospective case-control study.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 4 (ADAMTS4) may involve in the pathogenesis of some diseases. However, it is not clear whether they are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A hospital-based case-control study, including 862 cases with HCC and 1120 controls, was conducted to assess the effects of 258 SNPs in the coding regions of ADAMTS4 on HCC risk and prognosis. We found that six SNPs in ADAMTS4 were differential distribution between cases and controls via the primary screening analyses; however, only rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were further identified to modify the risk of HCC (odds ratio: 2.73 and 2.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.28-3.29 and 2.43-3.58; P-value, .73 × 10 and 1.36 × 10 , respectively). Significant interaction between these two SNPs and two known causes of hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin B1 were also observed. Furthermore, rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were associated not only with clinicopathological features of tumor such as tumor stage and grade, microvessel density, and vessel metastasis, but with poor overall survival. Additionally, these SNPs significantly downregulated ADATMS4 expression in tumor tissues. These data suggest that SNPs in the coding region of ADAMTS4, such as rs538321148 and rs1014509103, may be potential biomarkers for predicting HCC risk and prognosis.© 2019 The Authors.

As central components of the complement system, significant effects of thioester-containing protein (TEP) family members on  have been reported in most vertebrates and in some invertebrates, but the spatiotemporal expression and regulatory patterns of TEP family genes under environmental stress have been less widely investigated in scallops. In this study, expression profiling of TEP family members in the Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis (designated PyTEPs) was performed at all developmental stages, in different healthy adult tissues, and in mantles during exposure to different levels of acidification (pH = 6. and 7.) for different time points (3, 6, 12 and 24 h); this profiling was accomplished through in silico analysis of transcriptome and genome databases. Spatiotemporal expression patterns revealed that PyTEPs had specific functional differentiation in all stages of growth and development of the scallop. Expression analysis confirmed the inducible expression patterns of PyTEPs during exposure to acidification. Gene duplication and alternative splicing events simultaneously occurred in PyTEP1. Seven different cDNA variants of PyTEP1 (designated PyTEP1-A-PyTEP1-G) were identified in the scallop mantle transcriptome during acidic stress. These variants were produced by the alternative splicing of seven differentially transcribed exons (exons 18-24), which encode the highly variable central region. The responses to immune stress may have arisen through the gene duplication and alternative splicing of PyTEP1. The sequence diversity of PyTEP1 isoforms and their different expression profiles in response to ocean acidification (OA) suggested a mechanism used by scallops to differentiate and regulate PyTEP1 gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate the gene duplication and alternative splicing of TEP family genes and provide valuable resources for elucidating their versatile roles in bivalve innate immune responses to OA challenge.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, ferroptosis has been believed to be restrained only by the phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH)-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs). The factors which underlie a given cell type's sensitivity to ferroptosis are, however, critical to understand the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis and how it may be exploited for cancer treatment. Although metabolic constraints and phospholipid composition contribute to ferroptosis sensitivity, no cell-autonomous mechanisms have been yet been identified that account for ferroptosis resistance. We undertook an expression cloning approach to identify genes able to complement GPX4 loss. These efforts uncovered the flavoprotein "apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2 (AIFM2)" as a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic gene. AIFM2, hereafter renamed "ferroptosis-suppressor-protein 1" (FSP1), initially described as a pro-apoptotic gene, confers an unprecedented protection against ferroptosis elicited by GPX4 deletion. We further demonstrate that ferroptosis suppression by FSP1 is mediated via ubiquinone (CoQ): its reduced form ubiquinol traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, while FSP1 catalyses its regeneration by using NAD(P)H. Pharmacological targeting of FSP1 strongly synergizes with GPX4 inhibitors to trigger ferroptosis in a number of cancer entities. In conclusion, FSP1/CoQ/NAD(P)H exists as a stand-alone parallel system, which co-operates with GPX4 and glutathione (GSH) to suppress phospholipid peroxidation (pLPO) and ferroptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657480>Preschool wheezing diagnosis and management - survey of physicians' and caregivers' perspective.</a></h2><p>Preschool children with wheezing disorders represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and consume disproportionately large amounts of healthcare resources .

Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal microbiota in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favorable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and .A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at  weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time 2). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results confirmed that the probiotic supplementation was effective in increasing the overall blood biomarkers levels of vitamins, calcium, and mineral absorption from baseline to 10 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo.Probiotics may be suggested as supplements to improve biomarkers serum concentration if administered for a period of at least ≥  weeks.

Samples from non-migrant individuals, Danish-born from Danish parents, were included as comparison. Analysis was carried out using multivariate logistic regression.14,561 first time urine samples were included, with E. coli being the most prevalent bacterial pathogen. Of the identified isolates 4,686/11,737 were E. coli among non-migrants and 1,032/2,824 among migrants.Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim resistance was found in 34.3% (350/1020) of E. coli isolates among migrants and 23.2% (1070/4619) among non-migrant patients (Odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95%CI: 1.47-2.03).

Gentamicin resistance was seen in 10.8% (61/565) and 4.7% (110/2328) of isolates (OR 2.33, 95%CI:1.63-3.34), Cefuroxime resistance in 8.% (87/1019) and 3.4% (158/4618) (OR 2.40, 95%CI:1.77-3.24), Ampicillin resistance in 51.4% and 40.8% (OR 1.65, 95%CI: 1.42-1.92), and Piperacillin-Tazobactam resistance in 6.9 % (30/432) and 4.2% (65/1532) for migrant and non-migrant patients respectively. When stratifying according to migrant status, family-reunited had higher odds of resistance than refugees for Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim, Gentamicin, and Ampicillin.Prevalence of antibiotic resistance was significantly higher in E. coli isolates among migrants, both refugees and family reunited, than non-migrant patients. Differences could not be explained by comorbidity or income. The results emphasise the importance of urine sample testing in both local-born and migrants before antibiotic start-up and points to the benefit of considering migration to secure individual treatment and equal health outcomes.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

With data from varicella notification and surveys on immunization coverage, we used the screening method to estimate dose-specific varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) among preschool children in Hong Kong before universal vaccination. We estimated the VE of one- and two-dose varicella vaccination against all notified varicella as 69.4% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 69.-71.2) and 93.4% (95% CI 91.7-94.7), respectively. We found that VE did not decrease with time since receipt. Varicella vaccine was more effective against complications (85.4% [95% CI 48.8-95.8] for one dose and 100% [95% CI -Inf to 100] for two doses) and against hospital admission (75.2% [95% CI 53.4-86.8] for one dose and 93.1% [95% CI 47.1-99.1] for two doses). Lower protection of one-dose varicella vaccine resulted in breakthrough varicella. Under universal vaccination, second-dose varicella vaccine (given as combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine) was first scheduled for children when they reach primary one (about 6 years of age) and was recently advanced to 18 months of age.

Recently, we established a method to detect CatG activity at the cell surface of natural killer cells by using the activity-based probe MARS116-Bt in flow cytometry. MARS116-Bt consists of biotin, spacer, amino acid sequence, and a phosphonate warhead which binds covalently to the serine amino acid residue within the active center of CatG. Herein, MARS116 was conjugated to (6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) in order to limit non-specific signal-to-noise ratio generally resulting from binding of fluorescein-labelled avidin (avidin-FAM) to biotinylated, intracellular proteins; since MARS116-Bt is incubated with avidin-FAM in a second labelling step. MARS116-FAM was capable to detect intracellular CatG activity, in contrast to the control compound MARS116*-FAM which lacks the functional phosphonate warhead crucial for binding to the active-site of CatG and contains a carboxyl group instead. Furthermore, intracellular CatG activity was determined in CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells as well as in T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets. Thus, MARS116-FAM is a convenient activity-based probe to detect intracellular CatG activity in a flow cytometry approach.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Insight on HBV evolutionary history in the region is limited. We performed a comprehensive epidemiological and phylogenetic reconstruction based on a large cohort of HBV infected patients. Three hundred and nineteen HBV-infected patients with different clinical manifestations, including inactive and active chronic carriers and patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were enrolled in this study. The full-length large S gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine the genotype and subgenotypes of the isolates. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that genotype D is the most dominant genotype among patients. Moreover, this analysis identified two strains with genotype E isolated from active carriers. Detailed phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of four HBV D subgenotypes, D1 (93%, n = 296), D2 (0.02%, n = ), D3 (0.003%, n = 1), and D4 (0.003%, n = 1). In addition, six genotype D strains were not assigned to any existing HBV D subgenotype. The large S gene of eight strains showed signatures of genotype recombination between the genotypes D and A and between D and E. Several strains harbored medically important point mutations at the protein level. Along with the dominance of the HBV genotype D, isolation of the E genotype and several recombinant strains from patients with Saudi Arabian origin is an essential result for decisions involving therapeutic measures for patients. Development of vaccines and detection of diagnostic escape mutations at antigenic epitopes on the HBsAg will be valuable to public health authorities. Furthermore, the diversity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels and different proportions of dN/dS at the PreS1, PreS2, and HBsAg reveal the selective pressure trend from inactive status towards advanced liver diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Few studies have reported the preventable effects of immunoregulators, except for antibiotics, against leptospirosis. Generally, immunostimulatory agents are considered effective for enhancing innate immune responses. Many studies have found that beta-glucan (β-glucan) could be a potent and valuable immunostimulant for improving immune responses and controlling diseases. In this study, we investigated the preventable role of β-glucan against Leptospira infection in hamsters. First, β-glucan was administered 24 h prior to, during and after infection. The results showed that β-glucan increased the survival rate to 100%, alleviated tissue injury, and decreased leptospire loads in target organs. Additionally, we found using quantitative real-time PCR that application of β-glucan significantly enhanced the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, interleukin (IL)-1β and iNOS at 2 dpi (days post infection) and reduced the increase of TLR2, IL-1β and iNOS induced by Leptospira at  dpi. Furthermore, to induce memory , β-glucan was administered  days prior to infection. β-Glucan also significantly increased the survival rates and ameliorated pathological damage to organs. Moreover, we demonstrated that β-glucan-trained macrophages exhibited elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) in vitro, indicating that β-glucan induces an enhanced inflammatory response against Leptospira infection. These results indicate that administration of β-glucan and other immunostimulants could be potential valuable options for the control of Leptospira infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674648>What Is the Evidence to Support a Correlate of Protection for Measles? A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Many studies assume that the serologic correlate of protection from measles disease is 120 mIU/mL. We systematically reviewed the literature to examine the evidence supporting this correlate of protection.We searched peer-reviewed and gray literature for articles reporting a measles correlate of protection. We excluded studies focusing on special populations, infants aged <9 months, and those using animal models or nonstandard vaccines or administration routes. We extracted and synthesized data from full-text articles that met inclusion criteria.We screened 14 778 articles and included  studies in our review. The studies reported either preexposure antibody concentrations of individuals along with a description of symptoms postexposure, or the proportion of measles cases that had preexposure antibody concentrations above a threshold of  specified by the authors. Some studies also described secondary antibody responses upon exposure. The variation in laboratory methods between studies made comparisons difficult. Some of the studies that assumed 120 mIU/mL as a correlate of protection identified symptomatic individuals with preexposure titers exceeding this threshold.Our findings underscore the scant data upon which the commonly used 120 mIU/mL measles threshold of protection is based, suggesting that further work is required to characterize the measles  threshold.© Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Public Health Ontario, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621661>Predictors of mortality in outborns with neonatal sepsis: A prospective observational study.</a></h2><p>Neonatal sepsis-related mortalities are the outcome of a complex interaction of maternal-foetal colonisation, transplacental  and physical and cellular defence mechanisms of neonates.The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of mortality in outborn neonatal sepsis.A 1-year prospective observational study was undertaken at a tertiary care centre.

It is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for residents of endemic areas and travelers to risk areas. In 2013, the WHO discontinued the recommendation of booster doses every 10 years, indicating a single dose as sufficient for lifelong protection.Considering the lower immune response to YF vaccine in children compared to adults, this study was set out to assess the duration of  to YF in children vaccinated in the first two years of life.This cross-sectional study involved children aged 9 months to 12 years with accessible vaccination records recruited in primary care units from a metropolitan area in Southeast Brazil. The serologic status (negative, indeterminate and positive), and geometric mean titers (GMT, inverse dilution) of neutralizing antibodies against YF obtained by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test was assessed across categories of time after YF vaccination. The strength of association of seropositivity with time was assessed by the odds ratio (OR) taking recent vaccination (1-6 months) as reference.A total of 824 children recruited from August 2010 to July 2011were tested. The proportion of seropositivity (95% C.I.) and GMT (95% C.I.) dropped markedly across time periods: from 86.7% (80.-91.4%), GMT 47.9 (38.3-59.9) in newly vaccinated to 59.0% (49.7-67.8%), GMT 14.8 (11.6-19.1) and 42.2% (33.8-51.0), GMT 8.6 (7.1-12.1), respectively in the subgroups vaccinated 31-72 months and 73-100 months before.Analogous to previous findings in adults, these data support the need for revaccination of children living in areas with yellow fever virus circulation in humans or in other primates. The data also supported the change of a booster dose to 4 years of age for those primarily vaccinated for yellow fever in the first two years of life.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we demonstrate that circRNAs are involved in the rice-M. oryzae interaction using comparative circRNA-seq and transgenic approaches. We identified 2932 high-conﬁdence circRNAs from young leaves of the blast-resistant accession International Rice Blast Line Pyricularia-Kanto51-m-Tsuyuake (IRBLkm-Ts, IR25) and the blast-susceptible accession Lijiangxin Tuan Heigu (LTH) under M. oryzae-infected or uninfected conditions; 636 were detected specifically upon M. oryzae infection. The circRNAs in IR25 were significantly more diverse than those in LTH, especially under M. oryzae infection. Particularly, the number of circRNAs generated per parent gene was much higher in IR25 than in LTH and increased in IR25 but decreased in LTH upon M. oryzae infection. The higher diversity of circRNAs in IR25 was further associated with more frequent 3' and ' alternative back-splicing and usage of complex splice sites. Moreover, a subset of circRNAs was differentially responsive to M. oryzae in IR25 and LTH. We further confirmed that circR5g05160 promotes rice  against M. oryzae. Therefore, our data indicate that circRNA diversity is associated with different responses to M. oryzae infection in rice and provide a starting point to investigate a new layer of regulation in the rice-M. oryzae interaction.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

However, the functions of RING finger proteins are still poorly understood in crustaceans. Previously, we found that the transcript of a homolog of RING finger protein 152 (CqRNF152-like) was up-regulated in a differentially expressed transcriptome library of the haematopietic tissue (Hpt) cells from red claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus upon white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection, which is one of the most devastating viral diseases for crustaceans like shrimp and crayfish. The full-length cDNA sequence of CqRNF152-like was then identified with 975 bp, including an ORF of 685 bp that encoded a 195 amino acids protein, a '- UTR of 180 bp, and a 3'-UTR with a poly (A) tail of 207 bp. The conserved domain prediction showed that CqRNF152-like contained a conserved RING-finger domain. Gene expression analysis showed that CqRNF152-like was distributed in all tissues examined and the transcript is significantly up-regulated after WSSV challenge both in vivo in Hpt tissue and in vitro in cultured Hpt cells. Furthermore, the transcripts of both an immediate early gene ie1 and a late envelope protein gene vp28 of WSSV were clearly increased in the Hpt tissues, hemocytes and cultured Hpt cells after gene silencing of CqRNF152-like, which were further proved to be significantly decreased after overloading of recombinant CqRNF152-like protein in Hpt cell cultures. Meanwhile, CqRNF152-like was found to bind with WSSV envelope protein VP28 by proteins pull-down assay. Similar to most of RNF proteins, CqRNF152-like protein sequence contained a conserved RING-finger domain and showed self-ubiquitination activity in a RING finger domain dependent manner. Taken together, CqRNF152-like is likely to function as an antiviral molecular against WSSV infection through interaction with the envelope protein VP28 in a crustacean C. quadricarinatus. This is the first report that a RING finger protein with directly antiviral functions via interaction with viral protein and self-ubiquitination activity in crustacean, which sheds new light on the molecular mechanism of WSSV infection and the control of white spot disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

An alternative treatment to control this pathogen is the modulation of the innate immune response of the host. The Mexican avocado ( var. drymifolia) is a source of molecules with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Hence, we analyze the effect of a lipid-rich extract from avocado seed (LEAS) on  internalization into bMECs and their innate  response. The effects of LEAS (1-500 ng/ml) on the  growth and bMEC viability were assessed by turbidimetry and MTT assays, respectively. LEAS did not show neither antimicrobial nor cytotoxic effects.  internalization into bMECs was analyzed by gentamicin protection assays. Interestingly, LEAS (1-200 ng/ml) decreased bacterial internalization (60-80%) into bMECs. This effect correlated with NO production and the induction of the gene expression of IL-10, while the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF- was reduced. These effects could be related to the inhibition of MAPK p38 (∼60%) activation by LEAS. In conclusion, our results showed that LEAS inhibits the  internalization into bMECs and modulates the IIR, which indicates that avocado is a source of metabolites for control of mastitis pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Marisol Báez-Magaña et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618441>Novel genetic variants in KIF16B and NEDD4L in the endosome-related genes are associated with non-small cell lung cancer survival.</a></h2><p>The endosome is a membrane-bound organ inside most eukaryotic cells, playing an important role in adaptive  by delivering endocytosed antigens to both MHC class I and II pathways. Here, by analyzing two published genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we evaluated associations between genetic variants in the endosome-related gene-set and survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The discovery included 44,112 (3,478 genotyped and 40,634 imputed) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 220 genes in a single locus analysis for their associations with survival of 1,185 NSCLC patients from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. After validation of the 821 survival-associated significant SNPs in additional 984 NSCLC patients from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility study, 14 SNPs remained significant. The final multivariate stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model in the PLCO datasets identified three potentially functional and independent SNPs (KIF16B rs1555195 C>T, NEDD4L rs11660748 A>G and rs73440898 A>G) with an adjusted hazards ratio (HR) of 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.79-0.94, P=0.0007], 1.31 (1.16-1.47, P=6.0×10 ) and 1.27 (1.12-1.44, P=0.0001) for overall survival (OS), respectively. Combined analysis of the adverse genotypes of these three SNPs revealed a trend in the genotype-survival association (P <0.0001 for OS and P <0.0001 for disease-specific survival). Furthermore, the survival-associated KIF16B rs1555195T allele was significantly associated with decreased mRNA expression levels of KIF16B in both lung tissues and blood cells. Therefore, genetic variants of the endosome-related genes may be biomarker for NSCLC survival, possibly through modulating the expression of corresponding genes.

BRD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in all classes of cattle but particularly young beef and dairy calves.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an adjuvanted modified live virus (MLV) vaccine in the presence of well-defined maternal passive . Calves were vaccinated at approximately 1 month of age and challenged ~90 days later when BRSV systemic antibodies were ≤1:4. Body temperature was lower at 6 and 7 days post challenge and other clinical signs were also lower in the vaccinates. Nasal viral shed was 3-4 times lower in the vaccinated animals as measured by virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and peaked  days post challenge compared to the controls (who peaked at days 6 and 7). On day 8 following challenge, animals were necropsied, and lung lobes were scored and tested for virus by PCR and indirect fluorescent assay (IFA). There was a 25-fold reduction in PCR virus detection in vaccinates and two of the vaccinated calves' lungs were PCR negative. Only 29.4% of vaccinated calves were BRSV positive on IFA testing at necropsy, while 87.% of control calves were BRSV positive. Vaccinated calves developed a mucosal BRSV IgA response with over 50% of the vaccinated calves having IgA prior to challenge and all vaccinated calves were positive following challenge. Additionally, vaccination stimulated the production of Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in mononuclear cells to prime the immune system.

We hypothesised that contact differences may contribute to ethnic differences in pneumococcal carriage prevalence and density.In 2015, young infants (-8 weeks), toddlers (12-23 months), children (2-6 years), and caregivers from Suva and surrounding areas, participated in a cross-sectional survey (n = 2014), three years post pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction. Demographic and contact data, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. Pneumococci were detected, and quantified using quantitative real-time PCR, with molecular serotyping by microarray. Associations between ethnicity, contact, and pneumococcal carriage and density were estimated using multivariable generalised estimating equation regression models.iTaukei participants had larger household sizes, higher pneumococcal carriage rates, more contacts, and more frequent contacts of longer duration, compared with FID. The odds of vaccine-type carriage increased by 28% (95% CI 8-53%) P < 0.01 in association with physical contact with 7-14 year old children. iTaukei ethnicity was associated with vaccine-type carriage (aOR) 1.73; 95% CI 1.06-2.82, P = 0.03) and non-vaccine type carriage (aOR .98; 95% CI 4.47-8.00, P < 0.01).

However, our understanding concerning protein nuclear import is incomplete. Here we report that a cellular purine synthesis enzyme inhibits protein nuclear import via deamidation. Employing human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) to probe the role of protein deamidation, we identified a purine synthesis enzyme, phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthetase (PFAS) that inhibits KSHV transcriptional activation. PFAS deamidates the replication transactivator (RTA), a transcription factor crucial for KSHV lytic replication. Mechanistically, deamidation of two asparagines flanking a positively charged nuclear localization signal impaired the binding of RTA to an importin β subunit, thus diminishing RTA nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. Finally, RTA proteins of all gamma herpesviruses appear to be regulated by PFAS-mediated deamidation. These findings uncover an unexpected function of a metabolic enzyme in restricting viral replication and a key role of deamidation in regulating protein nuclear import.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here, we generated a murine brain atlas of serotonin (-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) levels using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). We found several nuclei rich in both -HT and a catecholamine (DA or NE) and identified the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), where -HT and NE are co-localized. The analysis of -HT fluctuations in response to acute tryptophan depletion and infusion of isotope-labeled tryptophan in vivo revealed a close kinetic association between the raphe nuclei, PVT, and amygdala but not the other nuclei. Our findings imply the existence of a highly dynamic -HT-mediated raphe to PVT pathway that likely plays a role in the brain monoamine system.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Like most organisms, the acquisition of nutrient iron is necessary for its survival. One route by which it obtains this metal is through the iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system that scavenges iron from the hemoglobin of the host. We show that the heavy chain variable region  gene commonly encodes human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting IsdB-NEAT2. Remarkably, these antibodies bind to multiple antigenic sites. One class of -encoded mAbs blocks  heme acquisition by binding to the heme-binding site of NEAT2, while two additional classes reduce the bacterial burden  by an alternative Fc receptor-mediated mechanism. We further identified clonal lineages of -encoded mAbs using donor samples, showing that each lineage diversifies during infection by somatic hypermutation. These studies reveal that encoded antibodies contribute to a protective immune response, furthering our understanding of the correlates of protection against  infection. The human pathogen  causes a wide range of infections, including skin abscesses and sepsis. There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent  infection, and its treatment has become increasingly difficult due to antibiotic resistance. One potential way to inhibit  pathogenesis is to prevent iron acquisition. The iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system has evolved in  to acquire hemoglobin from the human host as a source of heme-iron. In this study, we investigated the molecular and structural basis for antibody-mediated correlates against a member of the Isd system, IsdB. The association of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region  gene-encoded human monoclonal antibodies with the response against  IsdB is described using structural and functional studies to define the importance of this antibody class. We also determine that somatic hypermutation in the development of these antibodies hinders rather than fine-tunes the immune response to IsdB.Copyright © 2019 Bennett et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671185>Making the cut(s): how Cas12a cleaves target and non-target DNA.</a></h2><p>CRISPR-Cas12a (previously named Cpf1) is a prokaryotic deoxyribonuclease that can be programmed with an RNA guide to target complementary DNA sequences. Upon binding of the target DNA, Cas12a induces a nick in each of the target DNA strands, yielding a double-stranded DNA break. In addition to inducing cis-cleavage of the targeted DNA, target DNA binding induces trans-cleavage of non-target DNA. As such, Cas12a-RNA guide complexes can provide sequence-specific  against invading nucleic acids such as bacteriophages and plasmids. Akin to CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been repurposed as a genetic tool for programmable genome editing and transcriptional control in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In addition, its trans-cleavage activity has been applied for high-sensitivity nucleic acid detection. Despite the demonstrated value of Cas12a for these applications, the exact molecular mechanisms of both cis- and trans-cleavage of DNA were not completely understood. Recent studies have revealed mechanistic details of Cas12a-mediates DNA cleavage: base pairing of the RNA guide and the target DNA induces major conformational changes in Cas12a. These conformational changes render Cas12a in a catalytically activated state in which it acts as deoxyribonuclease. This deoxyribonuclease activity mediates cis-cleavage of the displaced target DNA strand first, and the RNA guide-bound target DNA strand second. As Cas12a remains in the catalytically activated state after cis-cleavage, it subsequently demonstrates trans-cleavage of non-target DNA. Here, I review the mechanistic details of Cas12a-mediated cis- and trans-cleavage of DNA. In addition, I discuss how bacteriophage-derived anti-CRISPR proteins can inhibit Cas12a activity.© 2019 The Author(s).

Th2 cells are central players in  to helminths and are implicated in mediating the inflammatory pathology associated with allergies. The differentiation of Th2 cells is dependent on transcription factors such as GATA3 and STAT6, which prime Th2 cells for the secretion of interleukin- (IL-) 4, IL-, and IL-13. Several lines of work now suggest that differentiating Th2 cells in the lymph node are potent IL-4 cytokine producers, but do not become competent IL-- and IL-13-producing cells until after receiving cues from non-lymphoid tissue. It is evident that Th2 cells that enter tissues undergo considerable changes in chromatin architecture and gene expression, and that over this time, the metabolic requirements of these cells change considerably. Herein, we discuss the metabolic requirements of Th2 cells during their early and late differentiation, focusing on the impact of glucose and lipid metabolism, mTOR activation, the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ and several metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Stark, Tibbitt and Coquet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589876>Immunogenicity of Cas9 Protein.</a></h2><p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) form the adaptive immune system in archaea and bacteria and have been modified for genome engineering in eukaryotic cells. CRISPR systems contain 2 components, a single-guide RNA, which is a short RNA composed of a 20 nucleotide sequence that targets specific sites in the genomic DNA and a scaffold necessary for its binding to the CRISPR-associated endonuclease (Cas9). Because of its high efficiency and accuracy, the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing based therapies are poised to treat a multitude of human diseases with a promise to target previously "undruggable" proteins. As the first in-body clinical trial with CRISPR-Cas9 is embarked on, the risks associated with administering the genome editing machinery to patients become increasingly relevant. Recent studies have demonstrated an innate and adaptive cellular immune response to Cas9 in mouse models and the presence of anti-Cas9 antibodies and T-cells in human plasma. Pre-existing  against therapeutic Cas9 delivery could decrease its efficacy in vivo and may pose significant safety issues. This review focuses on the immunogenicity of the Cas9 protein and summarizes potential approaches to circumvent the problem of immune recognition.Copyright © 2019 American Pharmacists Association®.

We aimed to establish which of three revaccination regimens is most effective at inducing protective  METHODS: Healthy adults (aged 18-80 years) from 16 Dutch centres (13 public health services, two university hospitals, and one travel clinic) were included in this multicentre, parallel group, randomised, controlled, superiority trial. The inclusion criterion was vaccine non-response (hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] titre <10 IU/L) after a primary series with three doses of one type of recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B virus (either HBVaxPro-10 or Engerix-B at months 0, 1, and 6). Participants were individually randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to a vaccination series of repeated initial vaccination (HBVaxPro 10 μg or Engerix-B 20 μg) as the control, or to Twinrix 20 μg, Fendrix 20 μg, or HBVaxPro 40 μg. We used a web-based randomisation programme, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. Participants and centres were unmasked to assignment after randomisation. Laboratory staff and investigators were masked to vaccine-group assignment. All revaccination schedules were identical, with intramuscular vaccinations at 0, 1, and 2 months. Anti-HBs was measured at 0, 1, 2, and 3 months. The primary outcome was the percentage of responders (anti-HBs titres ≥10 IU/L) at 3 months. Immunogenicity and safety analyses were based on an intention-to-vaccinate analysis, the immunogenicity analysis with last observation carried forward for missing data, and the Bonferroni and the Benjamini-Hochberg method were applied to correct for multiple testing. The trial was registered in the Dutch National Trial Register and inclusion has been stopped (identifier NL3011; EudraCT-number 2011-005627-40).The participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017. 480 participants were randomly assigned and included in intention-to-vaccinate analyses: 124 (26%) to control, 118 (25%) to Twinrix, 114 (24%) to HBVaxPro-40, and 124 (26%) to Fendrix. At month 3 the percentage of responders was 83 (67%) of 124 (95% CI 57·9-75·1 in the control group, 94 (80%) of the 118 (71·3-86·) in the Twinrix group, 95 (83%) of 114 (75·2-89·7) in the HBVaxPro-40 group, and 108 (87%) of 124 (79·9-92·4) in the Fendrix group. Compared with the control group, the percentage of responders was superior for the HBVaxPro-40 group (adjusted difference 21·6% [95% CI 10·4-32·7], p=0·0204 [Bonferroni corrected p value]) and the Fendrix group (26·3% [15·4-37·3], p=0·0006), but not the Twinrix group (25·0% [13·0-37·0]; p=0·0846). One serious adverse event occurred (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) in the Fendrix group, which was not attributed to the vaccine.Revaccinating healthy non-responders with Fendrix or HBVaxPro-40 resulted in significantly higher proportions of responders and therefore indication for these vaccines should be expanded to enable revaccination of non-responders.National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The main analysis compared adults with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving ustekinumab with tumour necrosis-α inhibitors (TNFi: etanercept and adalimumab) while the secondary analyses compared ustekinumab, etanercept, or methotrexate against adalimumab. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using overlap weights by propensity score to balance baseline covariates among comparison groups.We included ,468 biologic-naïve patients subsequently exposed (951 ustekinumab; 1,313 etanercept; and 3,204 adalimumab) in the main analysis. The secondary analyses also included 2,189 patients receiving methotrexate. The median (p25 - p75) follow up times for patients using ustekinumab, TNFi, adalimumab, etanercept and methotrexate were: 2.01 (1.16 - 3.21), 1.93 (1.05 - 3.34), 1.94 (1.09 - 3.32), 1.92 (0.93 - 3.45) and 1.43 (0.84 - 2.53) years, respectively. Ustekinumab, TNFi, adalimumab, etanercept and methotrexate groups had 7, 29, 23, 6 and 9 patients experiencing major CVEs, respectively. No differences in the risk of major CVEs were observed between biologic therapies (adjusted HR for ustekinumab vs TNFi: 0.96 [95%CI 0.41 - 2.22]; ustekinumab vs adalimumab: 0.81 [0.30 - 2.17]; etanercept vs adalimumab: 0.81 [0.28 - 2.30]) and methotrexate against adalimumab (1.05 [0.34 - 3.28]).In this large prospective cohort study, we found no significant differences in the risk of major CVEs between three different biologic therapies and methotrexate.

Long considered to be a "wear and tear" disease, OA is now seen as a low-grade inflammation disease that affects all tissues of the joint, involving cartilage degradation, bone remodelling, osteophytes, and synovitis. The process, called inflammaging, is characterised by the association of low-grade inflammation, profound changes in intra-cellular mechanisms, and the decreased efficiency of the immune system with ageing. The activation of innate  plays a critical role in the development and progression of OA. Innate , including inflammasome activation, is triggered by small endogenous molecules called alarmins or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These molecules are released in the extracellular media after cell stress or damage, bind to pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and activate the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, leading to joint inflammation. Moreover, such sterile inflammation triggers cell senescence, characterised by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Understanding the substantial age-related changes of joint tissues that influence the pathogenesis of OA is critical to improving the quality of life of elderly people in the context of increased life expectancy. This review will focus on age-related sterile inflammation in OA and highlight the various innovative and promising therapies targeting the mechanisms of aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634382>Diet modulates cecum bacterial diversity and physiological phenotypes across the BXD mouse genetic reference population.</a></h2><p>The BXD family has become one of the preeminent genetic reference populations to understand the genetic and environmental control of phenotypic variation. Here we evaluate the responses to different levels of fat in the diet using both chow diet (CD, 13-18% fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD, 45-60% fat). We studied cohorts of BXD strains, both inbred parents C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (commonly known as B6 and D2, respectively), as well as B6D2 and D2B6 reciprocal F1 hybrids. The comparative impact of genetic and dietary factors was analyzed by profiling a range of phenotypes, most prominently their cecum bacterial composition. The parents of the BXDs and F1 hybrids express limited differences in terms of weight and body fat gain on CD. In contrast, the strain differences on HFD are substantial for percent body fat, with DBA/2J accumulating 12.% more fat than C57BL/6J (P < 0.0001). The F1 hybrids born to DBA/2J dams (D2B6F1) have 10.6% more body fat (P < 0.001) than those born to C57BL/6J dams. Sequence analysis of the cecum microbiota reveals important differences in bacterial composition among BXD family members with a substantial shift in composition caused by HFD. Relative to CD, the HFD induces a decline in diversity at the phylum level with a substantial increase in Firmicutes (+13.8%) and a reduction in Actinobacteria (-7.9%). In the majority of BXD strains, the HFD also increases cecal sIgA (P < 0.0001)-an important component of the adaptive  response against microbial pathogens. Host genetics modulates variation in cecum bacterial composition at the genus level in CD, with significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Oscillibacter mapped to Chr 3 (18.7-19.2 Mb, LRS = 21.4) and for Bifidobacterium mapped to Chr 6 (89.21-89.37 Mb, LRS = 19.4). Introduction of HFD served as an environmental suppressor of these QTLs due to a reduction in the contribution of both genera (P < 0.001). Relations among liver metabolites and cecum bacterial composition were predominant in CD cohort, but these correlations do not persist following the shift to HFD. Overall, these findings demonstrate the important impact of environmental/dietary manipulation on the relationships between host genetics, gastrointestinal bacterial composition, immunological parameters, and metabolites-knowledge that will help in the understanding of the causal sources of metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618654>Transcriptional Atlas of Intestinal Immune Cells Reveals that Neuropeptide α-CGRP Modulates Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cell Responses.</a></h2><p>Signaling abnormalities in immune responses in the small intestine can trigger chronic type 2 inflammation involving interaction of multiple immune cell types. To systematically characterize this response, we analyzed 58,067 immune cells from the mouse small intestine by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) at steady state and after induction of a type 2 inflammatory reaction to ovalbumin (OVA). Computational analysis revealed broad shifts in both cell-type composition and cell programs in response to the inflammation, especially in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Inflammation induced the expression of exon  of Calca, which encodes the alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP), in intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. α-CGRP antagonized KLRG1 ILC2s proliferation but promoted IL- expression. Genetic perturbation of α-CGRP increased the proportion of intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s.

These range from microbial deposit and filter feeders, micro and macrophagous algal feeders, omnivores to herbivorous leaf litter and wood feeders. Endo-β-1,4-glucanase from glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9) digests cellulose like β-1,4-glucans from a range of materials. As it hydrolyses crystalline cellulose very slowly, it is a poor cellulase. Where tested, the enzyme has dual endo-β-1,4-glucanase and lichenase activity. Its presence does not necessarily indicate the ability of an animal to digest cellulose. It only indicates the ability to digest β-1,4-glucans and its function, which is discussed in this review, should be considered with reference to the substrates present in the diet. β-1,3-glucanase (laminarinase) belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (GH16) and hydrolyses β-1.3-glucans. These polysaccharides are present in the cell walls of algae, protozoans and yeast, and they also occur as storage polysaccharides within protozoans and algae. Depending on their site of expression, these enzymes may function as a digestive enzyme or may be involved in innate . Enzymes present in the digestive fluids or tissues, would be digestive. Haemolymph GH16 proteins may be involved in innate  through the activation of the phenol oxidase system. Insect GH16 proteins expressed within the haemolymph have lost their catalytic residues and function as β-glucan binding proteins. In contrast, crustacean GH16 proteins expressed within the same tissue, have retained the catalytic residues and thus possibly their β-1,3-glucanase activity. The potential function of which is discussed. Endo-β-1,4-mannase from glycosyl hydrolase family , subfamily 10 (GH5_10) hydrolyses mannan, glucomannan and galactomannan. These hemicelluloses are present in the cell walls of plants and algae and also function as storage polysaccharides within legume and palm seeds. They are digestive enzymes whose high expression in some species suggests they are a major contributor to hemicellulose digestion.

To examine the dynamics and locale of the adaptation process of avian influenza viruses when introduced to a mammalian host, we infected ferrets with H5N1 viruses. As expected, all ferrets infected with the human H5N1 isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 showed severe disease and virus replication outside the respiratory tract in multiple organs including the brain. In contrast infection of ferrets with the avian H5N1 virus A/Chicken/Laos/Xaythiani26/2006 showed a different collective pattern of infection; many ferrets developed and cleared a mild respiratory infection but a subset (25-50%), showed extended replication in the upper respiratory tract and developed infection in distal sites. Virus from these severely infected ferrets was commonly found in tissues that included liver and small intestine. In most instances the virus had acquired the common virulence substitution PB2 E627K but, in one case, a previously unidentified combination of two amino acid substitutions at PB2 S489P and NP V408I, which enhanced polymerase activity, was found. We noted that virus with high pathogenicity adaptations could be dominant in an extra-respiratory site without being equally represented in the nasal wash. Further ferret passage of these mutated viruses resulted in high pathogenicity in all ferrets. These findings illustrate the remarkable ability of avian influenza viruses that avoid clearance in the respiratory tract, to mutate towards a high pathogenicity phenotype during just a single passage in ferrets and also indicate a window of less than  days in which treatment may curtail systemic infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634190>Immune checkpoint inhibitors in people living with HIV: what about anti-HIV effects?</a></h2><p>: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) have shown major therapeutic successes when used in various cancers. In the HIV field a double benefit of such ICPi should result from their dual ability to restore in-vitro HIV-specific CD8 T-cell functions and to enhance HIV production from reservoir cells, thus fulfilling the goals of the 'shock and kill' concept proposed as an HIV cure therapeutic strategy.We conducted a systematic review to identify studies reporting the tolerance profile of ICPi and their effects on HIV plasma loads (pVL), CD4 count, HIV reservoirs (cell-associated HIV-DNA) and/or HIV-specific CD8 T in PLWH.Thirty-four articles were included for a total 176 participants. 12.1% participants experienced severe adverse events and 49.4% nonsevere adverse events. pVL remained stable in 91.9% participant, showed increases in .8% participant, and decreases in 2.3%. CD4 count remained stable in 60.7% participants, showed increases in 24.6%, and decreases in 14.7%. Regarding ICPi effects on HIV-DNA and HIV-specific , we identified three distinct profiles: profile I, transient pVL increases followed by a boost in HIV-specific CD8 T cells concomitant to a decrease in HIV-DNA, reported in one participant. Profile II: increase in HIV-specific CD8 T cells without changes in pVL or HIV-DNA, reported in three participants.

However, it needs further investigation to study how to delay release of aspirin for a long time and enable to promote bone regeneration. Herein, we demonstrated that the longterm delayed release pattern of aspirin through the construction of microsphere scaffolds is promising to achieve the excellent bone regeneration.Here we synthesized three kinds of scaffolds as follows: (1) aspirin loaded calcium silicate (CaSiO) microsphere (CaSiO-aspirin) via simple immersion; (2) aspirin loaded polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microsphere (PLGA-aspirin) via oil/water (O/W) emulsion; (3) aspirin loaded PLGA-CaSiO scaffold (PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin) via O/W emulsion, optimal morphology and structure of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin scaffold was acquired through modulating the ratio between PLGA and CaSiO. Furthermore, spectrophotometer was used to monitor the concentration of the extract of the three scaffolds for different releasing time, including 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 13, 17, 21, 24, 30, 36, and 45 days, aspirin loading efficiency and its accumulation releasing curves were both achieved according to the concentration of aspirin. Their sustained release effects of aspirin were evaluated eventually.Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) results showed that the surface structure of the three kinds of scaffolds were smooth and had uniform size distribution. In addition, a small amount of PLGA-aspirin microspheres occurred to aggregation, while a small amount of CaSiO-aspirin microspheres were broken. Moreover, the PLGA-aspirin microspheres in the PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin scaffolds were uniformly adhered to the surface of CaSiO microspheres. The aspirin loadings of CaSiO-aspirin, PLGA-aspirin, and PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin were (1.06±0.04)%, (7.05±0.06)%, and (6.75±0.18)%, respectively. In addition, their corresponding time for releasing 95% of aspirin was 3, 24, and 36 days, respectively. The releasing time of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin was longer than that of the others and the releasing rate was more stable.The microsphere scaffold of PLGA-CaSiO-aspirin composites has excellent delayedrelease effect on aspirin, which is promising for using as osteogenic materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612142>Modeling the Impact of Newcastle Disease Virus Vaccinations on Chicken Production Systems in Northeastern Madagascar.</a></h2><p>Chickens are a key source of nutrition for rural Malagasy communities. Due to high endemic rates of Newcastle disease, it remains challenging to raise sustainable chicken flocks as a consistent food source. Here, we explore the impact of triannual Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine interventions on the growth and herd  acquisition of Malagasy chicken flocks. Between 2011 and 2018 we collected longitudinal data to assess the population dynamics of chicken populations in remote Malagasy communities. In 2016, we launched a pilot campaign for vaccination in six rural communities to determine the impacts on chicken survivorship and productivity. We used these data to specify a mathematical model of realistic Malagasy chicken population dynamics under a triannual vaccination regime. The mathematical model represents an extension to conventional SIR models that allows for modeling the impact of specific vaccinations on chicken flock dynamics, rather than estimation of parameters. Understanding chicken population dynamics is important for realizing the potential for domestic chicken flocks to serve as sustainable food sources. The results suggested that vaccination coverage of at least ~40% is necessary over + years to achieve population doubling, while complete herd  may not be possible given the short duration of effectiveness of vaccination, and the high levels of births and deaths in the chicken flocks.Copyright © 2019 Annapragada, Borgerson, Iams, Ravelomanantsoa, Crawford, Helin, Anjaranirina, Randriamady and Golden.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609562>[Diphtheria: a 'forgotten' disease?]</a></h2><p>Respiratory diphtheria is an acute respiratory tract infection.

Understanding how our closest evolutionary relatives, nonhuman primates (NHPs), confront pathogens and how these responses have evolved over time could shed light on host range barriers, especially for zoonotic infections. Here, we analyzed cell-intrinsic  of primary cells from the broadest panel of NHP species interrogated to date, including humans, great apes, and Old and New World monkeys. Our analysis of their transcriptomes after poly(I:C) transfection revealed conservation in the functional consequences of their response. In mapping reads to either the human or the species-specific genomes, we observed that with the current state of NHP annotations, the percent of reads assigned to a genetic feature was largely similar regardless of the method. Together, these data provide a baseline for the cell-intrinsic responses elicited by a potent immune stimulus across multiple NHP donors, including endangered species, and serve as a resource for refining and furthering the existing annotations of NHP genomes.© 2019 Gaska et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669282>p38 MAPK is involved in the immune response to pathogenic Vibrio in the clam Meretrix petechialis.</a></h2><p>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in the response to various extracellular stimuli via regulating gene expression. In the present study, a p38 MAPK gene (MpP38) was identified from the clam Meretrix petechialis. The full-length cDNA of MpP38 measures 1,720 bp, consisting of a 134-bp '-UTR, a 1,095-bp ORF and a 491-bp 3'-UTR. Both the mRNA and protein expression levels of MpP38 increased after Vibrio challenge, implying that MpP38 is involved in clam . Based on our previous study, a transcription factor activated by p38 MAPK, i.e. microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), participated in clam  by regulating the expression of phenoloxidase (PO). Coupled with other related reports, the mechanism underlying the involvement of MpP38 in clam  is most likely that pathogen stimuli induce the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and thus activate MITF to regulate the expression of the immune-related gene PO. The results obtained in this study support this mechanism. First, we found that the MpP38 phosphorylation level increased in response to Vibrio challenge. Second, as revealed by a yeast two-hybrid assay, there was a direct interaction between MpP38 and MITF. Meanwhile, inhibiting the phosphorylation of MpP38 decreased the phosphorylation level of MpMITF, implying that MpP38 phosphorylation is required for MpMITF activation. Additionally, our results showed that there was a regulatory relationship between MpP38 phosphorylation level and PO expression level. With increased MpP38 phosphorylation level, the PO expression level was also increased after Vibrio challenge; when MpP38 phosphorylation was inhibited, the PO expression level was significantly decreased. This study describes the immune function of p38 MAPK in the clam for the first time and analyses its potential underlying mechanism, which will help to elucidate the immune mechanism in the clam M. petechialis.Copyright © 2019.

Paired blood samples were collected shortly after onset of the measles outbreak and after the outbreak. A questionnaire was used to document the likelihood of exposure to MV and occurrence of measles-like symptoms. All blood samples were tested for MV-specific antibodies with five different assays. Correlates of protection were assessed by considering the lowest neutralizing antibody levels in children without MV infection, and by ROC analyses. Among 91 participants, two seronegative children (2%) developed measles, and an additional 19 (23%) experienced subclinical MV infection. The correlate of protection against measles was lower than 0.345 IU/mL. We observed a decreasing attack rate of subclinical MV infection with increasing levels of specific antibodies until 2.1 IU/mL, above which no subclinical MV infections were detected. The ROC analyses found a correlate of protection of 1.71 IU/mL (95% CI 1.01-2.11) for subclinical MV infection. Our correlates of protection were consistent with previous estimates. This information supports the analyses of serosurveys to detect  gaps that require targeted intervention strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596761>Exposure to Anti-tumor Necrosis Factor Medications Increases the Incidence of Pouchitis After Restorative Proctocolectomy in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h2><p>Pouchitis is the most frequent complication after IPAA in patients with ulcerative colitis. Antibiotics represent the mainstay of treatment, suggesting a crucial role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of this condition. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents have been shown to adversely impact the gut microbiome and local host .The aim of this study is to assess the effect of prior exposure to biologics on the development of pouchitis in patients who have ulcerative colitis.This is a retrospective case-control study.This study was conducted at a tertiary-care IBD center.Consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent restorative proctocolectomy between 2000 and 2010 were included.The primary outcome measured was the incidence of pouchitis.Four hundred seventeen patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent IPAA were included. The incidence of pouchitis was 40.4%. There were no differences in patient demographics, disease-specific factors, surgical approach, and short-term postoperative complications between patients who developed pouchitis compared to those that did not. Patients exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or preoperative steroids were significantly more likely to develop pouchitis (anti-tumor necrosis factor: 47.9% vs 36.%, p = 0.027; steroids: 41.7% vs 23.3%, p = 0.048). However, on multivariable analysis, only anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was an independent predictor for pouchitis (p = 0.05). Pouchitis was not associated with adverse long-term outcomes.The retrospective design was a limitation of this study.In a large cohort of patients undergoing IPAA for ulcerative colitis with at least a -year follow-up, anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure was the only independent risk factor for the development of pouchitis.

It is supposed that the balance among these B cells subpopulation (resting B cells, activated B cells, Bregs, and other differentiated B cells) will determine the ultimate role of B cells in tumor . There has been increasing evidence supporting opposite roles of B cells in tumor , though there are no general acceptable phenotypes for them. Recent years, a new designated subset of B cells identified as Bregs has emerged from immunosuppressive and/or regulatory functions in tumor immune responses. Therefore, transferring activated B cells would be possible to become a promising strategy against tumor via conquering the immunosuppressive status of B cells in future. Understanding the potential mechanism of double-edge role of B cells will help researchers utilize activated B cells to improve their anti-tumor response. Moreover, the molecular pathways related to B cell differentiation are involved in its tumor-promoting effect, such as NF-κB, STAT3, BTK. So, we review the molecular and signaling pathway mechanisms of B cells involved in both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive , in order to help researchers optimize B cells to fight cancer better.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614679>Identification of Regulatory Host Genes Involved in Sigma Virus Replication Using RNAi Knockdown in .</a></h2><p>The  sigma virus, a member of the  family, specifically propagates itself in . It contains six genes in the order of 3'-------'. The sigma virus is the only arthropod-specific virus of the  family. Sigma-virus-infected  may suffer from irreversible paralysis when exposed to a high CO concentration, but generally, no other symptoms are reported. A recent study reported that host gene expression in immune pathways was not changed in sigma-virus-infected , which does not necessarily suggest that they are not involved in virus-host interactions. The present study aimed to identify host genes associated with sigma virus replication. Immune pathways JAK-STAT and IMD were selected for detailed study. The results showed that the genome copy number of the sigma virus increased after knocking down the immune pathway genes domeless and PGRP-LC in Drosophila S2 cells. The knocking down of domeless and PGRP-LC significantly up-regulated the expression of the L gene compared to the other viral genes. We propose that the immune pathways respond to sigma virus infection by altering L expression, hence suppressing viral replication. This effect was further tested in vivo, when D. melanogaster individuals injected with dsdome and dsPGRP-LC showed not only an increase in sigma virus copy number, but also a reduced survival rate when treated with CO. Our study proved that host  influences viral replication, even in persistent infection. Knocking down the key components of the immune process deactivates immune controls, thus facilitating viral expression and replication. We propose that the  system of D. melanogaster regulates the replication of the sigma virus by affecting the L gene expression. Studies have shown minimal host-virus interaction in persistent infection. However, our study demonstrated that the  continued to affect viral replication even in persistent infection because knocking down the key components of the immune process disabled the relevant immune controls and facilitated viral expression and replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608287>Structure, Topology, and Dynamics of Membrane-Inserted Polypeptides and Lipids by Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy: Investigations of the Transmembrane Domains of the DQ Beta-1 Subunit of the MHC II Receptor and of the COP I Protein p24.</a></h2><p>MHC class II receptors carry important function in adaptive  and their malfunctioning is associated with diabetes type I, chronic inflammatory diseases and other autoimmune diseases. The protein assembles from the DQ alpha-1 and DQ beta-1 subunits where the transmembrane domains of these type I membrane proteins have been shown to be involved in homo- and heterodimer formation. Furthermore, the DQ alpha 1 chain carries a sequence motif that has been first identified in the context of p24, a protein involved in the formation of COPI vesicles of the intracellular transport machinery, to specifically interact with sphingomyelin-C18 (SM-C18). Here we investigated the membrane interactions and dynamics of DQ beta-1 in liquid crystalline POPC phospholipid bilayers by oriented N solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The N resonances are indicative of a helical tilt angle of the membrane anchor sequence around 20°. Two populations can be distinguished by their differential dynamics probably corresponding the DQ beta-1 mono- and homodimer. Whereas, this equilibrium is hardly affected by the addition of  mole% SM-C18 a single population is visible in DMPC lipid bilayers suggesting that the lipid saturation is an important parameter. Furthermore, the DQ alpha-1, DQ beta-1 and p24 transmembrane helical domains were reconstituted into POPC or POPC/SM-C18 lipid bilayers where the fatty acyl chain of either the phosphatidylcholine or of the sphingolipid have been deuterated. Interestingly in the presence of both sphingolipid and polypeptide a strong decrease in the innermost membrane order of the POPC palmitoyl chain is observed, an effect that is strongest for DQ beta-1. In contrast, for the first time the polypeptide interactions were monitored by deuteration of the stearoyl chain of SM-C18. The resulting H solid-state NMR spectra show an increase in order for p24 and DQ alpha-1 which both carry the SM recognition motif. Thereby the data are suggestive that SM-C18 together with the transmembrane domains form structures imposing positive curvature strain on the surrounding POPC lipids. This effect is attenuated when SM-C18 is recognized by the protein.Copyright © 2019 Salnikov, Aisenbrey, Pokrandt, Brügger and Bechinger.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592329>Effect of vitamin D on serum markers of bone turnover in SLE in a randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Bone health in SLE is adversely affected by vitamin D deficiency, inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoid use.

This unique structure is found in a limited number of phylogenetically distant species, including mollusks, ancestral chelicerates, and early-branching cephalochordates, mostly living in marine environments. One puzzling evolutionary issue concerns the advantage for these species of having maintained a hydrophobic domain lost during evolution toward β-defensins. Using native ligation chemistry, we produced the oyster  BigDef1 (BigDef1) and its separate domains. BigDef1 showed salt-stable and broad-range bactericidal activity, including against multidrug-resistant human clinical isolates of  We found that the ancestral N-terminal domain confers salt-stable antimicrobial activity to the β-defensin-like domain, which is otherwise inactive. Moreover, upon contact with bacteria, the N-terminal domain drives BigDef1 assembly into nanonets that entrap and kill bacteria. We speculate that the hydrophobic N-terminal domain of big defensins has been retained in marine phyla to confer salt-stable interactions with bacterial membranes in environments where electrostatic interactions are impaired. Those remarkable properties open the way to future drug developments when physiological salt concentrations inhibit the antimicrobial activity of vertebrate β-defensins. β-Defensins are host defense peptides controlling infections in species ranging from humans to invertebrates. However, the antimicrobial activity of most human β-defensins is impaired at physiological salt concentrations. We explored the properties of big defensins, the β-defensin ancestors, which have been conserved in a number of marine organisms, mainly mollusks. By focusing on a big defensin from oyster (BigDef1), we showed that the N-terminal domain lost during evolution toward β-defensins confers bactericidal activity to BigDef1, even at high salt concentrations. BigDef1 killed multidrug-resistant human clinical isolates of  Moreover, the ancestral N-terminal domain drove the assembly of the big defensin into nanonets in which bacteria are entrapped and killed.

This poses a significant challenge for the host to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies. In , we show that a mechanism to circumvent this challenge is to elicit antibodies to cryptic epitopes that are not under immune pressure. We previously discovered that antibodies to the  invasion protein, PvDBP, cross-react with  VAR2CSA, a distantly related virulence factor that mediates placental malaria. Here, we describe the molecular mechanism underlying this cross-species . We identified an epitope in subdomain 1 (SD1) within the Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain of PvDBP that gives rise to cross-reactive antibodies to VAR2CSA and show that human antibodies affinity purified against a synthetic SD1 peptide block parasite adhesion to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA)  The epitope in SD1 is subdominant and highly conserved in PvDBP, and in turn, SD1 antibodies target cryptic epitopes in  VAR2CSA.

Although NETosis in general has been suggested to be glucose dependent, the transferability to patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unclear. We assessed whether the NETs markers double-stranded deoxyribonucleid acid (dsDNA) and myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA) associated with plasma glucose and the glucometabolic status in the acute phase and 3 months after a STEMI. We also explored whether an acute glucose load resulted in upregulated NETosis by assessment of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) gene expression.In total, 224 STEMI patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent blood sampling acutely (median 16. h after PCI) and after 3 months. Glucometabolic status was defined based on the results of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as normal glucose regulation (NGR), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). dsDNA and MPO-DNA were measured in serum, while PAD4 mRNA was measured in circulating leukocytes by RT-PCR.dsDNA levels were significantly correlated to plasma glucose both acutely and after 3 months (r = 0.12 and r = 0.17, both p < 0.02), whereas MPO-DNA was not.

Dystrophin-related protein (or utrophin) retains most of the structural and protein binding elements of dystrophin. Importantly, normal thymic expression in DMD patients should protect utrophin by central immunologic tolerance. We designed a codon-optimized, synthetic transgene encoding a miniaturized utrophin (µUtro), deliverable by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Here, we show that µUtro is a highly functional, non-immunogenic substitute for dystrophin, preventing the most deleterious histological and physiological aspects of muscular dystrophy in small and large animal models. Following systemic administration of an AAV-µUtro to neonatal dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, histological and biochemical markers of myonecrosis and regeneration are completely suppressed throughout growth to adult weight. In the dystrophin-deficient golden retriever model, µUtro non-toxically prevented myonecrosis, even in the most powerful muscles. In a stringent test of immunogenicity, focal expression of µUtro in the deletional-null German shorthaired pointer model produced no evidence of cell-mediated , in contrast to the robust T cell response against similarly constructed µDystrophin (µDystro). These findings support a model in which utrophin-derived therapies might be used to treat clinical dystrophin deficiency, with a favorable immunologic profile and preserved function in the face of extreme miniaturization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641082>Fcγ Receptors Contribute to the Antiviral Properties of Influenza Virus Neuraminidase-Specific Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) has been under intense study recently as a vaccine antigen, yet there remain unanswered questions regarding the immune response directed toward NA. Antibodies (Abs) that can inhibit NA activity have been shown to aid in the control of disease caused by influenza virus infection in humans and animal models, yet how and if interactions between the Fc portion of anti-NA Abs and Fcγ receptors (FcγR) contribute to protection has not yet been extensively studied. Herein, we show that poly- and monoclonal anti-NA IgG antibodies with NA inhibitory activity can control A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in the absence of FcγRs, but FcγR interaction aided in viral clearance from the lungs. In contrast, a mouse-human chimeric anti-NA IgG1 that was incapable of mediating NA inhibition (NI) solely relied on FcγR interaction to protect transgenic mice (with a humanized FcγR compartment) against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. As such, this study suggests that NA-specific antibodies contribute to protection against influenza A virus infection even in the absence of NI activity and supports protection through multiple effector mechanisms. There is a pressing need for next-generation influenza vaccine strategies that are better able to manage antigenic drift and the cocirculation of multiple drift variants and that consistently improve vaccine effectiveness. Influenza virus NA is a key target antigen as a component of a next-generation vaccine in the influenza field, with evidence for a role in protective  in humans. However, mechanisms of protection provided by antibodies directed to NA remain largely unexplored. Herein, we show that antibody Fc interaction with Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) expressed on effector cells contributes to viral control in a murine model of influenza. Importantly, a chimeric mouse-human IgG1 with no direct antiviral activity was demonstrated to solely rely on FcγRs to protect mice from disease. Therefore, antibodies without NA enzymatic inhibitory activity may also play a role in controlling influenza viruses and should be of consideration when designing NA-based vaccines and assessing immunogenicity.Copyright © 2019 Job et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652613>Nosocomial Vs.

Nevertheless, the differences between nosocomial infective endocarditis (NIE) and community-acquired infective endocarditis (CIE) have not been addressed in a population-based study. We conducted a retrospective, nationwide, temporal trend study from 1997 to 2014 analyzing the epidemiology, clinical, geographical, meteorological characteristics of patients diagnosed with IE in Spain, to distinguish NIE from CIE. Among 25,952 patients with IE (62.2 ± 18·6 years; 65.9% men), 45.9% had NIE. The incidence of IE increased from 2.83 to 3.73 due to the NIE incidence increment with a decline in CIE. Patients with NIE were older (63.8 years vs. 60.8 years,  < 0·001), presented a higher Charlson index (1.22 vs. 1.03,  < 0.001), a greater history of implanted cardiac devices (8.7% vs. 4.6%,  < 0.001), and higher mortality (31.% vs. 21.7%,  < 0.001). The most frequent microorganism for both NIE and CIE was  ( < 0.001), and the North reported a higher incidence ( < 0.001). Risk factors of mortality for NIE were age, Charlson index, hemodialysis, shock, heart failure, and stroke. Risk factors for CIE included female sex, renal disease, and cardiac-device carriers. The etiology of IE shifted from community origins to mostly nosocomial-associated infections. Higher morbidity, mortality, and poorer outcomes are associated with NIE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659236>Immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.</a></h2><p>Influenza vaccination is recommended for children following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), however there is limited evidence regarding its benefit. A prospective multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone HSCT compared with healthy age-matched controls. Participants were vaccinated between 2013 and 2016 according to Australian guidelines. Influenza-specific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres were performed prior to each vaccination and 4 weeks following the final vaccination. A nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was performed on participants that developed influenza-like illness. There were 86 children recruited; 43 who had undergone HSCT and 43 controls. For the HSCT group, seroprotection and seroconversion rates were 81.4% and 60.% for H3N2, 41.9% and 32.6% for H1N1, and 44.2% and 39.% for B strain respectively. There was a significant geometric mean fold increase to the H3N2 (GMFI .80, 95% CI 3.68-9.14, p < 0.001) and B (GMFI 3.44, 95% CI 2.36-.00, p = 0.048) strains. Serological response was superior in age-matched controls to all vaccine strains. There were no serious adverse events following vaccination. For children who underwent HSCT, incidence of laboratory-proven influenza infection was 2.3%.

Calves were randomised to receive meloxicam (0. mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of placebo subcutaneously at birth. Calf blood samples were collected between one and seven days of age to determine serum immunoglobulin (IgG) concentration. Colostrum intake, treatment for disease, mortality, and weaning weights were recorded. Multilevel linear or logistic regression models were used to determine the effects of meloxicam and to identify risk factors.There was no effect of meloxicam on serum IgG concentrations, average daily gain (ADG), or risk of inadequate TPI (serum IgG concentration <24 g/l), treatment for disease, or mortality (P>0.05). Bottle or tube feeding calves were associated with decreased serum IgG concentrations (P=0.01) compared with nursing. Calves with an incomplete tongue withdrawal reflex had higher odds of being treated for disease compared with those with complete withdrawal (P=0.009). Being born meconium-stained and having decreased serum IgG concentrations were associated with an increased risk of mortality (P=0.03). Being born of a mature cow, having a higher birth weight, and increased serum IgG concentrations were associated with greater ADG to weaning (P<0.05).Vigour assessment at birth along with good colostrum management may be important to improve TPI and health in high-risk calves such as those assisted at birth.© British Veterinary Association 2019.

Voxel based morphometry was used to model associations between marker levels and brain atrophy in mutation carriers relative to controls. Linear regression was used to model relationships between plasma marker levels with mean frontal white matter integrity [fractional anisotropy (FA)] and the FTLD modified Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes score (FTLD-CDR SB).  Plasma sCD163 was higher in symptomatic  carriers [mean 321 ng/ml (SD 125)] compared to controls [mean 248 ng/ml (SD 58);  < 0.05]. Plasma CCL18 was higher in symptomatic  carriers [mean 56.9 pg/ml (SD 19)] compared to controls [mean 40. pg/ml (SD 14);  < 0.05]. Elevation of plasma LBP was associated with white matter atrophy in the right frontal pole and left inferior frontal gyrus ( FWE corrected <0.05) in all mutation carriers relative to controls. Plasma LBP levels inversely correlated with bilateral frontal white matter FA (R = 0.59,  = 0.009) in mutation carriers.

Twelve male ice hockey players (age, 17.7 ± 0. years) were recruited for this study. The first saliva and blood collection took place at the beginning of the training camp (without training at the training camp), the second one was collected on the 9th day of the training camp immediately after the intensification of training, and the third collection was performed on the 13th day of training (4 days before leaving for the World Championship) in the tapering phase. To assess the mucosal immune function, concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), sIgA1, and sIgA2 were analyzed in saliva. Cortisol concentration and creatine kinase activity were determined in blood, as indicators of stress and muscle damage, respectively. The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 questionnaire was used to assess URTI symptoms. A significant increase in the sIgA1 and sIgA2 concentrations was observed in the third collection compared with the second time point (114.45 ± 33.00 vs. 77.49 ± 27.29 and 88.97 ± 25.33 vs. 71.65 ± 32.44 U, respectively). There were no statistically significant correlations between the URTI incidence and saliva variables.

The atypical profilin Arabidopsis AtPRF3 has been reported to cooperate with canonical profilin isoforms in suppressing formin-mediated actin polymerization during plant innate  responses. AtPRF3 has a 37-amino-acid-long N terminal extension (NTE), and its suppressive effect on actin assembly is derived from enhanced interaction with the poly-proline (Poly-P) of the formin AtFH1. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structures of AtPRF3Δ22 and AtPRF3Δ37, as well as AtPRF2 apo form and in complex with AtFH1 Poly-P at 1.-3.6 Å resolutions. By combining these structures with molecular modeling, we found that AtPRF3Δ22 NTE has high plasticity, with a primary "closed" conformation that can adopt an open conformation that enables Poly-P binding. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation and free-energy calculations of protein-protein binding, along with experimental validation, we show that the AtPRF3Δ22 binds to Poly-P in an adaptive manner, thereby enabling different binding modes that maintain the interaction through disordered sequences. Together, our structural and simulation results suggest that the dynamic conformational changes of the AtPRF3 NTE upon Poly-P binding modulate their interactions to fine-tune formin-mediated actin assembly.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647207>Autophagy: A Novel Mechanism Involved in the Anti-Inflammatory Abilities of Probiotics.</a></h2><p>Deregulation of the complex interaction among host genetics, gut microbiota and environmental factors on one hand and aberrant immune responses on the other hand, are known to be associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Mycobacteria have specialized secretion systems, e.g., type VII secretion or ESX systems, to transport substrates across this cell wall. The largest group of proteins that are secreted by these ESX systems are the PE proteins. Previously, it was shown that the N-terminal PE domain of about 100 amino acids is required for secretion. Here, we describe the identification of an aspartic protease, designated PecA, that removes (part of) this PE domain at the cell surface. Nearly all of the observed PE_PGRS proteins are processed by PecA. Interestingly, the protease itself is also a secreted PE protein and subject to self-cleavage. Furthermore, a defect in surface processing has no effect on the activity of the PE lipase protein LipY but does seem to affect the functioning of other virulence factors, as a  mutant strain of  shows moderate attenuation in zebrafish larvae.

The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598555>Prophylaxis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection reactivation - recommendations of the Working Group for prevention of HBV reactivation.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the main causes of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Here, we identified a secretory polysaccharide deacetylase (PDA1) from the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae, the most notorious plant pathogen of the Verticillium genus, that facilitates virulence through direct deacetylation of chitin oligomers whose N-acetyl group contributes to host lysine motif (LysM)-containing receptor perception for ligand-triggered . Polysaccharide deacetylases are widely present in fungi, bacteria, insects and marine invertebrates and have been reported to possess diverse functions in developmental processes rather than virulence. A phylogenetics analysis of more than ,000 fungal proteins with conserved polysaccharide deacetylase domains showed that the V. dahliae PDA1-containing subtree includes a large number of proteins from the Verticillium genus as well as the Fusarium genus, another group of characterized soil-borne fungal pathogens, suggesting that soil-borne fungal pathogens have adopted chitin deacetylation as a major virulence strategy. We showed that a Fusarium PDA1 is required for virulence in cotton plants. This study reveals a substantial virulence function role of polysaccharide deacetylases in pathogenic fungi and demonstrates a subtle mechanism whereby deacetylation of chitin oligomers converts them to ligand-inactive chitosan, representing a common strategy of preventing chitin-triggered host  by soil-borne fungal pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631347>Increased susceptibility to Haemonchus contortus infection by interleukin  modulation of eosinophil responses in sheep.</a></h2><p>Eosinophils are prominent effector cells in immune responses against gastrointestinal nematode infections in ruminants, but their in vivo role has been hard to establish in large animals. Interleukin- is a key cytokine in the induction and stimulation of anti-parasitic eosinophil responses. This study attempted to modulate the eosinophil response in sheep through vaccination with recombinant interleukin- (rIL-), and determine the effect on subsequent Haemonchus contortus infection. Nematode resistant Canaria Hair Breed (CHB) sheep vaccinated with rIL- in Quil-A adjuvant, had lower blood eosinophil counts and higher mean worm burdens than control sheep vaccinated with Quil-A adjuvant alone. In addition, adult worms in IL- vaccinated sheep were significantly longer with higher eggs in utero in female worms, supporting an active role of eosinophils against adult parasites in CHB sheep. These results confirm that eosinophils can play a direct role in effective control of H. contortus infection in sheep and offer a new approach to study immune responses in ruminants.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649954>Phase 1 Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Recombinant  Expressing Human Papillomavirus Type 16 E6 Oncoprotein Vaccine.</a></h2><p>The present study purposed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the therapeutic NZ8123-HPV16-optiE6 vaccine, following oral vaccination. The safety and tolerability were evaluated. Specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and vaginal IgA antibodies were calculated by ELISA, and E6-specific IFN-γ-secreting T cells were counted by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) assay in cervical lymphocytes and PBMC samples. The vaccine was well tolerated, and no serious adverse effects were observed in vaccine recipients. Statistical analysis showed that all vaccine groups had significant increases in antibody levels at day 60 after baseline. The time to peak activation in E6-specific IFN-γ-secreting CD8 CTL responses was seen at month 1 after last vaccination. According to the results, the humoral immune and cell-mediated responses for the vaccine groups that received  × 10 and 1 × 10 CFU/mL of vaccine were similar and were higher than those of the 1 × 10 CFU/mL group, indicating the dose-dependency of the NZ8123-HPV16-optiE6 vaccine following oral administration. Low antibody levels compared with the placebo groups were recorded at month 6 after the last vaccination. Interestingly, long-term E6-specific CTL responses were observed during follow-up. It was concluded that oral immunization with the NZ8123-HPV-16-optiE6 vaccine is safe, induces persistent , and is reasonably well tolerated.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610823>Dietary phytase and -inositol supplementation are associated with distinct plasma metabolome profile in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Phytase enzyme is used as a dietary supplement in broiler nutrition to improve phosphorous bioavailability. Phytase deliberates phosphate groups from phytic acid and produces myo-inositol after total dephosphorylation. Myo-inositol is a bioactive compound having beneficial modulatory effects on metabolism in humans. However, it is not well understood if and how phytic acid degradation products, particularly myo-inositol, can modulate metabolism in broiler chicken. The purpose of this study was to investigate effects of dietary supplements of phytase and myo-inositol on the blood plasma metabolome profile of broiler chickens. Broilers were provided a nutrient-adequate control diet or the same diet supplemented with either 3. g myo-inositol or 500, 1500 or 3000 units of phytase, per kilogram of feed (grower diet). Broilers were group-housed in floor pens (eight pens per diet) and provided one of the treatment diets for 22 days. Then, blood was collected from one bird per pen, resulting in eight replicated measurements per diet. A targeted metabolomics approach was applied to the heparin plasma. Body weight of the birds was not significantly affected by the treatments. Plasma myo-inositol concentrations were significantly increased by myo-inositol supplementation and phytase supplementation at 500 and 1500 units/kg. Metabolites generally affected by phytase supplementation belonged to the groups of acyl-carnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholine, biogenic amines and amino acids. Compared to the control diet, phytase supplements had significantly higher plasma concentrations of kynurenine and creatinine, but lower concentrations of histamine and cis-4-hydroxyproline. Myo-inositol supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of dopamine and serotonine. While some metabolites were similarly affected by myo-inositol and phytase supplementation, others were distinctly differently affected. We conclude that myo-inositol, either as a directly added supplement or indirectly released from phytate upon phytase supplementation, can affect specific metabolic pathways. Additional effects found on phytase supplementation may be related to intermediary phytate degradation products. Results are indicative for innovative hypothesis to be tested in future experiments, for instance, with regard to relationships between phytase or myo-inositol supplements and bird  or behaviour.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662457>Zika Virus NS2A-Mediated Virion Assembly.</a></h2><p>The flavivirus virion consists of an envelope outer layer, formed by envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins on a lipid bilayer, and an internal core, formed by capsid (C) protein and genomic RNA. The molecular mechanism of flavivirus assembly is not well understood. Here, we show that Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2A protein recruits genomic RNA, the structural protein prM/E complex, and the NS2B/NS3 protease complex to the virion assembly site and orchestrates virus morphogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that ZIKV NS2A binds to prM, E, NS2B, and NS3 (but not C, NS4B, or NS5) in a viral RNA-independent manner, whereas prM/E complex does not interact with NS2B/NS3 complex. Remarkably, a single-amino-acid mutation (E103A) of NS2A impairs its binding to prM/E and NS2B/NS3 and abolishes virus production, demonstrating the indispensable role of NS2A/prM/E and NS2A/NS2B/NS3 interactions in virion assembly. In addition, RNA-protein pulldown analysis identified a stem-loop RNA from the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome as an "RNA recruitment signal" for ZIKV assembly. The 3' UTR RNA binds to a cytoplasmic loop of NS2A protein. Mutations of two positively charged residues (R96A and R102A) from the cytoplasmic loop reduce NS2A binding to viral RNA, leading to a complete loss of virion assembly. Collectively, our results support a virion assembly model in which NS2A recruits viral NS2B/NS3 protease and structural C-prM-E polyprotein to the virion assembly site; once the C-prM-E polyprotein has been processed, NS2A presents viral RNA to the structural proteins for virion assembly. ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The molecular mechanism of ZIKV virion assembly is largely unknown. Here, we report that ZIKV NS2A plays a central role in recruiting viral RNA, structural protein prM/E, and viral NS2B/NS3 protease to the virion assembly site and orchestrating virion morphogenesis. One mutation that impairs these interactions does not significantly affect viral RNA replication but selectively abolishes virion assembly, demonstrating the specific role of these interactions in virus morphogenesis. We also show that the 3' UTR of ZIKV RNA may serve as a "recruitment signal" through binding to NS2A to enter the virion assembly site. Following a coordinated cleavage of C-prM-E at the virion assembly site, NS2A may present the viral RNA to C protein for nucleocapsid formation followed by envelopment with prM/E proteins. The results have provided new insights into flavivirus virion assembly.Copyright © 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640807>Rotavirus C: prevalence in suckling piglets and development of virus-like particles to assess the influence of maternal  on the disease development.</a></h2><p>Rotavirus C (RVC) has been detected increasingly in humans and swine in different countries, including the US. It is associated with significant economic losses due to diarrheal disease in nursing piglets. In this study we aimed: (1) to determine the prevalence of RVC in healthy and diarrheic suckling piglets on US farms; and (2) to evaluate if maternal antibody (Ab) levels were associated with protection of newborn suckling piglets against RVC. There was a significantly higher prevalence (p = 0.0002) of litters with diarrhea born to gilts compared with those born to multiparous sows. Of 113 nursing piglet fecal samples tested, 76.1% were RVC RNA positive. Fecal RVC RNA was detected in significantly (p = 0.0419) higher quantities and more frequently in piglets with diarrhea compared with healthy ones (82. vs. 69.9%). With the exception of the historic strain Cowden (G1 genotype), field RVC strains do not replicate in cell culture, which is a major impediment for studying RVC pathogenesis and . To circumvent this, we generated RVC virus-like particles (VLPs) for Cowden (G1), RV0104 (G3) and RV0143 (G6) and used them as antigens in ELISA to detect swine RVC Abs in serum and milk from the sows. Using RVC-VLP Ab ELISA we demonstrated that sows with diarrheic litters had significantly lower RVC IgA and IgG Ab titers in milk compared to those with healthy litters. Thus, our data suggest that insufficient lactogenic protection provided by gilts plays a key role in the development of and the increased prevalence of clinical RVC disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594813>Asparagine Deprivation Causes a Reversible Inhibition of Human Cytomegalovirus Acute Virus Replication.</a></h2><p>As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses rely on the host cell machinery to replicate efficiently, with the host metabolism extensively manipulated for this purpose. High-throughput small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens provide a systematic approach for the identification of novel host-virus interactions. Here, we report a large-scale screen for host factors important for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), consisting of 6,881 siRNAs. We identified 47 proviral factors and 68 antiviral factors involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including the mediator complex, proteasome function, and mRNA splicing. Focused characterization of one of the hits, asparagine synthetase (ASNS), demonstrated a strict requirement for asparagine for HCMV replication which leads to an early block in virus replication before the onset of DNA amplification. This effect is specific to HCMV, as knockdown of ASNS had little effect on herpes simplex virus 1 or influenza A virus replication, suggesting that the restriction is not simply due to a failure in protein production. Remarkably, virus replication could be completely rescued 7 days postinfection with the addition of exogenous asparagine, indicating that while virus replication is restricted at an early stage, it maintains the capacity for full replication days after initial infection. This study represents the most comprehensive siRNA screen for the identification of host factors involved in HCMV replication and identifies the nonessential amino acid asparagine as a critical factor in regulating HCMV virus replication. These results have implications for control of viral latency and the clinical treatment of HCMV in patients. HCMV accounts for more than 60% of complications associated with solid organ transplant patients. Prophylactic or preventative treatment with antivirals, such as ganciclovir, reduces the occurrence of early onset HCMV disease. However, late onset disease remains a significant problem, and prolonged treatment, especially in patients with suppressed immune systems, greatly increases the risk of antiviral resistance. Very few antivirals have been developed for use against HCMV since the licensing of ganciclovir, and of these, the same viral genes are often targeted, reducing the usefulness of these drugs against resistant strains. An alternative approach is to target host genes essential for virus replication. Here we demonstrate that HCMV replication is highly dependent on levels of the amino acid asparagine and that knockdown of a critical enzyme involved in asparagine synthesis results in severe attenuation of virus replication. These results suggest that reducing asparagine levels through dietary restriction or chemotherapeutic treatment could limit HCMV replication in patients.Copyright © 2019 Lee et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600774>Structure of the mitochondrial import gate reveals distinct preprotein paths.</a></h2><p>The translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) is the main entry gate for proteins.

Excoriation of scabies lesions can lead to secondary pyoderma infection, most commonly by Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS), with the latter linked to acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and potentially rheumatic heart disease (RHD). There is a paucity of data on the prevalence of these skin infections and their bacterial aetiology from Africa.A cross-sectional study, conducted over a four-month period that included the dry and rainy season, was conducted to determine the prevalence of common skin infections in Sukuta, a peri-urban settlement in western Gambia, in children < years. Swabs from pyoderma lesions were cultured for S. aureus and GAS. Of 1441 children examined, 15.9% had scabies (95% CI 12.2-20.4), 17.4% had pyoderma (95% CI 10.4-27.7) and 9.7% had fungal infections (95% CI 6.6-14.0). Scabies was significantly associated with pyoderma (aOR 2.74, 95% CI 1.61-4.67). Of 250 pyoderma swabs, 80.8% were culture-positive for S. aureus, and 50.8% for GAS. Participants examined after the first rains were significantly more likely to have pyoderma than those examined before (aRR 2.42, 95% CI 1.38-4.23), whereas no difference in scabies prevalence was seen (aRR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70-1.67). Swab positivity was not affected by the season.High prevalence of scabies and pyoderma were observed. Pyoderma increased significantly during the rainy season.

Resistance to the causal agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) could result from alleles of the adaptive immune system. During metamorphosis, however, immune systems may not be fully functional, implying that an effective immune response to Bd may be life-stage dependent. We evaluated the susceptibility of the relict leopard frog (Rana onca) sourced from two areas where Bd was present or absent, and where the populations appeared to show differences in pathogen resistance. We evaluated whether population-level resistance manifested across life stages using challenge experiments with late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 31-38), metamorphs (stage 45-46), and juvenile frogs. We used three different Bd isolates including one from wild R. onca to challenge juvenile frogs and focused on the isolate from R. onca to challenge tadpoles and resulting metamorphs. We found that juveniles from the Bd exposed population were . times more likely to survive Bd infection and 10 times more likely to clear infections than those from the area without Bd. In contrast, and regardless of the source area, we observed 98% survivorship of tadpoles, but only 19% survivorship of resulting metamorphs following re-exposure. Given the low survivorship of exposed metamorphs in the laboratory, we speculate on how resistance characteristics, whether adaptive or innate, that do not manifest at each life stage could develop in the wild. We suggest that seasonal high temperatures during times when metamorphosis appears common may modulate the effects of the pathogen during this most susceptible life stage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646331>[Advance in effect of aerobic exercise on immune system and autoimmune diseases].</a></h2><p>Autoimmune diseases are a kind of chronic diseases with unclear etiology, which has the characteristics of repetition and difficulty to cure completely.

By day 60 post-transplant, allografts with a 6 hour cold-ischemia time developed extensive glomerular injury compared with moderate pathology in allografts with 0. hour of cold-ischemia time. Pathology was associated with increased serum levels of anti-class 2 but not anti-class 1 donor-specific antibodies. Recipient B cell depletion abrogated early macrophage recruitment, suggesting augmented donor-specific antibodies, rather than T cells, increase glomerular pathology after prolonged cold ischemia. Lymphocyte sequestration with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 antagonist FTY720 specifically inhibited anti-MHC class II antibody production and abrogated macrophage infiltration into glomeruli. Adoptive transfer of sera containing anti-donor MHC class II antibodies or mAbs against donor MHC class II restored early glomerular macrophage infiltration in FTY720-treated recipients.Post-transplant inflammation augments generation of donor-specific antibodies against MHC class II antigens. Resulting MHC class II-reactive donor-specific antibodies are essential mediators of kidney allograft glomerular injury caused by prolonged cold ischemia.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663406>Hospitalizations for infections by age and sex: register-based study of Danish children 1977-2014.</a></h2><p> Infectious diseases are a major cause of hospitalizations in children and there is increasing interest in sex differences in  during childhood.

However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic B lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP colonization and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral . Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP colonization and promote B lymphocyte-suppression and reduction.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host  and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root . Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined these roles in the immune responses against Plasmodium chabaudi infection using the Il-27ra mice. While IL-27 was expressed at high levels during the early phase of the infection, enhanced CD4 T cell function and reduction in parasitemia were observed mainly during the chronic phase in the mutant mice. In mice infected with P. chabaudi and cured with drug, CD4 T cells in the Il-27ra mice exhibited enhanced CD4 T-cell responses, indicating the inhibitory role of IL-27 on the protective immune responses. To determine the role of IL-27 in detail, we performed CD4 T-cell transfer experiments. The Il-27ra and Il27p28 mice were first infected with P. chabaudi and then cured using drug treatment. Plasmodium-antigen primed CD4 T cells were prepared from these mice and transferred into the recipient mice, followed by infection with the heterologous parasite P. berghei ANKA. Il-27ra CD4 T cells in the infected recipient mice did not produce IL-10, indicating that IL-10 production by primed CD4 T cells is IL-27 dependent. Il27p28 CD4 T cells that were primed in the absence of IL-27 exhibited enhanced recall responses during the challenge infection with P. berghei ANKA, implying that IL-27 receptor signaling during the primary infection affects recall responses in the long-term via the regulation of the memory CD4 T cell generation. These features highlighted direct and time-transcending roles of IL-27 in the regulation of immune responses against chronic infection with Plasmodium parasites.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Immunotherapies such as those that target immune checkpoint molecules can be used to augment immune-mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from immunotherapy and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648279>The ROP16III-dependent early immune response determines the subacute CNS immune response and type III Toxoplasma gondii survival.</a></h2><p>Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that persistently infects the CNS and that has genetically distinct strains which provoke different acute immune responses. How differences in the acute immune response affect the CNS immune response is unknown. To address this question, we used two persistent Toxoplasma strains (type II and type III) and examined the CNS immune response at 21 days post infection (dpi). Contrary to acute infection studies, type III-infected mice had higher numbers of total CNS T cells and macrophages/microglia but fewer alternatively activated macrophages (M2s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) than type II-infected mice. By profiling splenocytes at , 10, and 21 dpi, we determined that at  dpi type III-infected mice had more M2s while type II-infected mice had more pro-inflammatory macrophages and that these responses flipped over time. To test how these early differences influence the CNS immune response, we engineered the type III strain to lack ROP16 (IIIΔrop16), the polymorphic effector protein that drives the early type III-associated M2 response. IIIΔrop16-infected mice showed a type II-like neuroinflammatory response with fewer infiltrating T cells and macrophages/microglia and more M2s and an unexpectedly low CNS parasite burden. At  dpi, IIIΔrop16-infected mice showed a mixed inflammatory response with more pro-inflammatory macrophages, M2s, T effector cells, and Tregs, and decreased rates of infection of peritoneal exudative cells (PECs). These data suggested that type III parasites need the early ROP16-associated M2 response to avoid clearance, possibly by the -Related GTPases (IRGs), which are IFN-γ- dependent proteins essential for murine defenses against Toxoplasma. To test this possibility, we infected IRG-deficient mice and found that IIIΔrop16 parasites now maintained parental levels of PECs infection. Collectively, these studies suggest that, for the type III strain, rop16III plays a key role in parasite persistence and influences the subacute CNS immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611734>Altered Toll-Like Receptor Signalling in Children with Down Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the key in initiating innate immune responses. TLR2 is crucial in recognising lipopeptides from gram-positive bacteria and is implicated in chronic inflammation. Children with Down syndrome (DS) are prone to infections from these pathogens and have an increased risk of autoimmunity. Sparstolonin B (SsnB) is a TLR antagonist which attenuates cytokine production and improves outcomes in sepsis. We hypothesised that TLR signalling may be abnormal in children with DS and contribute to their clinical phenotype. We evaluated TLR pathways in 3 ways: determining the expression of TLR2 on the surface of neutrophils and monocytes by flow cytometry, examining the gene expression of key regulatory proteins involved in TLR signal propagation, MyD88, IRAK4, and TRIF, by quantitative PCR, and lastly determining the cytokine production by ELISA following immunomodulation with proinflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Pam3Csk4) and the anti-inflammatory agent SsnB. We report TLR2 expression being significantly increased on neutrophils, total monocytes, and intermediate and nonclassical monocytes in children with DS ( = 20, mean age 8.8 ± SD .3 years, female  = 11) compared to controls ( = 15, mean age 6.2 ± 4.2 years, female  = ). At baseline, the expression of MyD88 was significantly lower, and TRIF significantly raised in children with DS. The TLR antagonist SsnB was effective in reducing TLR2 and CD11b expression and abrogating cytokine production in both cohorts. We conclude that TLR signalling and the TLR2 pathway are dysregulated in DS, and this disparate innate  may contribute to chronic inflammation in DS. SsnB attenuates proinflammatory mediators and may be of therapeutic benefit.Copyright © 2019 Dean Huggard et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614670>Impacts of Enriching Growing Rabbit Diets with  Microalgae on Growth, Blood Variables, Carcass Traits, Immunological and Antioxidant Indices.</a></h2><p>This work aimed to explore the effects of dietary supplementation of  (CLV) on the growth performance, carcass traits, hematobiochemical variables,  responses, and the antioxidant status of growing rabbits. A total number of 100 rabbits were randomly distributed into four treatment groups, each of five replicates (25 rabbits/group). The experimental groups were as follows; control: a basal diet without supplementation, CLV0.: basal diet + 0. g chlorella powder/kg diet; CLV1.0: basal diet + 1.0 g chlorella powder/kg diet, CLV1.: basal diet + 1. g chlorella powder/kg diet. Live body weight (LBW), cumulative body weight gain (CBWG), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not affected by dietary CLV supplementation. Platelet count (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), means corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) values were significantly increased in the CLV0. group compared with the other treatment groups. Dietary supplementation of CLV (1. g/kg diet) significantly reduced the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. The concentrations of serum triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) were lower (  0.05) in the CLV-treated groups than those of the control. Supplemental CLV at all experimental levels gave the best values of immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) and glutathione activities. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were lower in the animals that received CLV in their diet than those of the control group. Dietary supplementation of 1.0 g CLV/kg had the potential to enhance immune responses and antioxidant status, as well as reduce blood lipid accumulation. Therefore, it could be concluded that CLV supplementation to growing rabbit diets can improve the health status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673402>Isometric versus isotonic exercise for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a randomised controlled pilot study.</a></h2><p>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain. Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of exercise for GTPS. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of isometric and isotonic exercise for individuals with GTPS.This randomised controlled pilot trial recruited 30 participants with GTPS. Both programmes consisted of daily, progressive home exercise for 12 weeks with 8 individual physiotherapy sessions over the trial period. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G) and secondary outcome measures included the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10) and an 11-point Global Rating of Change Scale. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.Twenty-three participants completed the trial. After 12 weeks, mean VISA-G scores improved in both groups; 55-65 in the isometric group and 62-72 in the isotonic group. 55% of the isometric group and 58% of the isotonic group achieved a reduction in pain of at least 2 points (minimally clinically important difference (MCID)) on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 64% of the isometric group and 75% of the isotonic group had improved by at least 2 points (MCID) on the Global Rating of Change Scale.Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes appear to be effective for individuals with GTPS and should be considered in the loading management of patients with this condition.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622465>Human carriage of cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli in North-East India: an analysis of STs and associated resistance mechanisms.</a></h2><p>To determine the prevalence of Escherichia coli STs and associated resistance mechanisms carried by the community in North-East India.E. coli (108) were isolated from sewage collected from 19 sites across the city of Silchar by plating on MacConkey agar with/without selection (50 mg/L cefotaxime). Species identification was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS for 82 isolates. Common resistance mechanisms were determined by WGS of pooled E. coli isolates. PFGE combined with specific probes determined the presence of common resistance mechanisms in all isolates. Phylotypes, multilocus STs, core-genome multilocus STs, resistance genes and virulence genes were determined by in silico analysis of 38 genomes.Analysis of isolates collected without selection (n = 33) indicated that cefotaxime resistance in E. coli was 42% (14/33) and estimated meropenem resistance at 9%. The remaining 58% (19/33) were additionally susceptible to ampicillin, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides. The most common ST among the cefotaxime-resistant E. coli was ST167 (29%), followed by ST410 (17%) and ST648 (10%). E. coli ST131 was absent from the collection. Sixty-three isolates were resistant to cefotaxime and harboured blaCTX-M-15 [54% (34/63)] or blaCMY-42 [46% (29/63)], of which 10% (6/63) harboured both genes. Carbapenem resistance was due to blaNDM-, found in 10/63 cefotaxime-resistant isolates, and/or blaOXA-181, found in 4/63 isolates. NDM- was encoded by IncX3 and/or IncFII plasmids and CMY-42 was mostly encoded by IncI plasmids. NDM- appears to have replaced NDM-1 in this region and CMY-42 appears to be in the process of replacing CTX-M-15.© The Author(s) 2019.

This form of cell death has potent immunostimulatory activity. We show that heme-induced NETs are essential for malaria pathogenesis. Using patient samples and a mouse model, we define two mechanisms of NET-mediated inflammation of the vasculature: activation of emergency granulopoiesis via granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production and induction of the endothelial cytoadhesion receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Soluble NET components facilitate parasite sequestration and mediate tissue destruction. We demonstrate that neutrophils have a key role in malaria immunopathology and propose inhibition of NETs as a treatment strategy in vascular infections.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various colonization conditions such as bacterial concentrations, colonization time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or  dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate , stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or  dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for  dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and , while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to  and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial colonization reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting colonization of bacteria affected behavior characteristics. This study provides useful information on bacterial colonization of GF zebrafish and the interaction between the host and microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Tan, Limbu, Qian, Qiao, Du and Zhang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664034>Intronic ATTTC repeat expansions in STARD7 in familial adult myoclonic epilepsy linked to chromosome 2.</a></h2><p>Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy (FAME) is characterised by cortical myoclonic tremor usually from the second decade of life and overt myoclonic or generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Four independent loci have been implicated in FAME on chromosomes (chr) 2, 3,  and 8. Using whole genome sequencing and repeat primed PCR, we provide evidence that chr2-linked FAME (FAME2) is caused by an expansion of an ATTTC pentamer within the first intron of STARD7. The ATTTC expansions segregate in 158/158 individuals typically affected by FAME from 22 pedigrees including 16 previously reported families recruited worldwide. RNA sequencing from patient derived fibroblasts shows no accumulation of the AUUUU or AUUUC repeat sequences and STARD7 gene expression is not affected. These data, in combination with other genes bearing similar mutations that have been implicated in FAME, suggest ATTTC expansions may cause this disorder, irrespective of the genomic locus involved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620139>Increased T Cell Differentiation and Cytolytic Function in Bangladeshi Compared to American Children.</a></h2><p>During the first  years of life, children are especially vulnerable to infection-related morbidity and mortality. Conversely, the Hygiene Hypothesis suggests that a lack of exposure to infectious agents early in life could explain the increasing incidence of allergies and autoimmunity in high-income countries. Understanding these phenomena, however, is hampered by a lack of comprehensive, direct immune monitoring in children with differing degrees of microbial exposure. Using mass cytometry, we provide an in-depth profile of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children in regions at the extremes of exposure: the San Francisco Bay Area, USA and an economically poor district of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Despite variability in clinical health, functional characteristics of PBMCs were similar in Bangladeshi and American children at 1 year of age. However, by 2-3 years of age, Bangladeshi children's immune cells often demonstrated altered activation and cytokine production profiles upon stimulation with PMA-ionomycin, with an overall immune trajectory more in line with American adults. Conversely, immune responses in children from the US remained steady. Using principal component analysis, donor location, ethnic background, and cytomegalovirus infection status were found to account for some of the variation identified among samples. Within Bangladeshi 1-year-olds, stunting (as measured by height-for-age z-scores) was found to be associated with IL-8 and TGFβ expression in PMA-ionomycin stimulated samples. Combined, these findings provide important insights into the immune systems of children in high vs. low microbial exposure environments and suggest an important role for IL-8 and TGFβ in mitigating the microbial challenges faced by the Bangladeshi children.Copyright © 2019 Wagar, Bolen, Sigal, Lopez Angel, Guan, Kirkpatrick, Haque, Tibshirani, Parsonnet, Petri and Davis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624377>Generation and infusion of multi-antigen-specific T cells to prevent complications early after T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation-a phase I/II study.</a></h2><p>Prophylactic infusion of selected donor T cells can be an effective method to restore specific  after T-cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation (TCD-alloSCT). In this phase I/II study, we aimed to reduce the risk of viral complications and disease relapses by administrating donor-derived CD8 T cells directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenovirus antigens, tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA). Twenty-seven of thirty-six screened HLA-A*02:01 patients and their CMV and/or EBV donors were included. Using MHC-I-Streptamers, 27 T-cell products were generated containing a median of .2 × 10 cells. Twenty-four products were administered without infusion-related complications at a median of 58 days post alloSCT. No patients developed graft-versus-host disease during follow-up. Five patients showed disease progression without coinciding expansion of TAA/MiHA-specific T cells. Eight patients experienced CMV- and/or EBV-reactivations. Four of these reactivations were clinically relevant requiring antiviral treatment, of which two progressed to viral disease. All resolved ultimately. In 2/4 patients with EBV-reactivations and 6/8 patients with CMV-reactivations, viral loads were followed by the expansion of donor-derived virus target-antigen-specific T cells. In conclusion, generation of multi-antigen-specific T-cell products was feasible, infusions were well tolerated and expansion of target-antigen-specific T cells coinciding viral reactivations was illustrated in the majority of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650390>IRAK2 is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus risk.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are serine-threonine kinases involved in toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 signaling pathways.

However, the status of AGBL2 expression in ovarian cancer and its potential clinical and prognostic significance remain unclear. In the present study, immunohistochemistry staining investigated the protein expression level of AGBL2 in paraffin-embedded pathological specimens from 30 normal ovaries, 35 ovarian cystadenomas, 38 borderline ovarian tumors and 165 invasive ovarian carcinomas. The association between AGBL2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of patients was evaluated using the χ test or Fisher's exact test. The survival status of patients was assessed by receiver-operator curve analysis. The results demonstrated that high expression of AGBL2 was observed in 9% of cystadenomas cases, 21% of borderline tumors cases and 38% of ovarian carcinomas cases; however AGBL2 expression was not high in normal ovarian tissues (P<0.01). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that high expression of AGBL2 was associated with tumor histological grade, advanced pT/pN/pM and cancer stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (P<0.05). Following univariate survival analysis of the ovarian carcinoma groups, high expression of AGBL2 was significantly associated with shorter patient survival (P<0.001). In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that AGBL2 could be identified as a potential independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma (P=0.004). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that AGBL2 expression was significantly associated with the expression of  related GTPase M (IRGM) (P=0.013) and LC3A/B (P=0.004). IRGM expression level was also significantly associated with LC3A/B expression level (P=0.023). These findings demonstrated that AGBL2 expression was high in ovarian carcinomas, which suggested that AGBL2 may participate in the acquisition of an aggressive phenotype and may therefore serve as an independent prognostic molecular marker.Copyright: © He et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623222>Effects of Mannanoligosaccharide Supplementation on the Growth Performance, , and Oxidative Status of Partridge Shank Chickens.</a></h2><p>Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS) can be used in poultry production to modulate  and improve growth performance.

Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or ), which may altogether affect adult metabolism. All these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult metabolism has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on RMR (resting metabolic rate, measured in thermoneutrality, 25°C) and TMR (thermoregulatory metabolic rate, measured in cold challenging condition, °C) in the House sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood when their metabolism was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of metabolism was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an energy-saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.© 2019.

There was no increase in the female-to-male HIV-1 prevalence ratio for the age group >35 years with steady smallpox vaccination coverage; 1.93 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.25) in 1987-1990, 1.32 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.10) in 1996-1997, 0.81 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.16) in 2006-2007 (p value for no trend=0.07).Thus, data was compatible with the deduction that the phase-out of smallpox vaccination may have increased the susceptibility to HIV-1 relatively more for women than men. Hence, phasing out smallpox vaccination may have contributed to the global increase in the female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio among young individuals. Due to the potential fallacies of ecological studies, the results should be interpreted carefully, and this hypothesis needs further assessment. If the hypothesis is true, studies of smallpox vaccination could inform HIV-1 vaccine research.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

To better understand how long-term immunosuppression impacts the immune control of this EBV re-emergence, we systematically compared 10 clinically stable KTRs to 30 healthy controls (HCs). The EBV-specific T cell responses were determined in both groups by multiparameter flow cytometry with intra cellular cytokine staining (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15) and ELISpot-IFNγ assays (KTRs n = 7; HCs n = 7). The T/B/NK cell counts (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 30) and the NK/T cell differentiation and activation phenotypes (KTRs n = 10; HCs n = 15/30) were also measured. We show that in KTRs, the Th1 effector CD4+ T cell responses against latent EBV proteins are weak (2/7 responders). Conversely, the frequencies total EBV-specific CD8+T cells are conserved in KTRs (n = 10) and span a wider range of EBNA-3A peptides (/7responders) than in HCs (/7responders). Those modifications of the EBV-specific T cell response were associated with a profound CD4+ T cell lymphopenia in KTRs compared to HCs, involving the naïve CD4+ T cell subset, and a persistent activation of highly-differentiated senescent CD8+ T cells. The proportion of total NK / CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 was also increased in KTRs. Noteworthy, PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells normalized with time after transplantation. In conclusion, we show modifications of the EBV-specific cellular  in long term transplant recipients. This may be the result of both persistent EBV antigenic stimulation and profound immunosuppression induced by anti-rejection treatments. These findings provide new insights into the immunopathology of EBV infection after renal transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647310>Identification of Cardiac MRI Thresholds for Risk Stratification in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Aims Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-shortening condition. The European Cardiac and Respiratory Societies (ESC/ERS) and REVEAL 2.0 risk score calculator identify thresholds to predict 1-year mortality. This study evaluates whether cardiac-MRI thresholds can be identified and used to aid risk stratification and facilitate decision making. Methods Consecutive patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=438) undergoing cardiac-MRI were identified from the ASPIRE-MRI database. Thresholds were identified from a discovery cohort and evaluated in a test cohort. Results A right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted threshold of 227% or a left ventricular-end-diastolic-volume-index of 58ml/m2 identified patients at low (<%) and high (>10%) risk of 1-year mortality. These metrics identified 63% and 34% of patients as low risk, respectively. A right ventricular ejection fraction >54%, 37-54% and <37% identified 21%, 43% and 36% of patients at low, intermediate and high-risk of 1-year mortality, respectively. At follow-up cardiac-MRI patients who improved to, or were maintained in a low risk group had a one-year mortality <%. Right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted independently predicted outcome and when used in conjunction with the REVEAL 2.0 risk score calculator or a modified French Pulmonary Hypertension registry approach improved risk stratification for one-year mortality. Conclusion Cardiac-MRI can be used to risk stratify patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension using a threshold approach. Right ventricular-end-systolic-volume-index-%predicted can identify a high percentage of patients at low-risk of one-year mortality and when used in conjunction with current risk stratification approaches it can improve risk stratification. This study supports further evaluation of cardiac-MRI in risk stratification in PAH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606364>Hyperkalemia and Treatment With RAAS Inhibitors During Acute Heart Failure Hospitalizations and Their Association With Mortality.</a></h2><p>This study investigated associations between incident hyperkalemia during acute heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and changes in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors.Hyperkalemia is a potential complication of RAAS inhibitors. For patients with HF, fear of hyperkalemia may lead to failure to deliver guideline-recommended doses of RAAS inhibitors.Serum potassium concentrations were measured daily from baseline (<24 h after admission) until discharge or day 7 in 1,589 patients enrolled in the PROTECT (Placebo-Controlled Randomized Study of the Selective A1 Adenosine Receptor Antagonist Rolofylline for Patients Hospitalized with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Volume Overload to Assess Treatment Effect on Congestion and Renal Function) trial. Incident hyperkalemia was defined as at least 1 episode of potassium >.0 mEq/l. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 180 days.Overall, serum potassium concentrations increased from 4.3 ± 0.6 mEq/l at baseline to 4. ± 0.6 mEq/l at discharge or day 7 (p < 0.001). Patients developing incident hyperkalemia (n = 564; 35%) were more often taking mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) therapy prior to hospitalization and were more likely to have them down-titrated during hospitalization, independent of confounders. Incident hyperkalemia was not associated with adverse outcomes. Yet, down-titration of MRAs during hospitalization was independently associated with 180-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 2.60), regardless of incident hyperkalemia (p >0.10). Patients with incident hyperkalemia who were discharged with the same or increased dose of MRAs (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.77) had a lower 180-day mortality.Incident hyperkalemia is common in patients hospitalized for acute HF and is not associated with adverse outcomes. Incident hyperkalemia is associated with down-titration of MRAs, but patients who maintained or increased their dose of MRAs and/or ACE inhibitors/ARB during acute HF hospitalization had better 180-day survival.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring , could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML  years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities.A 60-year-old female developed PML  years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms.When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves inflammation and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV. Steroid pulse therapy, which can reduce inflammation, should thus be administered in organ transplantation cases with differential diagnoses including PML-IRIS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619537> LprE Suppresses TLR2-Dependent Cathelicidin and Autophagy Expression to Enhance Bacterial Survival in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Despite representing a very important class of virulence proteins, the role of lipoproteins in the pathogenesis of  remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of putative lipoprotein LprE in the subversion of host immune responses using the  CDC1551 LprE (LprE  ) mutant (∆LprE). We show that deletion of LprE  results in reduction of  virulence in human and mouse macrophages due to upregulation of vitamin D3-responsive cathelicidin expression through the TLR2-dependent p38-MAPK-CYP27B1-VDR signaling pathway. Conversely, episomal expression of LprE  in  improved bacterial survival. Infection in siTLR2-treated or  macrophages reduced the survival of LprE  expressing  and  because of a surge in the expression of cathelicidin. Infection with the LprE  mutant also led to accumulation of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, Atg-, and Beclin-1) and augmented recruitment of phagosomal (EEA1 and Rab7) and lysosomal (LAMP1) proteins, thereby resulting in the reduction of the bacterial count in macrophages. The inhibition of phago-lysosome fusion by LprE  was found to be due to downregulation of IL-12 and IL-22 cytokines. Altogether, our data indicate that LprE  is an important virulence factor that plays a crucial role in mycobacterial pathogenesis in the context of innate .Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658543>[Clinical randomized controlled trial on influence of recombinant human growth hormone on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries].</a></h2><p> To preliminarily investigate the influence of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries.  A total of 30 younger children with severe burn injuries, conforming to the study criteria, were admitted to our hospital from July 2016 to July 2018. They were enrolled in the prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial and divided into group rhGH [=15, 10 boys and  girls, aged (22±10) months] and control group [=15, 8 boys and 7 girls, aged (21±7) months] according to the random number table. The patients in control group received anti-shock, anti-infection, and wound caring therapies, etc. On the basis of above-mentioned treatment, the patients in group rhGH were subcutaneously injected with rhGH once every night before bedding, with a dosage of 0.2 IU·kg(-1)·d(-1), from the 3rd day post injury for 7 consecutive days. Before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatments, the fasting peripheral venous blood was collected from patients in both groups. Blood glucose level was detected by glucometer. Percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD3(+) T lymphocytes, CD19(+) B lymphocytes, and ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometer. Mass concentration of serum immune globulin (Ig) A, IgG, and complement C3 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test, independent sample  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement and Bonferroni correction, and Mann-Whitney  test.  (1) The blood glucose levels of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=0.474, 1.652, 1.997, >0.05). The glucose levels of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment [(6.9±1.0) and (7.7±1.1) mmol/L] were significantly higher than (.9±0.9) mmol/L before rhGH treatment (<0.05). The glucose level of children in control group on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (2) The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH before rhGH treatment and on the 7th day of rhGH treatment were (35.1±2.0)% and (38.±2.2)%, which were close to (36.2±2.0)% and (33.6±2.2)% in control group, respectively (=0.371, 1.553, >0.05). The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment[(44.7±2.2)%] was significantly higher than (36.±2.2)% in control group (=2.624, <0.05). The percentage of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment (<0.05). The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in control group on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were both close to the percentage before rhGH treatment (>0.05). (3) The percentage of CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd day of rhGH treatment was significantly lower than that in control group (=2.107, <0.05). (4) The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment (2.36±0.20) was significantly higher than 1.72±0.20 in control group (=2.285, <0.05). The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than 2.04±0.19 before rhGH treatment (<0.05). () The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and CD19(+) B lymphocytes of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=1.913, 0.552, 1.327, 1.465, 1.587, 0.407, >0.05). The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were significantly higher than the percentage before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (6) The mass concentration of serum IgA, complement C3, and IgG of children in the two groups was similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=-1.596, -0.100, 1.263, -0.220, 1.378, 1.631, =0.228, 0.519, 1.182, >0.05). The mass concentration of serum IgA and complement C3 of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment(<0.05).  rhGH has little effect on humoral  of younger children with severe burn injuries with limited influence on CD19(+) B lymphocyte, mass concentration of serum IgA, IgG, and complement C3.

Virus neutralizing antibodies are likely to be critical for clinical  after vaccination or natural infection. A number of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have previously been characterized as able to neutralize the infectivity of dengue virus (DENV) for mammalian cells in cell-culture systems.We tested the capacity of 12 human mAbs, each of which had previously been shown to neutralize DENV in cell-culture systems, to abrogate the infectiousness of dengue patient viremic blood for mosquitoes. Seven of the twelve mAbs (1F4, 14c10, 2D22, 1L12, 5J7, 747(4)B7, 753(3)C10), almost all of which target quaternary epitopes, inhibited DENV infection of Ae. aegypti. The mAbs 14c10, 747(4)B7 and 753(3)C10 could all inhibit transmission of DENV in low microgram per mL concentrations. An Fc-disabled variant of 14c10 was as potent as its parent mAb.The results demonstrate that mAbs can neutralize infectious DENV derived from infected human cells, in the matrix of human blood. Coupled with previous evidence of their ability to prevent DENV infection of mammalian cells, such mAbs could be considered attractive antibody classes to elicit with dengue vaccines, or alternatively, for consideration as therapeutic candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635817>3D synergistical rGO/Eu(TPyP)(Pc) hybrid aerogel for high-performance NO gas sensor with enhanced  to humidity.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of Internet of Things and portable electronics create an unprecedented demand for the high performance gas sensors. To pursuit such sensor, sandwich-type (phthalocyaninato)(porphyrinato) europium double-decker complex Eu(TPyP)(Pc) [TPyP = meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin; Pc = phthalocyanine] was in situ self-assembled on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) driven by the π-π interaction, forming a 3D synergistical rGO/Eu(TPyP)(Pc) hybrid aerogel. The resulting aerogel not only effectively integrates the gas sensing of Eu(TPyP)(Pc) and good conductivity of rGO, but also exhibited a prominent synergy effect. Ascribed to the attractive properties, the fabricated NO gas sensor exhibits superior sensitivity and selectivity in the range of 0. to 100 ppm with an extremely low theoretical limit level of detection (80 ppb) at ambient temperature. The response and recovery time of rGO/Eu(TPyP)(Pc) hybrid aerogel based sensor to20 ppm NO were 172 and 828 s, respectively. Remarkably, the hydrophobic porous structure of rGO/Eu(TPyP)(Pc) hybrid aerogel endows the prepared sensor with excellent  to high relative humidity, which conquered the key technical issue of real application. The present sensor, simultaneously featured with high performance, low-power consumption, and good tolerance to environmental variations, is anticipated to offer the "on-site" and "on-line" measurement tool in real samples.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Altered taste sensations lead to a decreased appetite that is usually one of the frequent causes of malnutrition in patients with diseases. Ongoing taste research has identified pathways of a variety of drugs that cause changes in the taste perceptions in cancer, increasing our understanding of taste disturbances attributable to the aberrant mechanisms of taste sensations. The evidence discussed in this review, which addresses the implication of the innate immune response in the modulation of taste functions, focuses on the adverse effects on the taste transmission from taste buds by immune modulators, responsible for the alterations in the perceived intensity of some taste modalities. Another factor such as damage to taste progenitor cells, in which directly results in local effects in taste buds, is also acted toward relation to taste disturbances of patients in cancer. The recent discovery provides the insights into the pathophysiology of taste dysfunctions, which is associated with the specific treatments. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The paradigm that taste signals transmitted to the brain are determined only by the tastant-mediated activation via taste receptors has been challenged by the immune modification of taste transmission through drugs during processing gustatory information in taste buds. The findings in a model system (mouse taste buds) explain the basis for taste dysfunctions of patients in cancer that has long been observed but never understood.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651363>Systemic and local  following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells in synovial sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Gene-modified autologous T cells expressing NY-ESO-1, an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1-specific HLA-A*02-restricted peptide SLLMWITQC (NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells; GSK 794), have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (SS). The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. Serum cytokines were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infusion, the TME exhibited minimal leukocyte infiltration; CD163 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were the dominant population. Modest increases in intra-tumoral leukocytes (≤%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8 weeks. Beyond 8 weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that non-T-cell inflamed tumors, which are resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, can be treated with adoptive T-cell based immunotherapy.ClinicalTrials.gov,  , Registered 27 April 2011.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629810>Study the immunomodulation of anthracenedione in striped dwarf catfish, Mystus vittatus against pathogenic bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila.</a></h2><p>Anthracenedione is a derivative of anthraquinone aromatic organic natural pigments found in senna, aloe latex, rhubarb, cascara, lichens, and fungi having broad range of bioactivity, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant, anti-viral activities suggesting potential for clinical purpose of many diseases.

Oncolytic adenovirus, a novel strategy of cancer therapy, shows potential use in OC treatment. However, its clinical application is limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. Thus, this study aimed to examine the efficacy of a new modified adenovirus against OC in vitro and in vivo.A multiple modified adenovirus (MMAD) armed with IL-13 (MMAD-IL-13) was constructed, and its effect on Cal-27 cells was examined. The potency of MMAD-IL-13 was examined in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro experiment, CCK-8 kit was used to determine the IC50 of MMAD-IL-3 in OC cell lines. For in vivo experiment, Cal-27 xenograft models were used to determine the antitumor effect of MMAD-IL-13. Apoptosis was measured in Cal-27 cells by Western blotting assay.  response was detected in Cal-27 xenograft models 7 days after intratumoral injection with MMAD-IL-13. The potency of MMAD and MMAD-IL-13 was compared in Cal-27 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) models.MMAD-IL-13 was successfully constructed; the harvested virus could be replicated and they overexpressed human IL-13 in Cal-27 cells. Compared with MMAD, MMAD-IL-13 showed enhanced antitumor effect in vitro by inducing apoptosis and reducing percentage of M2 macrophages in tumor environment in vivo. MMAD-IL-13 also showed potent antitumor effect in Cal-27, SCC-4, and Tca8113 cells in vitro and in Cal-27 xenograft models in vivo. However, MMAD-IL13 did not harm normal human oral epithelial cells in vitro and exhibited no effect on body weight in Cal-27 xenograft models. In Cal-27 PBMC models, MMAD-IL-13 showed stronger antitumor effect than MMAD.A new oncolytic adenovirus carrying the human IL-13 gene was constructed. This virus effectively led to remission of tumor development and death of OC cells in vivo and in vitro, showing its potential as a clinical cancer therapy.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632028>Self-Assembled Nanofibers Elicit Potent HPV16 E7-Specific Cellular  And Abolish Established TC-1 Graft Tumor.</a></h2><p>Vaccines are one of the most promising strategies for immunotherapy of HPV associated tumors; however, they generally lack significant clinical efficacy at present. This inefficacy might be due to inefficient generation of anti-tumor cellular immune responses.This study aimed to assess the potential of using self-assembled nanofibers as a new vaccine platform to elicit potent HPV antigen - specific anti-tumor .A HPV16 E7 peptide was chemically appended to the N terminus of self-assembling peptide Q11. The nanofibers were prepared and used to immunize mice through a preventive or therapeutic strategy in a TC-1 graft tumor model.Preventive immunization with nanofibers almost completely suppressed the growth of primarily grafted TC-1 tumors and even a re-challenge of tumor cells after a six-week rest. Therapeutic immunization significantly increased the levels of effector Th1 cells, CTLs and the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in E7 peptide-stimulated splenocytes, and the immunization reduced Th2, MDSC and IL-4 contents compared to the controls. The nanofiber immunization significantly suppressed the growth of established tumors and achieved 66.7% and 50% tumor-free in mice carrying 2-3 mm tumors and even larger tumors with a diameter of -6 mm respectively. In addition, the nanofibers were more efficient than the corresponding unassembled peptides for the treatment of established larger size tumors.The results indicated that self-assembling nanofibers could elicit robust HPV antigen -specific anti-tumor cellular  and are a potent antigen delivery system for HPV related tumor vaccines.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657920>Vaccine Adjuvants Derivatized from  Saponins I and II.</a></h2><p>We have derivatized  saponins (MS) I and II through their coupling at C3 glucuronic acid site with dodecylamine.

The aim of this study is to summarize the main characteristics of the measles resurgence that occurred in Serbia in 2014-2015. The national surveillance data on measles was analysed in relation to the clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data. Between November 2014 and December 2015 a measles resurgence with 420 cases was observed in Serbia. Measles virus was initially introduced by and spread among citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina with temporary residence in Serbia, before spreading to the resident population. Of the 223 patients with available medical records, 173 (77.6%) were unvaccinated. The overall measles incidence during the outbreak was .8/100.000. The highest age-specific incidence rate was recorded in children aged ≤4 years (25.9/100.000), but most cases (67.9%) were ≥20 years old. Hospitalization rate was high (32.9%) and included two cases of encephalitis associated with measles. In total, 42 health-care workers and 22 related cases including hospitalized patients (n = 13) contracted measles. The overall percentage of laboratory confirmed cases was 81.7% (n = 343/420). All measles virus sequences except one (D9) belonged to genotype D8, suggesting interruption of transmission after the previous outbreak in 2010-2011 caused by genotype D4 viruses. The growing number of adult patients as compared to previous epidemics, suggests an urgent need for supplementary immunization activities targeting susceptible health care workers, unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adults as well as people without vaccination records. The comprehensive investigation of the 2014/2015 measles resurgence will contribute to decisions about appropriate countermeasures to stop the future measles resurgences in Serbia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607468>Hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat interventions against iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: a randomised controlled trial in The Gambia.</a></h2><p>WHO recommends daily iron supplementation for pregnant women, but adherence is poor because of side-effects, effectiveness is low, and there are concerns about possible harm.

Eligible participants were pregnant women aged 18-45 years at between 14 weeks and 22 weeks of gestation. We randomly allocated women to either WHO's recommended regimen (ie, a daily UN University, UNICEF, and WHO international multiple-micronutrient preparation [UNIMMAP] containing 60 mg iron), a 60 mg screen-and-treat approach (ie, daily UNIMMAP containing 60 mg iron for 7 days if weekly hepcidin was <2· μg/L or UNIMMAP without iron if hepcidin was ≥2· μg/L), or a 30 mg screen-and-treat approach (ie, daily UNIMMAP containing 30 mg iron for 7 days if weekly hepcidin was <2· μg/L or UNIMMAP without iron if hepcidin was ≥2· μg/L). We used a block design stratified by amount of haemoglobin at enrolment (above and below the median amount of haemoglobin on every enrolment day) and stage of gestation (14-18 weeks vs 19-22 weeks). Participants and investigators were unaware of the random allocation. The primary outcome was the amount of haemoglobin at day 84 and was measured as the difference in haemoglobin in each screen-and-treat group compared with WHO's recommended regimen; the non-inferiority margin was set at -·0 g/L. The primary outcome was assessed in the per-protocol population, which comprised all women who completed the study. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN21955180.Between June 16, 2014, and March 3, 2016, 498 participants were randomised, of whom 167 were allocated to WHO's recommended regimen, 166 were allocated to the 60 mg per day screen-and-treat approach, and 165 were allocated to the 30 mg per day screen-and-treat approach. 78 participants were withdrawn or lost to follow-up during the study; thus, the per-protocol population comprised 140 women assigned to WHO's recommended regimen, 133 allocated to the 60 mg screen-and-treat approach, and 147 allocated to the 30 mg screen-and-treat approach. The screen-and-treat approaches did not exceed the non-inferiority margin. Compared with WHO's recommended regimen, the difference in the amount of haemoglobin at day 84 was -2·2 g/L (95% CI -4·6 to 0·1) with the 60 mg screen-and-treat approach and -2·7 g/L (-·0 to -0·) with the 30 mg screen-and-treat approach. Adherence, reported side-effects, and adverse events were similar between the three groups. The most frequent side-effect was stomachache, which was similar in the 60 mg screen-and-treat group (82 cases per 1906 person-weeks) and with WHO's recommended regimen (81 cases per 1974 person-weeks; effect 1·0, 95% CI 0·7 to 1·6); in the 30 mg screen-and-treat group the frequency of stomachache was slightly lower than with WHO's recommended regimen (58 cases per 2009 person-weeks; effect 0·7, 95% CI 0· to 1·1). No participants died during the study.The hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat approaches had no advantages over WHO's recommended regimen in terms of adherence, side-effects, or safety outcomes. Our results suggest that the current WHO policy for iron administration to pregnant women should remain unchanged while more effective approaches continue to be sought.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK Medical Research Council.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We investigated whether baseline measures of subgingival microbiota predicted fasting plasma glucose (FPG) longitudinally. The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at 2 y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed 2-y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean 2-y FPG change was 1. ± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which  sp oral taxon 097 and  spp predicted greater FPG change, while  sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3  values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change ( < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation ( < 0.0001). FPG change values ± SE in the third versus first tertile of the MDI were 4. ± 0.9 versus 1.6 ± 0.9 ( < 1 × 10).

In both mice and humans, IAV-specific T cell responses are protective during primary as well as homologous and heterologous challenge infections. Many mouse studies have focused on CD4 T cells specific for a single, known model or IAV antigen. However, studies have demonstrated that the IAV-specific CD4 T cell response comprises many epitopes spread across multiple viral proteins. Therefore, herein we track the antigen-experienced CD4 T cell response using the surrogate markers CD49d and CD11a. This novel surrogate marker method allows us to characterize the full IAV-specific CD4 T cell response without the potential bias that could occur when examining an individual Ag-specificity. Our findings demonstrate that the immunodominant I-A-binding NP epitope often used in studies of IAV-specific CD4 T cells represents only about % of the total IAV-specific CD4 T cell response. Further, we find that the kinetics of the full pulmonary CD4 T cell response is similar to that of NP-specific T cells and that the full CD4 T cell response in the lungs is predominantly composed of cells expressing the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, with smaller but significant portions of the response expressing the Treg and Tfh associated transcription factors Foxp3 and Bcl-6, respectively. Interestingly, although Th1 cells are the most abundant Th subset in the lungs of both BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice following IAV, the relative abundance of Treg and Tfh is reversed in the different mouse strains. In BALB/c mice, Foxp3 cells are more abundant than Bcl6 cells, whereas in C57Bl/6 mice, there are more Bcl6 cells. As a whole, these data highlight the diversity of the endogenous CD4 T cell response to a primary IAV infection, providing an important context for past and future studies of the IAV-specific CD4 T cell response.Copyright © 2019 Hornick, Zacharias and Legge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624262>Targeting the mTOR pathway uncouples the efficacy and toxicity of PD-1 blockade in renal transplantation.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use remains a challenge in patients with solid organ allografts as most would undergo rejection. In a melanoma patient in whom programmed-death 1 (PD-1) blockade resulted in organ rejection and colitis, the addition of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus resulted in ongoing anti-tumor efficacy while promoting allograft tolerance. Strong granzyme B, interferon (IFN)-γ CD8 cytotoxic T cell and circulating regulatory T (T) cell responses were noted during allograft rejection, along with significant eosinophilia and elevated serum IL- and eotaxin levels. Co-treatment with sirolimus abated cytotoxic T cell numbers and eosinophilia, while elevated T cell numbers in the peripheral blood were maintained. Interestingly, numbers of IFN-γ CD4 T cells and serum IFN-γ levels increased with the addition of sirolimus treatment likely promoting ongoing anti-PD-1 efficacy. Thus, our results indicate that sirolimus has the potential to uncouple anti-PD-1 therapy toxicity and efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604165>Poor ovarian response is associated with serum vitamin D levels and pro-inflammatory immune responses in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization.</a></h2><p>Poor ovarian response (POR) limits the success of infertility treatment modality. In this study, we aim to investigate if POR is associated with serum 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) levels and pro-inflammatory immune responses in infertile women with a history of in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer failures. A retrospective cross-sectional study included 157 women with IVF failures. Study patients were divided into four groups based on serum 25(OH)VD level and ovarian responses during the most recent IVF cycle; low VD (LVD) with POR, LVD with normal ovarian response (NOR), normal VD (NVD) with POR, and NVD with NOR. Serum 25(OH)VD level, cellular- and auto-, and metabolic parameters, including homocysteine and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were investigated. Peripheral blood CD56 NK cell levels (%) and NK cytotoxicity were significantly higher in POR-LVD when compared to the other groups (P < 0.05, respectively). CD19 + B and CD19+/+ B-1 cell levels were significantly higher in women with POR-LVD as compared with those of NOR-LVD and POR-NVD (P < 0.05, respectively). TNF-α/IL-10 producing Th1/Th2 cell ratio of POR-LVD was significantly higher than those of POR-NVD and NOR-NVD (P < 0.05 respectively). Peripheral blood homocysteine level of POR-LVD was significantly higher than those of NOR-LVD and POR-NVD (P < 0.05 respectively). We conclude that assessment of cellular and autoimmune abnormalities and metabolic factors, such as homocysteine should be considered in women with POR and LVD. VD and folic acid supplementation may be explored further as a possible therapeutic option for POR with immune and metabolic etiologies.Copyright © 2019.

The pathogenesis of ITP is complex and has not been fully elucidated. Currently, researches on the pathogenesis of ITP mainly focus on the disorders of humoral  and cellular . In recent years, some new progress has been made in the study of this pathogenesis, including the platelet clearance pathway that is not dependent on Fc γ R mediation, the metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 that can regulate T and B cells, and the abnormal expression of micro RNA in genetic factors. Under the joint action of multiple factors, the imbalance of the immune system in the body leads to the occurrence of ITP. This article reviews the research progress on humoral , cellular  and other possible new pathogenesis of ITP in recent years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603622>A conserved GH17 glycosyl hydrolase from plant pathogenic Dothideomycetes releases a DAMP causing cell death in tomato.</a></h2><p>To facilitate infection, pathogens deploy a plethora of effectors to suppress basal host  induced by exogenous microbe-associated or endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In this study, we have characterized family 17 glycosyl hydrolases of the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum (CfGH17) and studied their role in infection. Heterologous expression of CfGH17-1 to  by potato virus X in different tomato cultivars showed that CfGH17-1 and CfGH17- enzymes induce cell death in Cf-0, Cf-1 and Cf- but not in Cf-Ecp3 tomato cultivars or tobacco. Moreover, CfGH17-1 orthologues from other phytopathogens, including Dothistroma septosporum and Mycosphaerella fijiensis, also trigger cell death in tomato. CfGH17-1 and CfGH17- are predicted to be β-1,3-glucanases and their enzymatic activity is required for the induction of cell death. CfGH17-1 hydrolyses laminarin, a linear 1,3-β-glucan with 1,6-β linkages. CfGH17-1 expression is down-regulated during the biotrophic phase of infection and up-regulated during the necrotrophic phase. Deletion of CfGH17-1 in C. fulvum did not reduce virulence on tomato, while constitutive expression of CfGH17-1 decreased virulence, suggesting that abundant presence of CfGH17-1 during biotrophic growth may release a DAMP that activates plant defence responses. Under natural conditions CfGH17-1 is suggested to play a role during saprophytic growth when the fungus thrives on dead host tissue, which is in line with its high levels of expression at late stages of infection when host tissues have become necrotic. We suggest that CfGH17-1 releases a DAMP from the host cell wall that is recognized by a yet unknown host plant receptor.© 2019 The Authors.

Arterial blood was sampled in the acute phase (P1), at 24-48 h (P2) and at 3 months (P3). Leucocyte RNA was isolated and gene expression analysis was performed by Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. By omission of up- or downregulated genes at P2, secondary changes from innate  were excluded. Genes differentially expressed in P1 when compared to the convalescent sample in P3 were determined as genes involved in STEMI.Three genes were upregulated at P1 compared to P3; ABCG1 (P = .81 × 10 ), RAB20 (P = 3.69 × 10 ) and TMEM2 (P = 7.75 × 10 ) whilst four were downregulated; ACVR1 (P = 9.01 × 10 ), NFATC2IP (P = 8.86 × 10 ), SUN1 (P = 3.87 × 10 ) and TTC9C (P = 7.18 × 10 ). These genes were also highly expressed in carotid atherosclerotic plaques.We found seven genes involved in STEMI. The study is unique regarding the blood sampling in the acute phase and omission of secondary expressed genes from innate .

There is evidence for the clinical effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) delivered by clinical psychologists, but few rheumatology units have psychologists.To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a group CBT programme for RA fatigue [named RAFT, i.e. Reducing Arthritis Fatigue by clinical Teams using cognitive-behavioural (CB) approaches], delivered by the rheumatology team in addition to usual care (intervention), with usual care alone (control); and to evaluate tutors' experiences of the RAFT programme.A randomised controlled trial. Central trials unit computerised randomisation in four consecutive cohorts within each of the seven centres. A nested qualitative evaluation was undertaken.Seven hospital rheumatology units in England and Wales.Adults with RA and fatigue severity of ≥ 6 [out of 10, as measured by the Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue Numerical Rating Scale (BRAF-NRS)] who had no recent changes in major RA medication/glucocorticoids.RAFT - group CBT programme delivered by rheumatology tutor pairs (nurses/occupational therapists). Usual care - brief discussion of a RA fatigue self-management booklet with the research nurse.Primary - fatigue impact (as measured by the BRAF-NRS) at 26 weeks. Secondary - fatigue severity/coping (as measured by the BRAF-NRS); broader fatigue impact [as measured by the Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue Multidimensional Questionnaire (BRAF-MDQ)]; self-reported clinical status; quality of life; mood; self-efficacy; and satisfaction. All data were collected at weeks 0, 6, 26, 52, 78 and 104. In addition, fatigue data were collected at weeks 10 and 18. The intention-to-treat analysis conducted was blind to treatment allocation, and adjusted for baseline scores and centre. Cost-effectiveness was explored through the intervention and RA-related health and social care costs, allowing the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with the EuroQol- Dimensions, five-level version (EQ-5D-5L). Tutor and focus group interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.A total of 308 out of 333 patients completed 26 weeks (RAFT,  = 156/175; control,  = 152/158). At 26 weeks, the mean BRAF-NRS impact was reduced for the RAFT programme (-1.36 units;  < 0.001) and the control interventions (-0.88 units;  < 0.004). Regression analysis showed a difference between treatment arms in favour of the RAFT programme [adjusted mean difference -0.59 units, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.11 to -0.06 units;  = 0.03, effect size 0.36], and this was sustained over 2 years (-0.49 units, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.14 units;  = 0.01). At 26 weeks, further fatigue differences favoured the RAFT programme (BRAF-MDQ fatigue impact: adjusted mean difference -3.42 units, 95% CI -6.44 to - 0.39 units,  = 0.03; living with fatigue: adjusted mean difference -1.19 units, 95% CI -2.17 to -0.21 units,  = 0.02; and emotional fatigue: adjusted mean difference -0.91 units, 95% CI -1.58 to -0.23 units,  = 0.01), and these fatigue differences were sustained over 2 years. Self-efficacy favoured the RAFT programme at 26 weeks (Rheumatoid Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale: adjusted mean difference 3.05 units, 95% CI 0.43 to .6 units;  = 0.02), as did BRAF-NRS coping over 2 years (adjusted mean difference 0.42 units, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.77 units;  = 0.02). Fatigue severity and other clinical outcomes were not different between trial arms and no harms were reported. Satisfaction with the RAFT programme was high, with 89% of patients scoring ≥ 8 out of 10, compared with 54% of patients in the control arm rating the booklet ( < 0.0001); and 96% of patients and 68% of patients recommending the RAFT programme and the booklet, respectively, to others ( < 0.001). There was no significant difference between arms for total societal costs including the RAFT programme training and delivery (mean difference £434, 95% CI -£389 to £1258), nor QALYs gained (mean difference 0.008, 95% CI -0.008 to 0.023). The probability of the RAFT programme being cost-effective was 28-35% at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's thresholds of £20,000-30,000 per QALY. Tutors felt that the RAFT programme's CB approaches challenged their usual problem-solving style, helped patients make life changes and improved tutors' wider clinical practice.Primary outcome data were missing for 25 patients; the EQ-5D-5L might not capture fatigue change; and 30% of the 2-year economic data were missing.The RAFT programme improves RA fatigue impact beyond usual care alone; this was sustained for 2 years with high patient satisfaction, enhanced team skills and no harms. The RAFT programme is < 50% likely to be cost-effective; however, NHS costs were similar between treatment arms.Given the paucity of RA fatigue interventions, rheumatology teams might investigate the pragmatic implementation of the RAFT programme, which is low cost.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN52709998.This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in ; Vol. 23, No. 57.

By feeding of β-1,3-glucans to the annual fish Nothobranchius guentheri, we detected the survivorship of the fish and estimated the development of age-related biomarkers at different stages. We first showed that administration of β-1,3-glucans was able to prolong the life span of the fish (p<0.05). We then showed that β-1,3-glucans clearly reduced the accumulation of lipofuscin in the gills and the senescence-associated-β-galactosidase in the caudal fins. Moreover, β-1,3-glucans were able to lower the levels of protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species in the muscles. Finally, β-1,3-glucans could promote the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the fish, and slow down the increase of P66shc, a critical factor involved in the regulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species contents. These data together suggest for the first time that β-1,3-glucans can extend the lifespan, delay the onset of age-related biomarkers and exert an antioxidant action of the aged fish N. guentheri. It also implies that β-1,3-glucans may be potentially useful for health care in the elderly, including extension of the lifespan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666497>Comparison of clinical features of hepatitis A in people living with HIV between pandemic in 1999-2000 and that in 2017-2018 in a metropolitan area of Japan.</a></h2><p>Since 2017, hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been an epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Japan. We experienced 11 MSM patients with hepatitis A who were also infected with HIV. In 1999-2000, we also experienced  HIV-infected patients with hepatitis A. Since conditions of current HIV-infected patients have changed owing to recent progress in anti-HIV therapies, we compared clinical features of hepatitis A between patients in 2017-2018 and those in 1999-2000. By comparing patients' background characteristics, we found the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in the 2017-2018 group. After the onset of hepatitis, peak levels of hepatic transaminases were higher in the 2017-2018 group, suggesting the hepatocellular damage was more severe. On the other hand, neither the peak level of total bilirubin nor the nadir of prothrombin time was significantly different.

Little data is available on the molecular determinants of CSFV virulence. The aim of present study is to assess a possible role for CSFV virulence of a unique uninterrupted 36-uridine (poly-U) sequence found in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of the low virulent CSFV isolate Pinar de Rio (PdR). To this end, a pair of cDNA-derived viruses based on the PdR backbone were generated, one carrying the long poly-U insertion in the 3'UTR (vPdR-36U), and the other harboring the standard  uridines at this position (vPdR-5U). Two groups of twenty -day-old piglets were infected with vPdR-36U and vPdR-5U, respectively. Ten contact piglets were added to each group. Disease progression, virus replication and immune responses were monitored during  weeks. The vPdR-5U virus was significantly more virulent than the vPdR-36U virus, with more severe disease, higher mortality and significantly higher viral loads in serum and body secretions, despite similar replication characteristics in cell culture. The two viruses were transmitted to all contact piglets. 90% of the piglets infected with vPdR-36U seroconverted while only one vPdR-5U-infected piglet developed antibodies. The vPdR-5U-infected piglets showed only transient IFN-α responses in the serum after one week of infection while the vPdR-36U-infected piglets showed sustained IFN-α levels during the first two weeks. Taken together, these data show that the 3'UTR poly-U insertion acquired by the PdR isolate reduces viral virulence and activates the innate and humoral immune responses without affecting viral transmission. Classical swine fever (CSF), a highly contagious viral disease of pigs, is still endemic in some countries of Asia and Central and South America. Considering that the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) plays an important role in Flavivirus replication, the present study showed for the first time that a long poly-uridine sequence acquired in the 3'UTR by an endemic CSFV isolate can activate , control viral replication and modulate disease in piglets. Our findings provide new avenues for the development of novel vaccines against infections with CSF virus and other flaviviruses. Knowledge of molecular virulence determinants are also relevant for future development of rapid and efficient diagnostic tools for the prediction of the virulence of field isolates and for efficient CSF control.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613356>Safety and efficacy of mucosal immunotherapy using human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7-expressing Lactobacillus-based vaccine for the treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL): the study protocol of a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (MILACLE study).</a></h2><p>We developed an HPV16 E7-expressing Lactobacillus-based therapeutic vaccine, IGMKK16E7, to elicit mucosal E7-specific TH1 cellular immune responses. This study aims to examine the safety and clinical efficacy of IGMKK16E7 on HPV16-positive high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). This is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized phase I/II trial to test the safety and efficacy of IGMKK16E7 against HPV16-positive HSIL.

Impaired transplacental transfer of influenza antibodies may reduce this protection.We conducted a cross-sectional study of influenza vaccine-naïve pregnant women recruited at delivery from Blantyre (urban, low malaria transmission) and Chikwawa (rural, high malaria transmission) in Southern Malawi. HIV-infected mothers were excluded in Chikwawa. Maternal and cord blood antibodies against circulating influenza strains A/California/7/2009, A/Victoria/361/2011, B/Brisbane/60/2008, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). We studied the impact of maternal HIV infection and placental malaria on influenza antibody levels in mother-infant pairs in Blantyre and Chikwawa, respectively.We included 454 mother-infant pairs (Blantyre, n = 253; Chikwawa, n = 201). HIV-infected mothers and their infants had lower seropositivity (HAI titer ≥1:40) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (mothers, 24.3 vs 45.4%;  = .02; infants, 24.3 vs 50.%;  = .003) and A(H3N2) (mothers, 37.8% vs 63.9%;  = .003; infants, 43.2 vs 64.8%;  = .01), whereas placental malaria had an inconsistent effect on maternal and infant seropositivity. In multivariable analyses, maternal HIV infection was associated with reduced infant seropositivity (A(H1N1)pdm09: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.79; A(H3N2): aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89). Transplacental transfer was not impaired by maternal HIV or placental malaria.Maternal HIV infection influenced maternal antibody response to influenza A virus infection, and thereby antibody levels in newborns, but did not affect transplacental antibody transfer.© The Author(s) 2019.

Serum IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results were analyzed by the Chi-square test; a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The number of seropositive participants (%) was 308 (94.%) for rubella, 295 (90.%) for VZV, 244 (74.9%) for measles, and 219 (67.2%) for mumps. A significant correlation was found between measles IgG and age. A relationship was also observed between VZV IgG and kindergarten attendance. Response rates to measles, rubella, VZV, and mumps vaccination were 96%, 92.3%, 87.%, 78.8%, respectively. The total cost of vaccination after IgG screening was less than vaccination without screening.In this study, participants'  to measles and VZV was low. Prevaccination serological screening was cost-effectiveness method for preventing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella infections. We believe that administering booster measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine doses or developing a special MMR vaccination strategy for at-risk groups may prevent MMR outbreaks.©The Author 2019.

The experimental group comprised 136 patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 236 patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 133 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, while the control group comprised 100 time- and location-matched healthy women. The concentrations of sIgA, IgG, IL-2 and IL-10 in the vaginal lavage fluid, were detected using ELISA prior to treatment and at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Prior to treatment, differences in HPV infection rate and changes in vaginal immune factors between patients with all grades of lesions and controls were statistically significant (P<0.05). Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-10 expression levels and the IL-2/IL-10 ratio in patients with different grades of lesions, with or without seroconversion, were significantly different to those in controls (P<0.05). However, the differences between changes in IgG and sIgA expression between patients with HPV seroconversion and patients with persistent HPV infection were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The results of the present study suggest that the restoration of humoral immune function promotes HPV seroconversion, and that IL-2 and IL-10 levels and their ratio may reflect the severity of cervical lesions and treatment effects to a certain extent.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615876>Genomewide Analysis of Mode of Action of the -Adenosylmethionine Analogue Sinefungin in Leishmania infantum.</a></h2><p>To further our understanding of one-carbon metabolism in the protozoan parasite , we conducted genomic screens to study how the parasite responded to sinefungin (SNF) selection. SNF is a structural analogue of -adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a key methyl group donor to a number of biomolecules. One screen consisted of sequencing SNF-resistant mutants generated by stepwise selection with gradually increasing drug concentrations. These studies demonstrated deletion of the AdoMet transporter (AdoMetT1) by intergenic recombination as a crucial loss-of-function marker for SNF resistance. The second screen consisted of Cos-seq, a gain-of-function cosmid-based genomewide functional screen with increasing SNF concentration coupled to next-generation sequencing. Cosmids enriched in that screen and sequenced led to the identification of (i) the AdoMet synthetase (METK) as the major SNF target, (ii) an mRNA [(guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (CMT1)], (iii) a leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (LCMT), (iv) two tryparedoxin genes, and (v) two protein phosphatase regulatory genes. Further functional exploration indicated that LCMT interacts with one phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP2AC) and that mutation of the C-terminal leucine residue of PP2AC affects sinefungin susceptibility. These holistic screens led to the identification of transporters, biosynthetic genes, RNA and protein methyltransferases, as well as phosphatases linked to AdoMet-mediated functions in   The two main cellular metabolic one-carbon donors are reduced folates and -adenosylmethionine, whose biosynthetic pathways have proven highly effective in chemotherapeutic interventions in various cell types. Sinefungin, a nucleoside analogue of -adenosylmethionine, was shown to have potent activity against the protozoan parasite  Here, we studied resistance to sinefungin using whole-genome approaches as a way to further our understanding of the role of -adenosylmethionine in this parasite and to reveal novel potential drug targets. These approaches allowed the characterization of novel features related to -adenosylmethionine function in  which could further help in the development of sinefungin-like compounds against this pathogenic parasite.Copyright © 2019 Bhattacharya et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658786>Dose Effects of Recombinant Adenovirus Immunization in Rodents.</a></h2><p>Recombinant adenovirus type  (rAd) has been used as a vaccine platform against many infectious diseases and has been shown to be an effective vaccine vector. The dose of the vaccine varies significantly from study to study, making it very difficult to compare immune responses and vaccine efficacy. This study determined the immune correlates induced by serial dilutions of rAd vaccines delivered intramuscularly (IM) and intranasally (IN) to mice and rats. When immunized IM, mice had substantially higher antibody responses at the higher vaccine doses, whereas, the IN immunized mice showed a lower response to the higher rAd vaccine doses. Rats did not show dose-dependent antibody responses to increasing vaccine doses. The IM immunized mice and rats also showed significant dose-dependent T cell responses to the rAd vaccine. However, the T cell  plateaued in both mice and rats at 10 and 10 vp/animal, respectively. Additionally, the highest dose of vaccine in mice and rats did not improve the T cell responses. A final vaccine analysis using a lethal influenza virus challenge showed that despite the differences in the immune responses observed in the mice, the mice had very similar patterns of protection. This indicates that rAd vaccines induced dose-dependent immune responses, especially in IM immunized animals, and that immune correlates are not as predictive of protection as initially thought.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645729>Bacterial biodiversity drives the evolution of CRISPR-based phage resistance.</a></h2><p>About half of all bacteria carry genes for CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, which provide immunological memory by inserting short DNA sequences from phage and other parasitic DNA elements into CRISPR loci on the host genome. Whereas CRISPR loci evolve rapidly in natural environments, bacterial species typically evolve phage resistance by the mutation or loss of phage receptors under laboratory conditions. Here we report how this discrepancy may in part be explained by differences in the biotic complexity of in vitro and natural environments. Specifically, by using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its phage DMS3vir, we show that coexistence with other human pathogens amplifies the fitness trade-offs associated with the mutation of phage receptors, and therefore tips the balance in favour of the evolution of CRISPR-based resistance. We also demonstrate that this has important knock-on effects for the virulence of P. aeruginosa, which became attenuated only if the bacteria evolved surface-based resistance. Our data reveal that the biotic complexity of microbial communities in natural environments is an important driver of the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptive , with key implications for bacterial fitness and virulence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665638>Mitochondrial Damage Causes Inflammation via cGAS-STING Signaling in Acute Kidney Injury.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the innate immune system. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway detects cytosolic DNA and induces innate . Here, we investigate the role of mitochondrial damage and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway using a genetically engineered animal model of cisplatin-induced AKI and cultured tubular cells. Cisplatin induced mtDNA leakage into the cytosol-probably through BCL-2-like protein 4 (BAX) pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane-in tubules, with subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby triggering inflammation and AKI progression, which is improved in STING-deficient mice. STING knockdown in cultured tubular cells ameliorates inflammatory responses induced by cisplatin. mtDNA depletion and repletion studies support tubular inflammatory responses via the cGAS-STING signal activation by cytosolic mtDNA. Therefore, we conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent activation of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway is a critical regulator of kidney injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The interactions between ILs and adaptive  have been long considered secondary to the effects on the innate immune system, but in recent years it has appeared more clearly that IL direct interactions with adaptive  are extremely important both in physiologic and pathologic immune response. In the present review we analyze the role of inflammatory ILs (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33 and IL-37) on adaptive  and briefly discuss the possible therapeutic perspectives of IL-blockade in adaptive  disorders.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654988>Total Glucosides of Paeony protects against collagen-induced mouse arthritis via inhibiting follicular helper T cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>The development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to germinal center (GC) response and autoreactive T cells, which mediate adaptive  and play an important role in stimulating the production of autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines by B cells and macrophages. Total Glucosides of Paeony (TGP) has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and analgesic effects and is widely used to treat RA. However, few studies investigated whether the therapeutic effect of TGP is associated with the inhibition of autoimmune response.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of TGP on RA.Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used, and TGP and paeoniflorin were intragastrically treated.DBA/1 mice were divided into  groups: control, model, positive drug (paeoniflorin) and high- and low-dose TGP group. After 21 days of intragastric administration, the pathological change, inflammation expression and molecular mechanism of each group of mice were detected by Micro-CT, histochemical analysis, ELLSA, Western blot, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.Our study found that TGP treatment effectively improved inflammation and joint destruction in CIA mice. It reduced the production of serum IgG2a and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including serum interleukin (IL)-21, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, TGP could suppress the frequency of germinal center B cells and Tfh cells in the spleen.TGP can not only improve symptoms, but also inhibit bone destruction. The therapeutic effect of TGP on CIA is mainly achieved by inhibiting spleen Tfh cell differentiation and GC formation through STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
