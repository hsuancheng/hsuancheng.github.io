Despite major improvements over years, the cryoprotectant solutions are still a major source of concern, mostly due to their chemical toxicity and suboptimal protection against cryoinjuries. In this work, we introduced natural honey as a non-permeating cryoprotectant to replace traditionally used sucrose in embryo vitrification. The proposed media were compared with conventional ones by evaluating vitrified/warmed mouse embryos based on their re-expansion, hatching rate and transcription pattern of selected genes involved in heat-shock response, apoptosis and oxidative stress. Despite the similar high re-expansion rate, molecular fingerprint of the cryopreservation is remarkably reduced when honey is used instead of sucrose. The biological response of the proposed media was explained from a fundamental point of view using antioxidant analysis, DSC and GC techniques. It was found that the proposed honey-based medium is less thermodynamically prone to ice formation, which along with its antioxidant capacity can control the production of  radicals and minimize the stress-induced transcriptional response. Furthermore, this work tries to correlate the physico-chemical properties of the vitrification solutions with the cellular and molecular aspects of the cryopreservation and proposes the application of natural cryoprotectants in cryobiology.Copyright © 2019.

To identify the physicochemical determinants of GO's antimicrobial activity, we generated different modified Hummer's GO materials thermally annealed (at 200, 500, or 800 °C) to modify the surface  groups. The plating assays show that as received GO (ARGO) and TGO200, TGO500 and TGO800 reduce E. coli viability by 50% (EC50) at 183, 143, 127 and 86 µg/mL, respectively, indicating higher bacterial toxicity as ARGO is reduced. To uncover the GO toxicity mechanism, fluorescent dye-based assays were used to measure oxidative stress at the EC50. ARGO showed an increase in reactive  species (ROS) whereas TGO500 and TGO800 increased fluorescein diacetate (FDA) by 30 and 42% indicating a decrease in cell permeability. Due to a possible wrapping mechanism, plating assays after a post-exposure sonication were performed to explain TGO's low oxidative response and high FDA levels. Results show no difference in colony forming units, indicating that cell entrapment and inhibition of cell growth by GO are present. By comparing different GO samples at their EC50, this study reveals that reduction of GO alter both the mechanisms of cellular interaction and the degree of toxicity to bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694545>Low pH effects on reactive  species and methylglyoxal metabolisms in Citrus roots and leaves.</a></h1><p>Limited data are available on the responses of reactive  species (ROS) and methylglyoxal (MG) metabolisms to low pH in roots and leaves. In China, quite a few of Citrus are cultivated in acidic soils (pH < 5.0). 'Xuegan' (Citrus sinensis) and 'Sour pummelo' (Citrus grandis) (C. sinensis were more tolerant to low pH than C. grandis) seedlings were irrigated daily with nutrient solution at a pH of 2.5, 3 or 5 for nine months. Thereafter, we examined low pH effects on growth, and superoxide anion production rate (SAP), malondialdehyde (MDA), MG, antioxidants, and enzymes related to ROS and MG detoxification in roots and leaves in order to (a) test the hypothesis that low pH affected ROS and MG metabolisms more in roots than those of leaves, and (b) understand the roles of ROS and MG metabolisms in Citrus low pH-tolerance and -toxicity.Compared with control, most of the physiological parameters related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greatly altered at pH 2.5, but almost unaffected at pH 3. In addition to decreased root growth, many fibrous roots became rotten and died at pH 2.5. pH 2.5-induced changes in SAP, the levels of MDA, MG and antioxidants, and the activities of most enzymes related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greater in roots than those of leaves. Impairment of root ascorbate metabolism was the most serious, especially in C. grandis roots. pH 2.5-induced increases in MDA and MG levels in roots and leaves, decreases in the ratios of ascorbate/(ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) in roots and leaves and of reduced glutathione/(reduced+oxidized glutathione) in roots were greater in C. grandis than those in C. sinensis.Low pH affected MG and ROS metabolisms more in roots than those in leaves. The most seriously impaired ascorbate metabolism in roots was suggested to play a role in low pH-induced root death and growth inhibition. Low pH-treated C. sinensis roots and leaves had higher capacity to maintain a balance between ROS and MG production and their removal via detoxification systems than low pH-treated C. grandis ones, thus contribute to the higher acid-tolerance of C. sinensis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697058>Promoting photodegradation efficiency via a heterojunction photocatalyst combining with  direct and fast diffusion from gas phase to active catalytic sites.</a></h1><p>The low solubility of  in solution is the main obstacle for the biodegradation of organic pollutant in wastewater. To address this problem, inspired by the degradation mechanism of aerobic bacterial towards organic pollutants, a novel photodegradation system was presented operated by a heterojunction photocatalyst combining with a hydrophobic tri-phase interface allowing  to directly diffuse from gas phase to active catalytic sites submersed in polluted solution. Specially, the heterojunction photocatalyst was fabricated by graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (C3N4 NS) sensitized with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP). The resulting photocatalyst was coated on a certain part of the commercial superhydrophobic carbon paper (CP) and submersed in the polluted wastewater, while the other part of hydrophobic CP (without coating with C3N4-TCPP nanocomposite) was exposed to air to form gas-liquid-solid tri-phase photodegradation system. With this system, the photodegradation rate was 10-fold higher than that of conventional liquid/solid diphase system in  saturated solution. This was, on one hand, due to the abundant  on the surface of photocatalyst coming from the fast and directly diffusion from gas phase through superhydrophobic nanoporous of CP. On the other hand, the hybrid C3N4-TCPP nanocomposite enhanced the light absorption efficiency under simulated sunlight irradiation and restrained the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole. Moreover, the tri-phase photodegradation system was stable in aqueous solution for a long time and can be reused almost without attenuation for five cycles, which provided a great potential to utilize for the practical wastewater treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690051>Oxidative Stress Markers to Investigate the Effects of Hyperoxia in Anesthesia.</a></h1><p> (O) is commonly used in clinical practice to prevent or treat hypoxia, but if used in excess (hyperoxia), it may act as toxic. O toxicity arises from the enhanced formation of Reactive  Species (ROS) that exceed the antioxidant defenses and generate oxidative stress. In this study, we aimed at assessing whether an elevated fraction of inspired  (FiO) during and after general anesthesia may contribute to the unbalancing of the pro-oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium. We measured five oxidative stress biomarkers in blood samples from patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, randomly assigned to FiO = 0.40 vs. 0.80: hydroperoxides, antioxidants, nitrates and nitrites (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathionyl hemoglobin (HbSSG). The MDA concentration was significantly higher 24 h after surgery, and the body antioxidant defense lower, in the FiO = 0.80 group with respect to both the FiO = 0.40 group and the baseline values ( ≤ 0.05, Student's -test). HbSSG in red blood cells was also higher in the FiO = 0.80 group at the end of the surgery. NO was higher in the FiO = 0.80 group than the FiO = 0.40 group at t = 2 h after surgery. MDA, the main end product of the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids directly influenced by FiO, may represent the best marker to assess the pro-oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium after surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690284>Efficiency and safety of phenylephrine and tropicamide used in premature retinopathy: a prospective observational study.</a></h1><p>To determine effects and side effects of topical application of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 0.5% combination in preterm infants.In this prospective observational study, 60 infants undergoing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening were prospectively observed. Pupillary diameter, blood pressure, heart rate, and  saturation were monitored before and after up to 24 h during ROP screening examinations.The mean pupillary diameter 1 h after the instillation of drops was 5.58 ± 0.75 mm for both eyes. The mean systolic and diastolic pressure and  saturation of infants did not change statistically until the end of the study. The average heart rate decreased by a mean of 4.96 beats/minute from the baseline following eye drops instillation.

This was a secondary analysis of physical activity data for patients admitted to the internal medicine and surgical wards. Physical activity data, collected with a wireless patch sensor, was operationalized as time spent lying, sitting/standing, and walking. Barriers to physical activity included patients' pain levels, the use of urinary catheters, intravenous tubing,  lines, drains, and level of dependence. Regression analysis explored the relationship between physical activity and barriers to physical activity. Physical activity data were collected in 39 patients (aged 27-88, mean 54 years) during hospital stay. Patients were admitted for a median of 10 d (interquartile range [IQR]: 7-15 d). These patients were lying for a median of 12.1 h (7.6-17.7), sitting/standing 11.8 h (6.3-15.7), and walking 0.1 h (0-0.3) per day. Time lying during the day related to pain levels (β = 0.4 h per unit increase in pain,  < 0.01) and drain use (β = 3.1 h,  < 0.01). Patients spent the most time during the hospital stay lying in bed. Improved pain management and decreased drain use may be worth exploring to increase inpatient physical activity.Implications for rehabilitationContinuous monitoring of physical activity in patients during hospital stay is an important tool for health care professionals to improve multidisciplinary care and rehabilitation.Health care professionals should be aware of the necessity of adequate pain management and critically review the use of drains in order to improve physical activity of patients during hospital stay.Patients need extra support of health care professionals to increase physical activity during consecutive days of their hospital stay.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697272>[Hypnosis in transesophageal echocardiography.

Vital parameters (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP],  saturation [SO2] before, during and after the procedure) and drug administration were recorded. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was performed before and after TEE, the memory and experience of TEE through a structured interview were assessed.All patients in the hypnosis group performed TEE without any sedation. As for anxiety before TEE, no significant differences were observed between groups; after TEE all patients were less anxious than at the beginning (p<0.001) with a greater decrease in patients of the hypnosis group (p<0.001). Before TEE, there were no significant differences also in HR, BP and SO2. During TEE in both groups a similar increase in HR and BP was found (p<0.001), whereas SO2 values remained stable. In the responses to the structured interview, 94% of patients in the sedation group remembered everything vs 36% of the hypnosis group (p<0.05). No differences were found in the other answers between the two groups.Hypnosis in TEE is useful to improve the emotional experience of patients with congenital heart disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695465>How Western Diet And Lifestyle Drive The Pandemic Of Obesity And Civilization Diseases.</a></h1><p>Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive  species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695471>Linagliptin Inhibits Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation Concentration-Dependently And -Independently.</a></h1><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, prevent inflammation. However, the in vitro effects of linagliptin are unclear. Moreover, although linagliptin inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, the anti-inflammatory effects of linagliptin in this context are not concentration-dependent. In the absence of LPS-binding protein (LBP), the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS involve pathways other than the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 pathway. Here, we aimed to determine the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of linagliptin in an experimental model in which LBP was added to the medium.Human U937 monocytes were cultured at 1 × 10 cells/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium and differentiated into macrophages using phorbol myristate acetate. All processes were carried out in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 48 hrs of culture, we replaced the medium and pretreated the cells with 100, 250, 500, or 2500 nM linagliptin for 1 hr. We exchanged the medium again, and the cells were treated with 1 ng/mL LPS with or without 100, 250, 500, or 2500 nM linagliptin. Interleukin (IL)-6 and LBP in the supernatant, nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p65 in the nucleus, and reactive  species (ROS) in the cells, as important markers of the mechanism of inflammation induction by LPS, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.Linagliptin significantly prevented LPS-stimulated IL-6 production and intranuclear NF-κB/p65 levels in a concentration-dependent manner. LPS-induced intracellular ROS levels were significantly decreased by linagliptin at all concentrations. LBP levels were markedly higher in FBS-containing medium than in medium without FBS. However, LBP levels did not change following administration of linagliptin and/or LPS.Concentration-dependent and -independent inflammatory suppression was observed following linagliptin treatment in the context of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Thus, our findings suggested that linagliptin induced two different mechanisms to repress inflammation, i.e., TLR4-dependent and -independent mechanisms.© 2019 Sato et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696622>Tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) exhibits immunotoxicity in murine macrophages.</a></h1><p>Tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) has been linked to endocrine disruption, hepatotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. However, its immunotoxicity remains largely unknown. In the present study, RAW 264.7 cells, mouse macrophage cell line, were exposed to TBECH. MTT assays showed that TBECH significantly enhanced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in RAW 264.7 cells. The mRNA expression of some proapoptotic genes was upregulated by TBECH. Accordingly, TBECH elevated caspase-3 activity. In addition, TBECH upregualted the mRNA levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas it downregulated LPS-stimulated mRNA expression of these cytokines. Moreover, TBECH downregulated the mRNA expression of selected antigen presenting-related genes. Furthermore, TBECH increased reactive  species level, reduced glutathione content and the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and upregulated the mRNA expression of selected oxidative stress-related genes. The obtained data demonstrated that TBECH exhibits immunotoxicity in macrophages, and will help to evaluate its health risks.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698021>Critical role of oxidatively damaged DNA in selective noradrenergic vulnerability.</a></h1><p>An important pathology in Parkinson's disease is the earlier and more severe degeneration of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) than dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, the basis of such selective vulnerability to insults remains obscure. Using noradrenergic and dopaminergic cell lines, as well as primary neuronal cultures from rat LC and ventral mesencephalon (VM), the present study compared oxidative DNA damage response markers after exposure of these cells to hydrogen peroxide (HO). The results showed that HO treatment resulted in more severe cell death in noradrenergic cell lines SK-N-BE(2)-M17 and PC12 than dopaminergic MN9D cells. Furthermore, there were higher levels of oxidative DNA damage response markers in noradrenergic cells and primary neuronal cultures from the LC than dopaminergic cells and primary cultures from the VM. It included increased tail moments and tail lengths in Comet assay, and increased protein levels of phosphor-p53 and γ-H2AX after treatments with HO. Consistent with these measurements, exposure of SK-N-BE(2)-M17 cells to HO resulted in higher levels of reactive  species. Further experiments showed that exposure of SK-N-BE(2)-M17 cells to HO caused an increased level of noradrenergic transporter, reduced protein levels of copper transporter and 8-oxoGua DNA glycosylase, as well as amplified levels of Ca1.2 and Ca1.3 expression. Taken together, these experiments indicated that noradrenergic neuronal cells seem to be more vulnerable to oxidative damage than dopaminergic neurons, which may be related to the intrinsic characteristics of noradrenergic neuronal cells.Copyright © 2019.

A breath-hold challenge is usually used in clinical and research settings to simulate cardiovascular and cerebrovascular changes that mimic OSA events. This work utilises temporal arterial  saturation (SpO) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to estimate the temporal cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) waveform. Measurements of CBFv, SpO, and PPG, were acquired concurrently from volunteers performing two different protocols of breath-hold challenge in the supine position. Past values of the SpO and PPG signals were used to estimate the current values of CBFv using different permutations and topologies of supervised learning with shallow artificial neural networks (ANNs). The measurements from one protocol were used to train the ANNs and find the optimum topologies, which in turn were tested using the other protocol. Data collected from 10 normotensive, healthy subjects (four females, age 28.5 ± 6.1 years, Body Mass Index (BMI) 24.0 ± 4.7 kg/m) were used in this study. The results show that different subjects have different optimum topologies for ANNs, thus indicating the effects of inter-subject variability on ANNs. Successfully reconstructed blind waveforms for the same subject group in the second protocol showed a reasonable accuracy of 60-80% estimation compared to the measured waveforms.Temporal waveforms for SpO and PPG contain adequate information to estimate the temporal CBFv waveform using ANNs.Concurrent measurements of SpO and PPG using pulse oximetry from the forehead and CBFv from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using transcranial Doppler (TCD) were recorded from healthy, normotensive subjects performing a breath-hold challenge. The breath-hold challenge mimicked the cerebrovascular response to apnoea, and was recorded by measuring CBFv in MCA. Two protocols were used, each consisting of five breath-holding manoeuvres and differing in terms of the time between the five successive breath-holds. Using data from one protocol, several permutations of the temporal values of SpO and PPG signals were used as inputs to different ANN topologies, in order to train and find the optimum model. The optimum model was evaluated using the data from the other protocol as a blind dataset.Using the first protocol for training, optimum ANN configurations were found to be different for each subject, and accuracy of 75-87% was achieved. When these optimum ANN models were tested using the second protocol as a blind dataset, the accuracy achieved was around 60-80%.A novel approach employing temporal records of SpO and PPG can be used to estimate the CBFv waveform using ANNs with acceptable accuracy. Increases in the size and diversity of the population dataset and the use of features extracted from SpO and PPG signals are needed for generalisation of the method and potential future clinical applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Transcription factors, which regulate the expression of many genes and can simultaneously alter multiple phenotypes, may be common targets of selection if the benefits of induced changes outweigh the costs of negative pleiotropic effects. We combined complimentary population genetic analyses and physiological experiments in North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) to examine links between genetic variation in transcription factors that coordinate physiological responses to hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factors, HIFs) and multiple physiological traits that potentially contribute to high-altitude adaptation. First, we sequenced the exomes of 100 mice sampled from different elevations and discovered that several SNPs in the gene Epas1, which encodes the  sensitive subunit of HIF-2α, exhibited extreme allele frequency differences between highland and lowland populations. Broader geographic sampling confirmed that Epas1 genotype varied predictably with altitude throughout the western US. We then discovered that Epas1 genotype influences heart rate in hypoxia, and the transcriptomic responses to hypoxia (including HIF targets and genes involved in catecholamine signaling) in the heart and adrenal gland. Finally, we used a demographically-informed selection scan to show that Epas1 variants have experienced a history of spatially varying selection, suggesting that differences in cardiovascular function and gene regulation contribute to high-altitude adaptation. Our results suggest a mechanism by which Epas1 may aid long-term survival of high-altitude deer mice and provide general insights into the role that highly pleiotropic transcription factors may play in the process of environmental adaptation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690520>Impact of hyperoxia on patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit for acute heart failure.</a></h1><p> therapy remains a cornerstone of treatment for acute heart failure in patients with pulmonary congestion. While avoiding hypoxaemia has long been a goal of critical care practitioners, less attention has been paid to the potential hazard related to excessive hyperoxia.To evaluate the impact of early hyperoxia exposure among critically ill patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit for acute heart failure.In this preliminary study conducted in a Parisian intensive care unit, we assessed patients with acute heart failure admitted with pulmonary congestion and treated with  therapy from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016. The hyperoxia group was defined by having at least one partial pressure of  measurement>100mmHg on the first day following admission to the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were 30-day unplanned hospital admissions, occurrence of infections and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay.Seventy-five patients were included. Forty-three patients (57.3%) presented hyperoxia, whereas 32 patients (42.7%) did not (control group). The baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between the two groups. The primary endpoint was not statistically different between the two groups (14.0% in the hyperoxia group vs 18.8% in the control group; P=0.85). The secondary endpoints were also not significantly different between the two groups. In the multivariable analysis, hyperoxia was not associated with increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.24-2.41).In patients referred to an intensive care unit for acute heart failure, we did not find any difference in outcomes according to the presence of hyperoxia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The synthesized material (CuCs) was characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, FTIR, TEM, FESEM, XRD, DLS, and XPS. The fluorescence spectroscopy, microscopy and Raman spectroscopy results suggested CuCs to work well as a bi-modal imaging nanoprobe (fluorescence/SERS). The cell culture studies prove significant cytocompatibility and ROS scavenging property of the samples with respect to control. Further, CuCs-gelatin nanocomposite thin films were prepared and implanted into rodent deep wound model. The histological study has showed enhanced angiogenesis in the subcutaneous region. The results were validated by immuno-histochemistry.

Previously, we reported that astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has protective effects against the oxidative stress of DCM. This study aimed to determine the effect of APS on the oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in H9C2 cells.Rat H9C2 cells were cultured in vitro and randomly divided into the control group, HG group, APS-HG group, siRNASOD2 group, and APS-siRNASOD2 group. The cellular ultrastructure was measured by transmission electron microscopy. Cell apoptosis was examined by TUNEL staining. Levels of reactive  species (ROS) were detected by a quantitative fluorescence assay (DHE). 8-OH-dG and nitrotyrosine, the indicators of oxidative stress injury, were detected by immunohistochemistry. A PCR array was used to evaluate the expression levels of 84 oxidative stress genes in cultured cells, and the PCR array results were partially verified by Western blot.APS treatment protected the H9C2 cell ultrastructure, reduced the level of cell apoptosis, inhibited cellular ROS production, and reduced the levels of oxidative stress injury indicators 8-OH-dG and nitrotyrosine in high glucose-induced or SOD2-silenced H9C2 cells.

Structural changes in the endoplasmic reticulum were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78, C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were determined by Western blotting. The effect of Tβ4 on OGD/R injury was evaluated by adding exogenous Tβ4 to neuronal cultures.Cortical neurons were identified by the expression of neuron-specific enolase. In OGD/R cells, the rate of apoptosis was increased and GRP78, CHOP, and Bax were upregulated whereas Bcl-2 was downregulated relative to the control group. These effects were reversed by Tβ4 overexpression. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was observed in the OGD/R group, but this was abolished in neurons overexpressing Tβ4. The protective effect of Tβ4 against OGD/R injury was also demonstrated in cells treated with exogenous Tβ4 (10 ng/mL), which blocked OGD/R-induced apoptosis by inhibiting ER stress-related and pro-apoptotic protein expression.Tβ4 prevents OGD/R-induced ER stress-dependent apoptosis in cortical neurons, and is a potential treatment for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692282>Excess postexercise  consumption decreases with swimming duration in a labriform fish: Integrating aerobic and anaerobic metabolism across time.</a></h1><p>Many vertebrate animals employ anaerobic pathways during high-speed exercise, even if it imposes an energetic cost during postexercise recovery, expressed as excess postexercise  consumption (EPOC). In ectotherms such a fish, the initial anaerobic contribution to exercise is often substantial. Even so, fish may recover from anaerobic pathways as swimming exercise ensues and aerobic metabolism stabilizes, thus total energetic costs of exercise could depend on swimming duration and subsequent physiological recovery. To test this hypothesis, we examined EPOC in striped surfperch (Embiotoca lateralis) that swam at high speeds (3.25 L s ) during randomly ordered 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min exercise periods. We found that EPOC was highest after the 2-min period (20.9 mg O  kg ) and lowest after the 20-min period (13.6 mg O  kg ), indicating that recovery from anaerobic pathways improved with exercise duration. Remarkably, EPOC for the 2-min period accounted for 72% of the total O consumption, whereas EPOC for the 20-min period only accounted for 14%. Thus, the data revealed a striking decline in the total cost of transport from 0.772 to 0.226 mg O ·kg ·m during 2- and 20-min periods, respectively. Our study is the first to combine anaerobic and aerobic swimming costs to demonstrate an effect of swimming duration on EPOC in fish. Clarifying the dynamic nature of exercise-related costs is relevant to extrapolating laboratory findings to animals in the wild.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694142>In Situ Formation of Ag Nanoparticles in Mesoporous TiO Films Decorated on Bamboo via Self-Sacrificing Reduction to Synthesize Nanocomposites with Efficient Antifungal Activity.</a></h1><p>We developed a novel green approach for the in situ fabrication of Ag NPs in mesoporous TiO films via the bamboo self-sacrificing reduction of Ag(NH) ions, which can inhibit fungal growth on the bamboo surface. Mesoporous anatase TiO (MT) films were first synthesized on bamboo via a hydrothermal method. Then, Ag NPs with a 5.3 nm mean diameter were incorporated into the pore channels of optimal MT/bamboo (MTB) samples at room temperature without the addition of reducing agents, such that the Ag NPs were almost entirely embedded into the MT films. Our analysis indicated that the solubilized lignin from bamboo, which is rich in -containing functional groups, serves as a green reductant for reducing the Ag(NH) ions to Ag NPs. Antifungal experiments with  under dark conditions highlighted that the antifungal activity of the Ag/MT/bamboo samples were greater than those of naked bamboo, MTB, and Ag/bamboo, suggesting that these hybrid nanomaterials produce a synergistic antifungal effect that is unrelated to photoactivity. The inhibition of  effectively followed a similar trend. This newly developed bamboo protection method may provide a sustainable, eco-friendly, and efficient method for enhancing the antifungal characteristics of traditional bamboo, having the potential to prolong the service life of bamboo materials, particularly under dark conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692916>p16: cycling off the beaten path.</a></h1><p>p16 (hereafter called p16) is a faithful cellular ally in the fight against tumorigenesis.

Active DNA demethylation involves TET-mediated stepwise oxidation of mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine (fC), or 5-carboxylcytosine (caC), excision of fC or caC by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), and subsequent base excision repair. Many elements of this essential process are poorly defined, including TDG excision of caC. To address this problem, we solved high-resolution struc-tures of human TDG bound to DNA with cadC (5-carboxyl-2΄-deoxycytidine) flipped into its active site. The structures unveil detailed enzyme-substrate interactions that mediate recognition and removal of caC, many involving water molecules. Importantly, two water molecules contact a carboxylate  of caC and are poised to facilitate acid-catalyzed caC excision. Moreover, a substrate-dependent conformational change in TDG modulates the hydrogen bond interactions for one of these waters, enabling productive interaction with caC. An Asn residue (N191) that is critical for caC excision is found to contact N3 and N4 of caC, suggesting a mechanism for acid-catalyzed base excision that features an N3-protonated form of caC but would be ineffective for C, mC, or hmC. We also investigated another Asn residue (N140) that is catalytically essential and strictly conserved in the TDG-MUG enzyme family. A structure of N140A-TDG bound to cadC DNA provides the first high-resolution insight into how enzyme-substrate interactions, including water molecules, are impacted by depleting the conserved Asn, informing its role in binding and addition of the nucleophilic water molecule.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694368>Flow-encoded  control to track the time-dependence of molecular changes induced by static or cycling hypoxia.</a></h1><p>Detecting the effects of low  on cell function is often dependent on monitoring the expression of a number of hypoxia markers. The time dependence of the appearance and stability of these markers varies between cell lines. Assessing cellular marker dynamics is also critical to determining how quickly cells respond to transient changes in  levels that occurs with cycling hypoxia. We fabricated a manifold designed to use flow-encoding to produce sequential changes in gas mixtures delivered to a permeable-bottom 96-well plate. We show how this manifold and plate design can be used to expose cells to either static or cycling hypoxic conditions for eight different time periods thereby facilitating the study of the time-response of cells to altered  environments. Using this device, we monitored the time-dependence of molecular changes in human PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma and Caco-2 colon adenocarcinoma cells exposed to increasing periods of static or cycling hypoxia. Using immunohistochemistry, both cell lines show detectable levels of the marker protein hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) after 3 h of exposure to static hypoxia. Cycling hypoxia increased the expression level of HIF-1α compared to static hypoxia. Both static and cycling hypoxia also increased glucose uptake and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity.

However, the therapeutic effects of HBO and its associated mechanisms remain unknown. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) play important roles in mammalian nervous system development. The present study examined whether HBO stimulates the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and its effect on Wnt3/β-catenin and BMP2 signaling pathways. We showed HBO treatment (2 ATA, 60 min) promoted differentiation of NSCs into neurons and oligodendrocytes . In addition, rat hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) tissue extracts also promoted the differentiation of NSCs into neurons and oligodendrocytes, with the advantage of reducing the number of astrocytes. These effects were most pronounced when these two were combined together. In addition, the expression of Wnt3a, BMP2, and β-catenin nuclear proteins were increased after HBO treatment. However, blockade of Wnt/β-catenin or BMP signaling inhibited NSC differentiation and reduced the expression of Wnt3a, BMP2, and β-catenin nuclear proteins. In conclusion, HBO promotes differentiation of NSCs into neurons and oligodendrocytes and reduced the number of astrocytes  possibly through regulation of Wnt3/β-catenin and BMP2 signaling pathways. HBO may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HIE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692917>Identifying circRNA-associated-ceRNA networks in retinal neovascularization in mice.</a></h1><p>Retinal neovascularization is a complication which caused human vision loss severely. It has been shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play essential roles in gene regulation. However, circRNA expression profile and the underlying mechanisms in retinal neovascular diseases remain unclear. In the present study, we identified altered circRNAs in the retinas of -induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model by microarray profiling. Microarray analysis revealed that 539 circRNAs were significantly altered in OIR retinas compared with controls. Among them, 185 up-regulated and 354 down-regulated circRNAs were identified. The expression levels of 4 altered circRNAs including mmu_circRNA_002573, mmu_circRNA_011180, mmu_circRNA_016108 and mmu_circRNA_22546 were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analysis with validated circRNAs such as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks with Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis demonstrated that qRT-PCR validated circRNAs were associated with cellular process, cell part and phosphoric ester hydrolase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that MAPK signaling pathway and renin-angiotensin system were related to validated circRNAs, suggesting these pathways may participate in pathological angiogenesis. The results together suggested that circRNAs were aberrantly expressed in OIR retinas and may play potential roles in retinal neovascular diseases.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690331>High-flow nasal cannula  therapy versus conventional  therapy in patients after planned extubation.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697476>Synthesis of oligomeric and monomeric functionalized graphene oxides and a comparison of their abilities to perform as protein ligands and enzyme inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile, monomolecular layered nanomaterial that possess various  containing functionality on its large surface. These characteristics allow GO to interact with a variety of materials, for application to a number of areas. The strength and selectivity of these interactions can be improved significantly through further functionalization. In this paper we describe the functionalization of GO and its application as a protein ligand and an enzyme inhibitor. The work reported in this paper details how chymotrypsin inhibition can be improved using GO functionalized with a monomeric and oligomer layer of tyrosine. The results indicated that the mono and oligo functionalized systems performed extremely well, with Ki values nearly four times better than GO alone. Our original premise was that the oligomeric system would bind better, due to the length of the oligomeric arms and potential for a high degree of flexibility. However, the results clearly showed that the shorter monomeric system was the better ligand/inhibitor. This was due to weaker intramolecular interactions between the aromatic side chains of tyrosine and the aromatic surface of GO. Although these are possible for both systems, they are cooperative and therefore stronger, for the oligomeric functionalized GO. As such, the protein must compete and overcome these cooperative intramolecular interactions before it can bind to the functionalized GO. Whereas, the tyrosines on the surface of the monomeric system interact with the surface of GO through a significantly weaker mono-valent interaction, but interact cooperatively with the protein surface.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696783>Human Stem Cell-derived Aggregates of Forebrain Astroglia Respond to Amyloid Beta Oligomers.</a></h1><p>Astrocytes are vital components in neuronal circuitry and there is increasing evidence linking the dysfunction of these cells to a number of central nervous system diseases. Studying the role of these cells in human brain function in the past has been difficult due to limited access to the human brain. Here, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were differentiated into astrospheres using a hybrid plating method, with or without dual-SMAD inhibition. The derived cells were assessed for astrocytic markers, brain regional identity, phagocytosis, calcium-transient signaling, reactive  species production, and immune response. Neural degeneration was modeled via stimulation with amyloid-β (Aβ) 42 oligomers. Finally, co-culture was performed for the derived astrospheres with isogenic neurospheres. Results indicate that the derived astroglial cells express astrocyte markers with forebrain dorsal cortical identity, secrete extracellular matrix (ECM), and are capable of phagocytosing iron oxide particles and responding to Aβ42 stimulation (higher oxidative stress, higher TNF-a and IL-6 expression). RNA-sequencing results reveal the distinct transcriptome of the derived cells responding to Aβ42 stimulation for astrocyte markers, chemokines, and brain regional identity. Co-culture experiments show the synaptic activities of neurons and the enhanced neural protection ability of the astroglial cells. This study provides knowledge about the roles of brain astroglial cells, heterotypic cell-cell interactions, and the formation of engineered neuronal synapses in vitro. The implications lie in neurological disease modeling, drug screening, studying progression of neural degeneration and the role of stem cell microenvironment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690286>Clinical and morphological effects of hyperbaric  therapy in patients with interstitial cystitis associated with fibromyalgia.</a></h1><p>Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a debilitating disorder of the bladder, with a multifactorial and poorly understood origin dealing with microcirculation repeated damages. Also Fibromyalgia (FM) is a persistent disorder whose etiology is not completely explained, and its theorized alteration of pain processing can compromise the quality of life. Both these conditions have a high incidence of conventional therapeutic failure, but recent literature suggests a significant beneficial response to Hyperbaric  Therapy (HBOT). With this study, this study we evaluated the effects of HBOT on quality of life, symptoms, urodynamic parameters, and cystoscopic examination of patients suffering from both IC and FM.We structured an observational clinical trial design with repeated measures (questionnaires, urodynamic test, and cystoscopy) conducted before and 6 months after a therapeutic protocol with hyperbaric  for the treatment of patients suffering from both IC and FM. Patients were exposed to breathing 100%  at 2 atm absolute (ATA) in a multiplace pressure chamber for 90 min using an oro-nasal mask. Patients undertook a cycle of 20 sessions for 5 days per week, and a second cycle of 20 sessions after 1 week of suspension.Twelve patients completed the protocol. Changes after HBOT were not significant, except for hydrodistension tolerance (mean pre-treatment: 409.2 ml; mean post-treatment: 489.2 ml; p < 0.05). A regression of petechiae and Hunner's ulcers was also noted 6 months after the completion of HBOT.Our study showed no improvement of symptoms, quality of life, and urodynamic parameters, except for hydrodistension, and a slight improvement in cystoscopic pattern. However, to date, we could not demonstrate the significance of overall results to justify the use of HBOT alone in patients with IC and FM.

The aim of this prospective observational study was to find the incidence rate as well as possible risk factors of POCD in RARC with cerebral  monitoring.Patients who underwent RARC and open abdominal surgery in horizontal positioning were included. Preoperative and postoperative arterial blood gas (ABG), S-100β, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cognitive dysfunction scales were tested. Also, we used Z score to analyze and comprehensively evaluate POCD. Measurements of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), end-tidal CO (etCO), and cerebral  were immediately obtained after different time points during the surgery.Here, 24 and 23 patients were included in the RARC group and in the control group, respectively. The incidence of POCD didn't have significant difference in RARC group (45.8%), in contrast to the control group (26.1%). The laboratory tests of s100β and CRP between two groups didn't contain significant difference as well. As duration of Trendelenburg and pneumoperitoneum prolonged, the cerebral  saturation in the RARC group increased, which didn't cause excessive perfusion nevertheless (rSO<75%). We compared laboratory tests, age, education status, blood loss, and fluid input between POCD and non-POCD patients.

The present study sought to investigate the effect of quercetin in rats with complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis. Animals were divided into control/saline, control/quercetin (5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg) arthritis/saline, and arthritis/quercetin (5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg); the treatments were administered for 45 days. Biochemical, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity parameters were evaluated. All doses of quercetin reduced the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and reactive  species; however, only treatment with 25 or 50 mg/kg increased catalase activity. Total thiol and reduced glutathione levels were not significantly affected by the induction nor by the treatments.

The optimized strategy presented extracts with the extraction yield up to 21.19% with a significantly higher antioxidant ability, compared with the one without SS pretreatment. Further investigation proved that the SS suppressed the polyphenol oxidase activity of the TPs extract. The ability to scavenge the free radicals were compared in mouse liver mitochondria. Mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cardiolipin peroxidation, and respiratory chain complex (RCC) I-V activities were also evaluated as the index of the mitochondrial oxidative damage. The study supports evidence that the TPs extract exhibited significant protection against oxidative damage on mitochondrial. Furthermore, the effect of TPs on antioxidant ability in zebrafish embryo was evaluated. After TPs pretreatment for 1 day, zebrafish embryos showed a significantly higher survival rate as well as heart rate when facing the oxidative stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Polyphenols from tea leaves have been viewed as an antioxidant additive in food, mainly due to the ability of scavenging free radicals and reactive  species.

The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214 mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a metabolic chamber for a day, four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30-6:30), substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00), and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under the curve (AUC) for metabolic data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the overall treatment effect. The 22 h  consumption and EE were significantly higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively,  = 0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h,  = 0.054). Plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289, 276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively,  < 0.001).

Differences between sites and between seasons for water quality variables were typically an order of magnitude greater than those observed within each site (i.e. inside and outside the farm footprint). The relatively small effect of the presence of oysters on water quality is likely attributable to a combination of high background variability, relatively high flushing rates, relatively low oyster density, and small farm footprints. Minimal impacts overall suggest that low-density oyster farms located in adequately-flushed areas are unlikely to negatively impact local water quality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697088>Investigation of Protective Properties of Organic Layers Towards Reactive  Species (ROS).</a></h1><p>The antioxidant protective properties of polyaromatic organic layers were evaluated towards Reactive  Species (ROS) using Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) in a foot-printing strategy. The layers were prepared by electrografting of aryldiazonium salts. Where p-(methyl)phenyl films show only weak protective properties towards ROS, p-(ethynyl)phenyl films evidence an efficient protection of the covered surfaces. Applied potentials and electrolytes used during ORR are critical parameters to control, to prevent or reduce the influence of ROS production and hence enhancing devices lifetime.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690040>In Vitro and In Vivo Antioxidant Activity of the New Magnetic-Cerium Oxide Nanoconjugates.</a></h1><p>Cerium oxide nanoparticles present the mimetic activity of superoxide dismutase, being able to inactivate the excess of reactive  species (ROS) correlated with a large number of pathologies, such as stents restenosis and the occurrence of genetic mutations that can cause cancer. This study presents the synthesis and biological characterisation of nanoconjugates based on nanoparticles of iron oxide interconnected with cerium oxide conjugates.The synthesis of magnetite-nanoceria nanoconjugates has been done in several stages, where the key to the process is the coating of nanoparticles with polyethyleneimine and its chemical activation-reticulation with glutaraldehyde. The nanoconjugates are characterised by several techniques, and the antioxidant activity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.Iron oxide nanoparticles interconnected with cerium oxide nanoparticles were obtained, having an average diameter of 8 nm. Nanoconjugates prove to possess superparamagnetic properties and the saturation magnetisation varies with the addition of diamagnetic components in the system, remaining within the limits of biomedical applications. In vitro free-radical scavenging properties of nanoceria are improved after the coating of nanoparticles with polyethylenimine and conjugation with magnetite nanoparticles. In vivo studies reveal increased antioxidant activity in all organs and fluids collected from mice, which demonstrates the ability of the nanoconjugates to reduce oxidative stress.Nanoconjugates possess magnetic properties, being able to scavenge free radicals, reducing the oxidative stress. The combination of the two properties mentioned above makes them excellent candidates for theranostic applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691404>Egg storage and breeder age impact on egg quality and embryo development.</a></h1><p>Prolonged hatching egg storage (>7 days) influences internal egg quality and embryo survival during both storage and subsequent incubation. Moreover, effects of storage of hatching eggs interact with the breeder age. The aim of this review was to investigate how this interaction between storage duration and breeder age affects egg, embryo, hatchling and chicken characteristics. Prolonged storage resulted in a reduction in egg quality in both young and old breeders. This reduction was more pronounced in young flocks than in older flocks. For example, albumen pH increased more after 8 days of storage in younger flocks than in older flocks. Additionally, the embryonic morphological stage appears to increase as well with storage duration, but this increase is again more pronounced in younger flocks than in older flocks. Short storage (<7 days) seems to increase hatchability of eggs from young breeders, probably as a result of albumen liquefaction with consequently better  availability for the embryo. However, long storage (>7 days) resulted in a decline in hatchability, which was stronger in older breeders than in younger breeders. Prolonged storage duration resulted in lower chicken quality in both young and old breeders, but interaction between storage duration and breeder age on multiple chicken quality parameters is not clear. Based on this review, it can be concluded that (a) Short storage can improve hatchability of eggs from young breeders, but not from older breeders. (b) Negative impact of long storage appears to be lower with young breeders than with old breeders.(c) Adapted storage conditions related to the age of breeders might be an option to reduce negative effects of prolonged storage on hatching egg quality and chicken quality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695110>Production of reactive species in alginate hydrogels for cold atmospheric plasma-based therapies.</a></h1><p>In the last years, great advances have been made in therapies based in cold atmospheric plasmas (CAP). CAP generate reactive  and nitrogen species (RONS) which can be transferred to liquids. These CAP activated liquids display the same biological efficacy (i.e. on killing cancer cells) as CAP themselves, opening the door for minimally invasive therapies. However, injection of a liquid in the body results in fast diffusion due to extracellular fluids and blood flow. Therefore, the development of efficient vehicles which allow local confinement and delivery of RONS to the diseased site is a fundamental requirement. In this work, we investigate the generation of RONS (HO, NO, short-lived RONS) in alginate hydrogels by comparing two atmospheric pressure plasma jets: kINPen and a helium needle, at a range of plasma treatment conditions (time, gas flow, distance to the sample). The physic-chemical properties of the hydrogels remain unchanged by the plasma treatment, while the hydrogel shows several-fold larger capacity for generation of RONS than a typical isotonic saline solution. Part of the RONS are quickly released to a receptor media, so special attention has to be put on the design of hydrogels with in-situ crosslinking. Remarkably, the hydrogels show capacity for sustained release of the RONS. The plasma-treated hydrogels remain fully biocompatible (due the fact that the species generated by plasma are previously washed away), indicating that no cytotoxic modifications have occurred on the polymer. Moreover, the RONS generated in alginate solutions showed cytotoxic potential towards bone cancer cells. These results open the door for the use of hydrogel-based biomaterials in CAP-associated therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692327>Quinary Defect-rich Ultrathin Bimetal Hydroxide Nanosheets for Water Oxidation.</a></h1><p>Electronic structure of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can be modulated by heteroatom-doping and creating vacancies. The number of exposed active sites can be enriched by exfoliating bulk structure into fewer layers. Herein, we successfully achieved multielement-doping and exfoliation for Co3Fe LDHs by one SF6-plasma etching step at room temperature (named as Co3Fe LDHs-SF6). The obtained Co3Fe LDHs-SF6 ultrathin nanosheets display outstanding  evolution reaction (OER) activity, which only needs 268 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm-2. Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance are dramatically decreased indicating faster reaction kinetic rate. The excellent OER activity can be attributed to increased number of active sites and optimized electronic structure modulated by the incorporation of electron-withdrawing F, electron-donating S and abundant vacancies resulting in proper adsorption energy to  species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698018>Isorhamnetin exerts neuroprotective effects in STZ-induced diabetic rats via attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.</a></h1><p>Isorhamnetin, a derivative of quercetin, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in different diseases, and we examined its protective effects against diabetes-related changes in the brain.A single dose of a freshly prepared solution of streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally injected to establish STZ-induced diabetic model in male Wistar rats. The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control, control + isorhamnetin, diabetic, diabetic + isorhamnetin. Isorhamnetin at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight was intraperitoneally administrated once a day for 12 weeks. Formalin and tail immersion tests were performed to evaluate the severity of pain. Astrogliosis markers such as GFAP and APO-E4, DNA fragments, MDA level, and TNFα expressions were evaluated using ELISA assay. Neuronal density in the hippocampus region was evaluated using Nissl staining. The method of Ellman and fluorescent probe 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to measure brain acetyl-cholinesterase activity and detect reactive nitrogen and  species (RNS and ROS), respectively.Isorhamnetin reduced pain, blood glucose levels, and increased body weight significantly compared to control. Moreover, isorhamnetin inhibited astroglial activation, acetyl-cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation.These findings suggested that isorhamnetin has potential effects as neuroprotective agents against diabetes-related changes in the brain.Copyright © 2019.

Nitrogen containing functional groups of biochar have a wide range of applications, such as adsorption of pollutants, catalysis, and energy storage. To date, many methods have been developed and used to strengthen the function of N-containing biochar to promote its application and commercialization. However, there is no review available specifically on the development of biochar technologies concerning nitrogen-containing functional groups. This paper aims to present a review on fractionation, analysis, formation, engineering, and application of N-functional groups of biochar. The effect of influencing factors on biochar N-functional groups, including biomass feedstock, pyrolysis parameters (e.g., temperature), and additional treatment (e.g., N-doping) were discussed in detail to reveal the formation mechanisms and performance of the N-functional groups. Future prospective investigation directions on the analysis and engineering of biochar N-functional groups were also proposed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in PCD during lace plant leaf development is currently unknown. Hsp70 amounts were measured throughout lace plant leaf development, and the results indicate that it is highest before and during PCD. Increased Hsp70 amounts correlate with raised anthocyanin content and caspase-like protease (CLP) activity. To investigate the effects of Hsp70 on leaf development, whole plants were treated with either of the known regulators of PCD [reactive  species (ROS) or antioxidants] or an Hsp70 inhibitor, chlorophenylethynylsulfonamide (PES-Cl). ROS treatment significantly increased Hsp70 2-fold and CLP activity in early developing leaves, but no change in anthocyanin and the number of perforations formed was observed. Antioxidant treatment significantly decreased Hsp70, anthocyanin, and CLP activity in early leaves, resulting in the fewest perforations. PES-Cl (25 μM) treatment significantly increased Hsp70 4-fold in early leaves, while anthocyanin, superoxide, and CLP activity significantly declined, leading to fewer perforations. Results show that significantly increased (4-fold) or decreased Hsp70 amounts lead to lower anthocyanin and CLP activity, inhibiting PCD induction. Our data support the hypothesis that Hsp70 plays a role in regulating PCD at a threshold in lace plant leaf development. Hsp70 affects anthocyanin content and caspase-like protease activity, and helps regulate PCD during the remodelling of leaves of lace plant, Aponogeton madagascariensis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Considering the imitations in the reconstructive surgeries in restoring tissue loss and deficiency, stem cell-based therapy, in particular, has been expected to pave the way for a new solution to the regenerative approaches. Limitations in the reconstructive surgeries in restoring tissue loss and deficiency have paved the way for new regenerative approaches. Among them, adipose-derived stem/progenitor cells (ADSCs)-based therapy could be the most promising clue, since ADSCs have pluripotent differentiation capabilities not only in adipocytes but also in a variety of cell types. Accumulating evidences have indicated that the unfavorable development of adipose-tissue damage, namely, lipodystrophy, is a systemic complication, which is closely related to metabolic abnormality. Considering ADSC-based regenerative medicine should be applied for the treatment of lipodystrophy, it is inevitable to ascertain whether the ADSCs obtained from the patients with lipodystrophy are capable of being used. It will be very promising and realistic if this concept is applied to lipoatrophy; one form of lipodystrophies that deteriorates the patients' quality of life because of excessive loss of soft tissue in the exposed areas such as face and extremities. Since lipodystrophy is frequently observed in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the present study aims to examine the biological potentials of ADSCs isolated from the HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy associated with the HAART treatment. Growth properties, adipogenic differentiation, and mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production were examined in ADSCs from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Our results clearly demonstrated that ADSCs from both patients showed indistinguishable growth properties and potentials for adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Thus, although the number of cases were limited, ADSCs isolated from the patients with lipodystrophy retain sufficient physiological and biological activity for the reconstitution of adipose-tissue, suggesting that ADSCs from the patients with lipodystrophy could be used for autologous ADSC-based regenerative therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694192>The Role of Inflammasome-Dependent and Inflammasome-Independent NLRP3 in the Kidney.</a></h1><p>Cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) forms an inflammasome with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and pro-caspase-1, which is followed by the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1 and ultimately the activation of IL-1β and IL-18 and induction of pyroptosis in immune cells. NLRP3 activation in kidney diseases aggravates inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, and this effect is abrogated by genetic or pharmacologic deletion of NLRP3. Inflammasome-dependent NLRP3 mediates the progression of kidney diseases by escalating the inflammatory response in immune cells and the cross-talk between immune cells and renal nonimmune cells. However, recent studies have suggested that NLRP3 has several inflammasome-independent functions in the kidney. Inflammasome-independent NLRP3 regulates apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells by interacting with mitochondria and mediating mitochondrial reactive  species production and mitophagy. This review will summarize the mechanisms by which NLRP3 functions in the kidney in both inflammasome-dependent and inflammasome-independent ways and the role of NLRP3 and NLRP3 inhibitors in kidney diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692285>Nanocarriers in photodynamic therapy-in vitro and in vivo studies.</a></h1><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive technique which has proven to be successful in the treatment of several types of tumors. This relatively simple method exploits three inseparable elements: phototoxic compound (photosensitizer [PS]), light source, and . Upon irradiation by light with specified wavelength, PS generates reactive  species, which starts the cascade of reactions leading to cell death. The positive therapeutic outcome of PDT may be limited due to several aspects, including low water solubility of PSs, hampering their effective administration and blood circulation, as well as low tumor specificity, inefficient cellular uptake and activation energies requiring prolonged illumination times. One of the promising approaches to overcome these obstacles involves the use of carrier systems modulating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the PSs. In the present review, we summarized current in vitro and in vivo studies regarding the use of nanoparticles as potential delivery devices for PSs to enhance their cellular uptake and cytotoxic properties, and thus-the therapeutic outcome of PDT.

Yet comprehensive reviews on the medical geology of SUGEs are still lacking. The current paper posits that TGCs occur widely in SUGEs, and pose human health risks. The objectives of the review are to: (1) highlight the nature, occurrence and behaviour of TGCs associated with SUGEs; (2) discuss the human intake pathways and health risks of TGCs; (4) identify the key risk factors predisposing human health to TGCs particularly in Africa; and (5) highlight key knowledge gaps and future research directions. TGCs of human health concern in SUGEs include chrysotile asbestos, toxic metals (Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn, Zn, Co), and rare earth elements. Human intake of TGCs occur via inhalation, and ingestion of contaminated drinking water, wild foods, medicinal plants, animal foods, and geophagic earths. Occupational exposure may occur in the mining, milling, sculpturing, engraving, and carving industries. African populations are particularly at high risk due to: (1) widespread consumption of wild foods, medicinal plants, untreated drinking water, and geophagic earths; (2) weak and poorly enforced environmental, occupational, and public health regulations; and (3) lack of human health surveillance systems. Human health risks of chrysotile include asbestosis, cancers, and mesothelioma. Toxic metals are redox active, thus generate reactive  species causing oxidative stress. Dietary intake of iron and geophagy may increase the iron overload among native Africans who are genetically predisposed to such health risks. Synergistic interactions among TGCs particularly chrysotile and toxic metals may have adverse human health effects. The occurrence of SUGEs, coupled with the several risk factors in Africa, provides a unique and ideal setting for investigating the relationships between TGCs and human health risks. A conceptual framework for human health risk assessment and mitigation, and future research direction are highlighted.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Substituting noble metal-based electrocatalysts by decidedly effective and low-cost  metal-based  electrocatalysts is imperative for the commercial application of these technologies. Herein, we present a novel strategy to fabricate selenized and phosphorized porous cobalt-nickel oxide microcubes through sacrificial ZnO sphere template and employed it as OER electrocatalyst. The selenized samples manifest desirable and robust OER performance, with comparable overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 (312 mV) as RuO2 (308 mV) and better activity when the current reaches 13.7 mA cm -2 . The phosphorized samples exhibit core-shell structure with low-crystalline oxides inside amorphous phosphides, which ensures superior activity towards RuO2 with the same overpotential (at 10 mA cm -2 ) yet lower Tafel slope.

Ischemia and reperfusion damage the organs, due to the lack of  during the ischemia step, as well as the oxidative stress during the reperfusion step. Different methodologies are developed to prevent or to diminish the level of injuries. Preservation solutions were first developed to maximize cold static preservation, which includes the addition of several chemical compounds. The next chapter of organ preservation comes with the perfusion machine, where mechanical devices provide continuous flow and oxygenation ex vivo to the organs being preserved. In the addition of inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibitors of the proteasome, mesenchymal stem cells began being used 13 years ago to prevent or diminish the organ's injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells (e.g., bone marrow stem cells, adipose derived stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells) have proven to be powerful tools in repairing damaged organs.

The neutrophil-derived enzyme myeloperoxidase generates reactive  species which can react with host tissue resulting in cell damage and dysfunction. Thus, elevated myeloperoxidase may be associated with adverse patient outcomes.Circulating myeloperoxidase concentrations were assessed in a cohort of 44 critically ill patients, 55% of whom were diagnosed with septic shock, and 44 healthy controls. Intensive care mortality prediction scores (SOFA, SAPS, APACHE) and ICU and hospital mortality were obtained from the patients' clinical notes. Hematological and biochemical assessments included blood cell counts, lactate, alanine transaminase, creatinine, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, and PaO. Myeloperoxidase was assessed using a commercial ELISA kit and cell free DNA was detected using SytoxGreen™ fluorescence staining.Myeloperoxidase concentrations were significantly higher in critically ill patients than control samples (234 ± 30 ng/ml versus 15 ± 4 ng/ml, p < 0.001), and were elevated in septic shock relative to non-septic patients (302 ± 42 ng/ml versus 156 ± 38 ng/ml, p = 0.02), despite neutrophil counts being comparable between the two subgroups (p = 0.6). Myeloperoxidase correlated with SOFA scores in the critically ill patients (r = 0.395, p = 0.02), and with markers of tissue dysfunction and injury such as lactate (r = 0.572, p < 0.001), log alanine transferase (r = 0.392, p = 0.016) and log cell free DNA (r = 0.371, p = 0.03). The subgroup of patients with higher than mean APACHE III scores (i.e. >78, n = 16) exhibited significantly elevated myeloperoxidase concentrations in the non-survivors compared with survivors (416 ± 59 ng/mL versus 140 ± 33 ng/mL, p = 0.001). Hospital mortality for the whole cohort was 27%; mortality in the high APACHE III subgroup was 38%, and when combined with higher than mean myeloperoxidase (i.e. >234 ng/mL), mortality increased to 71%.Myeloperoxidase is associated with markers of tissue injury and systemic organ failure, particularly in septic patients. The enzyme is also associated with mortality in patients with higher APACHE III scores, thus potentially comprising an additional diagnostic marker to improve mortality prediction.Copyright © 2019.

Autophagy is a cellular self-digestion process that can selectively remove damaged organelles under oxidative stress, and thus presents a potential therapeutic target against osteoporosis. Monotropein is an iridoid glycoside which can increase osteoblastic bone formation and be applied for medicinal purpose in China. The aim of this work is to investigate whether autophagy participates the protection effects of monotropein in osteoblasts under oxidative stress and the possible mechanism of such involvement. Here, monotropein was capable of inhibiting the HO-induced reactive  species generation in osteoblasts. Monotropein induced autophagy and protected osteoblasts from cytotoxic effects of HO, as assessed by viability assays, apoptosis and western blotting. Moreover, it significantly attenuated HO-evoked oxidative stress as measured by malondialdehyde, catalase, and superoxide dismutase levels. Importantly, monotropein reduced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its two downstream proteins (p70S6K and 4EBP1). The autophagy level increased in osteoblasts treated with monotropein as represented by an increased in both Beclin1 expression and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. However, the Akt activator (SC79) and mTOR activator (MHY1485) suppressed the autophagy level induced by monotropein in HO-treated cells. Consequently, the antioxidant effects of monotropein were mediated, at least in part, by enhancing autophagy through the Akt/mTOR pathway. These results suggested that monotropein might be a promising candidate for osteoporosis treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Low-temperature (LT) stress constricts the geographic distribution, growth, and development of wucai (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis var. rosularis Tsen). However, there is little information on the global gene expression of BRs under LT stress in wucai. In this study, the molecular roles of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) after exogenously application, were explored by RNA sequencing under LT conditions.According to the Gene Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, photosynthesis was significantly enriched after spraying EBR under LT. The transcripts encoding the photosystem II (PSII) -evolving enhancer protein, photosystem I (PSI) subunit, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes I and II, and ferredoxin were up-regulated after the application of EBR. Transcripts encoding several key enzymes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were also up-regulated, accompanied by significant differences in the contents of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-proto IX), protochlorophyllide (Pchl), and photosynthetic pigments. Notably, transcriptional and physiological analyses revealed that under LT stress, plant responses to EBR involved a major reorientation of photosynthesis, as well as porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.This study explored the role of EBR as an LT stress tolerance mechanism in wucai. At the transcription level, LT tolerance manifests as an enhancement of photosynthesis, and the amelioration of porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691463>Pre-treatments enhance the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells in liver diseases.</a></h1><p>Liver diseases caused by viral infection, alcohol abuse and metabolic disorders can progress to end-stage liver failure, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, which are a growing cause of death worldwide. Although liver transplantation and hepatocyte transplantation are useful strategies to promote liver regeneration, they are limited by scarce sources of organs and hepatocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) restore liver injury after hepatogenic differentiation and exert immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, antioxidative stress and antiapoptotic effects on liver cells in vivo. After isolation and culture in vitro, MSCs are faced with nutrient and  deprivation, and external growth factors maintain MSC capacities for further applications. In addition, MSCs are placed in a harsh microenvironment, and anoikis and inflammation after transplantation in vivo significantly decrease their regenerative capacity. Pre-treatment with chemical agents, hypoxia, an inflammatory microenvironment and gene modification can protect MSCs against injury, and pre-treated MSCs show improved hepatogenic differentiation, homing capacity, survival and paracrine effects in vitro and in vivo in regard to attenuating liver injury. In this review, we mainly focus on pre-treatments and the underlying mechanisms for improving the therapeutic effects of MSCs in various liver diseases. Thus, we provide evidence for the development of MSC-based cell therapy to prevent acute or chronic liver injury. Mesenchymal stem cells have potential as a therapeutic to prolong the survival of patients with end-stage liver diseases in the near future.© 2019 The Authors.

Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control, HFD (high fat diet), OX (0.75% ethylene glycol), and HFD + OX (combined model) Changes in basal O levels were evaluated by chemiluminescence in renal interlobar arteries and renal cortex. Furthermore, the effect of different inhibitors on NADPH-stimulated O generation was assessed in renal cortex. Oxidative stress sources, and local inflammatory mediators, were also determined, in parallel, by RT-PCR, and correlated with measures of renal function, urinary biochemistry, and renal structure. Rats from the HFD group developed overweight without lipid profile alteration. Tubular deposits of crystals were seen in OX and severely enhanced in HFD + OX groups along with a significantly higher impairment of renal function. Basal oxidative stress was increased in renal cortex of OX rats and in renal arteries of HFD rats, while animals from the combined HFD + OX group exhibited the highest levels of oxidative stress in renal cortex, derived from xanthine oxidase and COX-2. NADPH oxidase-dependent O generation was elevated in renal cortex of the OX group and markedly enhanced in the HFD + OX rats, and associated to an up-regulation of Nox1 and a down-regulation of Nox4 expression. High levels of oxidative stress in the kidney, of OX and HFD + OX groups were also associated to an inflammatory response mediated by an elevation of TNFα, COX-2, NFκB1 MCP-1, and OPN. Oxidative stress is a key pathogenic factor in renal disease associated to hyperoxaluria and a common link underlying the exacerbated inflammatory response and kidney injury found under conditions of both obesity and hyperoxaluria.

The classification accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and positive predictive value) of ≥100 steps/min to predict ≥3 METs was calculated.A cadence threshold of ≥100 steps/min yielded an overall accuracy (combined sensitivity and specificity) of 73.3% for predicting minimally moderate intensity. Moreover, for individuals walking at a cadence ≥100 steps/min, the probability (positive predictive value) of achieving minimally moderate intensity was 80.3%.Although primarily developed using treadmill-based protocols, a cadence threshold of ≥100 steps/min for young adults appears to be a valid heuristic value (evidence-based, rounded, practical) associated with minimally moderate intensity during overground walking performed at a self-selected preferred pace.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695405>GPX2 suppression of HO stress regulates cervical cancer metastasis and apoptosis via activation of the β-catenin-WNT pathway.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence suggests that glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2) plays important roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of various human cancers, such as colorectal carcinomas and lung adenocarcinomas. However, the role of GPX2 in cervical cancer is unclear. In this study, we identified the role of GPX2 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines.The basal mRNA and protein expression of GPX2 in cervical cancer cells and a series of key molecules in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and WNT/β-catenin pathways were examined via real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays. The biological phenotype of the cervical cancer cell lines was detected by the cloning formation and transwell assays, and intracellular reactive  species (ROS) levels were detected by flow cytometry. Finally, the GPX2 expression level in 100 clinical cervical tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry.We found that GPX2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal individuals and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of cervical cancer cells, and this promotion correlated with the activation of EMT and WNT/β-catenin signaling in vitro. GPX2 was determined to reduce apoptotic damage by reducing hydroperoxides. According to the characteristics and verification of GPX2, this series of phenotypes is clearly related to oxidative stress in cells. Furthermore, we verified that GPX2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues and promoted the metastasis of cervical cancer.In summary, we found that GPX2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer cells and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of cervical cancer by affecting oxidative stress. Our study provides a new target for the clinical treatment of cervical cancer.© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690227>Super-activator variants of the cyanobacterial transcriptional regulator ChlR essential for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis under low  conditions.</a></h1><p>ChlR is a MarR-type transcriptional regulator that activates the transcription of the  operon in response to low  conditions in the cyanobacterium  sp. PCC 6803. Upon exposure to low  conditions, ChlR activates transcription of the operon that encodes enzymes critical to tetrapyrrole biosynthesis under low  conditions. We previously identified a super-activator variant, D35H, of ChlR that constitutively activates transcription of the operon. To gain insight into the low- induced activation of ChlR, we obtained eight additional super-activator variants of ChlR including D35H from pseudorevertants of a -disrupted mutant. Most substitutions were located in the N-terminal region of ChlR. Mapping of the substituted amino acid residues provided valuable structural insights that uncovered the activation mechanism of ChlR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691930>Genetic Approaches for Sports Performance: How Far Away Are We?</a></h1><p>Humans vary in their 'natural ability' related to sports performance. One facet of natural ability reflects so-called intrinsic ability or the ability to do well with minimal training. A second facet of natural ability is how rapidly an individual adapts to training; this is termed trainability. A third facet is the upper limit achievable after years of prolonged intense training; this represents both intrinsic ability and also trainability. There are other features of natural ability to consider, for example body size, because some events, sports, or positions favor participants of different sizes. In this context, the physiological determinants of elite endurance performance, especially running and cycling, are well known and can be used as a template to discuss these general issues. The key determinants of endurance performance include maximal  uptake [Formula: see text], the lactate threshold, and running economy (efficiency in the case of cycling or other sports). In this article, I use these physiological determinants to explore what is known about the genetics of endurance performance. My main conclusion is that at this time there are very few, if any, obvious relationships between these key physiological determinants of performance and DNA sequence variation. Several potential reasons for this lack of relationship will be discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695559>Ginsenoside Rb1 ameliorates cisplatin-induced learning and memory impairments.</a></h1><p>Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1), a dominant component from the extract of  root, exhibits neuroprotective functions in many neurological diseases. This study was intended to investigate whether Rb1 can attenuate cisplatin-induced memory impairments and explore the potential mechanisms.Cisplatin was injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 5 mg/kg/wk, and Rb1 was administered in drinking water at the dose of 2 mg/kg/d to rats for 5 consecutive wk. The novel objects recognition task and Morris water maze were used to detect the memory of rats. Nissl staining was used to examine the neuron numbers in the hippocampus. The activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, cholineacetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, and the levels of malondialdehyde, reactive  species, acetylcholine, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-10 were measured by ELISA to assay the oxidative stress, cholinergic function, and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.Rb1 administration effectively ameliorates the memory impairments caused by cisplatin in both novel objects recognition task and Morris water maze task. Rb1 also attenuates the neuronal loss induced by cisplatin in the different regions (CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus) of the hippocampus. Meanwhile, Rb1 is able to rescue the cholinergic neuron function, inhibit the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in cisplatin-induced rat brain.Rb1 rescues the cisplatin-induced memory impairment via restoring the neuronal loss by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and recovering the cholinergic neuron functions.© 2017 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693882>Mitochondrial Perturbations Couple mTORC2 to Autophagy in C. elegans.</a></h1><p>Autophagy is stimulated by stress conditions and needs to be precisely tuned to ensure cellular homeostasis and organismal development and health. The kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) forms the enzymatic core of the highly conserved mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is a key inhibitor of autophagy, yet the function of mTORC2 in autophagy is controversial. We here show that inactivation of mTORC2 and its direct target serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK-1) potently induces autophagy and the autophagic degradation of mitochondria in C. elegans. Enhanced autophagy in mTORC2- or SGK-1-deficient animals contributes to their developmental and reproductive defects and is independent of the canonical SGK-1 effector DAF-16/FOXO. Importantly, we find that inactivation of mTORC2-SGK-1 signaling impairs mitochondrial homeostasis and triggers an increased release of mitochondria-derived reactive  species (mtROS) to induce autophagy. Thus, mitochondrial stress couples reduced mTORC2 activity to enhanced autophagic turnover.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Based on recent studies demonstrating that mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and immune responses are correlated, the current study sought to determine whether MCT oil controls inflammatory responses through modulation of mitochondria using both in vitro and in vivo models. The mitochondrial metabolic phenotypes of macrophages were assessed according to  consumption rate (OCR). Inflammatory responses were assessed for production of cytokines and expression of activation markers. MCT oil was more rapidly oxidized as observed by increased OCR in macrophages. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was down-regulated and anti-inflammatory cytokine was elevated by MCT oil. In addition, classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 markers were reciprocally regulated by MCT intervention. Overall, up-regulated β-oxidation by MCT contributes to the anti-inflammatory M2-like status of macrophages, which may aid in the dietary prevention and/or amelioration of inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698040>Circ_016719 plays a critical role in neuron cell apoptosis induced by I/R via targeting miR-29c/Map2k6.</a></h1><p>Stroke is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Rac-MAPK kinase 6 (Map2k6) plays important roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role played by Map2k6 in stroke injury and the underlying mechanism of action remain unknown.Mice received cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. HT22 cells were subjected to  glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate an I/R injury. Subsequently, the levels of circ_016719, miR-29c and Map2k6 expression were determined, and their interactions were examined by luciferase assays. Circ_016719 knockdown, miR-29c inhibition or Map2k6 overexpression was induced in HT22 cells; after which, the cells were examined for their viability, apoptosis, autophagy and proliferation, as well their levels of Map2k6, p38, p53, LC3B-I, LC3B-II, Beclin 1, and p62 expression.Significantly increased levels of circ_016719 and Map2k6, and decreased levels of miR-29c were observed in both in vivo and in vitro I/R injury models. In HT22 cells, circ_016719 knockdown significantly increased miR-29c expression and cell proliferation, but decreased Map2k6 expression and cell apoptosis. Additionally, significant increases in LC3B-I and p62 levels and decreased LC3B-II levels were observed, indicating that circ_016719 knockdown had significantly inhibited autophagy. Furthermore, additional inhibition of miR-29c markedly suppressed the effects of circ_016719 knockdown; however, that suppression was significantly attenuated by Map2k6 overexpression. Additionally, Map2k6 was identified as a direct target of miR-29c, which in turn, might be sponged by circ_016719.Our results suggest that circ_016719 directly targets miR-29c, and thereby regulates the expression and functions of Map2k6, which significantly contributes to the pro-apoptotic role of circ_016719.Copyright © 2019.

A large number of STEMI patients after the infarction gradually develop heart failure due to the infarcted myocardium. Timely reperfusion is essential to salvage ischemic myocardium from the infarction, but the restoration of coronary blood flow in the infarct-related artery itself induces myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte death, known as ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). The factors contributing to IRI in STEMI are complex, and microvascular obstruction, inflammation, release of reactive  species, myocardial stunning, and activation of myocardial cell death are involved. Therefore, additional cardioprotection is required to prevent the heart from IRI. Although many mechanical conditioning procedures and pharmacological agents have been identified as effective cardioprotective approaches in animal studies, their translation into the clinical practice has been relatively disappointing due to a variety of reasons. With new emerging data on cardioprotection in STEMI over the past few years, it is mandatory to reevaluate the effectiveness of "old" cardioprotective interventions and highlight the novel therapeutic targets and new treatment strategies of cardioprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692343>Si-H Bond Activation with Bullock's Cationic Tungsten(II) Catalyst: CO as Cooperating Ligand.</a></h1><p>An in-depth investigation of the reaction of tertiary hydrosilanes with [CpW(CO)2(IMes)]+[B(C6F5)4]- reveals a fundamentally new Si-H bond activation mode. Unlike the originally proposed oxidative addition of the Si-H bond to the tungsten(II) center, there is strong experimental and NMR spectroscopic evidence for the involvement of one of the CO ligands of the cationic complex in the Si-H bond breaking event. The Si-H bond is heterolytically cleaved to form a tungsten(II) hydride and a silylium ion, which is stabilized by one of the CO ligands. This reactive hydrosilane adduct was eventually isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Quantum-chemical calculations support a cooperative mechanism but a stepwise process consisting of oxidative addition and subsequent tungsten-to- silyl migration in the tungsten(IV) silyl hydride is also energetically feasible. However, our combined spectroscopic and computational analysis favors the cooperative pathway.

However, the role of ferroptosis,a newly discovered form of oxidative cell death, has not been evaluated widely.Panx1, an ATP-releasing pathway family, has anti-inflammatory effects during kidneyinjury. Here, we demonstrated that panx1 deletion protected against renal IRI byregulating ferroptotic cell death. In panx1 knockout mice subjected to renal IRI,decreased plasma creatinine, MDA contents in kidney tissue, and tubular cell death(decreased TUNEL positive renal tubular cells) were found compared to those inpanx1 wild type (wt) mice. In cultured human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells, erastin inducedferroptotic lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation were significantly attenuated bysilencing panx1 expression. Moreover, panx1 silencing significantly modulatedferroptosis related protein expression. Furthermore, Panx1 deletion induced theexpression of a cytoprotective chaperone, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), andmodulated the MAPK/ERK pathway. In this study, we first discovered that panx1deletion protects against renal IRI by attenuating MAPK/ERK activation and inducingHO-1 expression in a ferroptotic way. Our findings provide new insights tounderstand the mechanism of panx1 in ferroptotic cell death and highlight a newtherapeutic target for acute kidney injury(AKI) treatment during the perioperativeperiod.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691474>Ultra-small 2D CoxZn2-x(benzimidazole)4 MOF nanosheets and their derived Co nanodots@Co-N-codoped graphene for efficient  reduction reaction.</a></h1><p>The development of non-precious metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) with efficient metal utilization and abundant active sites toward the  reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, ultra-small 2D CoxZn2-xBIM4 bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (~2 nm thick) are synthesized by a novel bottom-up strategy, which are then thermally converted to a core-shell structure of sub-5 nm Co nanodots (NDs) wrapped by 2 to 5 layers of Co-N-codoped graphene (Co@FLG). The size of the Co NDs in the Co@FLG could be precisely controlled by the Co:Zn ratio in the CoxZn2-xBIM4 nanosheet. The optimized Co@FLG, as an ORR electrocatalyst, exhibits an excellent half-wave potential of 0.841 V vs. RHE, a high limiting current density of 6.42 mA cm-2, and great stability in alkaline electrolyte. The Co@FLG also possesses great ORR performance in neutral electrolyte as well as in Mg-air batteries. The experimental studies and DFT calculations reveal that the high performance of the Co@FLG is mainly attributed to its great O2 absorptivity endowed by the abundant Co-Nx and pyridinic-N in the FLG shell and the strong electron-donating ability from the Co ND core to the FLG shell to elevate the eg-orbital energy of Co(II) and lower the activation energy for breaking the O=O/O-O bonds.

However, treatment resistance emerges inevitably. Here, we performed global metabolite screening with metabolite set enrichment coupled with transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis and proteomic screening, and identified substantial reprogramming of tumor metabolism involving oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with substantial accumulation of acyl-carnitines accompanied by an increase of PGC1α in response to genetic (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) and pharmacological (crizotinib) inhibition of c-MET. Extracellular flux and carbon tracing analyses (U-13C-Glucose, U-13C-Glutamine and U-13C-palmitic acid) demonstrated enhanced oxidative metabolism, which was driven by FAO and supported by increased anaplerosis of glucose carbons. These findings were observed in concert with increased number and fusion of mitochondria and production of reactive  species (ROS). Genetic interference with PGC1α rescued this oxidative phenotype driven by c-MET inhibition. Silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CREB regulates the expression of PGC1α in the context of c-MET inhibition. Interference with both oxidative phosphorylation (metformin, oligomycin) and beta-oxidation of fatty acids (etomoxir) enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of c-MET inhibition. Synergistic cell death was observed with c-MET inhibition and gamitrinib treatment. In patient-derived xenograft models, combination treatments of crizotinib and etomoxir, and crizotinib and gamitrinib were significantly more efficacious than single treatments and did not induce toxicity. Collectively, we have unraveled the mechanistic underpinnings of c-MET inhibition and identified novel combination therapies that may enhance its therapeutic efficacy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691896>The impact of calcium peroxide on groundwater bacterial diversity during naphthalene removal by permeable reactive barrier (PRB).</a></h1><p>-releasing compounds (ORCs) have recently gained much attention in contaminated groundwater remediation. We investigated the impact of calcium peroxide nanoparticles on the groundwater indigenous bacteria in a bioremediation process by permeable reactive barrier (PRB). Three sand-packed columns were applied, including (1) control column (fresh groundwater), (2) natural remediation column (contaminated groundwater), and (3) biostimulation column (contaminated groundwater amended with CaO). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria constituted the main phyla among the identified isolates. According to the results of next-generation sequencing, Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum (81% relative abundance) in the natural remediation condition. But, it was declined to 38.1% in the biostimulation column. Meanwhile, the abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were increased to 25.9% and 15.4%, respectively, by exposing the groundwater microbial structure to CaO nanoparticles. Furthermore, orders Chlamydiales, Nitrospirales, and Oceanospirillales existing in the control column were detected in the presence of naphthalene. Shannon index was 4.32 for the control column samples, while it was reduced to 2.73 and 2.00 in the natural and biostimulation columns, respectively.

It is a medical emergency that requires immediate recognition and treatment. Albuterol in combination with ipratropium bromide in the emergency department (ED) has been shown to decrease the time spent in the ED and the hospitalization rates. The benefits of ipratropium are not sustained after admission to the hospital. Oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be administered to all patients with acute severe asthma as early as possible because clinical benefits may not occur for a minimum of 6 to 12 hours. Viral respiratory infections are a common trigger for acute asthma; other causes include medical nonadherence, allergen exposure (especially pets and mold [e.g., Alternaria species]) in individuals who are severely atopic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory exposure in patients with aspirin allergy, irritant inhalation (e.g., smoke, paint), exercise, and insufficient use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids. The patient's history should focus on the acute assessment of asthma control and morbidity, including current use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids; the number of hospitalizations, ED visits, intensive care unit admissions, and intubations; the frequency of albuterol use; the presence of nighttime symptoms; activity intolerance; current medications; exposure to allergens; and other significant medical conditions. Severe airflow obstruction may be predicted by accessory muscle use, difficulty speaking, refusal to recline < 30°, a pulse of >120 beats/min, and decreased breath sounds. More objective measures of airway obstruction  peak flow or forced expiratory volume in 1 second and pulse oximetry before  administration usually are helpful.

According to Traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng is the most widely used "Qi-invigorating" herbs, which provides tonic and preventive effects by resisting oxidative stress, influencing energy metabolism, and improving mitochondrial function. Very few reports have systematically measured cell mitochondrial bioenergetics after ginseng treatment.Here, H9C2 cell line, a rat cardiomyoblast, was treated with ginseng extracts having extracted using solvents of different polarity, i.e., water, 50% ethanol, and 90% ethanol, and subsequently, the  consumption rate in healthy and -butyl hydroperoxide-treated live cultures was determined by Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.The 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng possessed the strongest antioxidative and tonic activities to mitochondrial respiration and therefore provided the best protective effects to H9C2 cardiomyocytes. By increasing the spare respiratory capacity of stressed H9C2 cells up to three-folds of that of healthy cells, the 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng greatly improved the tolerance of myocardial cells to oxidative damage.These results demonstrated that the low polarity extracts of ginseng could be the best extract, as compared with others, in regulating the  consumption rate of cultured cardiomyocytes during mitochondrial respiration.© 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691289>Physiological basis of brief vigorous exercise to improve health.</a></h1><p>This review considers the physiological basis of brief vigorous exercise to improve health, with a focus on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and glycemic control, and the potential underlying mechanisms involved. We defined 'brief' as a protocol lasting ≤15 min including warm-up, cool-down, and recovery, and involving a total of ≤5 min of 'vigorous' exercise, which was classified as meeting or exceeding the lower end of the range for this relative intensity per criteria from the American College of Sports Medicine. The physiological mechanisms responsible for the increase in CRF, as measured by maximal  update (VO ), after brief vigorous exercise are unclear, and likely depend on various factors including the specific nature of the intervention as well as the time course of the response. Limited available evidence suggests the potential for an increased  extraction by active muscle (i.e. greater arterio-venous  difference), since an increase in VO has been reported after several weeks of brief vigorous exercise despite no measurable change in cardiac output. Emerging evidence indicates that brief vigorous exercise can improve glycemic control, suggesting that this type of exercise could potentially play a role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. The acute response is not well characterized but several studies have shown that several weeks brief vigorous exercise improves estimates of insulin sensitivity as determined by various methods including by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The physiological mechanisms underlying improved CRF and glycemic control after brief vigorous exercise, and broader impact on health, remain fruitful areas of investigation.

However, there is a lack of research on the development of ROS-generating nanosystems that combine endogenous and exogenous ROS to enhance oxidative stress-mediated cancer cell death.  A ROS-generating agent based on polymer-modified zinc peroxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was presented, which simultaneously delivered exogenous HO and Zn capable of amplifying endogenous ROS production for synergistic cancer therapy.  After internalization into tumor cells, ZnO NPs underwent decomposition in response to mild acidic pH, resulting in controlled release of HO and Zn. Intriguingly, Zn could increase the production of mitochondrial O· and HO by inhibiting the electron transport chain, and thus exerted anticancer effect in a synergistic manner with the exogenously released HO to promote cancer cell killing. Furthermore, ZnO NPs were doped with manganese  cation exchange, making them an activatable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent.

To date, the genetic mechanisms of rapeseed' interactions with S. sclerotiorum are not fully understood, and molecular-based breeding is still the most effective control strategy for this disease. Here, Arabidopsis thaliana GDSL1 was characterized as an extracellular GDSL lipase gene functioning in Sclerotinia resistance. Loss of AtGDSL1 function resulted in enhanced susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum. Conversely, overexpression of AtGDSL1 in B. napus enhanced resistance, which was associated with increased reactive  species (ROS) and salicylic acid (SA) levels, and reduced jasmonic acid levels. In addition, AtGDSL1 can cause an increase in lipid precursor phosphatidic acid levels, which may lead to the activation of downstream ROS/SA defense-related pathways. However, the rapeseed BnGDSL1 with highest sequence similarity to AtGDSL1 had no effect on SSR resistance. A candidate gene association study revealed that only one AtGDSL1 homolog from rapeseed, BnaC07g35650D (BnGLIP1), significantly contributed to resistance traits in a natural B. napus population, and the resistance function was also confirmed by a transient expression assay in tobacco leaves. Moreover, genomic analyses revealed that BnGLIP1 locus was embedded in a selected region associated with SSR-resistance during the breeding process, and its elite allele type belonged to a minor allele in the population. Thus, BnGLIP1 is the functional equivalent of AtGDSL1 and has a broad application in rapeseed S. sclerotiorum-resistance breeding.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective action of BDNF overexpression in hippocampal neurons against injury under ischemia-like conditions ( and glucose deprivation) and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (GluTox). The overexpression of BDNF was reached by the transduction of cell cultures with the adeno-associated (AAV)-Syn-BDNF-EGFP virus construct. Neuroprotective effects were mediated by Ca-dependent BDNF release followed by activation of the neuroprotective signaling cascades and changes of the gene expression. Thus, BDNF overexpression modulates Ca homeostasis in cells, preventing Ca overload and initiation of apoptotic and necrotic processes. Antiapoptotic effect of BDNF overexpression is mediated via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and changing the expression of PI3K, HIF-1, Src, and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. On the contrary, the decrease of expression of proapoptotic proteins such as Jun, Mapk8, Caspase-3, and an inflammatory cytokine IL-1β was observed. These changes of expression were accompanied by the decrease of quantity of IL-1β receptors and the level of TNFα in cells in control, as well as 24 hours after OGD. Besides, BDNF overexpression changes the expression of GABA(B) receptors. Also, the expression of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits was altered towards a change in the conductivity of the receptors for Ca. Thus, our results demonstrate that neuronal BDNF overexpression reveals complex neuroprotective effect on the neurons and astrocytes under OGD and GluTox via inhibition of Ca-responses and regulation of gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691539>Changes in the blood redox balance during a simulated duathlon race and its relationship with athletic performance.</a></h1><p>The duathlon is an endurance multisport event that consists of sequential running, cycling, and further running. Imbalance in the redox homeostasis is associated with fatigued status and underperformance in various sports; however, there are no corresponding reports regarding the duathlon. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in the blood redox balance during a simulated duathlon race and to determine the relationship between performance and the redox balance. Eight male triathletes participated in a simulated race, consisting of a 5-km run, 30 km cycling, and a further 5-km run, with 5 min rest between two parts to collect the blood samples. The serum levels of reactive  metabolites (d-ROMs) and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) were measured and BAP/d-ROMs ratio and oxidative stress index (OSI) were calculated. The d-ROMs levels after the first Run were significantly increased compared with the levels observed before the race. Moreover, BAP levels increased significantly over the race. The BAP/d-ROMs ratio also gradually increased through the race, while the OSI was gradually decreased. In addition, a significant relationship was observed only between d-ROMs levels after the first Run and the first Run performance. These results suggest that the redox balance shifts toward reduction (antioxidation) during the duathlon race and increased oxidant potential levels are negatively correlated with performance in the early stages of the race.© 2019 The Authors.

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat containing X1 (NLRX1) is a unique NLR with regulatory and anti-inflammatory functions resulting in protection from IBD in mouse models. NX-13 is an orally active, gut-restricted novel drug candidate that selectively targets and activates the NLRX1 pathway locally in the gut. In vitro and in vivo efficacy of NLRX1 activation by NX-13 was examined. Oral treatment with NX-13 alleviates disease severity, colonic leukocytic infiltration, and cytokine markers of inflammation in three mouse models of IBD (dextran sulfate sodium, Mdr1a, and CD45RB adoptive transfer). Treatment of naive CD4 T cells with NX-13 in vitro decreases differentiation into Th1 and Th17 subsets with increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased NF-κB activation and reactive  species. With stimulation by PMA/ionomycin, TNF-α, or HO, PBMCs from ulcerative colitis patients treated with NX-13 had decreased NF-κB activity, TNF-α and IFN-γ CD4 T cells and overall production of IL-6, MCP1, and IL-8. NX-13 activates NLRX1 to mediate a resistance to both inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress in mouse models and human primary cells from ulcerative colitis patients with effects on NF-κB activity and oxidative phosphorylation. NX-13 is a promising oral, gut-restricted NLRX1 agonist for treating IBD.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693266>Interfacial Lattice-Strain-Driven Generation of  Vacancies in an Aerobic-Annealed TiO (B) Electrode.</a></h1><p> vacancies play crucial roles in defining physical and chemical properties of materials to enhance the performances in electronics, solar cells, catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion and storage. Conventional approaches to incorporate  defects mainly rely on reducing the  partial pressure for the removal of product to change the equilibrium position. However, directly affecting reactants to shift the reaction toward generating  vacancies is lacking and to fill this blank in synthetic methodology is very challenging. Here, a strategy is demonstrated to create  vacancies through making the reaction energetically more favorable via applying interfacial strain on reactants by coating, using TiO (B) as a model system. Geometrical phase analysis and density functional theory simulations verify that the formation energy of  vacancies is largely decreased under external strain. Benefiting from these, the obtained -deficient TiO (B) exhibits impressively high level of capacitive charge storage, e.g., ≈53% at 0.5 mV s , far surpassing the ≈31% of the unmodified counterpart. Meanwhile, the modified electrode shows significantly enhanced rate capability delivering a capacity of 112 mAh g at 20 C (≈6.7 A g ), ≈30% higher than air-annealed TiO and comparable to vacuum-calcined TiO .

This experiment was conducted to evaluate whether increasing the  level or administration of a probiotic could improve mortality and immune response of chickens at high altitude (2,986 m above the sea level). One-d-old chickens were randomly allocated to 1 of 6 treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement. The first factor was the  level (low and high), while the second factor was the diet (basal diet, basal diet containing aureomycin, and basal diet plus L. plantarum). Increasing the  level significantly reduced the mortality and improved immune responses. The levels of IgA, IgG, IL-10 and anti-BSA antibodies were significantly higher, while IL-1β, LITAF were significantly lower in chickens reared in the high- room. In the low- room, L. plantarum significantly decreased the mortality of chickens compared with the other 2 groups. Moreover, L. plantarum significantly increased the levels of IgA, anti-BSA antibodies, IL-10 and decreased IL-1β, LITAF compared with the control group. These results demonstrated that increasing  level or administration of L. plantarum can improve health status of chickens in high altitude regions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693927>Phytoestrogen coumestrol attenuates brain mitochondrial dysfunction and long-term cognitive deficits following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.</a></h1><p>Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia (HI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is frequently associated with short and long-term neurologic and cognitive impairments. The HI injury causes mitochondrial damage leading to increased production of reactive  species (ROS). Phytoestrogens are non-steroidal plant substances structurally and functionally similar to estrogen. Coumestrol is a potent isoflavonoid with a protective effect against ischemic brain damage in adult rats. Our aim was to determine if coumestrol treatment following neonatal HI attenuates the long-term cognitive deficits induced by neonatal HI, as well as to investigate one possible mechanism underlying its potential effect.On the 7th postnatal day, male Wistar rats were submitted to the Levine-Rice HI model. Intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg of coumestrol, or vehicle, were administered immediately pre-hypoxia or 3 hours post-hypoxia. At 12 hours after HI the mitochondrial status and ROS levels were determined. At 60th postnatal day the cognitive deficits were revealed in the Morris water maze reference and working spatial memories. Following behavioral analysis, histological assessment was performed and reactive astrogliosis was measured by GFAP expression.Results demonstrate that both pre- and post-HI administration of coumestrol were able to counteract the long-term cognitive and morphological impairments caused by HI, as well as to block the late reactive astrogliosis. The pre-HI administration of coumestrol was able to prevent the early mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus of injured rat pups.Present data suggest that coumestrol exerts protection against experimental neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia through, at least in part, early modulation of mitochondrial function.Copyright © 2019.

The dysfunctional tumor vasculature limits the efficiency of oxygenation and drug delivery to reduce treatment outcome. A concept of tumor vascular normalization (VN), which inhibits angiogenesis to improve vessel maturity, blood perfusion, and oxygenation, has been demonstrated under the anti-angiogenic therapy. The efficiency of drug delivery and penetration is increased by enhancing perfusion and reducing interstitial fluid pressure during the time window of VN. However, anti-angiogenic agents only induce transient VN and then prune vessels to aggravate tumor hypoxia. To repair tumor vessels without altering vessel density, we proposed to induce tumor VN by local  release via  microbubbles with ultrasound. With tumor perfusion enhancement under ultrasound contrast imaging tracing, the time window of VN was defined as 2-8 days after a single  microbubble treatment. The enhanced tumor oxygenation after  microbubble treatment inhibited hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway to improve the morphology and function of tumor vasculature. The pericyte coverage and Hoechst penetration of tumor vessels increased without any changes to the vessel density. Finally, the intratumoral accumulation of anti-cancer drug doxorubicin could be increased 3-4 folds during tumor VN. These findings demonstrate that regulating tumor oxygenation by  microbubbles could normalize dysfunctional vessels to enhance vascular maturity, blood perfusion, and drug penetration. Furthermore, ultrasound perfusion imaging provides a simple and non-invasive way to detect the VN time window, which increases the feasibility of VN in clinical cancer applications.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695748> exhibiting a modified route for uptake and catabolism of glycerol forms significant amounts of ethanol from this carbon source considered as 'non-fermentable'.</a></h1><p>Due to its inevitable formation during biodiesel production and its relatively high degree of reduction, glycerol is an attractive carbon source for microbial fermentation processes. However, glycerol is catabolized in a fully respiratory manner by the eukaryotic platform organism . We previously engineered   strains to favor fermentative metabolism of glycerol by replacing the native FAD-dependent glycerol catabolic pathway with the NAD-dependent 'DHA pathway'. In addition, a heterologous aquaglyceroporin (Fps1 homolog) was expressed to facilitate glycerol uptake. The current study was launched to scrutinize the formation of 's natural fermentation product ethanol from glycerol caused by the conducted genetic modifications. This understanding is supposed to facilitate future engineering of this yeast for fermenting glycerol into valuable products more reduced than ethanol.A strain solely exhibiting the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement produced ethanol at concentrations close to the detection limit. The expression of the heterologous aquaglyceroporin caused significant ethanol production (8.5 g L from 51.5 g L glycerol consumed) in a strain catabolizing glycerol via the DHA pathway but not in the wild-type background. A reduction of  availability in the shake flask cultures further increased the ethanol titer up to 15.7 g L (from 45 g L glycerol consumed).The increased yield of cytosolic NADH caused by the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement seems to be a minimal requirement for the occurrence of alcoholic fermentation in   growing in synthetic glycerol medium. The remarkable metabolic switch to ethanol formation in the DHA pathway strain with the heterologous aquaglyceroporin supports the assumption of a much stronger influx of glycerol accompanied by an increased rate of cytosolic NADH production via the DHA pathway. The fact that a reduction of  supply increases ethanol production in DHA pathway strains is in line with the hypothesis that a major part of glycerol in normal shake flask cultures still enters the catabolism in a respiratory manner.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692345>Persulfurated Coronene and Its Chalcogenide Analogues: Insight into Effects of the Peripheral Substitution.</a></h1><p>The density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods have been used to investigate the persulfurated coronene (PSC) and its chalcogenide analogues (POC and PSeC), derived from the substitution of sulfur, , and selenium for all hydrogen atoms in coronene, respectively. The presence of peripheral S-S in PSC results in a σ-type lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the dark low-lying states (S1 ∼ S15). The peripheral S-S bond is responsible for its electron capture, which maintains a planar configuration of the singly and doubly negative-charged PSC. POC is predicted to have the most stable saddle-shaped structure with the C=O group, and its bowl-shaped isomer with the O-O moiety is less stable by 279.2 kcal/mol energetically. PSeC has similar electronic and structural features with PSC, but its dimer is predicted to have much better hole mobility, compared to PSC. The present results indicate that the chalcogenide substitution at the periphery of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may remarkably change their electronic and spectroscopic properties as well as the carrier transport behavior of their molecular materials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696889>Size induced structural changes in maricite-NaFePO: an in-depth study by experiment and simulations.</a></h1><p>Rechargeable batteries based on the most abundant elements, such as sodium and iron, have a great potential in the development of cost effective sodium ion batteries for large scale energy storage devices. We report, for the first time, crystallite size dependent structural investigations on maricite-NaFePO4 through X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. Rietveld refinement analysis on the X-ray diffraction data reveals that a decrease in the unit cell parameters leads to volume contraction upon reduction in the crystallite size. Further, the atomic multiplet simulations on X-ray absorption spectra provide unequivocally a change in the site symmetry of transition metal ions. The high resolution  K-edge spectra reveal a substantial change in the bonding character with the reduction of crystallite size, which is the fundamental cause for the change in the unit cell parameters of maricite-NaFePO4. In parallel, we performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on maricite-NaFePO4 with different sodium ion vacancy concentrations. The obtained structural parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations on the mesostructured maricite-NaFePO4. The volumetric changes with respect to crystallite size are related to the compressive strain, resulting in the improvement in the electronic diffusivity. The nano-crystalline maricite-NaFePO4 with improved kinetics will open a new avenue for its usage as a cathode material in sodium ion batteries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695628>A Single Simulated Heliox Dive Modifies Endothelial Function in the Vascular Wall of ApoE Knockout Male Rats More Than Females.</a></h1><p>The number of divers is rising every year, including an increasing number of aging persons with impaired endothelial function and concomitant atherosclerosis. While diving is an independent modulator of endothelial function, little is known about how diving affects already impaired endothelium. In this study, we questioned whether diving exposure leads to further damage of an already impaired endothelium.A total of 5 male and 5 female ApoE knockout (KO) rats were exposed to simulated diving to an absolute pressure of 600 kPa in heliox gas (80% helium, 20% ) for 1 h in a dry pressure chamber. 10 ApoE KO rats (5 males, 5 females) and 8 male Sprague-Dawley rats served as controls. Endothelial function was examined  by isometric myography of pulmonary and mesenteric arteries. Lipid peroxidation in blood plasma, heart and lung tissue was used as measures of oxidative stress. Expression and phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase were quantified by Western blot.A single simulated dive was found to induce endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary arteries of ApoE KO rats, and this was more profound in male than female rats. Endothelial dysfunction in males was associated with changing in production or bioavailability of NO; while in female pulmonary arteries an imbalance in prostanoid signaling was observed. No effect of diving was found on mesenteric arteries from rats of either sex. Our findings suggest that changes in endothelial dysfunction were specific for pulmonary circulation. In future, human translation of these findings may suggest caution for divers who are elderly or have prior reduced endothelial function.Copyright © 2019 Berenji Ardestani, Matchkov, Eftedal and Pedersen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697942>Evaluation of sex differences in acid/base and electrolyte concentrations in acute large vessel stroke.</a></h1><p>Ischemic stroke is the one of the most severe and debilitating diseases, and despite animal models, there is much to learn about the neuropathology in humans in a way that could inform the development of therapies. We have developed a protocol to collect and evaluate arterial blood immediately distal and proximal from the removed intracranial thrombus during mechanical thrombectomy. These samples provide a unique resource in evaluating acute changes in acid/base and electrolyte concentrations at the time of ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to compare acid/base and electrolytes obtained proximal and distal to the occluded intracranial thrombi between male and female acute ischemic stroke subjects at the time of thrombectomy; and to determine whether arterial blood gas values predict outcomes in male and female subjects.We analyzed the first 49 subjects (age = 67 ± 15.0, 21 males) in the BACTRAC registry. We compared arterial blood gas of blood distal versus proximal to the thrombus during thrombectomy which provided acid/base levels (pH, pCO, pO, BD, HCO) and electrolyte values (iCa, K, and Na). Comparisons were evaluated by one-way repeated measures ANOVA (p < .05). Moderated multiple regression with an interaction term of sex determined predictors of infarct volume, edema volume, and infarct time.In general, distal intracranial luminal blood sample showed a compensated metabolic acidosis with an elevated  concentration in both blood samples. Analysis indicated several significant differences in the proximal blood samples between sexes (pH, pCO, and K). Bicarbonate and base deficit were predictors of infarct time specifically in female subjects.Acid/base and electrolyte response to ischemic conditions differ between men and women, and these early changes could be used to predict local acid/base changes and how they develop differently in men and women during ischemia. These findings provide a novel insight into the pathology of large vessel stroke in humans, particularly potential variations based on sex.Copyright © 2019.

Current understanding is largely limited to description of changes in chemistry, with few measurements of the processes driving winter changes, how they differ across lakes, and how they are impacted by under-ice conditions. Nitrification is a process which consumes  and ammonium (NH4+), and supplies nitrate (NO3-). To date, nitrification has been measured under ice cover in only two lakes globally. Here, we used 15NH4+ enrichment to measure rates of pelagic nitrification in thirteen water bodies in two ecozones. Our work demonstrates ecologically important rates of nitrification can occur despite low water temperatures, impacting NH4+, NO3- and, most importantly,  concentrations. However, high rates are not the norm. When, where and why is nitrification important in winter? We found that nitrification rates were highest in a eutrophic lake chain downstream of a wastewater treatment effluent (mean: 226.5 μg N L-1 d-1), and in a semi-saline prairie lake (110.0 μg N L-1 d-1). In the boreal shield, a eutrophic lake had nitrification rates exceeding those of an oligotrophic lake by 6-fold. Supplementing our results with literature data we found NH4+ concentrations were the strongest predictor of nitrification rates across lentic ecosystems in winter. Higher nitrification rates were associated with higher concentrations of NH4+, NO3- and nitrous oxide (N2O). While more work is required to understand the switch between high and low nitrification rates and strengthen our understanding of winter nitrogen cycling, this work demonstrates that high nitrification rates can occur in winter.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696099>Increasing Respiratory Effort With 100%  During Resuscitation of Preterm Rabbits at Birth.</a></h1><p> Spontaneous breathing is essential for successful non-invasive respiratory support delivered by a facemask at birth. As hypoxia is a potent inhibitor of spontaneous breathing, initiating respiratory support with a high fraction of inspired O may reduce the risk of hypoxia and increase respiratory effort at birth.  Preterm rabbit kittens (29 days gestation, term ~32 days) were delivered and randomized to receive continuous positive airway pressure with either 21% ( = 12) or 100% O ( = 8) via a facemask. If apnea occurred, intermittent positive pressure ventilation (iPPV) was applied with either 21% or 100% O in kittens who started in 21% O, and remained at 100% O for kittens who started the experiment in 100% O. Respiratory rate (breaths per minute, bpm) and variability in inter-breath interval (%) were measured from esophageal pressure recordings and functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured from synchrotron phase-contrast X-ray images.  Initially, kittens receiving 21% O had a significantly lower respiratory rate and higher variability in inter-breath interval, indicating a less stable breathing pattern than kittens starting in 100% O [median (IQR) respiratory rate: 16 (4-28) vs. 38 (29-46) bpm,  = 0.001; variability in inter-breath interval: 33.3% (17.2-50.1%) vs. 27.5% (18.6-36.3%),  = 0.009]. Apnea that required iPPV, was more frequently observed in kittens in whom resuscitation was started with 21% compared to 100% O (11/12 vs. 1/8,  = 0.001). After recovering from apnea, respiratory rate was significantly lower and variability in inter-breath interval was significantly higher in kittens who received iPPV with 21% compared to 100% O. FRC was not different between study groups at both timepoints.  Initiating resuscitation with 100% O resulted in increased respiratory activity and stability, thereby reducing the risk of apnea and need for iPPV after birth. Further studies in human preterm infants are mandatory to confirm the benefit of this approach in terms of oxygenation. In addition, the ability to avoid hyperoxia after initiation of resuscitation with 100% , using a titration protocol based on  saturation, needs to be clarified.Copyright © 2019 Dekker, Hooper, Croughan, Crossley, Wallace, McGillick, DeKoninck, Thio, Martherus, Ruben, Roehr, Cramer, Flemmer, Croton, te Pas and Kitchen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690173>Dysregulation of TFEB contributes to Manganese-induced Autophagic Failure and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Astrocytes.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological and clinical studies have long shown that exposure to high levels of heavy metals are associated with increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases. It is widely accepted that autophagic dysfunction is involved in pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders; however, the role of heavy metals in regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy is unclear. Here, we show that manganese (Mn) induces a decline in nuclear localization of TFEB (transcription factor EB), a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, leading to autophagic dysfunction in astrocytes of mouse striatum. We further show that Mn exposure suppresses autophagic-lysosomal degradation of mitochondria and induces accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria. Activation of autophagy by rapamycin or TFEB overexpression ameliorates Mn-induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and reactive  species (ROS) generation in astrocytes, suggesting a causal relation between autophagic failure and mitochondrial dysfunction in Mn toxicity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Mn inhibits TFEB activity, leading to impaired autophagy that is causally related to mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for Mn in dysregulation of autophagy and identify TFEB as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate Mn toxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690614>Long-Term Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation Cough Assistance in Neuromuscular Disease: Patterns of Use and Lessons for Application.</a></h1><p>Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) devices increase expiratory air flow and thereby promote increased cough peak flow (CPF) in conjunction with a cough. There is little research looking at long-term use of MI-E in subjects with neuromuscular disease (NMD), and no long-term study has reported CPF, MI-E device settings, and adherence.We evaluated 181 patient records (130 adults, 51 children) of individuals who received a MI-E device from our center between February 2014 and February 2018. Median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 27 (14-51) y. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were the 3 most common diagnoses.MI-E devices were provided to the weakest subjects with a CPF < 160 L/min. Median (IQR) settings were insufflation, 25 (23-30) cm HO, exsufflation -35 (-30 to -40) cm HO, insufflation time 1.5 (1.3-1.7) s, exsufflation time 1.8 (1.5-2.0) s, and pause 1.5 (1.3-2.0) s. The inspiratory flow profile was set to high in all subjects, and no subject used supplemental  with the MI-E device. When comparing insufflation pressures to exsufflation pressures, a greater negative pressure was used relative to positive pressure ( < .001). When comparing insufflation to exsufflation time, there was a significantly longer exsufflation duration ( < .001). Median (IQR) CPF at the start of MI-E was 60 (10-100) L/min. There was no correlation between either insufflation or exsufflation pressures and CPF. Median (IQR) usage for the group was 60% (13.5-100%) of days for the total days. Subjects with tracheostomies or SMA type I had the greatest adherence to treatment. Median (IQR) duration of MI-E use was 17 (8.5-32) months. Ninety-six percent of subjects were receiving ventilatory support.Greater exsufflation pressures than insufflation pressures, together with a shorter insufflation time than exsufflation time, were used. Predicting good adherence among the subjects was difficult. Subjects who produced daily secretions were more likely to use MI-E every day.Copyright © 2019 by Daedalus Enterprises.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698274>High adsorptivity and recycling performance activated carbon fibers for Cu(II) adsorption.</a></h1><p>In order to develop adsorbent materials with high Cu(II) adsorptivity and renewable recycling for Cu(II), nitric acid oxidation process is optimized and ameliorated by microwave and sonication to obtain an efficient modification and regeneration processes.

Insight into factors associated with the pathogenesis of BPD is key to improving its prevention and treatment.To perform a systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression of clinical studies exploring the association between chorioamnionitis (CA) and BPD in preterm infants.PubMed and Embase were searched without language restriction (last search, October 1, 2018). Key search terms included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chorioamnionitis, and risk factors.Included studies were peer-reviewed studies examining preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) or very low-birth-weight (<1500 g) infants and reporting primary data that could be used to measure the association between exposure to CA and the development of BPD.The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline was followed. Data were independently extracted by 2 researchers. A random-effects model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity in effect size across studies was studied using multivariate, random-effects metaregression analysis.The primary outcome was BPD, defined as supplemental  requirement on postnatal day 28 (BPD28) or at the postmenstrual age of 36 weeks (BPD36). Covariates considered as potential confounders included differences between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and rates of early- and late-onset sepsis.A total of 3170 potentially relevant studies were found, of which 158 met the inclusion criteria (244 096 preterm infants, 20 971 CA cases, and 24 335 BPD cases). Meta-analysis showed that CA exposure was significantly associated with BPD28 (65 studies; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.88-2.86; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 84%; P < .001) and BPD36 (108 studies; OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 63%; P < .001). The association between CA and BPD remained significant for both clinical and histologic CA. In addition, significant differences were found between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, birth weight, odds of being small for gestational age, exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and early- and late-onset sepsis. Chorioamnionitis was not significantly associated with RDS (48 studies; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92-1.34; P = .24; heterogeneity: I2 = 90%; P < .001), but multivariate metaregression analysis with backward elimination revealed that a model combining the difference in gestational age and the odds of RDS was associated with 64% of the variance in the association between CA and BPD36 across studies.The results of this study confirm that among preterm infants, exposure to CA is associated with a higher risk of developing BPD, but this association may be modulated by gestational age and risk of RDS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691326>Pumping new life into old ideas: Preservation and rehabilitation of the liver using ex situ machine perfusion.</a></h1><p>Recent advances in machine perfusion technology have reinvigorated the field of liver transplantation with the possibilities of vastly improving the efficiency and safety of the life-saving procedure.

By turning them into fatty acids, FALDH avoids the accumulation of toxic fatty aldehydes. The mutation results in the accumulation of aldehyde-modified lipids or fatty alcohols that may interfere with skin and brain function.In Nov 2018, we performed a literature search in PubMed for clinical studies, clinical trials, case reports, controlled trials, randomized controlled trials, and systemic reviews. The search terms we used were "SJOGREN-LARSSON SYNDROME" AND "HYPERMELANNOSIS" OR "FALDH" (from 1985). The search resulted in 1,289 articles, out of these 95 articles met our inclusion exclusion criteria. Our inclusion criteria included relevant original articles relevant, critical systemic reviews, and crucial referenced articles, ex-clusion criteria included duplicates and articles not published in English language.Toxicity of long-chain aldehydes to FALDH-deficient cells owing to accumulation under the profound epidermis layer improves oxidative stress in the cell resulting in keratinocyte hyperproliferation.While it continues to be determined whether accumulated fatty alcohol and fatty aldehydes obtained from ether glycerolipids and sphingolipids improve the susceptibility of melanocytes and their element accountable for skin hyperpigmentation to biological colour.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691440>Asymmetric Wacker-Type oxyallenylation and Azaallenylation of Cyclic Alkenes.</a></h1><p>Palladium-catalyzed three-component carboetherification of cyclic alkenes proceeds to give exclusive trans -adducts in excellent enantioselectivity via a Wacker-type pathway.

Manganese(II) doped carbon dots (Mn-CDs) were prepared by a convenient hydrothermal route and are shown to possess oxidase-like catalytic ability. They catalyze the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by dissolved  to form a blue colored product (oxTMB). AA can reduce blue oxTMB to colorless TMB. The fading of the blue color (measured at 652 nm) can be applied for quantifying AA in the 50 to 2500 nM concentration range and with a 9 nM detection limit. The method was successfully used for the quantitation of AA in real samples.

To overcome the high-energy cost of traditional electrochemical oxidation, a custom-built power supply device for the degradation of anthraquinone and azo dyes by low voltage of 15.0-20.0 V pulsed discharge was investigated. Titanium coated with mixed oxide (Ti/IrO -RuO -SnO ) plates and pure titanium plates were used as the anode and cathode, respectively, for the generation of chlorine in the dye solution. For the anthraquione dye Reactive Blue 19, 60.0% of the chemical  demand (COD) and 22.0% of the total organic carbon (TOC) were removed using this system. A comparison of the direct current electrolysis and pulsed discharge revealed that using the pulsed discharge method reduced the energy cost by 68.6%. UV-visible, LC-MS, and GC-MS were used to identify the intermediate compounds formed during the degradation of Reactive Blue 19. The results indicate that in the process of oxidation by chlorine/hypochlorite, the chromophore group was first oxidized to -NH , followed by decolorization via chlorination of the aromatic rings. The results confirm that low-voltage pulse-electrolysis can be used for the degradation of industrial dyes in waste effluents.© 2019 Water Environment Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693492>A new prospective on the role of melatonin in diabetes and its complications.</a></h1><p>Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland under the control of the circadian rhythm, and is released in the dark and suppressed during the day. In the past decades, melatonin has been considered to be used in the treatment for diabetes mellitus (DM). This is due to a functional inter-relationship between melatonin and insulin. Elevated oxidative stress is a feature found in DM associated with diabetic neuropathy (DN), retinopathy (DR), nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. Reactive  species (ROS) and nitrogen oxidative species (NOS) are usually produced in massive amounts via glucose and lipid peroxidation, and this leads to diabetic complications. At the molecular level, ROS causes damage to the biomolecules and triggers apoptosis. Melatonin, as an antioxidant and a free radical scavenger, ameliorates oxidative stress caused by ROS and NOS. Besides that, melatonin administration is proven to bring other anti-DM effects such as reducing cellular apoptosis and promoting the production of antioxidants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695223>Aproximación genética en la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica.</a></h1><p>The superoxide dismutase type 1 (SOD1) gene is the first responsible gene mapped in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 1 (ALS1), and it codes for the enzyme SOD1, the function of which is to protect against damage mediated by free radicals deriving from . Its pathophysiological mechanism in ALS1 is related to ischemia. Several molecular studies of the SOD1 gene show that point mutations are the most frequent. The most common mutations in familial cases are p.A4V, p.I113Y, p.G37R, p.D90A and p.E100G, which account for more than 80% of cases, although intronic mutations have also been described as responsible for ALS1. Sporadic cases are explained by mutations in other genes such as SETX and C9orf72. ALS1 is a complex disease with genetic heterogeneity. On the other hand, familial and sporadic cases have a different etiology, which is explained by molecular heterogeneity and multiple pathogenic mechanisms that lead to ALS1; oxidative stress and ischemia are not the only cause. In Mexico, ALS molecular genetics studies are scarce.

However, its bactericidal function during mycobacterial infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that the p53-deficient macrophages failed to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), manifested as a lower apoptotic cell death rate and enhanced intracellular survival. The expression levels of p53 during Mtb infection were stronger in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages. The TLR2/JNK signaling pathway plays an essential role in the modulation of M1 macrophage polarization upon Mtb infection. It facilitates p53-mediated apoptosis through the production of reactive  species, nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines in Mtb-infected M1 macrophages. In addition, nutlin-3 effectively abrogated the intracellular survival of mycobacteria in both TB patients and healthy controls after H37Ra infection for 24 h, indicating that the enhancement of p53 production effectively suppressed the intracellular survival of Mtb in hosts. These results suggest that p53 can be a new therapeutic target for TB therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695431>α-Hederin Increases The Apoptosis Of Cisplatin-Resistant Gastric Cancer Cells By Activating Mitochondrial Pathway In Vivo And Vitro.</a></h1><p>Gastric cancer remains an important cancer worldwide, and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have the defects of drug resistance and cell toxicity. α-Hederin has been found to have certain therapeutic effects on various types of human cancers. However, studies on the α-hederin that exert biological activities on the cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells are limited. In this study, we evaluated the effects of α-hederin in HGC27/DDP and the potential mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro.HGC27/DDP cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed quantitatively using Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell invasion and migration were detected by Transwell invasion assay and wound healing assay. Cell apoptosis was examined by employing Hoechst 33258 Staining Kit and an Annexin V-PE apoptosis kit. Intracellular GSH levels were examined by using a GSH Assay Kit. DCFH-DA and JC-1 Kit were used to detect levels of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm). The protein levels of Apaf-1, AIF, Bax, Bcl-2, Cyt C, Survivin, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, MMP-9 and MMP-2 were detected by Western blot analysis. The effect of α-hederin in vivo was observed by xenograft tumor models in nude mice.The α-hederin treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner of HGC27/DDP and induced obvious apoptosis compared with the control group (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the ability of cells to invade and migrate was suppressed (P<0.05). The α-hederin induced the depletion of GSH (P<0.05) and the accumulation of intracellular ROS (P<0.05), changed the mitochondrial membrane potential (P<0.05), increased the Bax, Apaf-1, AIF, Cyt C, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 expression and decreased the protein level of Bcl-2, survivin, MMP-9 and MMP-2 (P<0.05). Pretreatment with NAC (12 mM) enhanced the tendency and pretreatment with BSO (8 mM) attenuated the tendency above (P<0.05). Meanwhile, α-hederin inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo (P<0.05).Our study provides strong molecular evidence to support our hypothesis that α-hederin inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HGC27/DDP cells by increasing the levels of intracellular ROS and triggering mitochondrial pathway activation.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693915>Light emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation therapy on murine macrophage exposed to Bothropstoxin-I and Bothropstoxin-II myotoxins.</a></h1><p>The light-emitting diode (LED) is considered a therapeutic tool due to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and wound-healing effects, which occur through angiogenesis, decrease in IL-1β and IL-6 secretion, and acceleration of the cicatricial process. Snakebites are an important public health problem in tropical regions of the world. LED treatment is a therapeutic tool associated with serum therapy used to minimize the local effects of snakebites, including decrease in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations, myonecrosis, and inflammatory and haemorrhagic responses. In this study, we analysed the photobiomodulation effect of LED on the activation of murine macrophages induced by BthTX-I or BthTX-II isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom. Photobiomodulation caused an increase in mitochondrial metabolism and a considerable decrease in cytotoxicity in murine macrophages. Moreover, it induced a decrease in reactive  species and nitrogen liberation. However, photobiomodulation caused an increase in macrophage phagocytic capacity and lipid droplet formation. The results of this study corroborated with those of others in an unprecedented way and provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of photobiomodulation, besides offering a coadjuvant action treatment for the local effects of snakebites, not achieved with serum therapy alone.Copyright © 2019.

Similar to many other FPR2 agonistic peptides, nanomolar concentrations of both PSMα2 and PSMα3 activate neutrophils to increase the cytosolic concentration of Ca and release NADPH oxidase-derived reactive  species. In addition, the PSMα peptides induce FPR2 homologous desensitization, actin polymerization, and neutrophil reactivation through a receptor cross-talk mechanism. However, in contrast to conventional FPR2 agonistic peptides, including the host-derived formyl peptide MCT-ND4, we found that the PSMα peptides lacked the ability to recruit β-arrestin and induce neutrophil chemotaxis, supporting the previous notion that β-arrestin translocation is of importance for cell migration. Despite the lack of β-arrestin recruitment, the PSMα peptides induced an FPR2-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and internalization. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship analysis with PSMα2 derivatives revealed critical roles of the first 3 aa linked to N-fMet as well as the C terminus of PSMα2 in promoting FPR2 to recruit β-arrestin. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel neutrophil activation pattern upon FPR2 sensing of PSMα peptides, signified by the ability to induce increased intracellular Ca, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, internalization, and NADPH oxidase activity, yet lack of β-arrestin recruitment and neutrophil chemoattraction. These novel features adopted by the PSMα peptides could be of importance for  virulence and might facilitate identification of new therapeutic strategies for treating  infections.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697018>Sodalite-type Cu-based Three-dimensional Metal-Organic Framework for Efficient  Reduction Reaction.</a></h1><p>Inspiration from copper-based  reduction biocatalysts, we have studied the electrocatalytic behavior of a Cu-based MOF (Cu-BTT, compound 1) for  Reduction Reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. This catalyst reduces the  at the onset (Eonset) and half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0. 940  V and 0.778 V, respectively. The high halfway potential supports the good activity of Cu-BTT MOF. The high ORR catalytic activity can be interpreted by the presence of nitrogen-rich ligand (tetrazole) and the generation of nascent copper (I) during the reaction. In addition to the excellent activity, compound 1 showed exceptional stability too, which has been confirmed through Chronoamperometry study where, current was more or less unchanged up to 12 h. Further, the 4 electrons transfer of ORR kinetics was confirmed by hydrodynamic voltammetry. The  active center namely copper (I) generation during ORR is understood by the reduction peak in cyclic voltammetry as well in the XPS analysis.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of the Actiheart, a light portable monitor estimating AEE based on heart rate (HR) and activity counts (ACT), during two popular activities (running and cycling) performed at high intensities. The benefit of an individual calibration of the HR-AEE relationship established during a preliminary maximal test was also evaluated.AEE was estimated in eighteen active adults (4 women and 14 men; 25 ± 4 yr) with indirect calorimetry using a respiratory gas analysis system (reference method) and the Actiheart during 5-min running and cycling at 60, 75 and 85% of maximal  uptake (VO2max) previously determined during a maximal test performed on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. For the Actiheart, AEE was estimated either using the group or individual calibrated equations available in the dedicated software, and their respective HR, ACT or combined HR/ACT algorithms.When the HR algorithm was used for cycling and the HR or HR/ACT algorithms for running, AEE measured by the Actiheart increased proportionally to exercise intensity from 60 to 85% VO2max (P<0.001). Compared to indirect calorimetry, the Actiheart group calibrated equations slightly to moderately underestimated (3 to 20%) AEE for the three exercise intensities (P<0.001). Accuracy of AEE estimation was greatly improved by individual calibration of the HR-AEE relationship (underestimation below 5% and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.79-0.93) compared to group calibration (ICC: 0.64-0.79).The Actiheart enables to assess AEE during high intensity running and cycling when the appropriate algorithm is applied. Since an underestimation was present for group calibration, an individual and sport-specific calibration should be performed when a high accuracy is required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691492>Epigenetic modification of H3K4 and oxidative stress are involved in MC-LR-induced apoptosis in testicular cells of SD rats.</a></h1><p>Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) is a cyclic heptapeptide, produced by aquatic cyanobacteria such as microcystis, with strong reproductive toxicity which poses greater threat to the reproductive abilities of humans and animals. By exploring the role of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and the role of oxidative stress in MC-LR-induced apoptosis in testicular Sertoli cells in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, this study indicated that MC-LR increased the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes by raising the levels of H3K4me3. 5'-Deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), the inhibitor of H3K4me3, reduced apoptosis, indicating for the first time that epigenetic modification is closely related to the testicular reproductive toxicity induced by MC-LR. MC-LR also induced oxidative stress by stimulating the generation of reactive  species (ROS), and subsequently triggering mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing the levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and so on. MC-LR-induced apoptosis of testicular cells could be decreased after pretreatment with oxidative stress inhibitor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Furthermore, the pathological damage to mitochondria and testes were observed in SD rats. These results show that MC-LR can induce apoptosis by raising the levels of H3K4me3, and pretreatment with MTA can ameliorate the MC-LR-induced apoptosis of cocultured cells by lowering the levels of H3K4me3. Furthermore, NAC has a protective effect on MC-LR-induced apoptosis of testicular cells in SD rats by inhibiting the oxidative stress.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694529>Increase of reactive  species contributes to growth inhibition by fluconazole in Cryptococcus neoformans.</a></h1><p>Cryptococcus neoformans, a basidiomycetous yeast, is a fungal pathogen that can colonize the lungs of humans causing pneumonia and fungal meningitis in severely immunocompromised individuals. Recent studies have implied that the antifungal drug fluconazole (FLC) can induce oxidative stress in C. neoformans by increasing the production of reactive  species (ROS), as presence of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) could reverse the inhibitory effects of FLC on C. neoformans. However, in Candida albicans, AA has been shown to stimulate the expression of genes essential for ergosterol biosynthesis. Hence, the contribution of ROS in FLC-mediated growth inhibition remains unclear.In order to determine whether counteracting ROS generated by FLC in C. neoformans can contribute to diminishing inhibitory effects of FLC, we tested three other antioxidants in addition to AA, namely, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), retinoic acid (RA), and glutathione (GSH). Our data confirm that there is an increase in ROS in the presence of FLC in C. neoformans. Importantly, all four antioxidants reversed FLC-mediated growth inhibition of C. neoformans to various extents. We further verified the involvement of increased ROS in FLC-mediated growth inhibition by determining that ROS-scavenging proteins, metallothioneins (CMT1 and CMT2), contribute to growth recovery by PDTC and AA during treatment with FLC.Our study suggests that ROS contributes to FLC-mediated growth inhibition and points to a complex nature of antioxidant-mediated growth rescue in the presence of FLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696699>Water-soluble, Zwitterionic Poly-photosensitizers as Carrier-free, Photosensitizer-Self-Delivery System for in Vivo Photodynamic Therapy.</a></h1><p>Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely established to deliver most of the hydrophobic chemo-drugs or photosensitizers (PSs) for cancer therapy. However, this strategy is usually hindered by the relatively low drug loading capacity and the undesired toxicity as well as the immunogenicity caused by the non-therapeutic, polymeric carriers. The carrier-free, drug self-delivery systems, in which the chemo-drugs or their prodrugs themselves formed the NPs without the addition of non-therapeutic carriers, have been extensively developed to achieve high drug loading capacity and low systemic toxicity. However, most of the driving forces to form the NPs were based on the strong hydrophobic interactions, which were the undesired forces for the porphyrin-based hydrophobic PSs due to the parasitic aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) effect. Herein, the zwitterionic, water-soluble and ROS cleavable poly-photosensitizers (pPS) were prepared by the polymerization method, which spontaneous introduced different charges associated with the "desired electrostatic effect" and reduced the "undesired aggregation" by separating the PS monomers using flexible and ROS cleavable linkers. The obtained pPS could self-assembled into the nano-complexes based on the electrostatic effect with high PS loading capacity, improved singlet  generation ability and efficient photo-toxicity. Upon PEG or HA coating on the surface, both pPS/PEG and pPS/HA complexes exhibited enhanced stability under physiological environments and excellent in vivo anti-tumor efficacy. Moreover, HA coated complexes also exhibited active tumor targeting. Such polymerization strategy comprehensively addressed the parasitic issues for the hydrophobic PSs self-delivery system in PDT area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692366>Breathing with fins: Do the pectoral fins of larval fishes play a respiratory role?</a></h1><p>Convective water flow across respiratory epithelia in water-breathing organisms maintains transcutaneous  (O) partial pressure (PO) gradients that drive O uptake. Following hatch, larval fishes lack a developed gill and the skin is the dominant site of gas transfer, yet few studies have addressed the contribution of convective water flow to cutaneous O uptake in larvae. We hypothesized that the pectoral fins, which can generate water flow across the skin in larvae, promote transcutaneous O transfer and thus aid in O uptake. In zebrafish (), the frequency of pectoral fin movements increased in response to hypoxia at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf), but the response was blunted by 15 dpf, when the gills become the dominant site of O uptake and was absent by 21 dpf. In rainbow trout (), PO measured at the skin surface of ventilating larvae was lower when the pectoral fins had been surgically removed, directly demonstrating that fins contribute to convective flow that dissipates cutaneous PO boundary layers. Lack of pectoral fins compromised whole animal O consumption in trout during hypoxia, but this effect was absent in zebrafish. Overall, our findings support a respiratory role of the pectoral fins in rainbow trout, but their involvement in zebrafish remains equivocal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696666>Combined effects of growth hormone and testosterone replacement treatment in heart failure.</a></h1><p>Although preliminary studies have demonstrated safety and effectiveness of single replacement therapy for growth hormone deficiency or testosterone deficiency in heart failure (HF), no data are available regarding the combined treatment with both GH and T in this setting. Thus, the aim of the present hypothesis generating pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of multiple hormonal replacement therapies in chronic HF.Five stable HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, with a concomitant diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency and testosterone deficiency, on top of guideline-based HF treatment underwent 1 year of GH replacement therapy by subcutaneous injections of somatotropin at a dose of 0.012 mg/kg every second day. After 12 months, a T replacement treatment was added at a dosage of 1000 mg every 3 months. Each patient underwent a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination, and an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer at baseline (BL), after 1 year of GH treatment (V1), and after 1 year of combined GH + T treatments (V2). One-year of GH treatment resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (+5.4%, P < 0.01), New York Heart Association functional class (P < 0.05), and peak  consumption (VO peak) (+19.3%, P < 0.01), and in a significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels (-35.1%, P < 0.01). Notably, one additional year of combined GH and T replacement therapy induced a further increase in VO peak (+27.7%, final delta change + 52.44%, P < 0.01), as well as a significant improvement in muscular strength, as assessed by handgrip dynamometry (+17.5%, final delta change + 25.8%, P < 0.01). These beneficial effects were paralleled with an improvement of the overall clinical status (as assessed by New York Heart Association class). Of note, neither adverse effects nor cardiovascular events were reported during the follow-up period.Our preliminary data suggest for the first time that combined replacement therapy with GH and T could be considered safe and therapeutic in HF patients with multiple hormone deficiencies, supporting the hypothesis that multiple hormone deficiencies syndrome can be considered as a novel and promising therapeutic target in HF.

Of late, the hybrid structures of graphene-transition metal (TM) or oxides were found to exhibit enhanced charge storage capacity. Herein, we report the charge storage performance of VGN-transition metal nanoparticle (Au, Ag, Cu, and Ni) hybrid electrodes. Amongst them, Ni-decorated VGN exhibited the highest enhancement, up to 3.04 mF cm-2 (121.6 F g-1) compared to 0.16 mF cm-2 (6.4 F g-1) for as-grown VGN. Further, this was corroborated by the improved electrical as well as ionic conductivity of the metal-decorated VGN structures. Additionally, the presence of metal--carbon bonding ensured a contribution of pseudocapacitance. Ab initio calculations elucidated the extent as well as the nature of charge (e-) transfer in TM nanoparticle-VGN hybrid structures. These findings are well corroborated with the charge storage performance. A combined effect from charge transfer and pseudocapacitance on the charge storage performance of TM nanoparticle-VGN hybrid electrodes is demonstrated.

Xanthine oxidase-derived ROS increased parasite-induced cytokine secretion and CD80 surface expression in DCs. This enhanced maturation phenotype boosted the DCs' ability to prime autologous naive CD4 T cells, resulting in higher T cell proliferation in vitro. Xanthine oxidase-derived ROS did not have an effect on the cytokines produced by primed T cells.

We find that EGFR expression levels differ between organoids derived from different donors, and recapitulate EGFR expression levels of patient material. EGFR expression levels were found to correlate with the response to EGFR-targeted PDT. Importantly, organoids grown from surrounding normal tissues showed lower EGFR expression levels than their tumor counterparts, and were not affected by the treatment. In general, nanobody-targeted PDT was more effective than antibody-targeted PDT. Taken together, patient-derived HNSCC organoids are a useful 3D model for testing in vitro targeted PDT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695757>Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 confers erlotinib resistance via facilitating the reactive  species-reactive carbonyl species metabolic pathway in lung adenocarcinomas.</a></h1><p> Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib is a major challenge to achieve an overall clinical benefit of the targeted therapy. Recently, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) induction has been found to render lung adenocarcinomas resistant to EGFR-TKIs, and targeting ALDH1A1 becomes a novel strategy to overcome resistance. However, the molecular mechanism underlying such effect remains poorly understood.  Comprehensive assays were performed in a panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and xenografts that acquired resistance to erlotinib. Cancer phenotype was evaluated by cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition analysis , tumorsphere formation analysis , and tumor growth and dissemination analysis . Reactive  species (ROS) and reactive carbonyl species (RCS) were detected based on fluorescent oxidation indicator and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, respectively. Protein target was suppressed by RNA interference and pharmacological inhibition or ecto-overexpressed by lentivirus-based cloning. Gene promoter activity was measured by dual-luciferase reporting assay.  Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ALDH1A1 overcame erlotinib resistance  and . ALDH1A1 overexpression was sufficient to induce erlotinib resistance. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated lower ROS-RCS levels in ALDH1A1-addicted, erlotinib-resistant cells; in line with this, key enzymes for metabolizing ROS and RCS, SOD2 and GPX4, respectively, were upregulated in these cells. Knockdown of SOD2 or GPX4 re-sensitized the resistant cells to erlotinib and the effect was abrogated by ROS-RCS scavenging and mimicked by ROS-RCS induction. The ALDH1A1 overexpressed cells, though resisted erlotinib, were more sensitive to SOD2 or GPX4 knockdown. The ALDH1A1 effect on erlotinib resistance was abrogated by ROS-RCS induction and mimicked by ROS-RCS scavenging. Detection of GPX4 and SOD2 expression and analysis of promoter activities of GPX4 and SOD2 under the condition of suppression or overexpression of ALDH1A1 demonstrated that the RCS-ROS-metabolic pathway was controlled by the ALDH1A1-GPX4-SOD2 axis. The ROS-RCS metabolic dependence mechanism in ALDH1A1-induced resistance was confirmed . Analysis of public databases showed that in patients undergoing chemotherapy, those with high co-expression of ALDH1A1, GPX4, and SOD2 had a lower probability of survival.  ALDH1A1 confers erlotinib resistance by facilitating the ROS-RCS metabolic pathway. ALDH1A1-induced upregulation of SOD2 and GPX4, as well as ALDH1A1 itself, mitigated erlotinib-induced oxidative and carbonyl stress, and imparted the TKI resistance. The elucidation of previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism underlying erlotinib resistance provides new insight into the biology of molecular targeted therapies and help to design improved pharmacological strategies to overcome the drug resistance.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692987>Regulation of Nrf2 Signaling.</a></h1><p>Regulation of antioxidant gene expression is essential for controlling oxidative stress and maintaining physiological homeostasis. In this context, the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been identified as the chief regulator of the transcription of diverse antioxidant genes as well as many other cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 activity is subjected to the regulation at various levels including protein stability, transcription, and post-transcription. Among the various regulatory pathways, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 axis is the most prominent regulator of Nrf2 activity. Being a tightly controlled transcriptional activator of antioxidant genes, Nrf2 signaling is intimately involved in health and disease. While Nrf2 is a protector against oxidative and electrophilic tissue injury, persistent activation of Nrf2 signaling may also contribute to disease pathophysiology, such as cancer progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694312>Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Cause for Accumulation of Reactive  Species During Pollen Abortion in Cytoplasmic Male-Sterile Kenaf Line 722HA.</a></h1><p>Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait used for hybrid production in plants, a novel kenaf CMS line 722HA was derived from the thermo-sensitive male-sterile mutant 'HMS' by recurrent backcrossing with 722HB. The line 722HA has great potential for hybrid breeding in kenaf. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls pollen abortion in 722HA remains unclear, thus limiting the full utilization of this line. To understand the possible mechanism governing pollen abortion in 722HA, cytological, transcriptomic, and biochemical analyses were carried out to compare the CMS line 722HA and its maintainer line 722HB. Cytological observations of the microspore development revealed premature degradation of the tapetum at the mononuclear stage, which resulted in pollen dysfunction. The k-means clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that these genes are related to processes associated with the accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), including electron transport chain, FF-ATPase proton transport, positive regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), hydrogen peroxide catabolic, and oxidation-reduction. Biochemical analysis indicated that ROS-scavenging capability was lower in 722HA than in 722HB, resulting in an accumulation of excess ROS, which is consistent with the transcriptome results. Taken together, these results demonstrate that excessive ROS accumulation may affect the normal development of microspores. Our study provides new insight into the molecular mechanism of pollen abortion in 722HA and will promote further studies of kenaf hybrids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695795>Endogenous  generating multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for enhanced photodynamic-photothermal therapy and multimodal imaging.</a></h1><p>Phototherapy, including photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), has been considered as a noninvasive option for cancer therapy. However, insufficient penetration depth, tumor hypoxia, and a single treatment method severely limit the effectiveness of treatment.  In this study, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform has been fabricated based on Au/Ag-MnO hollow nanospheres (AAM HNSs). The Au/Ag alloy HNSs were first synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction and then the MnO nanoparticles were deposited on the Au/Ag alloy HNSs by the reaction between Ag and permanganate (KMnO), finally obtained the AAM HNSs. Then, SH-PEG was modified on the surface of AAM HNSs by the interaction of sulfhydryl and Au/Ag alloy, which improved the dispersibility and biocompatibility of the HNS. Next, the PDT photosensitizer Ce6 was loaded into AAM HNSs, benefiting from the hollow interior of the structure, and the AAM-Ce6 HNSs were obtained.  The AAM HNSs exhibit broad absorption at the near infrared (NIR) biological window and remarkable photothermal conversion ability in the NIR-II window. The MnO nanoparticles can catalyze endogenous HO to generate O and enhance the therapeutic effect of PDT on tumor tissue. Simultaneously, MnO nanoparticles intelligently respond to the tumor microenvironment and degrade to release massive Mn ions, which introduce magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) properties. When AAM-Ce6 HNSs are loaded with Ce6, the AAM-Ce6 HNSs can be used for triple-modal imaging (fluorescence/photoacoustic/magnetic resonance imaging, FL/PAI/MRI) guided combination tumor phototherapy (PTT/PDT).  This multifunctional nanoplatform shows synergistic therapeutic efficacy better than any single therapy by achieving multimodal imaging guided cancer combination phototherapy, which are promising for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692944>Potential for therapeutic use of hydrogen sulfide in oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h1><p>Oxidative phosphorylation is a source of energy production by which many cells satisfy their energy requirements. Endogenous reactive  species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial metabolism. Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, α-synuclein (α-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (HS), which also acts through the potassium (K/K) ion channel and calcium (Ca) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of HS is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize HO-induced oxidative damage in mitochondria. The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of HS to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696129>Reperfusion Microvascular Ischemia After Prolonged Coronary Occlusion: Implications And Treatment With Local Supersaturated  Delivery.</a></h1><p>Following a prolonged coronary arterial occlusion, heterogeneously scattered, focal regions of low erythrocyte flow are commonly found throughout the reperfused myocardium. Experimental studies have also demonstrated the presence of widespread, focally patchy regions of microvascular ischemia during reperfusion (RMI). However, the potential contribution of RMI to tissue viability and function has received little attention in the absence of practical clinical methods for its detection. In this review, the anatomic/functional basis of RMI is summarized, along with the evidence for its presence in reperfused myocardium. Advances in microcirculation research related to obstructive responses of vascular endothelial cells and blood elements to the effects of hypoxia and low shear stress are discussed, and a potential cycle of intensification of RMI from such responses and progressive loss of functional capillary density is presented. In capillaries with impaired erythrocyte flow, compensatory increases in the delivery of , because of its low solubility in plasma, are effective only at high partial pressures. As discussed herein, attenuation of the cycle with  at hyperbaric levels in plasma is, very likely, responsible for improved tissue level perfusion noted experimentally. Observed clinical benefits from intracoronary SuperSaturated  (SSO) delivery, including infarct size reduction, can be attributed to attenuation of RMI with improvement in microvascular blood flow.© 2019 Spears.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696673>Oxidative Cyclization-Induced Activation of a Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Inhibitor for Enhanced Selectivity of Cancer Chemotherapeutics.</a></h1><p>In this work, we designed a prodrug that reacts with cellular oxidative equivalents leading to ether cleavage and cyclization to release an active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. We show that the compound reduces affinity for PI3KA relative to the PI3K inhibitor, is slow to intercellularly oxidize, and is resistant to liver microsomes. We observed modest activity in untreated acute myeloid leukemia cells and 14-fold selectivity relative to non-cancerous cells. The cellular activity of the compound can be modulated by the addition of antioxidants or oxidants, indicating the compound activity is sensitive to cellular reactive  species (ROS) state. Co-treatment with cytosine arabinoside or doxorubicin was used to activate the compound inside cells. We observed strong synergistic activity specifically in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cancer cells with an increase in selective anticancer activity of up to 90-fold. Thus, these new self-cyclizing compounds can be used to increase the selectivity of anticancer agents.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Trauma to the vaginal vasculature might limit the delivery of  to the surgical wound, which may negatively affect wound healing and regeneration of connective tissue. This possibly increases the future risk of recurrence. We aimed to determine the effects of vaginal prolapse surgery on the microcirculation of the vaginal wall.We evaluated the vaginal microcirculation in healthy participants without known vascular disease undergoing anterior and/or posterior colporrhaphy. We used incident dark-field imaging for in vivo assessment before and after (1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks) surgery. We studied perfusion (microvascular flow index [MFI]), angioarchitecture (morphology/layout of microvessels) and capillary density.Ten women were included. Interindividual differences were observed 1 day postoperatively with regard to perfusion and angioarchitecture. Microvascular flow at the surgical site was absent or significantly reduced in some participants, whereas normal microvascular flow was observed in others (MFI range 0-3). Perfusion and angioarchitecture had been restored in all participants after 6 weeks (MFI range 2-3), regardless of the extent of vascular trauma 1 day postoperatively.The difference in the extent of vascular trauma between women undergoing seemingly identical surgical procedures suggests that some individuals are more susceptible to vascular trauma than others. Delivery of  to the wound and subsequent wound healing may be compromised in these cases, which could be related to the development of anatomical recurrence. Future studies should investigate whether there is a relationship between the vaginal microvasculature and the recurrence of prolapse.© 2019 The Authors.

Over the past few decades, flexible zinc-air batteries (FZABs), characterized by their extremely high theoretical energy density from consuming  in air and low cost, have been regarded as one of the most promising power supplies. However, their unique half-open structure poses great challenges for the environmental stability of their components, including the electrolyte and electrodes. As an important ionic conductor, the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-KOH gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) has been widely utilized in FZABs. To date, most studies have focused on investigations of the electrode, electrocatalyst materials and battery configuration, while very few have paid attention to the influence of the environment on the electrolyte and the corresponding FZAB performance. Herein, for the first time, the environmental stability of PVA-KOH GPE, such as dimensional stability and water and ionic conductivity retention capability, for FZABs in ambient air has been thoroughly studied. Moreover, the properties of the assembled FZABs in terms of cycling stability, discharge performance and power output are investigated. This report aims to play a leading role in examining the environmental stability of electrolytes in FZABs, which is critical for their practical applications.Copyright © 2019 Fan, Liu, Ding, Deng, Han, Hu and Zhong.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695422>Methyloleanolate Induces Apoptotic And Autophagic Cell Death Via Reactive  Species Generation And c-Jun N-terminal Kinase Phosphorylation.</a></h1><p>To develop a potent anticancer agent similar to oleanolate, the underlying mechanisms of its derivative, methyloleanolate, in the apoptosis and autophagy of A549 and H1299 cells were elucidated.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of methyloleanolate in inducing apoptotic and autophagic cell death in cancer cells.Flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V/PI staining, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted in A549 and H1299 cells.Methyloleanolate increased the fraction of Annexin V/PI apoptotic cells and activated caspase-8, caspase-3, and death receptor 5 (DR5) more than oleanolate in A549 and H1299 cells pretreated with pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and DR5 depletion. Also, methyloleanolate induced autophagic features of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 3BII (LC3BII) conversion and puncta in A549 and H1299 cells, along with autophagosomes and vacuoles. Methyloleanolate blocked autophagy flux for impaired autophagy and chloroquine (CQ)-enhanced microtubule-associated protein LC3BII accumulation and cytotoxicity in A549 and H1299 cells, although 3-methyladenine (3-MA) did not. Interestingly, LC3BII accumulation was detected only in methyloleanolate-treated autophagy-related gene 5 () mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells but not in   MEF cells. Methyloleanolate reduced p-mTOR but activated p-c-Jun N-terminal kinases and reactive  species production in A549 and H1299 cells. Conversely, n-acetyl-l-cysteine and SP600125 blocked apoptotic and autophagic cascades caused by methyloleanolate in A549 and H1299 cells.Overall, the findings suggest that methyloleanolate induces apoptotic and autophagic cell death in non-small cell lung cancers via reactive  species generation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation.© 2019 Jeong et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695344>The effects of exercise and diet program in overweight people - Nordic walking versus walking.</a></h1><p>Nordic walking (NW) has been recommended as a form of exercise for clinical populations. Despite intervention programs designed to face a clinical status may last several months, no longitudinal studies have compared the effect of NW to another usual form of exercise, like walking (W). We evaluated the effects of diet combined with a long-supervised NW versus W training on body composition, aerobic capacity and strength in overweight adults.Thirty-eight participants, randomized into a NW (n=19, 66±7 years, body mass index (BMI) 33±5)) and a W (n=19, 66±8 years, BMI 32±5) group, followed a diet and a supervised training routine 3 times/week for 6 months. The variables assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months were: anthropometric indexes (ie, BMI and waist circumference (WC)), body composition, aerobic capacity ( consumption (VO), peak power output (PPO), 6-min walking test (6MWT)) and strength (maximal voluntary contraction of biceps brachialis (MVC) and quadriceps femoris (MVC), chair stand and arm curl (AC)).After 6 months both NW and W group decreased significantly BMI (6% and 4%, respectively) and WC (8% and 4%, respectively), but only the NW group reduced (<0.05) total body fat (8%), android fat (14%) and leg fat (9%). After 6 months, PPO increased (<0.05) in both groups, but VO improved (<0.05) only in the NW group (8%). After 6 months, 6MWT increased (<0.001) in both groups and only the NW group improved (<0.05) in MVC (14%), MVC (17%) and AC (35%).Our results suggest that NW can give in some relevant health parameters, greater and faster benefits than W.

The brain is central in both behavioural and physiological responses to threatening stimuli and, given its tight metabolic and haemodynamic requirements, is particularly susceptible to environmental stress. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF, duplex ultrasound), cerebral  delivery (CDO ), oesophageal temperature, and arterial blood gases during exposure to three commonly experienced environmental stressors - heat, cold and hypoxia - in isolation, and in combination. Twelve healthy male subjects (27 ± 11 years) underwent core cooling by 1.0 °C and core heating by 1.5 °C in randomized order at sea-level; acute hypoxia (PetO  = 50 mmHg) was imposed at baseline and at each thermal extreme. Core cooling and heating protocols were repeated after 16 ± 4 days residing at 4330m to investigate any interactions with high altitude acclimatization. Cold stress decreased CBF by 20-30% and CDO by 12-19% (both p<0.01) irrespective of altitude, whereas heating did not reliably change either CBF or CDO (both p>0.08). The increases in CBF with acute hypoxia during thermal stress were appropriate to maintain CDO at normothermic, normoxic values. Reaction time was faster and slower by 6-9% with heating and cooling, respectively (both p<0.01), but central (brain) processes were not impaired by any combination of environmental stressors. These findings highlight the powerful influence of core cooling in reducing CDO . Despite these large reductions in CDO with cold stress, gross indices of cognition remained stable.

Herein, we describe the successful preparation of Cu2WS4 nanocrystals (CWS NCs) with excellent antibacterial activity. CWS NCs with small size (~20 nm) achieve more than 5 log (>99.999%) inactivation efficiency of both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (E. coli, Gram-negative) at low concentration (<2 μg mL-1) with or without ambient light, which is much better than most of the reported antibacterial nanomaterials (including Ag, TiO2, etc.) and even better than the widely used antibiotics (vancomycin and daptomycin). Antibacterial mechanism study showed that CWS NCs have both enzyme-like (oxidase and peroxidase) properties and selective bacteria-binding ability, which greatly facilitate the production of reactive  species (ROS) to kill bacteria. Animal experiments further indicated that CWS NCs can effectively treat methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infected wounds.

The aim of the present study was to determine the importance of brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT) NAD metabolism in regulating whole-body thermogenesis and energy metabolism. Accordingly, we generated and analyzed adipocyte-specific nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase () knockout (ANKO) and brown adipocyte-specific  knockout (BANKO) mice because NAMPT is the rate-limiting NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We found ANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in both BAT and WAT, had impaired gene programs involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function in BAT and a blunted thermogenic (rectal temperature, BAT temperature, and whole-body  consumption) response to acute cold exposure, prolonged fasting, and administration of β-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and CL-316243). In addition, the absence of NAMPT in WAT markedly reduced adrenergic-mediated lipolytic activity, likely through inactivation of the NAD-SIRT1-caveolin-1 axis, which limits an important fuel source fatty acid for BAT thermogenesis. These metabolic abnormalities were rescued by treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which bypasses the block in NAD synthesis induced by NAMPT deficiency. Although BANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in BAT only, had BAT cellular alterations similar to the ANKO mice, BANKO mice had normal thermogenic and lipolytic responses. We also found  expression in supraclavicular adipose tissue (where human BAT is localized) obtained from human subjects increased during cold exposure, suggesting our finding in rodents could apply to people. These results demonstrate that adipose NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis is essential for regulating adaptive thermogenesis, lipolysis, and whole-body energy metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694310>Clinical Response to Personalized Exercise Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Reduced Ejection Fraction is Accompanied by Skeletal Muscle Histological Alterations.</a></h1><p> Heart failure (HF) is associated with skeletal muscle wasting and exercise intolerance. This study aimed to evaluate the exercise-induced clinical response and histological alterations. One hundred and forty-four HF patients were enrolled. The individual training program was determined as a workload at or close to the lactate threshold (LT1); clinical data were collected before and after 12 weeks/6 months of training. The muscle biopsies from eight patients were taken before and after 12 weeks of training: histology analysis was used to evaluate muscle morphology. Most of the patients demonstrated a positive response after 12 weeks of the physical rehabilitation program in one or several parameters tested, and 30% of those showed improvement in all four of the following parameters:  uptake (VO2) peak, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), exercise tolerance (ET), and quality of life (QOL); the walking speed at LT1 after six months of training showed a significant rise. Along with clinical response, the histological analysis detected a small but significant decrease in both fiber and endomysium thickness after the exercise training course indicating the stabilization of muscle mechanotransduction system. Together, our data show that the beneficial effect of personalized exercise therapy in HF patients depends, at least in part, on the improvement in skeletal muscle physiological and biochemical performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692991>Preparation of a Novel Phosphorus-Nitrogen Containing Novolac Curing Agent for Epoxy Resin and flame-retardancy of its cured epoxy resin.</a></h1><p>In this study, DICY (dicyandiamide)-containing novolac (NN) was first prepared, and then DOPO (9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide) was introduced to react with the unsaturated bonds from DICY to obtain a novel phosphorus-nitrogen-containing novolac resin (PNN), which was used as a curing agent for epoxy resins.

As the global biodiversity crisis deepens, successful conservation efforts will hinge on developing mechanistic multiple stressor frameworks that have been ground-truthed in natural systems containing complex species dynamics and ecological processes. Our study examined the combined and interacting effects of potential climate and land use stressors on boreal stream fishes using data from over 300 catchments across a broad 250,000 km region. To characterize boreal fish community health, we examined four indicators including species richness, total catch per unit effort, the proportion of lithophilic spawners (fish sensitive to sedimentation), and the assemblage tolerance index which provides a measurement of the overall community tolerance to disturbance. Land use stressors included total anthropogenic land use area and linear disturbance at multiple watershed scales as well as two site-specific habitat degradation indicators (dissolved  and the proportion of fine substrate). Overall community richness and productivity were not negatively related to land use changes indicating potential compensatory dynamics (e.g. where intolerant species are replaced with more tolerant species as habitat quality degrades). In contrast, we observed declines for sensitive species, including highly valued salmonids, that varied depending on interactions between local climate, land use, and stream type. Sensitive species declines were concentrated in regions experiencing increased land use and warming, whereas increases were observed in cooler regions consistent with a subsidy-stress response. In addition, lithophilic spawners declined in watersheds experiencing warmer and wetter conditions owing to potential indirect effects on spawning habitat quality. Results from our study provide novel insight into complex climate and land use interactions occurring across a broad, real-world landscape, and highlight the potential for amplified species declines under future warming and land use scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a broad library of functionally diverse multi-porphyrin arrays that incorporate the non-traditional rigid linker groups cubane and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) is described. A robust, reliable, and versatile synthetic procedure was employed to access porphyrin-cubane/BCP-porphyrin arrays, representing the largest non-polymeric structures available for cubane/BCP derivatives. These reactions demonstrate considerable substrate scope, from utilization of small phenyl moieties to large porphyrin rings, with varying lengths and different angles. To control conformational flexibility, amide bonds were introduced between the bridgehead carbon of BCP/cubane and the porphyrin rings. Through varying the orientation of the substituents around the amide bond of cubane/BCP, different intermolecular interactions were identified through single crystal X-ray analysis. These studies revealed non-covalent interactions that are the first-of-their-kind including a unique iodine- interaction between cubane units. These supramolecular architectures indicate the possibility to mimic a protein structure due to the sp 3 rigid scaffolds (BCP or cubane) that exhibit the essential conformational space for protein function while simultaneously providing amide bonds for molecular recognition.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Hydrogen spillover is a catalytic process that occurs by surface reaction and subsequent diffusion between gas and correlated oxides, but the mechanism and surface chemistry at the surface of correlated oxides with metal catalyst are not well understood. Here we show that a significant amount of  is released from the surface of correlated VO films during hydrogen spillover for the first time, contrary to the well-established observation of the formation of hydrogen interstitials in the bulk part of VO films. By using ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we prove that the formation of surface  vacancies during hydrogen spillover is a consequence of a favorable reaction for the generation of weakly-adsorbed HO from surface O atoms that have low coordination and weak binding strength. Our results reveal the importance of in-situ characterization to prove the dynamic change near the surface during redox reaction, and presents opportunity to control intrinsic defects at the surface that are different from those in the bulk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695621>Two Weeks of High-Intensity Interval Training in Combination With a Non-thermal Diffuse Ultrasound Device Improves Lipid Profile and Reduces Body Fat Percentage in Overweight Women.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative strategy which combined low-frequency ultra sound (LOFU) with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve physical fitness and promote body fat loss in overweight sedentary women. A placebo controlled, parallel group randomized experimental design was used to investigate the efficacy of a 2-week combined LOFU and HIIT program (3 sessions per week). Participants were allocated into either the Experimental HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10) or Placebo HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10). Baseline exercise testing (maximal  uptake, lower limb strength and substrate oxidation test), dietary assessment, anthropometric measures and blood sampling were completed in week 1 and repeated in week 4 to determine changes following the program (Post-HIIT). During each training session, the HIIT and HIIT groups wore a non-thermal diffuse ultrasound belt. However, the belt was only switched on for the HIIT group. Delta change scores were calculated for body weight, body fat percentage (Fat%), muscle mass,  O , hip and waist circumferences, and all lipid variables from Baseline to Post-HIIT. Statistical analysis was completed using a repeated-measures factorial analysis of variance by group (HIIT and HIIT) and time (Baseline and Post-HIIT). Results showed significant improvements in maximal  uptake (HIIT; Baseline 24.7 ± 5.4 mL kg min, Post-HIIT 28.1 ± 5.5 mL kg min and HIIT; Baseline 28.4 ± 5.9 mL kg min, Post-HIIT 31.4 ± 5.5 mL kg min) for both groups. Significant decreases in Fat% (HIIT; Baseline 32.7 ± 3.2%, Post-HIIT 28.9 ± 3.5% and HIIT; Baseline 28.9 ± 3.5%, Post-HIIT 28.9 ± 3.4% kg), waist circumference (HIIT; Baseline 95.8 ± 9.6 cm, Post-HIIT 89.3 ± 8.9 cm and HIIT; Baseline 104.3 ± 3.5 cm, Post-HIIT 103.6 ± 3.4 cm) and triglycerides (HIIT; -29.2%, HIIT; -6.7%) were observed in the HIIT group only. These results show that HIIT combined with LOFU was an effective intervention to improve body composition, lipid profile, and fitness. This combined strategy allowed overweight, sedentary women to achieve positive health outcomes in as little as 2 weeks.Copyright © 2019 Hausswirth, Marquet, Nesi and Slattery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690919>Singlet  partition between the outer-, inner- and membrane-phases of photo/chemotherapeutic liposomes.</a></h1><p>Liposomes carrying membrane-embedded porphyrin-phospholipid (PoP) are capable of chemo- and photo-therapeutic modes of action, which make them a potential candidate material for next-generation cancer treatments. This study examines singlet  (1O2) production and release by PoP liposomes carrying either no chemotherapeutic cargo (EMPTY), or those carrying either doxorubicin (DOX) or irinotecan (IRT) chemotherapy drugs. Herein, we developed a strategy to quantify the fraction of 1O2 lifetime spent in the three distinct local liposomal environments by obtaining four key pieces of information for each system: average 1O2 deactivation rate constants (kΔ) for liposome suspensions in H2O and in D2O solvents, as well as the absolute and the apparent 1O2 production quantum yields (ΦΔ). Despite the characteristic differences in their photophysical behavior, namely in ΦΔ values, all three formulations of PoP liposomes were found to carry out 1O2 release in a similar manner. It was found that >80% of all sensitized 1O2 from the ensemble of PoP liposomes deactivates within the nanostructures themselves, with the largest portion (∼50%) deactivating in the lipid membrane specifically. Based on these findings, we conclude that the current design of the PoP liposomes is well suited for light-induced chemotherapeutic drug release. Importantly, the 1O2 partition quantification approach reported herein has potential to be a tool for characterizing nanoparticulate light-activated chemo- and phototherapeutic systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692317>Elucidating the Dynamic Nature of Fuel Cell Electrodes as a Function of Conditioning: An Ex-situ Materials Characterization and In-situ Electrochemical Diagnostic Study.</a></h1><p>To increase the commercialization of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), it is imperative to improve the activity and performance of electrocatalysts through combined efforts focused on materials characterization and device level integration. Obtaining fundamental insights into the ongoing structural and compositional changes of electrocatalysts in-operando is crucial for not only transitioning an electrode from its as-prepared to functional state, also known as "conditioning"- but also for establishing intrinsic electrochemical performances . Here, we investigated several ORR electrocatalysts in-operando via in situ and ex situ characterization techniques to provide fundamental insights into the interfacial phenomena occurring on the catalyst surface that enable peak  reduction reaction mass activity and high current density performance. A mechanistic understanding of a fuel cell conditioning procedure is described - which encompasses voltage cycling and subsequent voltage recovery steps at low potential holds performed at a relative humidity above saturation). In particular, Ex situ MEA characterization using transmission electron microscopy and Ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) were performed for determining changes in carbon and Pt particle size, morphology and surface impurities, and In situ electrochemical diagnostics were performed either during or after specific points in the testing protocol to determine the electrochemical and interfacial changes occurring on the catalyst surface responsible for  transport resistances through ionomer films during operation. The results demonstrate that voltage cycling (break-in) step aids in the removal of sulfate and fluoride and reduces non-Fickian  transport resistances, especially for catalysts where Pt is located within the pores of the carbon support. Subsequent low voltage holds at low temperature and oversaturated conditions, i.e. voltage recovery (VR) cycles, serve to improve mass activities by a factor of two to three, through a combined removal of contaminants, surface-blocking species (i.e. oxides), and rearrangement of the catalyst atomic structure (i.e., Pt-Pt and Pt-Co coordination).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695732>Anaemia and transfusion triggers in critically ill patients - What we have learnt thus far.</a></h1><p>Anaemia is a common finding in critically ill patients, the cause of which is multi-factorial including: sepsis, haemolysis (and disseminated intravascular coagulation), iatrogenic blood loss secondary to laboratory sampling, post-operative anaemia, bone marrow suppression/failure, decreased production of erythropoietin, anaemia secondary to drugs/toxins, overt or occult blood loss, functional iron deficiency, poor nutrition and haemodilution. Anaemia is associated with deleterious outcomes including increased risk of cardiac-related morbidity and mortality and decrease in -carrying capacity in the face of increased metabolic demands. There is a growing body of evidence, which demonstrates that packed red blood cell transfusions are associated with poorer outcomes. Clinicians therefore need to weigh the potential benefit of treating anaemia against the desire to avoid unnecessary transfusions. We explored current literature regarding transfusion triggers and morbidity and mortality associated with packed red blood cell transfusions transfusion, concentrating on studies that have been conducted in critical care patients. In addition, we reflected on trials which considered the viability of iron transfusion and erythropoietin in critically unwell patients.© The Intensive Care Society 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694161>Circulating Metabolites Originating from Gut Microbiota Control Endothelial Cell Function.</a></h1><p>Cardiovascular functionality strictly depends on endothelial cell trophism and proper biochemical function. Any condition (environmental, pharmacological/toxicological, physical, or neuro-humoral) that changes the vascular endothelium has great consequences for the organism's wellness and on the outcome and evolution of severe cardiovascular pathologies. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms, both endogenous and external, that affect endothelial dysfunction is pivotal to preventing and treating these disorders. In recent decades, significant attention has been focused on gut microbiota and how these symbiotic microorganisms can influence host health and disease development. Indeed, dysbiosis has been reported to be at the base of a range of different pathologies, including pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The study of the mechanism underlying this relationship has led to the identification of a series of metabolites (released by gut bacteria) that exert different effects on all the components of the vascular system, and in particular on endothelial cells. The imbalance of factors promoting or blunting endothelial cell viability and function and angiogenesis seems to be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the circulating factors identified to date, either directly produced by gut microbes or resulting from the metabolism of diet derivatives as polyphenols.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693801>Cigarette smoke extract inhibits cell migration and contraction via the reactive  species/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway in nasal fibroblasts.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast migration plays a significant role in wound healing after endoscopic sinonasal surgery. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is a potent inhibitor of fibroblast functions including cell proliferation and migration. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of CSE on migration and collagen gel contraction in nasal fibroblasts and investigate its underlying mechanisms.Fibroblast migration was evaluated using wound healing assay and transwell migration assay. Contractile activity was assessed by collagen gel contraction assay. Reactive  species (ROS) were quantified by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Fibroblasts were treated with CSE and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), metformin, compound C, or transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression. AMPK activation was determined by Western blot.CSE and metformin were found to significantly reduce the migration and collagen gel contraction activity of nasal fibroblasts. Conversely, pretreatment with NAC and compound C significantly enhanced the migration and collagen gel contraction activity of fibroblasts. ROS production and AMPK phosphorylation were found to be significantly induced by CSE treatment, whereas the activity was inhibited on treatment with NAC, metformin, compound C, or AMPK siRNA. Silencing of AMPK expression was found to significantly reverse the suppressive effect of CSE in nasal fibroblasts.CSE has an inhibitory effect on cell migration and collagen gel contraction activity via the ROS/AMPK signaling pathway in nasal fibroblasts.© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691623>Video-assisted thoracoscopic total thymectomy: two-lung ventilation with artificial pneumothorax.</a></h1><p> Double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLET) and one-lung ventilation (OLV) have been generally accepted as the classic anesthetic method in video-assisted thoracoscopic total thymectomy (VATT). However, there are still some disadvantages of DLET. Two-lung ventilation (TLV) with single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLET) is considered to be an alternative in VATT to avoid these disadvantages. This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of TLV in VATT by comparing it with OLV cases. We retrospectively screened 198 patients who received TLV unilateral thoracic incision VATT and 117 patients who received OLV unilateral thoracic incision VATT. Perioperative data were analyzed, including surgical variables, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, and postoperative complications and hospital stay. No significant differences with regard to operative time ( = .146), postoperative hospital stay ( = .553), complications ( = .254), hemodynamic parameters and pulse  saturation (SpO) were found between TLV group and OLV group. However, end-tidal CO (EtCO) was higher in TLV group at 15 min (39.95 ± 5.03 vs 38.70 ± 4.57,  = .021) and 30 min (41.91 ± 5.50 vs 38.91 ± 4.51,  < .001) after initiation of the operation.

Ginger plants were grown in soil containing 500 mg/kg Pb(NO) without (CK) or with Si, Se, or microorganism fertilizer (T1, T2, T3) as soil conditioners. Morphology indexes, Pb accumulation and distribution rates, and antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated. The Pb transfer and Pb absorption coefficients were calculated, and Pb accumulation in plant organs at various developmental stages were determined. All three soil conditioners alleviated Pb stress in ginger plants. The rhizome fresh weight in T1, T2, and T3 was increased by 96.06, 85.81, and 41.58%, respectively, compared with CK. The accumulation of Pb in organs was lower in all treatments than in CK. The chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in leaves, and root activity, root length, and the tolerance index, were higher in the treatments than in CK. The reactive  species content in ginger leaves and roots was significantly lower in all treatments than in CK. Soil conditioners alleviated the negative effects of Pb stress on ginger plants: Si was the most effective, followed by Se, and then the microorganism fertilizer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This study retrospectively reviews our experience with surgery in adult patients with FSV.From January 2008 to September 2017, 65 adult patients with FSV underwent surgery in our hospital. Twenty underwent Blalock-Taussig shunt or bidirectional Glenn procedures in other hospitals prior, and four were lost to follow-up. Finally, 41 patients were included in this study.The early postoperative mortality was 7.3% (3/41). Postoperative systemic arterial  saturation (SpO , 83.7% ± 4.8%) was significantly higher than preoperative SpO (77.9% ± 10.1%, P < .01). The mean follow-up time was 3.9 ± 3.1 years (range 1-11 years). There was only one case of late mortality and massive hemoptysis was the cause of death. Right ventricular morphology and severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) were the risk factors of postoperative death for patients with pulmonary stenosis(PS). There was no death case in patients who received Fontan procedure. In a follow-up, we found the grade of AVVR was reduced and the grade of heart function (New York Heart Association) was improved.Adult patients with FSV can also undergo surgery. The mortality was acceptable and late results were satisfactory. After surgery,  saturations increased, grades of AVVR decreased and the heart functions improved.

However, they have evolved a self-defense system whereby reactive  and nitrogen species (RONS) act as double-edged swords by imposing (at higher concentration) and mitigating (at lower concentration) environmental stress. Cold plasma is emerging as a feasible option to produce a variety of RONS in a controlled manner when amalgamate with water. Cold plasma activated/treated water (PAW) contains a variety of RONS at concentrations, which may help to activate the plant's defense system components. In the present study, we examine the effect of cold atmospheric-air jet plasma exposure (15 min, 30 min, and 60 min) on the water's RONS level, as well as the impact of PAW irrigation, (assigned as 15PAW, 30PAW, and 60PAW) on tomato seedlings growth and defense response. We found that PAW irrigation (priming) upregulate seedlings growth, endogenous RONS, defense hormone (salicylic acid and jasmonic acid), and expression of key pathogenesis related (PR) gene. 30 min PAW contains RONS at concentrations which can induce non-toxic signaling. The present study suggests that PAW irrigation can be beneficial for agriculture as it modulates plant growth as well as immune response components.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691421>High-flow  therapy: Conclusion after adventures in the jungle of abbreviations.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697939>Experimental infection by Neospora caninum in gerbil reduces activity of enzymes involved in energy metabolism.</a></h1><p>Neospora caninum is a protozoan that has tropism for the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to determine whether experimental infection of gerbils would interfere with activity of enzymes associated with energy metabolism. We randomized 20 gerbils into two groups (ten animals per group): the control group (healthy animals; uninfected) and the infected group (experimentally infected with dose 7.8 x 10 tachyzoites of N. caninum per gerbil). On day six and twelve post-infection (PI), brain and spleen tissues were collected for biochemical and histopathological analyses. No histopathological lesions were observed in the brains of infected animals; however, inflammatory infiltrates were found in the spleen. Significantly greater levels of reactive  species (ROS) were observed in the brain and spleen of infected gerbils than in the control group at 12 days PI. Cytosolic creatine kinase (CK-CYT), mitochondrial creatine kinase (CK-MIT), and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were lower in the brains of infected gerbils than in those of the control group on day 12 PI. There was significantly less CK-CYT activity in the spleens of infected gerbils on day 6 and 12 PI. Finally, there was significantly less sodium-potassium ion pump (Na/K ATPase) activity in the brains and spleens of infected gerbils on day 12 PI. These data suggest that experimental infection with N. caninum interfered with energy metabolism associated with ATP homeostasis in the brain and spleen, directly or indirectly, apparently mediated by ROS overproduction, contributing to inhibition of Na/K ATPase activity.Copyright © 2019.

The human Golgi Anti-Apoptotic Protein (hGAAP, also known as TMBIM4) is a highly conserved Golgi cation channel that modulates intracellular Ca fluxes. Human GAAP is expressed in all human tissues, is essential for cell viability and provides resistance against a range of apoptotic stresses. Furthermore, hGAAP enhances adhesion and cell migration by increasing the turnover of focal adhesions due to activation of store-operated Ca entry. Here, we describe a GA-derived mechanism that controls cell invasion. The overexpression of hGAAP stimulates 3-dimensional proteolytic cell invasion by a mechanism that is dependent on the accumulation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide which might be produced by the hGAAP-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide new insight into the complex mechanisms by which Ca and reactive  species signaling contribute to cell invasion and to the role of the GA in these processes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The present study investigates the influence of varying biochar dose (2.5, 5, and 10% on a weight basis) on the maturity of compost and heavy metals during vermicomposting of vegetable waste using epigeic earthworm. Biochar amendment notably enhanced the electrical conductivity (up to 2.7 mS/cm), nitrogen content (up to 3.1%), NO-N (up to 630 mg/kg) and nutritional value. The heavy metals,  uptake rate (below 0.96 mg/g VS/day) and CO evolution rate (below 1 mg/g VS/day) were attenuated along with degradation of complex organic crystals as observed in powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) spectra. Furthermore, biochar aid in reducing pathogens (below 1.1 × 10 MPN/g dry weight) as inferred from the Most Probable Number (MPN) results as well as degrading the complex organics into simpler compounds as revealed from the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra. The present study inferred that the vegetable waste was biologically stabilized through biochar amendment during vermicomposting process with improved nutritional and physico-chemical properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It describes a bioengineering software solution, which is explored for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae fed-batch cultures. The experimental investigation of both cultures presents experimental validation results since the start of the bioprocess, i.e. since the injection of inoculant solution into bioreactor. In total, four strains were analyzed, and 21 experiments were performed under varying bioprocess conditions, out of which 7 experiments were carried out with dosed substrate feeding. Development of the microorganisms' culture invariant generic estimator of biomass concentration was the main goal of this research.The results show that stoichiometric parameters provide acceptable knowledge on the state of biomass concentrations during the whole cultivation process, including the exponential growth phase of both E. coli and S. cerevisiae cultures. The cell culture stoichiometric parameters are estimated by a procedure based on the Luedeking/Piret-model and maximization of entropy. The main input signal of the approach is cumulative  uptake rate at fed-batch cultivation processes. The developed noninvasive biomass estimation procedure was intentionally made to not depend on the selection of corresponding bioprocess/bioreactor parameters.The precision errors, since the bioprocess start, when inoculant was injected to a bioreactor, confirmed that the approach is relevant for online biomass state estimation. This included the lag and exponential growth phases for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae. The suggested estimation procedure is identical for both cultures. This approach improves the precision achieved by other authors without compromising the simplicity of the implementation. Moreover, the suggested approach is a candidate method to be the microorganisms' culture invariant approach. It does not depend on any numeric initial optimization conditions, it does not require any of bioreactor parameters. No numeric stability issues of convergence occurred during multiple performance tests. All this makes this approach a potential candidate for industrial tasks with adaptive feeding control or automatic inoculations when substrate feeding profile and bioreactor parameters are not provided.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690891>Carbon nitride as a heterogeneous visible-light photocatalyst for the Minisci reaction and coupling to H production.</a></h1><p>Cyanamide functionalised carbon nitride powder is reported as a photocatalyst for direct Minisci-type coupling of heteroarenes with ethers, alcohols, and amides using atmospheric  as the oxidant at room temperature.

Using high-resolution, in situ DO time-series collected over the course of a year in a novel marine ecosystem (Jellyfish Lake, Palau), we show that DO declined throughout the marine lake and subsequently recovered in the upper water column. These shifts were accompanied by variations in water temperature and were correlated to changes in wind, precipitation, and especially sea surface height that occurred during the 2015-2016 El Niño-Southern Oscillation event. Multiple approaches used to calculate rates of community respiration, net community production, and gross primary production from DO changes showed that DO consumption and production did not accelerate nor collapse; instead, their variance increased during lake deoxygenation and recovery, and then stabilized. Spatial and temporal variations in rates were significantly related to climatic variability and changes in DO, and causality testing indicated that these relationships were both correlative and causative. Our data indicate that climatic, physical, and biogeochemical properties and processes collectively regulated DO, producing linked feedbacks that drove DO decline and recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694361>Rain exacerbates cold and metabolic strain during high-intensity running.</a></h1><p>Outdoor exercise often proceeds in rainy conditions.

Mean weighted skin temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON during exercise (P<0.05).  consumption and rating of perceived exertion were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 50 and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma lactate was significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05).These results suggest that rain increased heat loss during the early phase of exercise in the cold, then heat production increased and transiently suppressed cold stress. However, with time, body heat loss intensified due to increasing wet area, and then energy expenditure and plasma lactate increased due to cold stress. Therefore, rain may decrease exercise performance and affect sport safety.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696204>CXCR3 from chemokine receptor family correlates with immune infiltration and predicts poor survival in osteosarcoma.</a></h1><p>Chemokine receptors have a crucial role in regulating tumor mediating immunity and also implicated in the prognosis of some cancers. Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling pathways modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, metabolism, KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive  species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, inflammation, and immune-related pathways such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690112>Neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4 (NEDD4) regulates hydrogen peroxide-induced cell proliferation and death through inhibition of Hippo signaling.</a></h1><p>E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death. In this study, we investigated the role of neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (NEDD4) in regulation of hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis in human bone marrow-derived stem cells (hBMSCs). Cell proliferation was increased in low doses of HO (10 to 10 μM), whereas sublethal concentrations of HO (>200 μM) induced apoptosis. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified that recruitment of NF-κB onto the promoter region of  mediated HO-induced  expression. The increase of NEDD4 expression by HO induced translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP) into the nucleus by decreasing the stability of large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS). Thus, the phosphorylation of serine 127 residue of YAP by LATS upstream kinase is decreased and thereby increased the transcriptional activity of YAP. The mRNA expression levels of catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase, which are well-known targets of YAP, were increased by HO treatment but down-regulated by NEDD4 silencing using a specific small interfering RNA targeting NEDD4 (siNEDD4). HO-induced scavenging capacity of reactive  species was also decreased by siNEDD4 in hBMSCs. Finally, hBMSC differentiation into osteoblast was decreased by siNEDD4 but reverted by reintroduction of the S127A mutant construction of YAP. Taken together, these results indicate that NEDD4 regulates HO-induced alteration of cell status through regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway.-Jeon, S.-A., Kim, D. W., Cho, J.-Y.

Acute exacerbations of COPD patients are in significant respiratory distress and noninvasive measurements of WOB are easier for the patient to tolerate. Given the interest in using alternative therapies to noninvasive ventilation, such as high flow nasal  therapy or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal, understanding the physiological changes are key and this includes assessment of WOB. This narrative review considers the role of three different methods of assessing WOB in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Esophageal pressure is a very well validated measure of WOB, however the ability of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD to tolerate esophageal tubes is poor. Noninvasive alternative measurements include parasternal electromyography (EMG) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EMG is easily applied and is a well validated measure of neural drive but is more likely to be degraded by the electrical environment in intensive care or high dependency. EIT is less well validated as a tool for WOB in COPD but extremely well tolerated by patients. Each of the different methods assess WOB in a different way and have different advantages and disadvantages. For research into therapies treating acute exacerbations of COPD, combinations of EIT, EMG and esophageal pressure are likely to be better than only one of these.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692088>MiR-92a regulates brown adipocytes differentiation, mitochondrial oxidative respiration, and heat generation by targeting SMAD7.</a></h1><p>Brown adipocytes are rich in mitochondria and linked to the body's blood fat levels and obesity. MiR-92a is negatively correlated with the activity of brown adipocytes. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of miR-92a on brown adipocytes. The expression of miR-92a in C2C12 cell was detected by a quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). C2C12 cells were induced to brown adipocytes. The direct target gene of miR-92a was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Brown adipocytes were treated with isoprenaline (Iso) and transfected by miR-92a inhibitor and siSMAD7. The expression of heat-producing genes and adipose differentiation genes related to brown adipocytes were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The expression of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 were detected using Western blot analysis. The mitochondrial content was measured by mitotracker fluorescent staining. MiR-92a inhibitor significantly decreased the expression of miR-92a in C2C12 cells. MiR-92a inhibitor could upregulate the expression of Ucp1, Cox7a1, Elovl3, Ppargc1α, PPARγ, and FABP4, and its effect on Ucp1 was increased after the treatment of isoprenaline. Moreover, miR-92a inhibitor increased mitochondrial content,  consumption rate (OCR) and the expression of SMAD7 and suppressed the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3, whereas miR-92a directly targeted SMAD7 to exert its inhibitory effects. SiSMAD7 reversed the effects of the inhibitor on heat-producing genes, mitochondrial content, OCR and the expressions of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 in brown adipocytes. Blocking miR-92a might promote brown adipocytes differentiation, mitochondrial oxidative respiration, and thermogenesis by targeting SMAD7 to inhibit the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690310>Redirecting photosynthetic electron flux in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by the deletion of flavodiiron protein Flv3.</a></h1><p>-evolving photoautotrophic organisms, like cyanobacteria, protect their photosynthetic machinery by a number of regulatory mechanisms, including alternative electron transfer pathways. Despite the importance in modulating the electron flux distribution between the photosystems, alternative electron transfer routes may compete with the solar-driven production of CO-derived target chemicals in biotechnological systems under development. This work focused on engineered cyanobacterial Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains, to explore possibilities to rescue excited electrons that would normally be lost to molecular  by an alternative acceptor flavodiiron protein Flv1/3-an enzyme that is natively associated with transfer of electrons from PSI to O, as part of an acclimation strategy towards varying environmental conditions.The effects of Flv1/3 inactivation by flv3 deletion were studied in respect to three alternative end-products, sucrose, polyhydroxybutyrate and glycogen, while the photosynthetic gas fluxes were monitored by Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) to acquire information on cellular carbon uptake, and the production and consumption of O. The results demonstrated that a significant proportion of the excited electrons derived from photosynthetic water cleavage was lost to molecular  via Flv1/3 in cells grown under high CO, especially under high light intensities. In flv3 deletion strains these electrons could be re-routed to increase the relative metabolic flux towards the monitored target products, but the carbon distribution and the overall efficiency were determined by the light conditions and the genetic composition of the respective pathways. At the same time, the total photosynthetic capacity of the Δflv3 strains was systematically reduced, and accompanied by upregulation of oxidative glycolytic metabolism in respect to controls with the native Flv1/3 background.The observed metabolic changes and respective production profiles were proposedly linked with the lack of Flv1/3-mediated electron transfer, and the associated decrease in the intracellular ATP/NADPH ratio, which is bound to affect the metabolic carbon partitioning in the flv3-deficient cells. While the deletion of flv3 could offer a strategy for enhancing the photosynthetic production of desired chemicals in cyanobacteria under specified conditions, the engineered target pathways have to be carefully selected to align with the intracellular redox balance of the cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698002>N-acetyl-l-cysteine protects porcine oocytes undergoing meiotic resumption from heat stress.</a></h1><p>Heat stress (HS) is a notable risk factor for female reproductive performance. In particular, impaired oocyte maturation was thought to contribute largely to the HS-induced reproductive dysfunctions. In this study, we confirmed that oocytes undergoing GVBD were much susceptible to HS, and thus compromising subsequent embryonic development. Using N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), we found supplementation of a relatively high dose NAC during in vitro maturation, can protect oocytes from HS-induced complications, and thus rescuing impaired embryonic development. Further analysis indicated that mechanisms responsible for protecting GVBD oocytes from HS by NAC may include: (1) reversing disorganized spindle assembly and inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling; (2) correcting erroneous H3K27me3 modification and dysregulated expression of imprinted genes; (3) alleviating increased intraoocyte reactive  species accumulation and apoptosis initiation. Our study, focusing on the oocyte meiotic maturation, may provide a safe and promising strategy for protecting reproductive sows under environmental hyperthermal conditions.Copyright © 2019.

Ethanol, cyanamide or their combination did not alter dP/dt or LVDP in OVX rats. Cyanamide induced cardiac oxidative stress and abrogated the subsequent alcohol-evoked increases in ROS and MDA levels in SO rats. Neither ethanol nor cyanamide influenced ROS or MDA levels in OVX rats. Importantly, cyanamide exaggerated ethanol-evoked hypotension in SO and uncovered this hypotensive response in OVX rats, which implicates ALDH2 in the vasodilating effect of ethanol.Contrary to our hypothesis, cyanamide attenuated the E -dependent cardiac dysfunction caused by alcohol, likely by preconditioning the heart to oxidative stress, while exacerbating the vasodilating effect of alcohol. The latter might predispose to syncope when cyanamide and alcohol are combined in females.Copyright © 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693037>Formation of uniform porous yolk-shell MnCoO microrugby balls with enhanced electrochemical performance for lithium storage and the  evolution reaction.</a></h1><p>Mixed transition metal oxides with favorable electrochemical properties are promising electrode materials in energy storage and conversion systems. In this work, uniform porous yolk-shell MnCo2O4 (denoted as YSM-MCO) microrugby balls have been synthesized by simple annealing treatment of metal carbonates with a microrugby ball shape in air. Benefiting from the desired porous structure and composition, the as-synthesized YSM-MCO exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance when investigated as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries and electrocatalysts for the  evolution reaction. The YSM-MCO demonstrates remarkable lithium storage properties with a good cycling stability (94% capacity retention over 200 cycles at 0.5 A g-1) and superior rate capability (414 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1).

Here, we propose that the electrocatalytic properties could be well modified by incorporating missing linkers into the MOF. Theoretical calculations suggest the electronic structure of MOFs can be tuned by introducing missing linkers, which improves  evolution reaction (OER) performance of the MOF. Inspired by these aspects, we introduced various missing linkers into a layered-pillared MOF Co(OH)(CHO) (termed as CoBDC) to prepare missing-linker MOFs. Transmission electron microscope and synchrotron X-ray measurements confirmed that the missing linkers in the MOF could be introduced and well controlled by our strategy. The self-supported MOF nanoarrays with missing linkers of carboxyferrocene exhibit excellent OER performance with ultralow overpotential of 241 mV at 100 mA cm. This work opens a new prospect to develop efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts by introducing missing linkers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694576>Induction techniques that reduce redistribution hypothermia: a prospective, randomized, controlled, single blind effectiveness study.</a></h1><p>While much effort has been devoted to correcting intraoperative hypothermia, less attention has been directed to preventing redistribution hypothermia. In this study, we compared three different anesthetic induction techniques to standard IV propofol inductions (control) in their effect on reducing redistribution hypothermia.Elective, afebrile patients, age 18 to 55 years, were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 50 each). Group "INH/100" was induced with 8% sevoflurane in 100% , Group "INH/50" with 8% sevoflurane in 50%  and 50% nitrous oxide, Group "PROP" with 2.2 mg/kg propofol, and Group "Phnl/PROP" with 2.2 mg/kg propofol immediately preceded by 160 mcg phenylephrine. Patients were maintained with sevoflurane in 50% nitrous oxide and 50%  in addition to opioid narcotic. Forced air warming was used. Core temperatures were recorded every 15 min after induction for 1 h.Compared to control group PROP, the mean temperatures in groups INH/100, INH/50, and Phnl/PROP were higher 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after induction (p < 0.001 for all comparisons), averaging between 0.39 °C and 0.54 °C higher.

It is well-known that pressure can induce structural phase transition, producing novel properties. On the other hand, the study of W oxides under high pressures is beneficial for the control of the  fugacity. In this work, we built the high-pressure phase diagram of W-O binary compounds through first-principles swarm-intelligence structural search calculations. WOand WOare stable in the whole considered pressure range from 0 to 300 GPa. Besides reproducing the known structures, we identify two new phases of WO(e.g., C2/m and Cmca) and three ones for WO(e.g., Pnma, Cmcm, and Pm-3n), associating with the evolution of polyhedron (i.e. octahedron → distorted octahedron for WO, and octahedron → hendecahedron → tetradecahedron → icosahedron for WO). More interestingly, the Pm-3n-structured WOshows the highest coordination number of 12. Electron structure calculations indicates that pressure-induced nonmetal → metal transition occurs for WOand WO.

Bioassay indicated that compound 5i was outstood with broad-spectrum of in vitro activity against five fungi, its EC50 value (0.73 μg/mL) was comparable to boscalid ( EC50 of 0.51 μg/mL) and fluxapyroxad (EC50 of 0.19 μg/mL) against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. For Rhizoctonia cerealis, 5i and 5p with the EC50 of 4.61 μg/mL and 6.48 μg/mL respectively, showed significant higher activity than fluxapyroxad with the EC50 of 16.99 μg/mL. In vivo fungicidal activity of 5i exhibited excellent inhibitory rate (100%) against Puccinia sorghi at 50 μg/mL, while the positive control boscalid showed only 70% of inhibitory rate. Moreover, 5i showed promising fungicidal activity with 60% inhibitory rate against Rhizoctonia solani at 1 μg/mL, which was better than boscalid (30%). Compound 5i possessed better in vivo efficacy against P. sorghi and R. solani than boscalid. Molecular docking showed, even the carbonyl  atom of 5i was far from pyrazole ring, it could also form hydrogen bonds towards the hydroxyl hydrogen, amino hydrogen of TYR58 and TRP173 on SDH, respectively, which consisted with the positive control fluxapyroxad. Fluorescence quenching analysis and SDH enzymatic inhibition studies also validated its mode of action.

The prepared MoS/SnS/r-GO showed significant photoexcitation of photosensitive  (ROS) by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, demonstrating that superoxide radicals (O), pores, and hydroxyl radicals (OH) are the main active species. The constructed S-C-S heterojunction has a multilevel electron transport mechanism and synergistic effect, which provides the possibility of producing more organic fuel. The photocatalytic materials were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, PL, etc. As a result, the atomic layer MoS/SnS/r-GO heterojunction exhibited a CO formation rate of 68.53 μmol g h and a CH formation rate of 50.55 μmol g h, respectively.

In eukaryotes, its role and frequency remain highly debated, although recent research supports that gene transfer from bacteria to diverse eukaryotes may be much more common than previously appreciated. However, most of this research focused on animals and the true phylogenetic and functional impact of bacterial genes in less-studied microbial eukaryotic groups remains largely unknown. Here, we have analyzed transcriptome data from the deep-branching stramenopile Opalinidae, common members of frog gut microbiomes and distantly related to the well-known genus Blastocystis. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the early acquisition of several bacterial genes in a common ancestor of both lineages. Those LGTs most likely facilitated the adaptation of the free-living ancestor of the Opalinidae-Blastocystis symbiotic group to new niches in the -depleted animal gut environment.© The Author(s) 2019.

The underlying neural system's functioning is apparently too complicated, however. Therefore, the neural time series' analysis through new methods is the aim of any recent research. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a prominent modality for investigating the human brain's neural substrate, especially when cognitive impairment occurs. The present study was an attempt to investigate the brain network's differences between MS patients and HCs using graph-theoretic measures constructed by an effective connectivity measure through statistical tests. The results of the significant measures were then evaluated through machine learning methods. To this end, we gathered blood- level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data of the participants during the execution of paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT). Granger causality analysis (GCA) was then employed between brain regions' time series on each subject in order to construct a brain network. Afterward, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was implemented to find the alteration of brain networks between the mentioned groups. According to the results, Global flow coefficient was significantly different between HCs and patients. Moreover, MS disease impacted several areas of the brain including Hippocampus, Para Hippocampal, Thalamus, Cuneus, Superior temporal gyrus, Heschl, Caudate, Medial Frontal Superior Gyrus, Fusiform, Pallidum, and several parts of Cerebellum in centrality measures and local flow coefficient. Most of the obtained regions were related to the cognitive impacts of the disease. We also found the best subset of graph features by means of Fisher score, and classified them to evaluate the features strength for the discrimination of MS patients from HCs via several machine learning methods. Having used the combination of Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher score, we were able to classify MS patients from HCs using linear support vector machine (SVM) with an accuracy of 95%. With regard to the few existing studies on brain network of MS patients, especially during a cognitive task execution, our findings showed that the selected graph measures by Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher score from the GCA-based brain networks resulted in a promising classification accuracy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The pharmacological mechanism of protocatechuic aldehyde (PCA) for PD treatment have retained unclear. The purposes of the present study were to clarify the neuroprotective effects of post-treatment of PCA for PD treatment by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage, and to further determine whether its effects were mediated by the polo-like kinase 2/phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 β/nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (PLK2/p-GSK3β/Nrf2) pathways. We found that PCA improved 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced behavioral deficits and dopaminergic cell loss. Moreover, PCA increased the expressions of PLK2, p-GSK3β and Nrf2, following the decrease of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Cell viability was increased and the apoptosis rate was reduced by PCA in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP)-incubated cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial complex I activity and reactive  species (ROS) levels in MPP-incubated cells were also ameliorated by treatment with PCA. The neuroprotective effects of PCA were abolished by inhibition or knockdown of PLK2, whereas overexpression of PLK2 strengthened the protection of PCA. Furthermore, GSK3β and Nrf2 were involved in PCA-induced protection. These results indicated that PCA has therapeutic effects on PD by the PLK2/p-GSK3β/Nrf2 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692728>[Management of cerebral radionecrosis: experience in the Department of Neurology at the Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital].</a></h1><p>Brain radionecrosis is a rare but life-threatening complication of external-beam radiotherapy for ENT cancers, in particular of the nasopharynx, and for brain tumors. Very few studies were conducted on this complication in the African population as well as in the Maghreb population. Therefore our study aims to describe the demographic, clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic and evolutionary features of cerebral radionecrosis in the Department of Neurology at the Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital in Rabat over a period of 18 years (2000-2017). The study involved 4 women and 13 men, with an average age of 50 years. The mean time between the end of the radiotherapy and the onset of neurological signs was 28 months. Systematic Brain MRI, sometimes complemented by spectro-MRI, allowed the diagnosis in 100% of cases. Etiologically, this complication occurred after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and cancer of the larynx in all cases. Fifteen patients were treated with a combination of: bolus application of corticosteroids, platelet aggregation inhibitors associated with hyperbaric  therapy with good evolution of two patients in whom  therapy was contraindicated due to a lung problem and ENT cancer, received a combination of bolus application of corticosteroids and platelet aggregation inhibitors with unchanged evolution. These results demonstrate the importance of early diagnosis in patients with potentially serious conditions, in particular neuropsychiatric conditions, as well as of treatment combining bolus application of corticosteroids and hyperbaric  therapy because this is the best guarantee of a favorable outcome, without omitting the crucial role of preventive measures.© Amine Raggabi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696566>Cambiarenes: Single-Step Synthesis and Selective Zwitterion Binding of a Clip-Shaped Macrocycle with a Redox-Active Core.</a></h1><p>We report the synthesis of a novel macrocyclic host molecule that forms in a single step from commercially available starting materials.

The biochemical indicators closely related to fatigue, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid (LD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) in the serum; liver glycogen (LG) in the liver tissue; muscle glycogen (MG); inorganic phosphate (Pi) and Annexin V in the gastrocnemius; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities; malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); and the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and reactive  species (ROS) content in both serum and the gastrocnemius were detected. Morphological changes were also observed. The anti-fatigue-related proteins of the NRF2/ARE, Bcl2, and PGC-1α pathways in the gastrocnemius of the mice were detected by western blot.Anwulignan significantly increased the exercise tolerance by decreasing BUN, LD, LDH, CK, Pi, MDA, TBARS, 8-OHdG, ROS, and Annexin V levels and increasing LG, MG, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels, significantly upregulated the expression of NRF2 and Bcl2 proteins, which are anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis regulators, and also activated the p38MAPK-PGC-1α pathway.Anwulignan can increase exercise tolerance and relieve fatigue in an excessive fatigue mouse model. The underlying mechanism may be through its regulatory effect on the NRF2 and PGC-1α signaling pathway.

Interestingly, β2AR has long-been linked to ROS, yet the involvement of ROS in β2AR function has not been as vigorously studied as other aspects of β2AR signaling. Herein, we discuss the existing body of evidence linking β2AR activation to intracellular ROS generation and importantly, the role of ROS in regulating β2AR function. The reciprocal interplay of the β2AR and ROS appear to endow this receptor with the ability to self-regulate signaling efficacy and ligand binding, hereby unveiling a redox-axis that may be unfavorably altered in pathological states contributing to both disease progression and therapeutic drug responses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Given the high oxidation sensitivity of copper inks before, during and after the curing process, the conductivity and thereby the device performance can be affected. Strategies to limit or even avoid this drawback include the development of metal organic decomposition (MOD) inks with selected 'protective' ligands. In this study, the influence of the ligand on the oxide formation during the ink decomposition process is described using a wide variety of in-situ characterization techniques. It is demonstrated that bidentate ligands provide an improved oxidation barrier, although the copper preservation mechanism has its limits:  can interfere in every reduction pathway to an extent depending on the curing duration and atmospheric conditions. The generated insights can be applied in the further evolution towards ambient-curable copper MOD inks.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692138>Photoinduced multi-effects to enhance uranium extraction from natural seawater by black phosphorus nanosheet.</a></h1><p>Rational design of adsorbent that targets the marine factors is highly possible to enhance the efficiency for uranium extraction from natural seawater. Herein, based on the photoinduced photothermal, photoelectric, and photocatalytic effects of black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, a BP-PAO fiber with enhanced uranium extraction capacity and high antibiofouling activity is fabricated by compositing BP nanosheets into polyacrylamidoxime (PAO). The photothermal effect increases the coordination interaction between UO22+ and the functional amidoxime group, and the photoelectric effect produces the surface positive electric field that exhibits electrostatic attraction to the negative [UO2(CO3)3]4-, which all increase the capacity for uranium adsorption. The photocatalytic effect endows the adsorbent with high antibiofouling activity by producing biotoxic reactive  species. Due to these three photoinduced effects, the photoinduced BP-PAO fiber shows a high uranium adsorption capacity of 11.76 mg g-1, which is 1.50 times of the PAO fiber, in bacterial contained natural seawater.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This physiologic inflammatory process is mediated by disruption of the alveolar-vascular interface, leading to pulmonary oedema and impaired  exchange, which often warrants mechanical ventilation to increase survival in the acute setting. One of the least understood aspects of ARDS is the role of the platelets in this process. Platelets, which protect vascular integrity, play a pivotal role in the progression and resolution of ARDS. The recent substantiation of the age-old theory that megakaryocytes are found in the lungs has rejuvenated interest in and raised new questions about the importance of platelets for pulmonary function. In addition to primary haemostasis, platelets provide a myriad of inflammatory functions that are poised to aid the innate immune system. This review focuses on the evidence for regulatory roles of platelets in pulmonary inflammation, with an emphasis on two receptors, CLEC-2 and TLT-1. Studies of these receptors identify novel pathways through which platelets may regulate vascular integrity and inflammation in the lungs, thereby influencing the development of ARDS.© 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691948>The regulatory role of HIF-1 in tubular epithelial cells in response to kidney injury.</a></h1><p>The high sensitivity to changes in  tension makes kidney vulnerable to hypoxia. Both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease are almost always accompanied by hypoxia. Tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the dominant intrinsic cells in kidney tissue, are believed to be not only a victim in the pathological process of various kidney diseases, but also a major contributor to kidney damage. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the main regulator of adaptive response of cells to hypoxia. Under various clinical and experimental kidney disease conditions, HIF-1 plays a pivotal role in modulating multiple cellular processes in TECs, including apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, metabolic pattern alteration, and cell cycle arrest. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which HIF-1 regulates these cellular processes in TECs may help identify potential therapeutic targets to improve the outcome of acute kidney injury and delay the progression of chronic kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697493>Iron(II) Corrole Anions.</a></h1><p>Reduction of [Fe(TPC)(THF)] (TPC = trianion of 5,10,15-triphenylcorrole) with KC generates the iron(II) corrole anion, K(THF)[Fe(TPC)] (). Compound  represents the first example of an isolated and crystallographically characterized corrole complex of divalent iron. The compound adopts an intermediate-spin state ( = 1), displaying square-planar geometry about the iron atom.

Animals were divided into four groups: control, Saxa, LPS, and LPS + Saxa. Histopathology changes of lung tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining. The degree of edema was determined by wet/dry ratio. The levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines in lung homogenate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were detected using kits. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to test apoptosis and Western blotting was applied to measure the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways were detected by Western blotting. The results revealed that Saxa attenuated LPS-induced pathological injury and edema. Saxa decreased the levels of reactive  species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The contents of inflammatory cytokines were reduced in the Saxa intervention group. Saxa attenuated apoptosis accompanied by alterations in the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. Furthermore, the expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1 were upregulated whereas phospho (p)-NF-κB p65 and phospho-inhibitory subunit of NF-κB alpha (p-IκB-α) were downregulated after Saxa treatment. These findings concluded that Saxa alleviates oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in ALI induced by LPS via modulating the Nrf-2/HO-1 and NF-κB pathways, which provides evidence for employing Saxa in ALI treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698213>Microaerated UASB reactor treating textile wastewater: The core microbiome and removal of azo dye Direct Black 22.</a></h1><p>Sequential anaerobic and aerobic processes have been recommended to treat textile wastewater reliably. In this work, the focus was on finding an energetically more competitive system to remove tetra-azo dye Direct Black 22 (DB22). We operated two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors (R1 and R2) in three phases (PI, PII, and PIII). R1 was operated as a conventional UASB, while R2 was microaerated in the upper part (0.18 ± 0.05 mg O. L), aiming to remove DB22 simultaneously with the aromatic amine byproducts. PI consisted of feeding reactors with synthetic textile wastewater (STW), PII had higher salinity in the STW, and PIII was the same as PII, plus sulfate. The results showed that color and COD removal efficiencies were similar for both reactors (67-72% for R1 and 59-78% for R2) without a substantial influence of  in R2. However, microaeration played a crucial role in R2 by removing the anaerobically formed aromatic amines; during PIII, the effluent was 16 times less toxic than that of R1. The microbial community that developed in the sludge bed of both reactors was quite similar, with the core microbiome represented by Trichococcus, Syntrophus and Methanosaeta genera. The increase in salinity in PII and PIII promoted a shift in the microbial community, excluding salty-sensitive genera from the core microbiome. The putative genera Brevundimonas and Ornatilinea were associated to aromatic amine microaerobic removal. Therefore, there is a potential application of a compact microaerated anaerobic system for textile wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Critical care outreach services (CCOS) aim to avert inappropriate ICU admissions, while ensuring timely patient review.We retrospectively analysed patients with haematological malignancy reviewed by an outreach service between January 2014 and December 2015 at a single institution. The aim of our study was to describe the patient population assessed by a well-established outreach team, identify predictors of ICU admission, as well as ICU and hospital mortality.Sixty of 126 patients reviewed (47.6%) were admitted to ICU. ICU and hospital mortality were 25.3% and 45.2%, respectively. The odds of being admitted to ICU was 13 times higher ( = 0.013) if the patient was referred for hypoxia, 20 times higher ( = 0.006) if they were referred for sepsis or 14 times higher ( = 0.027) if they were referred to CCOS for hypotension, compared to when the team was automatically alerted. The odds of not surviving hospital admission increased 1.27 times for every extra day of CCOS review ( = 0.02). When a patient was referred having a refractory or progressive haematological condition, the odds of not surviving to hospital discharge increased by four or 12 times, respectively, compared to when the referred patient was in remission. Receiving high flow nasal cannula  (HFNCO) was associated with a reduction in ICU admission ( = 0.03), irrespective of the underlying diagnosis, performance status or location of delivery. The CCOS participated in end-of-life discussions in 29% patients.ICU and hospital mortality of patients with haemato-oncological malignancy continue to improve. CCOS are heavily involved in the recognition and management of these patients, as well as in the facilitation of end-of-life discussions. Sepsis was associated with increased risk of ICU admission and mortality. Initiation of HFNCO outside ICU appears to be feasible and safe and was not associated with increasing risk in this single centre study.© The Intensive Care Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692058>Silencing circular RNA circANKRD36 remits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory damage by regulating microRNA-15/MyD88.</a></h1><p>Bedsore is a familiar disease, which fearfully harms the health of the patients. We investigated the efficacy and mechanism of circular RNA circANKRD36 on HaCaT cell in inflammatory damage. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were respectively used to investigate the efficacies of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), circANKRD36, and microRNA (miR)-15 on cell viability and apoptosis. Moreover, circANKRD36 and miR-15 expression were changed by cell transfection and investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the levels of Bax, pro caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and proteins of the pathway were investigated by Western blot. Otherwise, the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive  species (ROS) was investigated by ROS assay. The relation between myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and miR-15 was investigated by luciferase assay. LPS caused inflammatory damage and upregulated circANKRD36. circANKRD36 was silenced in cells and si-circANKRD36 remitted inflammatory damage. Furthermore, si-circANKRD36 negatively regulated miR-15 and miR-15 inhibitor could reverse the efficacies of si-circANKRD36. Besides, si-circANKRD36 restrained the NF-κB pathway by upregulating miR-15. Finally, MyD88 was authenticated as a target of miR-15. circANKRD36 remitted cell inflammatory damage upregulating miR-15/MyD88 via the NF-κB pathway in HaCaT cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695087>Performance of wild-Serbian Ganoderma lucidum mycelium in treating synthetic sewage loading using batch bioreactor.</a></h1><p>The fluctuation of domestic wastewater characteristic inhibits the current conventional microbial-based treatment. The bioremediation fungi has received attention and reported to be an effective alternative to treat industrial wastewater. Similar efficient performance is envisaged for domestic wastewater whereby assessed performance of fungi for varying carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in domestic wastewater is crucial. Thus, the performance of pre-grown wild-Serbian Ganoderma lucidum mycelial pellets (GLMPs) was evaluated on four different synthetic domestic wastewaters under different conditions of initial pH (pH 4, 5, and 7) and chemical  demand (COD) to nitrogen (COD/N) ratio of 3.6:1, 7.1:1, 14.2:1, and 17.8:1 (C3.6N1, C7.1N1, C14.2N1, and C17.8N1). The COD/N ratios with a constant concentration of ammonia-nitrogen (NH-N) were chosen on the basis of the urban domestic wastewater characteristics sampled at the inlet basin of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The parameters of pH, COD, and NH-N were measured periodically during the experiment. The wild-Serbian GLMPs efficiently removed the pollutants from the synthetic sewage. The COD/N ratio of C17.8N1 wastewater had the best COD and NH-N removal, as compared to the lower COD/N ratio, and the shortest treatment time was obtained in an acidic environment at pH 4. The highest percentage for COD and NH-N removal achieved was 96.0% and 93.2%, respectively. The results proved that the mycelium of GLMP has high potential in treating domestic wastewater, particularly at high organic content as a naturally sustainable bioremediation system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697486>Synergistic chemical and photodynamic antimicrobial therapy for enhanced wound healing mediated by multifunctional light-responsive nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>Recently, rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance, increased prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and slow healing of infected wound lead to vast difficulties in developing innovative antimicrobial agent to obliterate pathogenic bacteria and simultaneously accelerate wound healing. To effectively solve this problem, we designed light-responsive multifunctional nanoparticles with conjugation of quaternary ammonium chitosan and photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) to merge chemical and photodynamic therapy to efficient anti-bacteria. Mg/EGCG complex rapidly responded to the light irradiation under 660 nm with accordingly magnesium ions release, which effectively accelerated wound healing without toxicity to mammalian cells. Notably, positively charged nanoparticles could efficiently adhere to the bacterial surface, reactive  species (ROS) produced under laser irradiation destroyed the membrane structure of the bacteria, which is irreversible, ultimately leading to bacteria death. Thus, the multifunctional nanoparticles with combination of chemical and photodynamic antimicrobial therapy would offer guidance to rational predicted and designed new effective antimicrobial nanomaterials.

Our previous study showed that BHPF impaired mouse denuded oocyte in vitro maturation. However, there is a question that whether BHPF is still able to affect oocyte maturation in the presence of dense cumulus cells. In the present study, we checked the toxic effects of BHPF on porcine oocyte maturation which is derived from COCs in vitro culture. Our results showed that BHPF (50 μM) inhibited the expansion of cumulus cells, led to a significant decrease in polar body extrusion (PBE). Importantly, BHPF resulted in abnormal spindle assembly, ATP level decrease, reactive  species (ROS) accumulation and early apoptosis in porcine oocytes, which are all negative to oocyte maturation. Furthermore, BHPF also declined porcine oocyte quality by disturbing the cortical granules (CGs) distribution. In conclusion, our study showed that BHPF still inhibited oocyte maturation even in the presence of cumulus cells leading to abnormal spindle assembly, ATP decrease, increased ROS level, early apoptosis, and disturbed CGs distribution in porcine oocytes, and also indicates that BHPF has a wide range toxic effects on oocyte in different species.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690504>Diatom-assisted biomicroreactor targeting the complete removal of perfluorinated compounds.</a></h1><p>Persistent perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have been recognized as a global environmental issue. Developing methods without leading to additional burden in nature will be essential for PFCs removal. Herein, we functionalized iron nanoparticles on living diatom (Dt) to efficiently enable the Fenton reaction and reactive  species (ROS) production. Iron nanoparticles at the surface of living diatom act as promising catalytic agents to trigger OH radical generation from HO. Dt plays dual roles: i) as solid support for effective adsorption, and ii) it supplies  and inherently produces ROS under stress conditions, which improves removal efficiency of PFCs. We also demonstrated its reusability by simple magnetic separation and 85% of decomposition efficiency could still be achieved. This newly developed diatom-assisted bioremediation strategy enables green and efficient PFC decomposition and shall be readily applicable to other persistent pollutants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Current clinical guidelines recommend preterm infants are slept supine from 32 weeks' postmenstrual age, regardless of gestational age at birth. However, respiratory function is also related to gestational and chronological ages and is affected by sleep state. We aimed to identify the optimal timing for adopting the supine sleeping position in preterm infants, using a longitudinal design assessing the effects of sleep position and state on cardiorespiratory stability.Twenty-three extremely (24-28 weeks' gestation) and 33 very preterm (29-34 weeks' gestation) infants were studied weekly from birth until discharge, in both prone and supine positions, in quiet and active sleep determined by behavioral scoring. Bradycardia (heart rate ≤100 bpm), desaturation ( saturation ≤80%), and apnea (pause in respiratory rate ≥10 s) episodes were analyzed.Prone positioning in extremely preterm infants reduced the frequency of bradycardias and desaturations and duration of desaturations. In very preterm infants, prone positioning only reduced the frequency of desaturations. The position-related effects were not related to postmenstrual age. Quiet sleep in both preterm groups was associated with fewer bradycardias and desaturations, and also reduced durations of bradycardia and desaturations in the very preterm group.Cardiorespiratory stability is improved by the prone sleep position, predominantly in extremely preterm infants, and the improvements are not dependent on postmenstrual age. In very preterm infants, quiet sleep has a more marked effect than the prone position. This evidence should be considered in individualizing management of preterm infant positioning.© Sleep Research Society 2019.

HCMV can result in severe direct and indirect pathologies under immunosuppressed conditions and is the leading cause of birth defects related to infectious disease. Currently, the effect of HCMV infection on host cell metabolism as an increase in glycolysis during infection has been defined. We have observed that oxidative phosphorylation is also increased. We have identified morphological and functional changes to host mitochondria during HCMV infection. The mitochondrial network undergoes fission events after HCMV infection. Interestingly, the network does not undergo fusion. At the same time mitochondrial mass and membrane potential increase. The electron transport chain (ETC) functions at an elevated rate resulting in the release of increased reactive  species. Surprisingly, despite the stress applied to the host mitochondria, the network is capable of responding to and meeting the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands placed on it. When mitochondrial DNA is depleted from the cells, we observed severe impairment of viral replication. Mitochondrial DNA encodes many of the ETC components. These findings suggest that the host cell ETC is essential to HCMV replication. Our studies suggest the host cell mitochondria may be a therapeutic target. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus present in up to 85% of some populations. Like all herpesviruses, HCMV infection is for life. There is no vaccine currently available, neutralizing antibody therapies are ineffective and current antivirals have limited long-term efficacy due to side effects and potential for viral mutation and resistance. The significance of this research is in understanding how HCMV manipulates the host mitochondria to support bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements for replication. Despite a large genome, HCMV relies exclusively on host cells for metabolic functions. By understanding the dependency of HCMV on the mitochondria, we could exploit these requirements and develop novel antivirals.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694206>A Neuroimaging Study of Personality Traits and Self-Reflection.</a></h1><p>This study examines the blood- level dependent (BOLD) activation of the brain associated with the four distinctive thinking styles associated with the four personality orientations of the Gountas Personality Orientations (GPO) survey: Emotion/Feeling-Action, Material/Pragmatic, Intuitive/Imaginative, and Thinking/Logical. The theoretical postulation is that each of the four personality orientations has a dominant (primary) thinking style and a shadow (secondary) thinking style/trait. The participants (N = 40) were initially surveyed to determine their dominant (primary) and secondary thinking styles. Based on participant responses, equal numbers of each dominant thinking style were selected for neuroimaging using a unique fMRI cognitive activation paradigm. The neuroimaging data support the general theoretical hypothesis of the existence of four different BOLD activation patterns, associated with each of the four thinking styles. The fMRI data analysis suggests that each thinking style may have its own cognitive activation system, involving the frontal ventromedial, posterior medial, parietal, motor, and orbitofrontal cortex. The data also suggest that there is a left hemisphere relationship for the  and  styles and a right activation relationship for  and  styles. Additionally, the unique self-reflection paradigm demonstrated that perception of self or self-image, may be influenced by personality type; a finding of potentially far-reaching implications.</p></html>
