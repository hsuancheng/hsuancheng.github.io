<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25763242>New therapy using omega-3-Acid ethyl esters for decubitus ulcers and stasis dermatitis: a case report.</a></h2><p>In daily practice, it is common to experience difficulty in treating decubitus ulcers (pressure ulcers, also known as decubitus ulcers) and stasis dermatitis of the lower limbs. We hereby report that omega-3-acid ethyl esters were remarkably effective when administered to cases of refractory pressure ulcers and stasis dermatitis for the purpose of improving the blood flow and promoting blood circulation.Case 1: A 21-year-old Japanese female with lower-body paralysis. Pressure ulcers appeared on the heel and first toe of her left lower extremity. Although the patient had been treated with various ointments such as dimethyl isopropylazulene and 0.9% iodine-containing ointment, the course showed no improvement, so omega-3-acid ethyl esters was administered orally, completely healing the ulcer of the first toe in 10 weeks. Case 2: A 76-year-old Japanese male. The patient had been treated on an outpatient basis for 15 years due to hypertension, heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and . Two years prior to this presentation, stasis dermatitis occurred in the lower limbs and at the end of last year, erosive ulcers appeared on the front part of the lower-right thigh and shin. Although treatment with various topical ointment and dressings was performed, the course showed no improvement. Oral administration of omega-3-acid ethyl esters was initiated. At 12 weeks, his condition entered the white phase and healed almost completely.This report is the first to document other treatment possibilities for pressure ulcer and/or stasis dermatitis in cases where the use of topical applied ointments and medications is difficult. This new therapy may therefore help physicians to treat pressure ulcers and stasis dermatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189365>Bioequivalence Demonstration for Ω-3 Acid Ethyl Ester Formulations: Rationale for Modification of Current Guidance.</a></h2><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for establishing bioequivalence (BE) of ω-3 acid ethyl esters (containing both eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] as ethyl esters), used to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia, recommends the conduct of 2 studies: one with participants in the fasting state and one with participants in the fed state. For the fasting study, the primary measures of BE are baseline-adjusted EPA and DHA levels in total plasma lipids. For the fed study, the primary measures of BE are EPA and DHA ethyl esters in plasma. This guidance differs from that established for icosapent ethyl (EPA ethyl esters) in which the primary measure of BE is baseline-adjusted total EPA in plasma lipids for both the fasting and fed states. The FDA guidance for ω-3 acid ethyl esters is not supported by their physiologic characteristics and triglyceride-lowering mechanisms because EPA and DHA ethyl esters are best characterized as pro-drugs. This article presents an argument for amending the FDA draft guidance for ω-3 acid ethyl esters to use baseline-adjusted EPA and DHA in total plasma lipids as the primary measures of BE for both fasting and fed conditions. This change would harmonize the approaches for demonstration of BE for ω-3 acid ethyl esters and icosapent ethyl (EPA ethyl esters) products for future development programs and is the most physiologically rational approach to BE testing.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.
