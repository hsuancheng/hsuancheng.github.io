Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk . Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids, Lys and  decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of +Tyr, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other energy metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, Ile, Val, Lys and , there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9263881>A model of scorpion toxin binding to voltage-gated K+ channels.</a></h2><p>Mutational studies have identified part of the S5-S6 loop of voltage-dependent K+ channels (P region) responsible for tetraethylammonium (TEA) block and permeation properties. Several scorpion peptide toxins-charybdotoxin (ChTX), kaliotoxin (KITX), and agitoxin (AgTX)-also block the channel with high affinity and specificity. Here, we examine the interaction predicted when the toxins are docked onto the molecular model of the K+ channel pore that we recently proposed. Docking with the model of the Kv1.3 channel started by location of Lys-27 side chain into the central axis of the pore, followed by  minimization. In the optimal arrangement, Arg-24 of KITX or AgTX forms a hydrogen bond with the Asp-386 carboxyl of one subunit, and Asn-30 is in immediate contact with Asp-386 of the opposing subunit in the tetramer. Toxin residues in proximity to the side chain of Lys-27 (-25, -36, Met-29, and Ser-11 in KITX) interact with the four C-end His-404s. For ChTX the interaction with Asp-386 is reduced, but this is compensated by additional nonbonded interactions formed by Tyr-36 and Arg-34. Comparison of calculated  of interaction of these specific toxin-channel residues with experimental studies reveals good agreement. The similar total calculated  of interaction is consistent with the similar IC50 for Kv1.3 block by KITX and AgTX. Steric contacts of residues in position 380 of the S5-P linker with residues on the upper part of toxins permit reconstruction of the K+ channel outer vestibule walls, which are about 30 A apart and about 9 A high. Molecular modeling shows complementarity of the pore model to toxin spacial structures, and supports the proposal that the N-terminal borders of the P regions surround residues of their C-terminal halves.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11784132>Antagonistic effects of human cyclic MBP(87-99) altered peptide ligands in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and human T-cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>The immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide comprising residues 87-99 is a self-antigen in multiple sclerosis (MS). In Lewis rats this epitope induces experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, and is a model of MS. Structure-activity studies have shown that Lys(91) and Pro(96) residues are important for encephalitogenicity. Replacement of Lys and/or Pro residues with Arg and/or Ala, respectively, results in suppression of EAE. A potent linear altered peptide ligand of the immunodominant sequence MBP(83-99) has been selected for clinical trial (Nat. Med. 2000, 6, 1167, 1176). In the present report, two cyclic analogues, cyclo(91-99)[Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) and cyclo(87-99)[Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) were designed by NMR and molecular modeling data on human MBP(87-99) epitope (Val(87)-His---Lys-Asn-Ile-Val--Pro-Arg--Pro(99)) and its linear antagonist peptide analogue [Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99). These analogues (altered peptide ligands) inhibited EAE in Lewis rats and decreased  in the spinal cord. In addition, the analogue cyclo(87-99)[Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) induced proliferation of human peripheral blood T-cells. These cyclic MBP(87-99) peptide analogues may lead to the design of potent antagonist mimetics for treating MS.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8601843>Amino acid pair interchanges at spatially conserved locations.</a></h2><p>Here we study the pattern of amino acid interchanges at spatially, locally conserved regions in globally dissimilar and unrelated proteins. By using a method which completely separates the amino acid sequence from its respective structure, this work addresses the question of which properties of the amino acids are the most crucial for the stability of conserved structural motifs. The proteins are taken from a structurally non-redundant dataset. The spatially conserved substructural motifs are defined as consisting of a "large enough" number of Calpha atoms found to provide a geometric match between two proteins, regardless of the order of the Calpha atoms in the sequence, or of the sequence composition of the substructures. This approach can apply to proteins with little or no sequence similarity but with sufficient structural similarity, and is unique in its ability to handle local, non-topological matches between pairs of dissimilar proteins. The method uses a computer-version based algorithm, the Geometric Hashing. Since the Geometric Hashing ignores sequence information it lends itself to answer the question posed above. The interchanges at geometrically similar positions that have been obtained with our method demonstrate the expected behaviour. Yet, a closer inspection reveals some distant characteristics, as compared with interchanges based upon sequence-order based techniques, or from -contact-based considerations. First, a pronounced division of the amino acids into two classes is displayed: Lys, Glu, Arg, Gln, Asp, Asn, Pro, Gly, , Ser and His on the one hand, and Ile, Val, Leu, , Met, Tyr, Trp, Cys and Ala on the other. These groups further cluster into subgroups: Lys, Glu, Arg, Gln; Asp Asn; Pro, Gly; Ile, Val, Leu, . The other amino acids stand alone. Analysis of the conservation among amino acids indicates proline to be consistently, by far, the most conserved. Next are Asp, Glu, Lys and Gly. Cys is also highly conserved. Interestingly, oppositely charged amino acids are interchanged roughly as frequently as those of the same charge. These observations can be explained in terms of the three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Most of all, there is a clear distinction between residues which prefer to be on the protein surfaces, compared to those frequently buried in the interiors. Analysis of the interchanges indicates their low information content. This, together with the separation into two groups, suggest that the predictive value of the spatial positions of the Calpha+ atoms is not much greater than the sequence alone, aside from their hydrophobicity/hydrophillicity classification.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013895>Eight Collagen Peptides from Hydrolysate Fraction of Spanish Mackerel Skins: Isolation, Identification, and In Vitro Antioxidant Activity Evaluation.</a></h2><p>A previous report indicated that collagen hydrolysate fraction (F7) from Spanish mackerel () skins showed high reducing power and radical scavenging activities on 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (EC value of 1.57 mg/mL) and hydroxyl (EC value of 1.20 mg/mL).

Furthermore, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM could effectively reduce Fe to Fe and inhibit lipid peroxidation.

In this report we examined the effects of streptozotocin-induced  on the feeding responses to centrally administered opioid agonists with differing receptor selectivities. The selective mu receptor agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(Me)-Gly-ol (DAGO) caused a larger increase in intake in diabetic rats than in controls. In both groups feeding responses were greater on the fourth day of daily injections than on the first day.

TT-232 inhibited tyrosine kinase activity of tumor cell lines and this inhibition correlated well with the inhibition of cell proliferation of a large number of cancer cell lines in vitro and reduces the size of different tumors in animal models in vivo. The antitumor efficacy of TT-232 has been found to be associated with the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, resulting in highly selective elimination of tumor tissue. TT-232 was found to be devoid of GH release inhibitory activity but to possess strong antitumor effects. It binds with a high affinity to SSTR1 and SSTR4.

The peculiarities of their immunoregulatory effects are demonstrated with two of the six synthesized MPs, MP-1 (-Leu-Gly--Pro-) and MP-2 (Leu-Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp). It is shown that MP action is directed to the damaged links of immunity. MP-1 enhances a decreased level of antibody production in cyclophosphamide (Cy)-treated mice, but does not influence the antibody formation in normal animals. MP-2 inhibits the tumor growth more in a tumor-bearing organism as the tumor size gets larger, insofar as MP-2 antitumor effect is concerned, by its ability to recover functional activity of T lymphocytes suppressed by tumor products. Selective immunocorrective effects of MPs are based on ligand-receptor interactions. Using FITC-labeled MP-1 and [3H]-labeled MP-2, specific binding of these peptides with appropriate cell populations is shown.

One hundred forty-four broiler chicks were divided into 24 groups of 6 birds balanced for BW and fed 4 diets in a completely randomized design (6 groups per diet) from d 14 to 21 of age. The diets were a corn-soybean meal-based basal diet formulated to meet NRC nutrient requirements, the basal diet with - and AA-yielding ingredients replaced by 30% of either solvent-extracted canola meal (SECM) or EECM, and a low-protein casein-cornstarch-based diet. The SECM, which is commonly used in formulating poultry diets, was fed for comparison with EECM, whereas the casein-cornstarch-based diet was fed to estimate basal endogenous AA losses for determining standardized ileal digestibility of AA. All 4 diets contained titanium oxide (0.3%) as an indigestible marker, and nutrient digestibility and retention were determined by the substitution method. From d 19 to 21, excreta samples were collected for AMEn determination. On d 21, the birds were killed by cervical dislocation, and contents of the whole ileum were obtained for determination of AA digestibility. Expeller-extracted canola meal had greater (P<0.05) standardized ileal digestible contents of Gly, Leu, Ser, , Asp, and Glu and tended to have greater (P<0.10) standardized ileal digestible contents of Ile, Lys, , Ala, and Tyr than SECM. Compared with SECM, EECM had greater (P<0.001) AMEn (2,694 vs. 1,801 kcal/kg).

Obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. The impact of metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related co-morbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decades. Thus, treatment of obesity and its associated immune-mediated diseases is challenging due to impaired function of leptin system. These disorders are managed through antibiotics and by cytokines replacement. However, the effectiveness of cytokines coupled to the complexity of the cytokine network leads to severe side-effects, which can still occur after careful preclinical evaluation. In addition, synthetic immunotherapeutics carry a degree of risk, time-consuming and expensive. Hence, the complexity of existing therapy and adverse effects emphasizes the need for an alternative approach for the management of immune dysfunction associated with obesity. Computer-aided small molecule antibody technology has been successful in the design of novel biologicals for the diagnosis of diseases and therapeutic interventions. In this study, the crystal structure of leptin receptor (LEPR) complex with monoclonal antibody (9F8 Fab) was explored to predict Ag-Ab interactions using bioinformatics tools. The LEPR of complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops were mutated with published positive control residues of Ser, , Tyr, Trp, and  to design a set of 678 peptides which were evaluated through Ag-peptide docking, binding free-energies, and interaction energies.

AsP had 16 β-sheets and 10 α-helices, with Ser(350) (G347-G357), Asp(158) (D158-H169), and His(193) (H193-G203) in separate turn/coil structures. Biological metal binding region situated near 6th-helix and His(193) residue is responsible for metal binding site. Also, calcium ion (Ca(2+)) is coordinated by the carboxyl groups of Lys(84), Ile(85), Lys(86), Asp(87), (88), Ala(89), Ala(90) (K84-A90) for first Ca(2+) binding site and carbonyl oxygen atom of Lys(244), Gly(245), Arg(246), (247), Lys(248), Lys(249), and Ala(250) (K244-A250), for second Ca(2+) binding site. Moreover, Ramachandran plot analysis of protein residues falling into most favored secondary structures were determined (83.3%). The predicted molecular 3D structural model was further verified using PROCHECK, ERRAT, and VADAR servers to confirm the geometry and stereo-chemical parameters of the molecular structural design. The functional analysis of AsP 3D molecular structure predictions familiar in the current study may provide a new perspective in the understanding and identification of antifungal protease inhibitor designing.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

RGD-containing peptides are capable of inducing apoptosis through direct activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3 in cells. Additionally, tumor cells overexpressing somatostatin receptors can be targeted by somatostatin analogs. Radiolabeled somatostatin analogs are successfully used to image and treat such tumors via receptor-targeted scintigraphy and therapy. We combined these 2 peptides, RGD and somatostatin, to synthesize a new hybrid peptide, RGD-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-octreotate (c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Asp)-Lys(DTPA)-D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-). An earlier study showed that tumor-bearing rats had high receptor-specific uptake of RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate in somatostatin receptor subtype 2-positive tissues and tumors. Furthermore, RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate showed a pronounced tumoricidal effect, which is probably the result of increased apoptosis, as is shown by an increased caspase-3 activity after incubation with (111)In-labeled RGD-DTPA-octreotate in comparison with the 2 monopeptides (111)In-DTPA-RGD and (111)In-DTPA-Tyr(3)-octreotate. In this study, we evaluated the biodistributions of RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate and (125)I-RGD-octreotate and investigated the caspase-3 activation of the unlabeled compound RGD-DTPA-octreotate in vitro.Biodistribution studies on tumor-bearing rats were performed with RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate and (125)I-RGD-octreotate. The apoptotic activity, by activation of caspase-3 with RGD-DTPA-octreotate and RGD-octreotate, was examined using colorimetric and immunocytochemical assays.The radiolabeled compound, RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate, showed high uptake and retention in the rats in which rat pancreatic CA20948 tumor had been implanted. A major drawback was high renal uptake. In vitro, the unlabeled peptide RGD-DTPA-octreotate induced a significant increase in caspase-3 levels in various cell lines in comparison with RGD and Tyr(3)-octreotate (P < 0.01). Caspase-3 activation was time dependent. To alter the elimination route, we examined the biodistribution of radioiodinated RGD-octreotate without DTPA [c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Asp)-D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-], as a model of unlabeled RGD-octreotate, in tumor-bearing rats. (125)I-RGD-octreotate showed a much lower renal uptake than did RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate. Furthermore, the affinity of RGD-octreotate increased in comparison with RGD-DTPA-octreotate (values of 1.4 x 10(-8) mol/L vs. 9.4 x 10(-8) mol/L, respectively, for inhibitory concentration of 50%). Finally, RGD-octreotate was still able to activate caspase-3, as was indicated with immunocytochemistry.Because of the high renal uptake, RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate is unsuitable for radionuclide therapy. However, the unlabeled peptides, RGD-DTPA-octreotate and RGD-octreotate, also induced an increase in caspase-3 levels, indicating the therapeutic potential of this compound. Thus, the development of hybrid molecules can become a new approach in the treatment of cancer.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746701>Nitrogen retention, energy, and amino acid digestibility of wheat bran, without or with multicarbohydrase and phytase supplementation, fed to broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The study was conducted to determine the effects of multicarbohydrase (MC) preparation (700 U α-galactosidase, 2,200 U galactomannanase, 3,000 U xylanase, and 22,000 U β-glucanase per kg of diet) and phytase (Phy, 500 FTU per kg of diet) supplementation on the nutritive value of wheat bran (WB) in broiler chicks. Trial 1 determined retention of nutrients and apparent metabolizable energy corrected by nitrogen (AMEn). One reference diet (RD) protein-free (85% corn based) was fortified to determine the WB nutrient retention coefficient. Trial 2 determined standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA, when pancreas and liver were weighed. An additional group of bird was fed with an RD with 5% casein-corn starch diet, fortified with vitamins and minerals to quantify the endogenous fraction and determine SID of AA. For each trial, the test diets were made by mixing RD and WB 7:3 (wt/wt) and fed without or with MC or Phy or combination. Male broilers (Cobb 500), 245 d old, were allocated to five treatments to give seven replicates (seven birds/cage). The birds were fed a commercial diet from day 0 to10 followed by Trial 1 diets from day 11 to 18 and finally Trial 2 diets from day 19 to 21. Excreta samples were collected on days 15-18 and all birds were slaughtered on day 21 for ileal digesta. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between MC and Phy on retention of DM, N, P, and AMEn. An interaction (P < 0.05) was also observed on SID of Arg, His, Leu, Lys, , , Val, Asp, Cys, Glu, and Ser.

The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is involved in  homeostasis, food intake, sexual function, and obesity. The endogenous hAGRP protein is 132 amino acids in length, possesses five disulfide bridges at the C-terminus of the molecule, and is expressed in the hypothalamus of the brain. We have previously reported that a monocyclic hAGRP(103-122) peptide is an antagonist at the melanocortin receptors expressed in the brain. Stereochemical inversion from the endogenous l- to d-isomers of single or multiple amino acid modifications in this monocyclic truncated hAGRP sequence resulted in molecules that are converted from melanocortin receptor antagonists into melanocortin receptor agonists. The Asp-Pro-Ala-Ala--Ala-Tyr-cyclo[Cys-Arg-DPhe-DPhe-Asn-Ala--Cys]-Tyr-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu peptide resulted in a 60 nM melanocortin-1 receptor agonist that is 100-fold selective versus the mMC4R, 1000-fold selective versus the mMC3R, and ca. 180-fold selective versus the mMC5R. In attempts to identify putative ligand-receptor interactions that may be participating in the agonist induced stimulation of the MC4R, selected ligands were docked into a homology molecular model of the mMC4R.

ACE inhibitory peptides derived from food proteins could exert antihypertensive effects without side effects. Jellyfish (Rhopilema esculentum) is an important fishery resource suitable for production of ACE inhibitory peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis conditions for production of protein hydrolysate from R. esculentum (RPH) with ACE inhibitory activity, and to isolate and identify the ACE inhibitory peptides from RPH.Rhopilema esculentum protein was hydrolyzed with Compound proteinase AQ to produce protein hydrolysate with ACE inhibitory activity, and the hydrolysis conditions were optimized using response surface methodology. The optimum parameters for producing peptides with the highest ACE inhibitory activity were as follows: hydrolysis time 3.90 h, hydrolysis temperature 58 °C, enzyme:substrate ratio 2.8% and pH 7.60. Under these conditions, the ACE inhibitory rate reached 32.21%. In addition, four novel ACE inhibitory peptides were isolated, and their amino acids sequences were identified as Val-Gly-Pro-Tyr, --Tyr-Val-Pro-Gly, --Tyr-Val-Pro-Gly-Ala and -Gln-Ala-Val-Trp-Ala-Gly, respectively.

Whereas it is established that IFNAR1 is an essential component of the IFNAR signaling complex, the key residues underpinning the IFN-β-IFNAR1 interaction are unknown. Guided by the crystal structure of the IFN-β-IFNAR1 complex, we used truncation variants and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate domains and residues enabling complexation of IFN-β to IFNAR1. We have identified an interface on IFNAR1-subdomain-3 that is differentially utilized by IFN-β and IFN-α for signal transduction. We used surface plasmon resonance and cell-based assays to investigate this important IFN-β binding interface that is centered on IFNAR1 residues Tyr and Tyr binding the C and N termini of the B and C helices of IFN-β, respectively. Using IFNAR1 and IFN-β variants, we show that this interface contributes significantly to the affinity of IFN-β for IFNAR1, its ability to activate STAT1, the expression of interferon stimulated genes, and ultimately to the anti-viral and anti-proliferative properties of IFN-β. These results identify a key interface created by IFNAR1 residues Tyr and Tyr interacting with IFN-β residues , Leu, Glu, , Val, and Arg that underlie IFN-β-IFNAR1-mediated signaling and biological processes.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8512070>A continuous fluorescence assay of renin activity.</a></h2><p>A sensitive fluorescence assay that employs a new fluorogenic peptide substrate has been developed to continuously measure the proteolytic activity of human renin. The substrate, DABCYL-gaba-Ile-His-Pro--His-Leu-Val-Ile-His--EDANS, has been designed to incorporate the renin cleavage site that occurs in the N-terminal peptide of human angiotensinogen. The assay relies upon resonance energy transfer-mediated, intramolecular fluorescence quenching that occurs in the intact peptide substrate. Efficient fluorescence quenching occurs as a result of favorable energetic overlap of the EDANS excited state and the DABCYL absorption, and the relatively long excited state lifetime of the EDANS fluorophore. Cleavage of the substrate by renin liberates the peptidyl-EDANS fragment from proximity with the DABCYL acceptor, restoring the higher, unattenuated fluorescence of the EDANS moiety. This leads to a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity, directly related to the extent of substrate consumed by renin cleavage. The kinetics of renin-catalyzed hydrolysis of this substrate have been shown to be consistent with a simple substrate inhibition model with a substrate Km approximately equal to 1.5 microM at physiological pH; Cleavage of the substrate occurs specifically at the Leu-Val bond and corresponds to the renin cleavage site of angiotensinogen, as reported earlier. In this report, we describe in detail the synthesis of the fluorogenic renin substrate and its application in assays of renin activity.

On d 18, 19, or 20, six hourly blood samples were collected simultaneously from the portal and hepatic veins plus an artery to determine net fluxes of nutrients across the portal-drained viscera and the liver. Yields of milk and protein increased, as did urinary N excretion with increasing MP. Portal absorption of essential amino acids (EAA) increased linearly with increasing MP supply, as did liver removal of His, Met, and . In contrast, liver removal of the branched-chain AA (BCAA) and lysine was unaffected by diets. With increasing MP, the ratio of milk output to postliver supply of BCAA, , and Lys decreased linearly, indicating oxidation of these AA in the peripheral tissues. Concomitant to a decreased catabolism of EAA in the liver (His, Met, , and ) and/or in peripheral tissues (BCAA, Lys, and ), the efficiency of transfer of absorbed EAA into milk protein decreases markedly as protein supply increases.

They exhibit structural homology and activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, receptors on endothelial cells that signal for growth of blood vessels and lymphatics. VEGF-C and VEGF-D were thought to exhibit similar bioactivities, yet recent studies indicated distinct signaling mechanisms (e.g. tumor-derived VEGF-C promoted expression of the prostaglandin biosynthetic enzyme COX-2 in lymphatics, a response thought to facilitate metastasis via the lymphatic vasculature, whereas VEGF-D did not). Here we explore the basis of the distinct bioactivities of VEGF-D using a neutralizing antibody, peptide mapping, and mutagenesis to demonstrate that the N-terminal α-helix of mature VEGF-D (-Arg) is critical for binding VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Importantly, the N-terminal part of this α-helix, from  to , is required for binding VEGFR-3 but not VEGFR-2. Surprisingly, the corresponding part of the α-helix in mature VEGF-C did not influence binding to either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3, indicating distinct determinants of receptor binding by these growth factors. A variant of mature VEGF-D harboring a mutation in the N-terminal α-helix, D103A, exhibited enhanced potency for activating VEGFR-3, was able to promote increased COX-2 mRNA levels in lymphatic endothelial cells, and had enhanced capacity to induce lymphatic sprouting in vivo This mutant may be useful for developing protein-based therapeutics to drive lymphangiogenesis in clinical settings, such as lymphedema.

We used the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method to study the reactivation pathways of the exogenously inhibited enzyme matrix. The ONIOM calculations performed on the enzyme agree with experimental results, i.e., wild-type [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase H-cluster is inhibited by oxygen metabolites. An enzyme spherical region with a radius of 8 Å (from the distal iron, Fe) has been screened for residues that prevent HO from leaving the catalytic site and reactivate the [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase H-cluster. In the screening process, polar residues were removed, one at a time, and frequency calculations provided the change in the Gibbs'  for the dissociation of water (due to their deletion). When residue deletion resulted in significant Gibbs'  decrease, further residue substitutions have been carried out. Following each substitution, geometry optimization and frequency calculations have been performed to assess the change in the Gibbs'  for the elimination HO. Favorable thermodynamic results have been obtained for both single residue removal (ΔG = -1.6 kcal/mol), single substitution (ΔG = -3.1 kcal/mol), and combined residue substitutions (ΔG = -7.5 kcal/mol). Because the wild-type enzyme has only an endergonic step to overcome, i.e., for HO removal, by eliminating several residues, one at a time, the endergonic step was made to proceed spontaneously. Thus, the most promising residue deletions which enhance HO elimination are ΔArg, Δ, ΔSer, ΔGlu, ΔGlu, and ΔTyr. The thermodynamics and electronic structure analyses show that the bridging carbonyl (CO) of the H-cluster plays a concomitant role in the enzyme inhibition/reactivation. In gas phase, CO shifts towards Fe to compensate for the electron density donated to oxygen upon the elimination of HO. However, this is not possible in the wild-type enzyme because the protein matrix hinders the displacement of CO towards Fe, which leads to enzyme inhibition. However, enzyme reactivation can be achieved by means of appropriate amino acid substitutions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567703>Evidence for a crucial role of neutrophil-derived serine proteases in the inactivation of interleukin-6 at sites of .</a></h2><p>The bioactivity of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was found to be dramatically reduced in fluids from sites of .

As with other amyloid proteins, misfolding of huntingtin is related to Huntington's disease through  that can involve interactions with phospholipid membranes. Experimental results suggest that the N-terminal 17-amino-acid sequence (htt(NT)) positioned just before the Q(N) region is important for the binding of huntingtin to membranes. Through all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, we unveil the structure and dynamics of the htt(NT)Q(N) fragment on a phospholipid membrane at the atomic level. We observe that the insertion dynamics of this peptide can be described by four main steps-approach, reorganization, anchoring, and insertion-that are very diverse at the atomic level. On the membrane, the htt(NT) peptide forms a stable α-helix essentially parallel to the membrane with its nonpolar side-chains-mainly Leu-4, Leu-7, -11 and Leu-14-positioned in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Salt-bridges involving Glu-5, Glu-12, Lys-6, and Lys-15, as well as hydrogen bonds involving -3 and Ser-13 with the phospholipids also stabilize the structure and orientation of the htt(NT) peptide. These observations do not significantly change upon adding the Q(N) region whose role is rather to provide, through its hydrogen bonds with the phospholipids' head group, a stable scaffold facilitating the partitioning of the htt(NT) region in the membrane.

Restoration of circulatory and liver vitamin C and B3 was observed.

In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of Lys, , Cys, Leu, , Tyr, Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily  gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8662895>Ouabain interactions with the H5-H6 hairpin of the Na,K-ATPase reveal a possible inhibition mechanism via the cation binding domain.</a></h2><p>Cardiac glycosides such as ouabain and digoxin specifically inhibit the Na,K-ATPase. Three new residues in the carboxyl half of the Na, K-ATPase, -786, Leu-793 (PFLIF786IIANIPL793PLGT797), and -863 (FTYF863VIM) have been identified as ouabain sensitivity determinants using random mutagenesis. Polymerase chain reaction was utilized to randomly mutate the DNA sequence encoding the amino acids between Lys-691 and Lys-945 in the alpha subunit of the Na, K-ATPase. This region contains four transmembrane segments (H5, H6, H7, and H8) and the connecting extracellular and cytoplasmic loops. Diverse substitutions of these three residues resulted in proteins displaying 2.8-48-fold increases in the I50 of different cardiac glycosides for inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase activity. By locating these residues, in conjunction with -797 (Feng, J., and Lingrel, J. B (1994) Biochemistry 33, 4218-4224), a new region of the protein containing the H5-H6 hairpin and the H7 transmembrane segment emerges as a major determinant of ouabain inhibition. Thus, a link between the cardiac glycoside binding site and the cation transport sites of the Na,K-ATPase transpires giving a structural base to the cation antagonism of ouabain binding. Furthermore, this link suggests a possible mechanism for cardiac glycoside inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase, such that ouabain binding to the implicated region blocks the movement of the H5 and H6 transmembrane domains which may be required for  transduction and cation transport.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117172>Preparation and Identification of Antioxidative Peptides from Pacific Herring () Protein.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to isolate and purify antioxidative peptides from Pacific herring () protein.

However, there is limited data about the effect of dietary free AA, readily available in the duodenum, on the duodenal abundance of AA transporters and its impact on pig performance. Forty-eight pigs (24.3 kg initial BW) distributed in 4 treatments were used to evaluate the effect of the CP level and form (free vs. protein bound) in which AA are added to diets on the expression of AA transporters in the 3 small intestine segments, serum concentration of AA, and performance. Dietary treatments based on wheat and soybean meal (SBM) were 1) low-CP (14%) diet supplemented with L-Lys, L-, DL-Met, L-Leu, L-Ile, L-Val, L-His, L-Trp, and L- (LPAA); 2) as in the LPAA but with added L-Gly as a N source (LPAA+N); 3) intermediate CP content (16%) supplemented with L-Lys HCl, L-, and DL-Met (MPAA); and 4) high-CP (22%) diet (HP) without free AA. At the end of the experiment, 8 pigs from LPAA and HP were sacrificed to collect intestinal mucosa and blood samples and to dissect the carcasses. There were no differences in ADG, ADFI, G:F, and weights of carcass components and some visceral organs between treatments. Weights of the large intestine and kidney were higher in HP pigs (P < 0.01). Expression of b(0,+) in the duodenum was higher in pigs fed the LPAA compared with the HP diet (P= 0.036) but there was no difference in the jejunum and ileum. In the ileum, y+ L expression tended to be higher in pigs fed the LPAA diet (P = 0.098). Expression of b(0,+) in LPAA pigs did not differ between the duodenum and the jejunum, but in HP pigs, the expression of all AA transporters was higher in the jejunum than in the duodenum or ileum (P < 0.05). The serum concentration of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, , and Val was higher but serum Lys and Met were lower in pigs fed the HP diet (P < 0.05). These results indicate that LPAA can substitute up to 8 percentage units of protein in HP wheat-SBM diets without affecting pig performance; nonessential N does not seem to be limiting in very low-protein wheat-SBM diets for growing pigs. Also, the inclusion of free AA in the diet appears to affect their serum concentration and the expression of the AA transporter b0,+ in the duodenum of pigs.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459844>Protein and energy intakes affected amino acid concentrations in plasma, muscle, and liver, and cell signaling in the liver of growing dairy calves.</a></h2><p>The nutrient content of and feeding recommendations for milk replacers (MR) vary widely in North America, and acceleration of growth through manipulation of protein and energy intakes can reduce rearing costs of dairy operations. The effects of varying the protein and energy intake of MR on metabolite concentrations in plasma, liver, and muscle and the phosphorylation activity of protein kinase B (AKT) and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) cell signals in liver and muscle were assessed. Twenty-four newborn Holstein calves were fed 1 of 4 MR for 9 wk (n=6/treatment): (1) a 20% crude protein (CP), 20%  MR fed at 441 g of dry matter (DM)/d (CON); (2) a high-protein, medium- MR (HPMF; 28% CP, 20% ) fed at 951 g of DM/d; (3) a high-protein, high- MR (HPHF; 27% CP, 28% ) fed at 951 g of DM/d; and (4) HPHF fed at 1,431 g of DM/d (HPHF+). Water and starter (20% CP, 1.43% ) were offered ad libitum and calves were fed MR twice daily. Plasma samples were obtained at 1, 5, and 9 wk of age. Calves were not weaned and were slaughtered after the last blood sampling. Liver and muscle tissues were collected and analyzed for metabolite concentrations and cell signaling activity. Calves fed all treatments had lower plasma concentrations of  and Tyr, and a trend for lower Leu, but greater concentrations of  relative to calves fed CON. Calves fed all treatments had increased muscle concentrations of Met and muscle to plasma ratios of , Tyr, and branched-chain amino acids compared with CON. All treatments increased liver to plasma ratios of  and Tyr but diminished the ratios of Met compared with CON. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B was not affected by treatment; however, relative to calves fed HPHF, HPMF and HPHF+ diets increased phosphorylation ratios of ribosomal protein S6 in the liver. Therefore, the changes in plasma and tissue concentrations and plasma to tissue ratios of amino acids were associated with enhanced growth rates. However, cell signaling activity was not consistent with accelerated growth in calves fed treatments with increased contents of energy and protein possibly due to confounding effects of diet (MR + starter) or fasting before tissue harvesting. Muscle concentrations of Met might have a regulatory role in protein synthesis in rapidly growing calves fed high levels of CP and energy.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

Chondrostean fish, such as the Acipenseridae (sturgeon), though without a distinct urophysis, also have a caudal neurosecretory system, which has been indicated by bioassay and immunological evidence to contain UII-like peptides. In the present studies, we investigated by UII radioimmunoassay the UII-like peptides in the spinal cord of three Acipenser species, and isolated and sequenced UII from one of them. As expected, much more UII immunoreactivity (UII-IR) was found in caudal than in anterior spinal cord extracts. In addition, caudal extracts from A. ruthenus were found to contain much more UII-IR (whether determined on a UII-IR/ or UII-IR/fish basis) than those from the larger A. stellatus and A. guldenstadti. UII was therefore isolated from A. ruthenus and its amino acid sequence was shown to be H-Gly-Ser--Ser-Glu-Cys--Trp-Lys-Tyr-Cys-Val-OH. This sequence is identical at positions 6-11 (the disulfide ring) with the known teleost UII peptides, and has acidic and hydrophobic amino acids at positions 5 and 12, respectively, as do the teleost UII peptides.

Recently, a derivative of the fungal metabolite balanol, N46, has been reported to inhibit PKG Iα with high potency and selectivity and attenuate thermal hyperalgesia and osteoarthritic pain. Here we determined co-crystal structures of the PKG Iα C-domain and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) Cα, each bound with N46, at 1.98 Å and 2.65 Å, respectively. N46 binds the active site with its external phenyl ring, specifically interacting with the glycine-rich loop and the αC helix. -371 at the PKG Iα glycine-rich loop is oriented parallel to the phenyl ring of N46, forming a strong π-stacking interaction, whereas the analogous -54 in PKA Cα rotates 30° and forms a weaker interaction. Structural comparison revealed that steric hindrance between the preceding Ser-53 and the propoxy group of the phenyl ring may explain the weaker interaction with PKA Cα. The analogous Gly-370 in PKG Iα, however, causes little steric hindrance with -371. Moreover, Ile-406 on the αC helix forms a hydrophobic interaction with N46 whereas its counterpart in PKA, -88, does not. Substituting these residues in PKG Iα with those in PKA Cα increases the IC values for N46, whereas replacing these residues in PKA Cα with those in PKG Iα reduces the IC, consistent with our structural findings. In conclusion, our results explain the structural basis for N46-mediated selective inhibition of human PKG Iα and provide a starting point for structure-guided design of selective PKG Iα inhibitors.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10984401>Photomodulation of conformational states.

Mono- and bicyclic peptides with (4-amino)phenylazobenzoic acid as backbone constituent.</a></h2><p>The thioredoxin reductase active-site fragment H-Ala-Cys-Ala--Cys-Asp-Gly--OH [134-141], which is known for its high tendency to assume an almost identical conformation as in the intact enzyme, was backbone cyclized with the photoresponsive (4-amino)phenylazobenzoic acid (APB) to produce a monocyclic and disulfide-bridged bicyclic APB-peptide. Light-induced reversible cis/trans isomerization occurs at identical extents in both the linear and the two cyclic forms. Nuclear magnetic resonance conformational analysis clearly revealed that in the bicyclic APB-peptide both as a trans- and cis-azo-isomer the constraints imparted by the bicyclic structure do not allow the molecule to relax into a defined low  conformation, thus making the molecule a frustrated system that flip-flops between multiple conformational states. Conversely, the monocyclic APB peptide folds into a well-defined lowest  structure as a trans-azo-isomer, which upon photoisomerization to the cis-azo configuration relaxes into a less restricted conformational space. First femtosecond spectroscopic analysis of the dynamics of the photoreaction confirm a fast first phase on the femtosecond time scale related to the cis/trans isomerization of the azobenzene moiety followed by a slower phase in the picosecond time scale that involves an adjustment of the peptide backbone. Due to the well- defined photoresponsive two-state transition of this monocyclic peptide molecule, it represents a model system well suited for studying the ultrafast dynamics of conformational transitions by time-resolved spectroscopy.Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019158>Structural determination of glycopeptidolipids of Mycobacterium smegmatis by high-resolution multiple-stage linear ion-trap mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization.</a></h2><p>Glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) are abundant in the cell walls of different species of mycobacteria and consist of tripeptide-amino-alcohol core of D--D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninol linked to 3-hydroxy or 3-methoxy C(26-34) fatty acyl chain at the N-terminal of D- via amide linkage, and a 6-deoxytalose (6-dTal) and an O-methyl rhamnose residues, respectively, attach to D-allo- and the terminal L-alaninol.

Following resonance excitation in an ion trap, MS(n) spectra of the [M + Na](+) ions of GPLs contained mainly b and y series ions that readily determine the peptide sequence.

Firstly, the conserved glutamate Glu-243 in the D-channel of subunit I was replaced by an asparagine or an aspartate residue. The effects of the mutations showed that Glu-243, which is essential for proton movement in bacterial oxidases, is also required for the activity of the eukaryotic enzyme.

We investigate here how  Trm140 protein recognizes its six tRNA substrates. We show that Trm140 has two modes of tRNA substrate recognition. Trm140 recognizes G-U-tA of the anticodon loop of tRNA substrates, and this sequence is an identity element because it can be used to direct mC modification of tRNA However, Trm140 recognition of tRNA substrates is different, since their anticodons do not share G-U and do not have any nucleotides in common. Rather, specificity of Trm140 for tRNA is achieved by seryl-tRNA synthetase and the distinctive tRNA V-loop, as well as by tA and iA We provide evidence that all of these components are important in vivo and that seryl-tRNA synthetase greatly stimulates mC modification of tRNA and tRNA in vitro.

Furthermore, DHA (562 μg/paw) and gabapentin (1000 μg/paw) reduced thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia.

Of the three putative heparin-binding clusters of LPL (J. Biol. Chem. 1994. 269: 4626-4633; J.

Mutants of HL were generated in which potential heparin-binding residues within Clusters 1 and 4 were changed to Asn. Two chimeras in which the LPL heparin-binding sequences of Clusters 2 and 4 were substituted for the analogous HL sequences were also constructed. These mutants were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and assayed for heparin-binding ability using heparin-Sepharose chromatography and a CHO cell-binding assay. The results suggest that residues within the homologous Cluster 1 region (Lys 297, Lys 298, and Arg 300), as well as some residues in the partially conserved Cluster 4 region (Lys 337, Lys 436, and Arg 443), are involved in the heparin binding of hepatic lipase. In the cell-binding assay, heparan sulfate-binding affinity equal to that of LPL was seen for the RHL chimera mutant that possessed the Cluster 4 sequence of LPL. Mutation of Cluster 1 residues of HL resulted in a major reduction in heparin binding ability as seen in both the cell-binding assay and the heparin-Sepharose elution profile. These results suggest that Cluster 1, the N-terminal heparin-binding domain, is of primary significance in RHL. This is different for LPL: mutations in the C-terminal binding domain (Cluster 4) cause a more significant shift in the salt required for elution from heparin-Sepharose than mutations in the N-terminal domain (Cluster 1).</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637154>Dissecting the molecular control of endothelial NO synthase by caveolin-1 using cell-permeable peptides.</a></h2><p>In endothelia, NO is synthesized by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which is negatively regulated by caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the primary coat protein of caveolae.

It is promising that LuffinSs may be used as the efficient toxin moiety of immunotoxins.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29505708>Insight into the Aggregation Capacity of Anammox Consortia during Reactor Start-Up.</a></h2><p>Anammox aggregates have been extensively observed in high-efficiency nitrogen-removal reactors, yet the variation and inherent cause of its aggregation capacity related to reactor operation are still unknown. Here, we used microbial detection, metabolomics, extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, and multivariate statistical analysis to address this issue. The aggregation capacity of anammox consortia varied periodically during reactor operation, which was determined by the hydrophobic force and the ratio of extracellular protein (PN) to extracellular polysaccharides (PS). Fundamentally, it related to the variation of polysaccharides degradation bacteria abundance and the discrepancy of consortia . Specifically, the distinguishable up-regulation of the amino acids , Leu, Ala, , Gly, Glu, and Val potentially contributed to the high biosynthesis of extracellular PN. Together with the reduced extracellular PS production that was regulated via the uridine diphosphate (UDP)- N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and UDP- N-acetyl-d-galactosamine , the elevated extracellular PN-to-PS ratio resulted in the obviously increased extracellular hydrophobicity and aggregation capacity. Additionally, the overtly enriched phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway was also vital to increasing extracellular hydrophobicity to accelerate aggregation. Understanding aggregation capacity variation is useful for advancing anammox aggregation for its application in wastewater treatment.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15471839>Increased cell death after therapy with an Arg-Gly-Asp-linked somatostatin analog.</a></h2><p>Receptor-targeted scintigraphy and radionuclide therapy with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs are successfully applied for somatostatin receptor-positive tumors.

The peptide also stimulated insulin release from 1.1B4 human-derived clonal β-cells and isolated mouse islets and improved glucose tolerance concomitant with increased circulating insulin concentrations in mice following intraperitoneal administration. The insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D was not associated with membrane depolarization or an increase in intracellular [Ca] but incubation of the peptide (1 μM) with BRIN-BD11 cells produced a modest, but significant (P < 0.05), increase in cAMP production. Stimulation of insulin release was abolished in protein kinase A-downregulated cells but maintained in protein kinase C-downregulated cells. Circular dichroism studies showed that, in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles, frenatin 2D exhibited a helical content of 35% and a turn content of 28%. Substitution of the , Asn, Pro, and Ile residues in frenatin-2D by Trp and interchange of Pro and  led to loss of insulinotropic activity but the [D1W] and [G7W] analogues were as potent and effective as the native peptide. Frenatin 2D (1 μM) also stimulated proliferation of BRIN-BD11 cells and provided significant protection of the cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. It is concluded that the insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, by the K channel-independent pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Common features of the mtDNA in Candida species are a strong A+T pressure on protein coding genes, and insufficient mitochondrial tRNA species are encoded to perform protein synthesis. The wobble site of the anticodon is always U for the NNR (NNA and NNG) codon families, which are dominated by A-ending codons, and always G for the NNY (NNC and NNU) codon families, which is dominated by U-ending codons, and always U for the NNN (NNA, NNU, NNC and NNG) codon families, which are dominated by A-ending codons and U-ending codons. Patterns of synonymous codon usage of Candida species can be classified into three groups: (1) optimal codon-anticodon usage, Glu, Lys, Leu (translated by anti-codon UAA), Gln, Arg (translated by anti-codon UCU) and Trp are containing NNR codons. NNA, whose corresponding tRNA is encoded in the mtDNA, is used preferentially. (2) Non-optimal codon-anticodon usage, Cys, Asp, , His, Asn, Ser (translated by anti-codon GCU) and Tyr are containing NNY codons. The NNU codon, whose corresponding tRNA is not encoded in the mtDNA, is used preferentially. (3) Combined codon-anticodon usage, Ala, Gly, Leu (translated by anti-codon UAG), Pro, Ser (translated by anti-codon UGA),  and Val are containing NNN codons. NNA (tRNA encoded in the mtDNA) and NNU (tRNA not encoded in the mtDNA) are used preferentially. In conclusion, we propose that in Candida species, codons containing A or U at third position are used preferentially, regardless of whether corresponding tRNAs are encoded in the mtDNA. These results might be useful in understanding the common features of the mtDNA in Candida species and patterns of synonymous codon usage.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8181980>Low-protein, crystalline amino acid-supplemented, sorghum-soybean meal diets for the 10- to 20-kilogram pig.</a></h2><p>Five randomized block design experiments were conducted to determine the limiting amino acids (or other nutrients) in low-CP (12%) sorghum-soybean meal (S-SBM) diets for the 10- to 20-kg pig.

The protein degradation characteristics of BSD1 was studied with rice protein as the sole nitrogen source. Maximum protein degradation activity was obtained when BSD1 was inoculated with an inoculum of 5% into a medium with glucose as carbon source and initial pH value of 7.0 and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. In this optimal condition, protein concentration decreased from 156.8 mg/L to 19.2 mg/L, and protein degradation efficiency of BSD1 reached 88%. Free amino acid analysis showed that the content of , Tyr, Pro, Ala, Lys,  and His increased in protein degradation process. After degradation, NHN concentration producing in medium supernatant reached 232.2 mg/L. These results indicated the strain BSD1 could transform proteins into free amino acids and eventually convert them to ammonium or ammonia. Furthermore, strain BSD1 could also be used for deproteinization of brewery spent diatomite and 51% of proteins in spent diatomite were degraded. After biological deproteinization the specific surface area and total pore volume of diatomite improved obviously.

Occupancy of these G-protein-coupled receptors by formyl peptides has been shown to induce regulatory phosphorylation of cytoplasmic serine/threonine amino acid residues in heterologously expressed recombinant receptors, but the biochemistry of these modifications in primary human neutrophils remains relatively unstudied. FPR1 and FPR2 were partially immunopurified using antibodies that recognize both receptors (NFPRa) or unphosphorylated FPR1 (NFPRb) in dodecylmaltoside extracts of unstimulated and N-formyl-Met-Leu- (fMLF) + cytochalasin B-stimulated neutrophils or their membrane fractions. After deglycosylation and separation by SDS-PAGE, excised Coomassie Blue-staining bands (∼34,000 Mr) were tryptically digested, and FPR1, phospho-FPR1, and FPR2 content was confirmed by peptide mass spectrometry. C-terminal FPR1 peptides (Leu(312)-Arg(322) and Arg(323)-Lys(350)) and extracellular FPR1 peptide (Ile(191)-Arg(201)) as well as three similarly placed FPR2 peptides were identified in unstimulated and fMLF + cytochalasin B-stimulated samples. LC/MS/MS identified seven isoforms of Ala(323)-Lys(350) only in the fMLF + cytochalasin B-stimulated sample. These were individually phosphorylated at (325), Ser(328), (329), (331), Ser(332), (334), and (339). No phospho-FPR2 peptides were detected. Cytochalasin B treatment of neutrophils decreased the sensitivity of fMLF-dependent NFPRb recognition 2-fold, from EC50 = 33 ± 8 to 74 ± 21 nM. Our results suggest that 1) partial immunopurification, deglycosylation, and SDS-PAGE separation of FPRs is sufficient to identify C-terminal FPR1 Ser/ phosphorylations by LC/MS/MS; 2) kinases/phosphatases activated in fMLF/cytochalasin B-stimulated neutrophils produce multiple C-terminal tail FPR1 Ser/ phosphorylations but have little effect on corresponding FPR2 sites; and 3) the extent of FPR1 phosphorylation can be monitored with C-terminal tail FPR1-phosphospecific antibodies.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30418772> Alternations of Amino Acids, γ-Aminobutyric Acid, and Salicylic Acid in Solanum lycopersicum (L.)

Our previous studies have indicated that a region encompassing residues 6-11 (RKKIQF) and phospho--34, of phospho-DARPP-32, interacts with PP1. However, little is known about specific regions of inhibitor-2 that interact with PP1. We have now characterized in detail the interaction of phospho-DARPP-32 and inhibitor-2 with PP1. Mutagenesis studies indicate that within DARPP-32 -11 and Ile-9 play critical roles, with Lys-7 playing a lesser role in inhibition of PP1. Pro-33 and Pro-35 are also important, as is the number of amino acids between residues 7 and 11 and phospho--34. For inhibitor-2, deletion of amino acids 1-8 (I2-(9-204)) or 100-204 (I2-(1-99)) had little effect on the ability of the mutant proteins to inhibit PP1. Further deletion of residues 9-13 (I2-(14-204)) resulted in a large decrease in inhibitory potency (IC50 approximately 800 nM), whereas further COOH-terminal deletion (I2-(1-84)) caused a moderate decrease in inhibitory potency (IC50 approximately 10 nM). Within residues 9-13 (PIKGI), mutagenesis indicated that Ile-10, Lys-11, and Ile-13 play critical roles.

Classical inhibitors of DHFR use an active transport mechanism to gain access to the cell; disabling this mechanism creates a pathway for resistance. In response, recent research focuses on nonclassical -soluble DHFR inhibitors that are designed to passively diffuse through the membrane. Here, a new series of propargyl-linked antifolates are investigated as potential nonclassical human DHFR inhibitors. Several of these compounds exhibit potent enzyme inhibition with 50% inhibition concentration values under 500 nM. Molecular docking investigations show that the compounds maintain conserved hydrogen bonds between the pyrimidine ring and the enzyme as well as form van der Waals interactions with critical residues in the active site. Interestingly, the most potent compound, 2,4-diamino-5-(3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-1-ynyl)-6-ethylpyrimidine (compound 35), is 3500-fold more potent than trimethoprim, a potent inhibitor of bacterial DHFR but weak inhibitor of human DHFR. The two structural differences between compound 35 and trimethoprim show that the propargyl linkage and the substitution at C6 of the pyrimidine ring are critical to the formation of contacts with  56, Ser 59, Ile 60, Leu 22,  31 and  34 and hence, to enhancing potency. The propargyl-linked antifolates are efficient ligands with a high ratio of potency to the number of non-hydrogen atoms and represent a potentially fruitful avenue for future development of antineoplastic agents.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A hexadecapeptide with the amino acid sequence -Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly-Ala-Tyr-Asp-Pro-Leu-Ser-Ala-Gly---Asp was identified and designated starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP). Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the SMP precursor protein revealed that it comprises 12 copies of SMP as well as 3 peptides (7 copies in total) that are structurally related to SMP. Analysis of the expression of SMP precursor transcripts in P. pectinifera using qPCR revealed the highest expression in the radial nerve cords and lower expression levels in a range of neuromuscular tissues, including the apical muscle, tube feet and cardiac stomach. Consistent with these findings, SMP also caused relaxation of tube foot and cardiac stomach preparations. Furthermore, SMP caused relaxation of apical muscle preparations from another starfish species - Asterias amurensis. Collectively, these data indicate that SMP has a general physiological role as a muscle relaxant in starfish. Interestingly, comparison of the sequence of the SMP precursor with known neuropeptide precursors revealed that SMP belongs to a bilaterian family of neuropeptides that include molluscan pedal peptides (PP) and arthropodan orcokinins (OK). This is the first study to determine the function of a PP/OK-type peptide in a deuterostome. Pedal peptide/orcokinin (PP/OK)-type peptides are a family of structurally related neuropeptides that were first identified and functionally characterised in protostomian invertebrates. Here, we report the discovery of starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP), a novel member of the PP/OK-type neuropeptide identified in the starfish Patiria pectinifera (phylum Echinodermata). SMP is the first PP/OK-type neuropeptide to be functionally characterised in a deuterostome.© 2016 The Authors.

The exo-PGase was purified to homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, through sequential column chromatographies. The enzyme had a molecular  of approximately 45,000 and an isoelectric point of pH 5.8. The N-terminal sequence was Ser-Met-Gln-Lys-Ile-Lys-Asp-Glu-Ile-Leu-Lys--Leu-Lys-Val-Pro-Val- and had no sequence similarity to those of other pectinolytic enzymes reported to date. Maximum activity toward polygalacturonic acid (PGA) was observed at 60 degrees C and at pH 7.0 in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer without requiring any metal ions. When the chain length of oligogalacturonic acids increased, the apparent Km for them decreased, but the kcat values increased.

Many kinases are regulated via phosphorylation within their activation loop. This loop is embedded in the activation segment, which additionally contains the Mg binding loop and a P + 1 loop that is important in substrate binding. In this report, we identify Abl-mediated phosphorylation of a highly conserved Tyr residue in the P + 1 loop of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) during oxidative stress. Remarkably, we observed that the three human PKD isoforms display very different degrees of P + 1 loop Tyr phosphorylation and we identify one of the molecular determinants for this divergence. This is paralleled by a different activation mechanism of PKD1 and PKD2 during oxidative stress. Tyr phosphorylation in the P + 1 loop of PKD2 increases turnover for Syntide-2, while substrate specificity and the role of PKD2 in NF-κB signaling remain unaffected. Importantly, Tyr to  substitution renders the kinase inactive, jeopardizing its use as a non-phosphorylatable mutant. Since large-scale proteomics studies identified P + 1 loop Tyr phosphorylation in more than 70 Ser/ kinases in multiple conditions, our results do not only demonstrate differential regulation/function of PKD isoforms under oxidative stress, but also have implications for kinase regulation in general.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690286>Isolation and characterisation of in vitro and cellular free radical scavenging peptides from corn peptide fractions.</a></h2><p>Corn gluten meal, a corn processing industry by-product, is a good source for the preparation of bioactive peptides due to its special amino acid composition. In the present study, the in vitro and cellular free radical scavenging activities of corn peptide fractions (CPFs) were investigated. Results indicated that CPF1 (molecular weight less than 1 kDa) and CPF2 (molecular weight between 1 and 3 kDa) exhibited good hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion radical and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Meanwhile, the in vitro radical scavenging activity of CPF1 was slightly higher than that of CPF2. Both CPF1 and CPF2 also exhibited significant cytoprotective effects and intracellular reactive  species scavenging activity in Caco-2 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The amino acid composition analysis revealed that the CPF were rich in hydrophobic amino acids, which comprised of more than 45% of total amino acids. An antioxidant peptide sequence of Tyr--Cys-Leu- (YFCLT) was identified from CPF1 using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS). The YFCLT exhibited excellent ABTS radical scavenging activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of 37.63 µM, which was much lower than that of Trolox.

The objective was to evaluate the effect of feeding betaine-containing molasses on performance of transition dairy cows during late summer in 2 trials. In early September, cows were randomly assigned to betaine (BET) or control (CON) groups either shortly after dry off (trial 1; n = 10 per treatment) or 24 d before calving (trial 2; n = 8 per treatment) based on parity and previous mature equivalent milk yield. Cows were fed common diets supplemented either with a liquid supplement made of molasses from sugar cane and condensed beet solubles containing betaine [BET, 89.1 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] or a sugar cane molasses-based liquid supplement without betaine (CON) until 8 wk postpartum. The liquid supplements had similar nutrient contents and were fed at a rate of 1.1 and 1.4 kg DM/d for pre- and postpartum cows, respectively. Starting at their entry in the studies, cows were housed in the same freestall barn without a cooling system. After calving, all cows were housed in the same barn cooled by misters and fans and milked thrice daily. Intake was recorded daily and  and  condition score were assessed every 2 wk. Milk yield was recorded at each milking and composition was analyzed weekly. Blood samples were collected weekly from a subset of cows to assess concentrations of metabolites and AA. No treatment effects were apparent for DM intake and  in the prepartum and postpartum periods. For cows enrolled at dry off, BET supported higher milk yield (45.1 vs. 41.9 kg/d) and fat content (4.78 vs. 4.34%) and elevated plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in early lactation compared to CON. However, no differences were observed for milk yield, most milk component contents and yields, and blood metabolites between treatments for cows enrolled during the close-up period. Compared to cows in the CON group, BET cows enrolled during the far-off period tended to have lower plasma concentrations of Met, , and Trp during the pre- and postpartum periods. They also had lower plasma concentrations of Lys and  before calving but higher plasma Gly concentration after parturition. In conclusion, feeding a betaine-containing liquid supplement from far-off through early lactation improves lactation performance but increases adipose tissue mobilization and production of ketone bodies in early lactation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

This study presents a statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein complexes. A one-node-per-residue elastic network model accounting for the nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the interatomic interactions through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations than core residues in agreement with experimental observations. Ranking residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct classification of amino acids into three groups: (i) highly fluctuating-Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, and Asp, (ii) moderately fluctuating-, Asn, Gln, Lys, Glu, Arg, Val, and Cys, and (iii) weakly fluctuating-Ile, Leu, Met, , Tyr, Trp, and His. The structural instability in proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences, and disordered proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Trp have a propensity to form more stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein structures.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573843>Triennial Lactation Symposium: Mammary metabolism of amino acids in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met,  (+Tyr), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, , and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of +Tyr uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling  supply did not result in mammary oxidation of +Tyr and either limited or no contribution of peptides to  and Tyr mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (Ile, Leu, Val, and Lys) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing Lys supply decreased Lys U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and , does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the  U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than  supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for  provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as gluconeogenesis and  supply, in other tissues to support lactation.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30415874>Characterization of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) expression and antiproliferative effect of somatostatin analogues in aggressive thyroid cancers.</a></h2><p>Certain human carcinomas have demonstrated a distinct expression of somatostatin receptors.

Capillary immunoblotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the basal expression of protein and mRNA of SSTR1-SSTR5. Cells were treated with the somatostatin analogues octreotide, pasireotride (SOM230), and KE-108 for 48h. IC was determined via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and cell proliferation was measured by viable cell count. Presence of SSTR2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that most cell lines expressed SSTR1-SSTR3 and SSTR5 in varying degrees. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that mRNA expression for SSTR2 and SSTR3 correlated with protein expression. MTT assays showed that KE-108 and SOM230 were able to inhibit cell proliferation. Tissue microarray (TMA) showed that SSTR2 was highly expressed in human tissues of aggressive thyroid carcinomas.Follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer express SSTR1-3 and SSTR5 in distinct fashions both at a message and protein level.

A Lolium rigidum population collected from the Western Australian grain belt with a 12-year trifluralin use history was characterised for resistance to dinitroaniline, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase)- and acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides. Target-site resistance mechanisms were investigated.This L. rigidum population exhibited 32-fold resistance to trifluralin, as compared with the susceptible population.

In addition, this population showed multiple resistance to commonly used post-emergence ACCase- and ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Two target-site α-tubulin gene mutations (Val-202- and -239-Ile) previously documented in other dinitroaniline-resistant weed species were identified, and some known target-site mutations in ACCase (Ile-1781-Leu, Asp-2078-Gly and Cys-2088-Arg) and ALS (Pro-197-Gln/Ser) were found in the same population.

The molecular  of the two proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were similar (about 30,000). Both proteins provided protection against the cytocidal effect of TNF in vitro and both bound TNF-alpha more effectively than TNF-beta. Antibodies raised against each of the proteins had an inhibitory effect on the binding of TNF to cells, suggesting that both proteins are structurally related to the TNF receptors.

The relative efficacy of anti-sera against the two proteins in inhibiting the binding of TNF to cells varied markedly from one line of cells to another.

Mono- and bicyclic peptides with (4-aminomethyl)phenylazobenzoic acid as backbone constituent.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that backbone cyclization of octapeptides with the photoresponsive (4-aminomethyl)phenylazobenzoic acid imparts sufficient restraints to induce and stabilize ordered conformations of the peptide backbone in both the cis- and trans-azo-isomers (L. Ulysse, J. Cubillos, and J. Chmielewski, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1995, Vol. 117, pp. 8466-8467). Correspondingly, the active-site octapeptide fragment H-Ala-Cys-Ala--Cys-Asp-Gly--OH [134-141] of thioredoxin reductase, with its high preference for a 3(10)-helix turn conformation centered on the -Cys sequence, was backbone cyclized with this azobenzene moiety in the attempt to design a photoresponsive system where the conformational states of the peptide backbone are dictated by the configuration of the azobenzene and can be further modulated by the disulfide bridge. Nuclear magnetic resonance conformational analysis of the monocyclic compound clearly revealed the presence of two conformational families in both the cis- and trans-azo configuration. Of the higher populated conformational families, the structure of the trans-isomer seems like a pretzel-like folding, while the cis-isomer relaxes into a significantly less defined conformational state that does not exhibit any regular structural elements. Further restrictions imparted by disulfide bridging of the peptide moiety leads to an even better defined conformation for the trans-azo-isomer, whereas the cis-isomer can be described as a frustrated system without pronounced  minima and thus with little conformational preferences. Our findings would suggest that this photoresponsive peptide template may not be of general usefulness for light-induced conformational transitions between two well-defined conformational states at least under the experimental conditions employed, even in the bicyclic form. However, trans --> cis isomerization of the bicyclic peptide is accompanied by a switch from a well-defined conformation to an ensemble of possible conformations.Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28374069>Mu and kappa opioid receptors of the periaqueductal gray stimulate and inhibit thermogenesis, respectively, during psychological stress in rats.</a></h2><p>The periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is rich in mu and kappa opioid receptors, and this system is involved in thermoregulation, analgesia, and defensive behaviors. No study approached the involvement of the PAG opioids in body temperature (Tb) regulation during psychological stress such as restraint.

Protein phosphatases are divided into two major groups: tyrosine (Tyr) phosphatases and serine/threonine (Ser/) phosphatases. Substrate trapping mutants are frequently used to characterize Tyr phosphatases and identify their substrates; however, a rapid and simple method to identify substrates for Ser/ phosphatases has yet to be developed. Recently it has reported that AlF4 -/AlF3 and BeF3 - form a complex with Mg2+ in the catalytic center of FCP/SCP phosphatases, and that the Mg2+-AlF4 -/AlF3 complex mimics the transition state of the hydrolysis step, while the Mg2+-BeF3 - complex mimics the aspartylphosphate intermediate.The main objective of this study was to develop a novel methodology, termed Phosphorylation Mimic Phage Display (PMPD), to identify substrates for Ser/ phosphatase Scp1 using peptide phage display libraries with Mg2+ and AlF4 -.Recombinant protein of human full-length Scp1 (rScp1) expressed in E. coli system was purified by Co2+ chelated affinity column, and then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The Ph.D.-C7C or M12 Phage Display Libraries (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were screened using purified rScp1 immobilized on ELISA plate. Then, the plate was blocked with 0.5% (w/v) BSA in maleate buffer at 4°C for 3 h, before adding approximately 1×1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the phages in maleate blocking AlF4 - buffer to each well. After incubating, the wells were washed with maleate AlF4 - buffer to remove unbound phages. Then, phages were eluted with Mg2+ and AlF4 - free maleate buffer or with excess rScp1. After the third round of screening, the isolated phages were sequenced and subjected to binding analyses.After panning by PMPD method, 46 and 60 clones were isolated from the Ph.D. C7C and Ph.D. 12 phage libraries, respectively, as Mg2+ or/and AlF4 - -dependent binding clones. The binding analyses showed that M12-1 and Dep-3 specifically bind to Scp1 in an AlF4 --dependent manner. Notably, the Dep-3 peptide contained a -Pro-Met-Ser sequence, which is similar to the Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5 (Ser/-Pro-partially hydrophobic residue-Ser) sequence found in CTD, which is an endogenous substrate for Scp1. Binding analyses also showed that both BP-14 and M12-6a bound to Scp1 in a Mg2+-dependent manner. BP-14 peptide contained Ser- -Tyr and Pro--Glu sequences, which are similar to the Ser--Trp and Ile--Glu sequences found in M12-6a, suggesting that one or both of these tripeptides may be the binding motif(s) recognized by Scp1.We developed a substrate identification method for the Ser/ phosphatase Scp1 using a novel phage display method with AlF4 -. Dep-3 showed a core sequence similar to that of the CTD of RNA polymerase II, an endogenous Scp1 substrate, suggesting that this method is applicable for identifying novel Scp1 substrate candidates. This method will also be applicable for other FCP/SCP-type phosphatases, allowing us to better understand the substrate recognition mechanisms of Ser/ phosphatases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25605306>Structural insights into the multispecific recognition of dipeptides of deep-sea gram-negative bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain SM9913.</a></h2><p>Peptide uptake is important for nutrition supply for marine bacteria. It is also an important step in marine nitrogen cycling. However, how marine bacteria absorb peptides is still not fully understood. DppA is the periplasmic dipeptide binding protein of dipeptide permease (Dpp; an important peptide transporter in bacteria) and exclusively controls the substrate specificity of Dpp. Here, the substrate binding specificity of deep-sea Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain SM9913 DppA (PsDppA) was analyzed for 25 different dipeptides with various properties by using isothermal titration calorimetry measurements. PsDppA showed binding affinities for 8 dipeptides. To explain the multispecific substrate recognition mechanism of PsDppA, we solved the crystal structures of unliganded PsDppA and of PsDppA in complex with 4 different types of dipeptides (Ala-, Met-Leu, Gly-Glu, and Val-). PsDppA alternates between an "open" and a "closed" form during substrate binding. Structural analyses of the 4 PsDppA-substrate complexes combined with mutational assays indicate that PsDppA binds to different substrates through a precise mechanism: dipeptides are bound mainly by the interactions between their backbones and PsDppA, in particular by anchoring their N and C termini through ion-pair interactions; hydrophobic interactions are important in binding hydrophobic dipeptides; and Lys457 is necessary for the binding of dipeptides with a C-terminal glutamic acid or glutamine. Additionally, sequence alignment suggests that the substrate recognition mechanism of PsDppA may be common in Gram-negative bacteria. All together, our results provide structural insights into the multispecific substrate recognition mechanism of marine Gram-negative bacterial DppA, which provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of marine bacterial peptide uptake.Peptide uptake plays a significant role in nutrition supply for marine bacteria. It is also an important step in marine nitrogen cycling. However, how marine bacteria recognize and absorb peptides is still unclear. This study analyzed the substrate binding specificity of deep-sea Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain SM9913 DppA (PsDppA; the dipeptide-binding protein of dipeptide permease) and solved the crystal structures of unliganded PsDppA and PsDppA in complex with 4 different types of dipeptides. The multispecific recognition mechanism of PsDppA for dipeptides is explained based on structural and mutational analyses. We also find that the substrate-binding mechanism of PsDppA may be common in Gram-negative bacteria.

Gel permeation and reverse-phase HPLC fractionation of crude pancreatic extracts resolved a single molecular form of gull PP in each case. Purification of gull PP to homogeneity indicated that the mammalian PP antiserum employed was only 4% cross-reactive with this peptide. When radioimmunoassay data were corrected for this, the herring gull pancreas was found to contain 5 nmol PP/g wet wt. The molecular mass of gull PP was determined as 4237 +/- 2 Da by 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectroscopy (PDMS). Gas-phase sequencing established unequivocally the entire primary structure of a 36-amino-acid residue peptide as Gly-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro--Tyr-Pro-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Pro-Val-Glu-Asp-Leu-Val- Arg- - Try-Asn-Asp-Leu-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Val-Val--Arg-His-Arg-Tyr. The computed molecular mass of this peptide (4235.6 Da) was in close agreement with that derived by PDMS. The primary structure of herring gull PP differs from that of the chicken in four residues at positions 3 (Val/Ser), 18 (Val/IIe), 22 (Asn/Asp), and 23 (Asp/Asn). Avian PP thus appears to be a highly conserved regulatory peptide.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12169210>Comparative study of some energetic and steric parameters of the wild type and mutants HIV-1 protease: a way to explain the viral resistance.</a></h2><p>Because, in vivo, the HIV-1 PR ( HIV-1 protease) present a high mutation rate we performed a comparative study of the energetic behaviors of the wild type HIV-1 PR and four type of mutants: Val82/Asn; Val82/Asp; Gln7/Lys, Leu33/Ile, Leu63/Ile; Ala71/, Val82/Ala.

As such, developing a greater understanding of their substrate selectivity would expand our ability to engineer the enzymatic or microbial production of a broad range of small-molecule targets. Here, we report the crystal structures and biochemical characterization of Acat2 and Acat5, two biosynthetic thiolases from Ascaris suum with varying selectivity toward branched compared to linear compounds. The structure of the Acat2-C91S mutant bound to propionyl-CoA shows that the terminal methyl group of the substrate, representing the α-branch point, is directed toward the conserved  288 and Met 158 residues. In Acat5, the  ring is rotated to accommodate a hydroxyl-π interaction with an adjacent  side chain, decreasing space in the binding pocket and possibly accounting for its strong preference for linear substrates compared to Acat2. Comparison of the different Acat thiolase structures shows that Met 158 is flexible, adopting alternate conformations with the side chain rotated toward or away from a covering loop at the back of the active site. Mutagenesis of residues in the covering loop in Acat5 with the corresponding residues from Acat2 allows for highly increased accommodation of branched substrates, whereas the converse mutations do not significantly affect Acat2 substrate selectivity.

Both AKHs are released into the blood during flight and serve to regulate  and other physiological processes involved in flight. By in vitro "pulse-chase" experiments we show that 2 precursors (P1 and P2) are involved in AKH biosynthesis. These are about 8.4 kDa polypeptides which are AKH immunoreactive but also contain an amino acid (tyrosine) not present in the AKH peptides. By following the fate of 14C-tyrosine incorporated into P1 and P2, we have identified 2 novel products of precursor processing. These are called AKH-Precursor Related Peptides or APRP 1 and APRP 2. Size exclusion chromatography shows that the APRPs are about 6.5 kDa large and therefore represent major fragments of the precursors. The optical density peaks corresponding to P1, P2, APRP 1, and APRP 2 on a reverse-phase chromatogram are identified. The precursors being metabolic intermediates are represented by minor optical density peaks that disappear when de novo protein synthesis is blocked by cycloheximide. In contrast, the APRPs are represented by major optical density peaks consistent with their being accumulating end products of AKH precursor processing. The function of the APRPs is as yet unknown. They are, however, co-synthesized and also co-released with the AKHs, and may therefore also have hormonal functions related to flight.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8292014>The 100-kDa protein, whose phosphorylation precedes the fusion of chick embryonic myoblasts, is the eukaryotic elongation factor-2.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 100-kDa protein dramatically increases during the early period of myoblast fusion and inhibition of the protein phosphorylation prevents the fusion.

In this study, we have identified IRS-1 gene polymorphisms, evaluated their frequencies in Japanese subjects, and analysed the contribution of these polymorphisms to the development of NIDDM. The entire coding region of the IRS-1 gene of 94 subjects (47 NIDDM and 47 control subjects) was screened by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Seven SSCP polymorphisms were identified. These corresponded to two previously identified polymorphisms [Gly971 --> Arg (GGG --> AGG) and Ala804 (GCA --> GCG)] as well as five novel polymorphisms [Pro190 --> Arg (CCC --> CGC), Met209 -->  (ATG --> ACG), Ser809 -->  (TCT --> TTT), Leu142 (CTT --> CTC), and Gly625 (GGC --> GGT)]. Although the prevalence of each of these polymorphisms was not statistically different between NIDDM and control subjects, the prevalence of the four IRS-1 polymorphisms with an amino acid substitution together was significantly higher in NIDDM than in control subjects (23.4 vs 8.5%, p < 0.05), and two substitutions (Met 209 -->  and Ser809 --> ) were found only in NIDDM patients. Equilibrium glucose infusion rates during a euglycaemic clamp in NIDDM and control subjects with the IRS-1 polymorphisms decreased by 29.5 and 22.0%, respectively on the average when compared to those in comparable groups without polymorphisms, although they were not statistically significant. Thus, IRS-1 polymorphisms may contribute in part to the insulin resistance and development of NIDDM in Japanese subjects; however, they do not account for the major part of the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake which is observed in subjects with clinically apparent NIDDM.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26812323>Effect of heat stress on the endogenous intestinal loss of amino acids in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) increases the death of intestinal cells in pigs, which, in turn, may elevate the endogenous intestinal loss (EIL) of proteins and AA.

The following day, all pigs were still under TN conditions and ileal content was collected during 12 consecutive hours, at the end of which and for the following 8 d the pigs were exposed to natural HS conditions (31 to 37°C). Ileal content was collected again on d 2 (HS at d 2 [HSd2]) and 8 (HS at d 8 [HSd8]). Body temperature (BT) was measured in another group of 8 pigs every 15 min during the whole study. The average BT at HSd2 (39.6°C) was higher ( < 0.05) compared with both TN conditions (38.6°C) and HSd8 (38.8°C), but it did not differ between TN conditions and HSd8.

Intrathecal administration of the DOR selective agonist deltorphin II failed to induce antihyperalgesic effects in MOR-KO mice, whereas it dose-dependently reversed thermal hyperalgesia in wild-type mice. The antihyperalgesic effects of deltorphin II were blocked by naltrindole but not d--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2) (CTOP) suggesting that this agonist was mainly acting through DOR. SNC80-induced antihyperalgesic effects in MOR-KO mice were also attenuated as compared with littermate controls. In contrast, kappa opioid receptor knockout did not affect deltorphin II-induced antihyperalgesia. As evaluated using mice lacking endogenous opioid peptides, the regulation of DOR's effects was also independent of beta-endorphin, enkephalins, or dynorphin opioids known to be released during persistent . We therefore conclude that DOR-mediated antihyperalgesia is dependent on MOR expression but that activation of MOR by endogenous opioids is probably not required.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145747>Identification, structure-activity relationship and in silico molecular docking analyses of five novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides from stone fish (Actinopyga lecanora) hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>Stone fish is an under-utilized sea cucumber with many health benefits.

However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also have high sensitivity, attributable to low background fluorescence, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors.

Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (6). Several families of proteases are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (7-10). The gelatinase family is a subgroup of MMPs consisting of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) (11). Gelatinase expression in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages, is highly regulated. Elevated levels of gelatinases have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (12). A cyclic peptide, c(CTTHWGFTLC)NH (C1), was identified by phage screening to be potent inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (13); however, C1 is readily degraded . A synthetic peptide, c(KAHWGFTLD)NH (C6), was linked with a Cy5.5 NIR dye molecule  the α-NH of Lys to form Cy5.5-C6 for  imaging of MMP-2/-9 activity (14). Cy5.5-C6 is being developed for NIR fluorescence imaging of MMP-2/-9 proteolytic activity in tumors.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2054098>The adipokinetic neuropeptide of Mantodea.

After brief enzymatic digestion by 5-oxoprolylpeptidase the primary structure of the peptide of each species was determined by pulsed-liquid phase sequencing employing Edman degradation. The C-terminus of both peptides was blocked, as indicated by the lack of digestion with carboxypeptidase A. The peptides of both species were identical: a blocked, uncharged octapeptide with the sequence L-Glu-Val-Asn---Pro-Asn-Trp-NH2. The peptide is now called mantid adipokinetic hormone (Emp-AKH). The synthetic peptide was chromatographically indistinguishable from the natural compound and increased blood lipids in locusts and blood carbohydrates in cockroaches when administered in low doses. The structural features clearly define the peptide as a novel member of the large AKH/RPCH-family of peptides. Seven amino-acid residues are at identical positions in Emp-AKH when compared with the adipokinetic hormone of a dragonfly (Lia-AKH) and the hypertrehalosaemic hormone I from the American cockroach (Pea-CAH-I).

The models included estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 and MX-1 and estrogen-sensitive MCF-7-MIII tumors. Nude mice bearing xenografts of these cancers were injected i.v. with 250 nmol/kg doses of cytotoxic radical AN-201, cytotoxic analog AN-238 or the unconjugated mixture of AN-201 and sst analog RC-121. Significant inhibition of growth of MDA-MB-231, MX-1 and MCF-7-MIII tumors was observed 1 week after injection of a single dose of cytotoxic analog AN-238. The volume of MDA-MB-231 tumors remained significantly decreased 3 weeks after treatment. The volumes and  of MCF-7-MIII tumors continued to be significantly reduced 60 days after therapy with AN-238. AN-238 also caused complete regression of MX-1 tumors in 5 of 10 animals, which remained tumor-free 60 days after treatment. In contrast, after treatment with cytotoxic radical AN-201, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7-MIII tumors grew steadily and the regression of MX-1 tumors was only transitory in most animals. Toxicity of AN-201 was much greater than that of AN-238, as measured by animal deaths, loss of  and leukopenia. High-affinity sst receptors and mRNA for both sst(2) and sst(5) subtypes were found in all 3 tumor lines. Expression of sst receptors was not significantly affected by treatment with AN-238.

(1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15298-15303]. To elucidate the role of Tyr80 in stabilizing the enzyme, the KNTase gene was modified by site-directed mutagenesis so that the codon for Asp80 of the wild type was replaced by that for Ser, , Ala, Val, Leu,  and Trp, respectively. The eight mutant KNTases including Tyr80 were all purified, as well as the wild-type enzyme. The heat-inactivation rate constants were determined at 58 degrees C and the half-life values were found to be correlated with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues replaced at the unique position. The Gibbs  change of unfolding in water of KNTase assessed from urea denaturation (25 degrees C, pH 7.0) was also found to be correlated with hydrophobicity. The results suggest that different amino acids at position 80 of KNTase contribute to the stability of the protein by hydrophobic interactions. In the case of tyrosine at position 80 the unusually high stability of the enzyme compared to the Phe80 enzyme suggests that the hydroxyl group also contributes to the conformational stability.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626507>Effects of herbage ingestion upon ileal digestibility of amino acids in heavy Iberian pigs fed on an acorn-based diet.</a></h2><p>We conducted two experiments with heavy Iberian pigs to determine the ileal digestibility of amino acids (AA) in acorns and freshly cut herbage, and the effects of adding fresh herbage upon the supply of ileal digestible AA when pigs were fed on holm-oak acorns. In Experiment 1, carried out in cannulated pigs of 107 kg bodyweight (BW), daily intake of acorns reached 44.9 g DM/kg(0.75) BW. Arg, His and  showed the lowest apparent ileal digestibility (AID) values, whereas Met, the branched-chain AA and  had the highest coefficients. The AID of total EAA was 0.716 but only 0.222 for NEAA. Most of the digestive and absorptive processes of acorn protein occurred before the hindgut. Acorn provides (per kg DM) 2.27 g apparent ileal digestible Lys and 22.7 g apparent total digestible AA. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) values for EAA, NEAA and total AA were 0.924 ± 0.020, 0.784 ± 0.041 and 0.860 ± 0.029. In Experiment 2 fresh herbage was given to six cannulated Iberian pigs of 140 kg either as a single feed (13.7 g DM/kg(0.75) BW) or as a supplement to acorns (28.4 g DM/kg(0.75) BW). When only freshly cut forage was offered the AID of the EAA, NEAA and total AA was close to 0.65 and supplied (per kg DM ingested) 5.61 g AID Lys and 91.7 g digestible AA. Standardized ileal values were 0.744 ± 0.023, 0.912 ± 0.038 and 0.831 ± 0.030 respectively. The addition of fresh forage to the acorns led to a significant decrease in AID of AA in acorn due to digesta transfer to the hindgut: His (p < 0.01), Met (p < 0.001),  (p = 0.092),  (p < 0.05) and Val (p < 0.05), but Arg, Lys and the branched-chain AA remained unaffected. The main contribution of herbage to AA nutrition of the grazing Iberian pig relies mainly on increasing the supply of digestible AA for pig tissues.© 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329054>Immune system stimulation induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Changes in plasma free AA flux reflect the modification of AA metabolism in different metabolic states. Immune system stimulation (ISS) in growing pigs may redistribute AA from protein retention towards processes involved in the immune response, thus impacting AA utilization. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of ISS on whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization and the kinetics of plasma free AA. Ten gilts (BW 9.4 ± 1.1 kg) were surgically fitted with jugular vein catheters, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Repeated intramuscular injections of increasing amounts of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to induce ISS (30 and 36 µg/kg BW, given 48 h apart). Whole-body N-balance was determined for 3-d before ISS (ISS-) and 3-d during ISS (ISS+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for determination of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma-free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected before and 76-h after the initiation of ISS and assayed for hematology and blood chemistry. Body temperature (BT) was monitored during the course of study. Blood chemistry, hematology, and BT results indicated that LPS induced effective ISS in pigs (P < 0.05). ISS tended to reduce N retention (P = 0.09) and the N retention-to-N intake ratio (P = 0.08). Apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy and AID of N were reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Ile and  was reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Strong tendencies for decreased Lys flux and N retention were observed in ISS pigs (P < 0.10). ISS increased the pool size for Leu but reduced the pool size for Ile (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that ISS alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size in growing pigs. The decrease in Lys, , and Ile flux during ISS may be attributed to a reduction in whole-body protein synthesis or decreased catabolism of these AA. Relative to other AA, dietary Lys, , and Ile requirements may decrease in ISS pigs.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8312239>Comparison of the ileal and faecal digestibility of dietary amino acids in adult humans and evaluation of the pig as a model animal for digestion studies in man.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to determine if there is a difference between ileal and faecal assays for determining amino acid and N digestibilities in adult human subjects. Comparison of true ileal amino acid and N digestibilities was also made between adult human subjects and growing pigs to establish the usefulness of the pig as a model animal. Five subjects with established ileostomies and six subjects with intact large bowels consumed a constant diet consisting of meat, vegetables, fruit, bread and dairy products for 7 d with collection of ileostomy contents or faeces respectively over the last 4 d. The study was repeated using 25 kg  ileostomized and intact pigs. Apparent amino acid and N digestibility coefficients were determined. For human subjects the faecal digestibility values were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the ileal values for Arg, Asp, Gly, , Pro, Ser,  and Trp. The faecal digestibility of Met was significantly lower than the ileal value. Determination of DNA, diaminopimelic acid (DAPA) and the digestibilities of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose in human subjects indicated that some microbial colonization had occurred at the terminal ileum after formation of an ileostomy; however, this was not as extensive as in the large intestine. True ileum amino acid and N digestibilities were calculated after correcting for the endogenous contribution of amino acids at the terminal ileum determined using a protein-free diet. There were no significant differences between adult human subjects and pigs for true ileal dietary amino acid digestibility except for , , Cys and Met.

Four lactating, multiparous Holstein cows received 4 treatments composed of 2 basal diets containing 2 levels of PDIE (LP or HP) and 2 different infusions of AA mixtures (AA- or AA+) in the duodenum. The AA+ mixture contained Lys, Met, Leu, His, Ile, Val, , Arg, Trp, and Glu, whereas the AA- mixture contained Glu, Pro, and Ser. The infusion mixtures were iso-PDIE. The diet plus infusions provided 13.9 versus 15.8% of crude protein that corresponded to 102 versus 118g/kg of dry matter of PDIE in LP and HP treatments, respectively. The treatments were designed as a 2×2 crossover design of 2 levels of PDIE supply (LP vs. HP) with 28-d periods. Infusions of AA in the duodenum (AA- vs. AA+) were superimposed to diet within each 28-d period according to 2×2 crossover designs with 14-d subperiods. Increasing the PDIE supply tended to increase milk protein yield; however, the efficiency of PDIE utilization decreased and the plasma urea concentration increased, indicating a higher catabolism of AA. The AA+ treatments increased milk protein yield and content similarly at both levels of protein supply. This was explained by an increase in the mammary uptake of all EAA except His and Trp. The mammary uptake of non-EAA (NEAA) was altered to the increase in EAA uptake so that the total AA uptake was almost equal to milk protein output on a nitrogen basis. The ratio between NEAA to total AA uptake decreased from 46% in LPAA- to 40% in LPAA+, HPAA-, and HPAA+ treatments. The PDIE efficiency tended to increase in the AA+ versus the AA- treatments because the NEAA supply and the amount of NEAA not used by the mammary both decreased. Nevertheless, our AA+ treatments seemed not to be the ideal profile: the mammary uptake-to-output ratio for  was higher than 1 in LPAA-, but it decreased to 1 in all the other treatments, suggesting that  was deficient in these treatments. Conversely, an excess of His was indicated because its uptake was similar in AA+ and AA- treatments. In conclusion, balancing the EAA profile increased milk protein yield and metabolizable protein efficiency at both levels of protein supply by increasing the mammary uptake of EAA and altering the NEAA uptake, leading to less AA available for catabolism.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Barrows (44.2 +/- 1.3 kg of BW) were assigned to 4 diets in a randomized complete block design. Diets consisted of 16.1% CP with no CAA, and 12.8, 10.1, and 7.8% CP containing CAA. As the CP concentration decreased, CAA were gradually increased to meet requirements on a true ileal digestibility basis. Barrows were weighed on d 0 and 13. Blood samples were collected before the morning feeding on d 0, 6, and 12 (prefeeding), and 2 h after the morning feeding on d 13 (postfeeding). Pigs were euthanized on d 13, and liver and right LM were removed and weighed. The reduction in the dietary CP concentration linearly decreased (P < 0.01) ADG, G:F, LM , and the CP content of LM. Reducing the CP concentration decreased pre- and postfeeding plasma concentrations of IGF-I (linear, P < 0.01) and insulin (linear, P < 0.10). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased prefeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, Gln, Gly, and total AA but decreased Arg, Asn, His, Ile, , Trp, and Tyr (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentration of total indispensable AA decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.01). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased postfeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, Lys, Met (linear, P < 0.01), and Gly (linear, P = 0.073) and decreased Asn, Ser, Tyr, Arg, His, and Leu (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of Ile, , , Trp, and Val decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.05).

Performance from 0 to 18 d of age and the relative size of all the internal organs and intestines were not affected (all P>0.05) by dietary treatment. In addition, dietary SA had no effect (P>0.05) on the serum activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which indicated that there was no damage to skeletal muscle, heart muscle, liver, kidneys, or brain.

Male broiler chicks (96) were randomly assigned into 4 treatments containing dietary SA at 0, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10%. Dietary SA at the 0.025% level increased feed intake compared with control (P<0.05). Regression analysis indicated a quadratic response for both  gain and feed intake (P<0.05) as SA increased in the diet. Again, dietary SA did not affect the relative  of bursa of Fabricius, liver, kidney, or digestive tract. Nitrogen-corrected AME and protein digestibility were not affected by SA level. A negative linear relationship was found between dietary SA level and apparent ileal digestibility of Met, , Ser, Pro, Gly, Ala, and . Sinapic acid disappearance in the ileum was above 97% for all SA levels, whereas apparent SA retention in excreta ranged from 64 to 79%.

Thus, doxorubicin derivative 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (AN-201) can be linked to SST analogue RC-121 (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys--NH2) to form targeted cytotoxic SST analogue AN-238. In this study, we evaluated the effects of AN-238 on the growth of SST receptor (SSTR)-positive androgen-independent Dunning R-3327-AT-1 prostate cancers in Copenhagen rats. The dose range and tumor growth-inhibitory effects of AN-238 and AN-201 were investigated in preliminary experiments. Administration of cytotoxic radical AN-201 at single i.v. doses of 110, 125, and 150 nmol/kg resulted in 0, 77.7, and 100% mortality, respectively, within 6-10 days. Four weeks after the injection of 110 nmol/kg AN-201, mean tumor volume was reduced by 35.1 % (P < 0.05), as compared with controls. In contrast, a single i.v. injection of analogue AN-238 at a dose of 300 nmol/kg was nontoxic and remarkably potent in inhibiting the growth of Dunning AT-1 tumors, resulting in a 85.9% (P < 0.01) reduction in tumor volume after 4 weeks. Treatment with AN-238 extended the survival time of tumor-bearing rats from 52.0+/-3.75 to 91.8+/-3.70 days, corresponding to a 76.5% (P < 0.01) increase. In a comprehensive experiment, we compared the effects of radical AN-201 at 115 nmol/kg, analogue AN-238 at 115 and 300 nmol/kg, carrier SST analogue RC-121 at 300 nmol/kg, and a mixture of AN-201 and RC-121 at doses of 300 nmol/kg administered i.v. Administration of AN-201 at 115 nmol/kg led to 90.0% mortality in 12 days, but animals treated with 115 nmol/kg of AN-238 showed no signs of toxicity, their tumor volume was reduced by 40.0% (P < 0.05), and their tumor  was reduced by 42.8% (P < 0.01) after 4 weeks, as compared with controls. The dose of 300 nmol/kg of AN-238 was also nontoxic and diminished tumor volume by 80.9% (P < 0.01) and tumor  by 82.0% (P < 0.01). No reduction in tumor growth or toxic effects was observed with carrier RC-121, but after the injection of unconjugated mixture of AN-201 and RC-121 at doses of 300 nmol/kg, all rats died within 4 days. Specific high-affinity receptors for SST were found on Dunning R-3327-AT-1 tumor membranes by radioligand binding assay and were identified by reverse transcription-PCR as SSTR2. Our study indicates that cytotoxic SST analogue AN-238 can be targeted to SSTRs on tumors and produces a powerful inhibition of the growth of Dunning-AT-1 rat prostate cancer at doses that are nontoxic, whereas its cytotoxic component, 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin, is toxic and ineffective.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6114957>Inactivation of the bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase with dicyclohexyl[14C]carbodiimide leads to the modification of a specific glutamic acid residue in the beta subunit.</a></h2><p>When the bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase is inactivated with dicyclohexyl[14C]carbodiimide and then gel-filtered, from 2 to 3 g atoms of 14C are incorporated/mol of enzyme.

A hyperlipaemic neuropeptide was isolated from corpora cardiaca of H. alata in a single high-performance liquid chromatography step. The primary sequence of this peptide was assigned by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, biological assay and co-elution with the synthetic peptide. The adipokinetic peptide of H. alata is an octapeptide with the sequence pGlu-Leu-Asn--Ser--Gly-Trp amide denoted Schgr-AKH-II which was sequenced previously from the corpora cardiaca of a number of Caelifera, Ensifera and some Hymenoptera. A dose of 1pmol of synthetic Schgr-AKH-II causes a pronounced hyperlipaemic effect in the twig wilter. Physiological experiments with the twig wilter reveal that during flight periods of 3 min, the normally low carbohydrate concentration in the haemolymph is significantly diminished, whereas the  concentration stays constant in most cases. During a subsequent rest period of 60 min after a 3 min flight episode, however, the concentration of lipids in the haemolymph increases substantially and significantly, indicating that lipids, too, are a major fuel during flight of twig wilters. This is corroborated by the activation of the enzyme triacylglycerol (TAG) lipase in the  body, but not in the flight muscles, by injection of 5 pmol of synthetic Schgr-AKH-II, the endogenous adipokinetic hormone that is thought to be released during flight. Moreover, in the thorax there is a significant decrease in the concentration of glycogen and lipids measured after flight plus 60 min of rest compared to non-flown twig wilters, whereas no significant changes were monitored for these substrates stored in the abdomen. When the change in  class composition was analysed during flight plus 60 min of rest, TAG which comprised the major class in all compartments analysed (thorax, abdomen, haemolymph) was significantly reduced in abdomen and thorax, and diacylglycerol was significantly increased in all three compartments. From all the data collected, it is concluded that lipids are the major fuel class for flight in H. alata and that the contribution of carbohydrates is minimal.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2276874>Complete amino acid sequence of goose VLDV-neurophysin.

Despite apparent molecular mass of unreduced VLDV-neurophysin measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecylsulfate appeared near 17 kDa, this value fell to 11 kDa after reduction with mercaptoethanol, suggesting the existence of a homodimer. Complete amino acid sequence (93 residues) of goose VLDV-neurophysin has been determined. N- and C-terminal sequences of the protein have been established by Edman degradation (microsequencing) and use of carboxypeptidase Y, respectively. Peptides derived from oxidized or carboxamidomethylated neurophysin by trypsin or staphylococcal proteinase hydrolyses have been isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and microsequenced, allowing determination of the complete sequence. Comparison within the vertebrate VLDV-neurophysin lineage, namely goose VLDV-neurophysin to mammalian VLDV-neurophysins and to deduced toad VLDV-neurophysin, reveals a residue insertion between positions 66 and 67 in the nonmammalian VLDV-neurophysins.

These peptides, Asn-880-Lys-892 and Ala-893-Val-911-COOH, however, were resistant to trypsin, unless the cell membranes had been treated with high concentrations of NaOH. This suggests that the carboxyl terminal region is located in situ within the native band 3 molecule. Unlike in the cases of other portions of the band 3 protein, such as Gly-647-Arg-656, Ser-731-Lys-743, and Tyr-818-Lys-826, the release of the carboxyl terminal region was not inhibited by pretreatment of erythrocytes with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), indicating that there is no major structural difference in the carboxyl terminal portion between the outward and inward facing forms. The carboxyl terminal region of the band 3 protein has a negative charge cluster. In the middle of the negative charge cluster, consensus sequences, Val-Asp-X-X-X-Leu-Asp-Ala-Asp-Asp and --Asp-Glu (TFDE), were found in the carboxyl terminal regions of aquaporin CHIP and glucose transporter 1, respectively.

This factor is highly conserved throughout evolution. However, several key residues differ between bacterial and mammalian mitochondrial EF-Tu (EF-Tu(mt)). One such residue is Ser221 (Escherichia coli numbering). This residue is conserved as a Ser or  in the bacterial factors but is present as Pro269 in EF-Tu(mt). Pro269 reorients the loop containing this residue and shifts the adjoining beta-strand in EF-Tu(mt) compared to that of E. coli EF-Tu potentially altering the binding pocket for the acceptor stem of the aa-tRNA. Pro269 was mutated to a serine residue (P269S) in EF-Tu(mt). For comparison, the complementary mutation was created at Ser221 in E. coli EF-Tu (S221P). The E. coli EF-Tu S221P variant is poorly expressed in E. coli and the majority of the molecules fail to fold into an active conformation. In contrast, EF-Tu(mt) P269S is expressed to a high level in E. coli.

VIP is rapidly degraded and simplified stable analogs are needed. VIP's action was extensively studied in rat and guinea pig. However, it is largely unknown whether its pharmacophore in these species resembles human. To address this issue we investigated the VIP pharmacophore for VPAC(1) (the predominant receptor subtype in cancers and widely distributed in normal tissues) by using alanine and D-amino acid scanning. Interaction with rat, guinea pig, and human VPAC(1) was assessed using transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and PANC1 cells and cells possessing native VPAC(1). Important species differences existed in the VIP pharmacophore. The human VPAC(1) expressed in CHO cells, which were used almost exclusively in previous studies, differed markedly from the native VPAC(1) in T47D cells. The most important amino acids for determining affinity are His(1), Asp(3), (6), Arg(12), Arg(14), and Leu(23).

Molecular characterization of the multidrug-resistance phenotype revealed the presence of a class 1 integron containing two genes, a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (PF00186), which confers resistance to trimethoprim; and aminoglycoside adenyltransferase (AadA) (PF01909), which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin.

SNF1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is inhibited during growth on high levels of glucose and is activated in response to glucose depletion and other stresses. Activation entails phosphorylation of (210) on the activation loop of the catalytic subunit Snf1 by Snf1-activating kinases. We have used mutational analysis to identify Snf1 residues that are important for regulation. Alteration of Tyr(106) in the αC helix or Leu(198) adjacent to the Asp--Gly motif on the activation loop relieved glucose inhibition of phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of (210) during growth on high levels of glucose. Substitution of Arg for Gly(53), at the N terminus of the kinase domain, increased activation on both high and low glucose. Alteration of the ubiquitin-associated domain revealed a modest autoinhibitory effect. Previous studies identified alterations of the Gal83 (β) and Snf4 (γ) subunits that relieve glucose inhibition, and we have here identified a distinct set of Gal83 residues that are required. Together, these results indicate that alterations at dispersed sites within each subunit of SNF1 cause phosphorylation of the kinase during growth on high levels of glucose. These findings suggest that the conformation of the SNF1 complex is crucial to maintenance of the inactive state during growth on high glucose and that the default state for SNF1 is one in which (210) is phosphorylated and the kinase is active.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23684032>Purification and identification of five novel antioxidant peptides from goat milk casein hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>The present research described the preparation, purification, and identification of antioxidant peptides from goat milk casein (GMC). Goat milk casein was hydrolyzed by using a combination of neutral and alkaline proteases to obtain goat milk casein hydrolysates (GMCH) with high antioxidant activity. After desalting by nonpolar macroporous absorption resin, GMCH was isolated and purified by gel filtration chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, respectively, and further identified by nanoliter electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Antioxidant activities of GMC, GMCH, and pure peptides were evaluated and compared using free radical scavenging activity, metal ion chelating ability, and anti-lipid peroxidation ability. Compared with GMC, the free radical-scavenging ability and ferrous ion-chelating ability of GMCH increased significantly. The inhibition effect of lipid peroxidation of GMCH was much stronger than that of tert-butylhydroquinone and phytogermine and a little lower than that of ascorbic acid. The antioxidant activity of GMCH could be attributed to the high antioxidant activity of oligopeptides, especially 5 novel oligopeptides: Val-Tyr-Pro-, -Gly-Gly-Met-Ala-His, -Pro-Tyr-Cys-Ala-Pro, Tyr-Val-Pro-Glu-Pro-, and Tyr-Pro-Pro-Tyr-Glu--Tyr, which were first observed in GMCH. The antioxidant activity of these 5 novel oligopeptides and GMCH increased 3.59 to 380 times compared with GMC, combining anti-lipid peroxidation ability of GMCH, which indicated that GMCH and its purified fractions in different stages could be used as functional food ingredients, food additives, and pharmaceutical agents in the future.Copyright © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

The structure of the G-protein receptors to which these hormones bind, are crucial in understanding many of the physiological processes in which they play a central role. To date no 3D structure of an insect G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) is available. Here, the first models of the 3D structures of a GPCR from the malaria mosquito are presented. Homology modeling of the receptor identified from the genome of Anopheles gambiae was used to construct two models of the receptor. The 7 transmembrane helical bundles of these two models are based on the crystal structures of beta2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin. The flexible loop regions were modeled using high temperature simulated annealing and constrained molecular dynamic simulations. The two receptor models differ in a number of critical features, the most important of which is that the rhodopsin-based model has a 'closed' structure while the beta2-based structure is 'open'. The 'open' conformation provides easy access of the hormone to the binding pocket. Docking calculations with the insect adipokinetic hormones, AKH-1 (pGlu-Leu----Pro-Ala-Trp-NH(2)) from the malaria mosquito and Del-CC (pGlu-Lys-Asn--Ser-Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-Asn-NH(2)) from the blister beetle showed that while the binding motif of the two is similar, AKH-1 has more than 30 times higher affinity than Del-CC, which strongly suggests that the binding is specific, and that the correct binding site was identified. Using these models it is possible to design antagonists, which block the binding site and are thus species-specific insecticides.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10492-10496). Kinetic analysis of the HIV-1 protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of a fluorogenic substrate demonstrates that the enzyme is an obligatory dimer. At pH = 5.0, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer, 37 degrees C, the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 3.6 +/- 1.9 nM. We found that the tetrapeptide Ac--Leu-Asn--COOH, corresponding to the COOH-terminal segment of the enzyme, is an excellent inhibitor of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis shows that the inhibitor binds to the inactive protomers and prevents their association into the active dimer (dissociative inhibition). The dissociative nature of this inhibition is consistent with the results obtained from sedimentation equilibrium experiments in which the apparent molecular  of the enzyme was observed to be 20,800 +/- 1,500 and 12,100 +/- 300, in the absence and presence of the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide, respectively. The dissociation constant of the protomer-inhibitor complex is Ki = 45.1 +/- 1.8 microM. This is the first kinetic analysis and direct experimental demonstration of noncovalent dissociative inhibition.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439319>Anopheles gambiae, Anoga-HrTH hormone, free and bound structure--a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment.</a></h2><p>The spread of malaria by the female mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, is dependent, amongst other things, on its ability to fly. This in turn, is dependent on the adipokinetic hormone, Anoga-HrTH (pGlu-Leu----Pro-Ala-Trp-NH2). No crystal structure of this important neuropeptide is available and hence NMR restrained molecular dynamics was used to investigate its conformational space in aqueous solution and when bound to a membrane surface. The results showed that Anoga-HrTH has an almost cyclic conformation that is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the C-terminus and Thr3. Upon docking of the agonist to its receptor, this H-bond is broken and the molecule adopts a more extended structure. Preliminary AKHR docking calculations give the free  of binding to be -47.30 kJ/mol. There is a close correspondence between the structure of the docked ligand and literature structure-activity studies. Information about the 3D structure and binding mode of Anoga-HrTH to its receptor is vital for the design of suitable mimetics which can act as insecticides.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Small angle X-ray scattering data indicate that PKI(6-22)amide has a compact, rather than extended, structure in solution (Reed J et al., 1989, Biochem J 264:371-380). CD spectroscopic analysis of the PKI peptide led to the suggestion that a beta-turn structure might be located in the -Ala12-Ser-Gly-Arg15-connecting sequence in the middle of the molecule (Reed J, Kinzel V, Cheng HC, Walsh DA, 1987, Biochemistry 26:7641-7647). To investigate this possibility further, conformationally constrained and flexible analogs of PKI(6-22)amide were synthesized and used to study the structure-function relationships of this central portion of the inhibitor. (Des12-14)PKI(6-22) amide exhibited over a 200-fold loss in inhibitory activity. Replacement of the omitted -Ala12-Ser-Gly14-sequence with aminocaprylic acid yielded an analog that regained more than 90% of the lost binding . The D-alanine14 PKI analog was as potent as the parent peptide, whereas the beta-alanine14 and the sarcosine14 analogs were only 10-fold less active. Several peptides that promoted a beta-turn structure at residues 12-15 showed about 200-fold decreases in inhibitory activity. Two constrained analogs that could not assume a beta-turn conformation were only 30-fold less potent than PKI(6-22)amide. Thus, the structure of the central connecting portion of the PKI peptide, encompassing residues 12-15, greatly influences its ability to effectively bind to and inhibit the catalytic subunit. We conclude, however, that a formal beta-turn at this position is not required and is actually detrimental for a high-affinity interaction of PKI(6-22)amide with the enzyme. These results are interpreted in light of the Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the peptide analogs and the crystal structure of the peptide bound at the active site of the protein kinase (Knighton DR et al., 1991b, Science 253:414-420).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6547917>Isolation and primary structure of human PHI (peptide HI).</a></h2><p>The isolation of the human form of PHI (peptide HI) is described.

The NH2-terminal sequence of proMMP-7 is Lys-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Glu, which is identical to that of matrilysin. The zymogen is activated by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), yielding an intermediate form of M(r) 21,000 and an active species of M(r) 19,000 which shows the new NH2-terminal sequence of Tyr78-Ser-Leu--Pro-Asn-Ser. Although trypsin fully activates the zymogen, the activation rate by plasmin or leukocyte elastase is confined to approximately 50%. ProMMP-7 can be activated by MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) to its full activity in a single-step mechanism and generates the same NH2 terminus obtained by APMA activation, whereas MMP-1 (tissue collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) do not have such an effect. On the other hand, proMMP-1 is activated by MMP-7 to an activity similar to that obtained by APMA and the activation by MMP-7 is enhanced up to approximately 6.5 fold in the presence of APMA. This enhanced activity is donated by specific cleavage at the Gln80-Phe81 bond of proMMP-1. MMP-7 can also activate proMMP-9 up to approximately 50% of the full activity with a new NH2 terminus of Leu16-Arg--(Asn)-Leu. Incubation of proMMP-2 or proMMP-3 with MMP-7 results in no activation of these proMMPs. MMP-7 degrades type IV collagen, laminin-1, fibronectin, proteoglycan, type I gelatin, and insoluble elastin. These results suggest that in vivo MMP-7 may play a role in degradation of extracellular matrix macromolecules in concert with MMP-1, -3, and -9 under pathological conditions.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717784>Amino acid digestibility and  concentration in a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains and their effects on growth performance of pigs.</a></h2><p>Three experiments were conducted to evaluate a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains produced by Buhler Inc. (HP-DDG(Buhler)) and fed to growing pigs. The standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA in HP-DDG(Buhler) and in soybean meal (SBM) was determined in Exp. 1. Nine pigs (109.8 +/- 2.78 kg of BW) were fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a triplicated 3 x 3 Latin square design with 3 diets and 3 periods per square. Diets containing HP-DDG(Buhler) or SBM as the only source of AA and an N-free diet were formulated. The SID of indispensable AA was less (P < 0.01) in HP-DDG(Buhler) than in SBM (Arg, 87.5 vs. 93.9%; His, 76.7 vs. 88.7%; Ile, 76.4 vs. 87.5%; Leu, 77.8 vs. 86.8%; Lys, 75.4 vs. 88.4%; Met, 82.8 vs. 88.4%; , 77.9 vs. 87.3%; , 72.5 vs. 83.5%; Trp, 85.1 vs. 91.0%; Val, 73.3 vs. 84.3%). The DE and ME in HP-DDG(Buhler) and in corn were measured in Exp. 2 using 16 growing barrows (24.6 +/- 1.66 kg of BW). A corn-based diet and a diet containing 50% corn and 48.2% HP-DDG(Buhler) were formulated. The total collection method and the difference procedures were used. The concentrations of DE and ME in HP-DDG(Buhler) were greater (P < 0.001) than in corn (5,043 vs. 4,002 kcal/kg of DM and 4,690 vs. 3,921 kcal/kg of DM, respectively). Experiment 3 was a 9-wk growth assay using 40 pigs (initial BW: 58.2 +/- 2.28 kg) allotted to 5 dietary treatments, with 8 replicates of individually housed pigs per treatment. Treatments included a control diet based on corn and SBM and 4 diets in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 33, 66, 66, or 100% of the SBM in the control diet. All HP-DDG(Buhler) diets contained supplemental Lys and  to provide similar concentrations of SID Lys and  in all diets; one of the diets in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 66% of the SBM and the diet in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 100% of the SBM also contained crystalline Trp. Dietary treatments had no effect on ADG (1.15, 1.13, 1.16, 1.12, and 1.14 kg), ADFI (3.33, 3.35, 3.39, 3.30, and 3.33 kg), or G:F (0.35, 0.34, 0.34, 0.34, and 0.34 kg/kg). Carcass traits of pigs fed the diet in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 100% of the SBM were not different from those of pigs fed the control diet. In conclusion, HP-DDG(Buhler) contains more DE and ME than corn, but has decreased SID values for AA compared with SBM. Soybean meal can be replaced by HP-DDG(Buhler) in diets fed to finishing pigs without any effect on growth performance or carcass characteristics, provided that diets are adequate in indispensable AA.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2775757>Amino acid sequence of bovine angiogenin.</a></h2><p>The amino acid sequence and disulfide bridges of bovine plasma derived angiogenin were determined by sequencer analysis of the intact protein and fragments derived by enzymatic and chemical digestion.

Moreover, we wanted to compare the ancestral AKH with AKHs of more advanced beetles, of which a number are pest insects. This would allow us to assess whether AKH mimetics would be suitable as insecticides, that is, be harmful to the pest species but not to the beneficial species. Nine species of the Adephaga were investigated and all synthesize only one octapeptide in the corpus cardiacum, as revealed by Edman degradation sequencing techniques or by mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence pGlu-Leu-Asn--Ser--Gly-Trp corresponds to Schgr-AKH-II that was first identified in the desert locust. It is assumed that Schgr-AKH-II-the peptide of a basal beetle clade-is the ancestral AKH for beetles. Some other beetle families, as well as some Hymenoptera (including honey bees) also contain this peptide, whereas most of the pest beetle species have different AKHs. This argues that those peptides and their receptors should be explored for developing mimetics with insecticidal properties. A scenario where Schgr-AKH-II (the only AKH of Adephaga) is used as basic molecular structure to derive almost all other known beetle AKHs via single step mutations is very likely, and supports the interpretation that Schgr-AKH-II is the ancestral AKH of Coleoptera.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12514185>Proline oxidase induces apoptosis in tumor cells, and its expression is frequently absent or reduced in renal carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Proline oxidase is a p53-induced gene that can mediate apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells. Here, we provide evidence implicating a role for proline oxidase in renal carcinoma. We observed absent or reduced expression of proline oxidase in 8 of 12 primary renal cell carcinomas, with respect to their normal tissue counterparts. Two renal cell carcinomas, which displayed little or no expression of proline oxidase, expressed p53s that were less capable of inducing proline oxidase than p53 isolated from normal renal tissue. One of those tumor-derived p53s contained a double transition mutation at amino acid residues 125 (Ala to ) and 193 (Arg to His), and the other exhibited a single transition mutation at amino acid 149 (Ser to ). Forced up-regulation of proline oxidase induced the formation of reactive oxygen species and mediated apoptosis in the 786-0 renal cell carcinoma cell line. A proline oxidase antisense vector repressed p53-induced up-regulation of proline oxidase, release of cytochrome c from , and apoptosis in 786-0 renal carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings support a role for proline oxidase as a downstream effector in p53-mediated apoptosis. We hypothesize that its altered expression can contribute to the development of renal carcinomas.

TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the -binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific  headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues Ile-2456 to Trp-2470 of the -binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and -2469) and aliphatic residues (Ile-2456, Leu-2459, Ile-2464, and Pro-2468) in the -binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25795677>Lantibiotic Reductase LtnJ Substrate Selectivity Assessed with a Collection of Nisin Derivatives as Substrates.</a></h2><p>Lantibiotics are potent antimicrobial peptides characterized by the presence of dehydrated amino acids, dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, and (methyl)lanthionine rings. In addition to these posttranslational modifications, some lantibiotics exhibit additional modifications that usually confer increased biological activity or stability on the peptide. LtnJ is a reductase responsible for the introduction of D-alanine in the lantibiotic lacticin 3147. The conversion of L-serine into D-alanine requires dehydroalanine as the substrate, which is produced in vivo by the dehydration of serine by a lantibiotic dehydratase, i.e., LanB or LanM. In this work, we probe the substrate specificity of LtnJ using a system that combines the nisin modification machinery (dehydratase, cyclase, and transporter) and the stereospecific reductase LtnJ in Lactococcus lactis. We also describe an improvement in the production yield of this system by inserting a putative attenuator from the nisin biosynthesis gene cluster in front of the ltnJ gene. In order to clarify the sequence selectivity of LtnJ, peptides composed of truncated nisin and different mutated C-terminal tails were designed and coexpressed with LtnJ and the nisin biosynthetic machinery. In these tails, serine was flanked by diverse amino acids to determine the influence of the surrounding residues in the reaction. LtnJ successfully hydrogenated peptides when hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, , and Ala) were flanking the intermediate dehydroalanine, while those in which dehydroalanine was flanked by one or two polar residues (Ser, , Glu, Lys, and Asn) or Gly were either less prone to be modified by LtnJ or not modified at all. Moreover, our results showed that dehydrobutyrine cannot serve as a substrate for LtnJ.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Interaction of S100A12 with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been suggested to play a central role in inflammation.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a protocol for the purification of S100A12 and to partially characterize this protein in the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) as a prelude to the development of an immunologic method for its detection and quantification in canine serum and fecal specimens. Leukocytes were isolated from canine whole blood by dextran sedimentation, and canine S100A12 was extracted from the cytosol fraction of these cells. Further purification of cS100A12 comprised of ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and strong cation- and anion-exchange column chromatography. Canine S100A12 was successfully purified from canine whole blood. The relative molecular mass of the protein was estimated at 10,379.5 and isoelectric focusing revealed an isoelectric point of 6.0. The approximate specific absorbance of cS100A12 at 280 nm was determined to be 1.78 for a 1 mg/ml solution. The N-terminal AA sequence of the first 15 residues of cS100A12 was -Lys-Leu-Glu-Asp-His-X-Glu-Gly-Ile-Val-Asp-Val--His, and revealed 100% identity with the predicted protein sequence available through the canine genome project. Sequence homology for the 14 N-terminal residues identified for cS100A12 with those of feline, bovine, porcine, and human S100A12 was 78.6%.

The objective of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of essential AA ratios on milk protein synthesis in vitro and to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms. Triplicate cultures of MAC-T cells and bovine mammary tissue explants (MTE) were incubated with the optimal AA ratio (OPAA; Lys:Met, 2.9:1; :, 1.05:1; Lys:, 1.8:1; Lys:His, 2.38:1; and Lys:Val, 1.23:1) in the presence of rapamycin (control), OPAA, a Lys: ratio of 2.1:1, a Lys: ratio of 1.3:1, a Lys:His ratio of 3.05:1, or a Lys:Val ratio of 1.62:1 for 12 h; the other AA concentrations were equal to OPAA. In some experiments, the cells were cultured with OPAA with or without rapamycin (100 ng/mL) or with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) small interference RNA, and the MTE were exposed to OPAA with rapamycin for β-casein expression. Among the treatments, the expression of β-casein was greatest in the MTE cultured with OPAA. In MAC-T cells, the OPAA upregulated the mRNA expression of SLC1A5 and SLC7A5 but downregulated the expression of IRS1, AKT3, EEF1A1, and EEF2 compared with the control. The OPAA had no effect on the mTOR phosphorylation status but increased the phosphorylation of S6K1 and RPS6. When the MTE were treated with rapamycin in the presence of OPAA, the expression of β-casein was markedly decreased. The phosphorylation of RPS6 and 4EBP1 also was reduced in MAC-T cells. A similar negative effect on the expression of RPS6KB1 and EIF4EBP1 was detected when the cells were cultured with either rapamycin or mTOR small interference RNA. The optimal AA ratio stimulated β-casein expression partly by enhancing the transport of AA into the cells, cross-talk with insulin signaling and a subsequent enhancement of mTOR signaling, or translation elongation in both MAC-T cells and bovine MTE.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

These PLP-dependent enzymes show high sequence homology (∼40% identity) and both form homotetrameric structures. Steady state kinetic studies with both enzymes show that an active site base is essential for activity, and α-deuterated substrates exhibit modest primary isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km, suggesting that substrate deprotonation is partially rate-limiting. Pre-steady state kinetics with TPL and TIL show rapid formation of external aldimine intermediates, followed by deprotonation to give quinonoid intermediates absorbing at about 500nm. In the presence of phenol and indole analogues, 4-hydroxypyridine and benzimidazole, the quinonoid intermediates of TPL and TIL decay to aminoacrylate intermediates, with λmax at about 340nm. Surprisingly, there are significant kinetic isotope effects on both formation and subsequent decay of the quinonoid intermediates when α-deuterated substrates are used. The crystal structure of TPL with a bound competitive inhibitor, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate, identified several essential catalytic residues: Tyr-71, -124, Arg-381, and -448. The active sites of TIL and TPL are highly conserved with the exceptions of these residues: Arg-381(TPL)/Ile-396 (TIL); -124 (TPL)/Asp-137 (TIL), and -448 (TPL)/His-463 (TIL). Mutagenesis of these residues results in dramatic decreases in catalytic activity without changing substrate specificity. The conserved tyrosine, Tyr-71 (TPL)/Tyr-74 (TIL) is essential for elimination activity with both enzymes, and likely plays a role as a proton donor to the leaving group. Mutation of Arg-381 and -124 of TPL to alanine results in very low but measurable catalytic activity. Crystallography of Y71F and F448H TPL with 3-fluoro-l-tyrosine bound demonstrated that there are two quinonoid structures, relaxed and tense. In the relaxed structure, the substrate aromatic ring is in plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond, but in the tense structure, the substrate aromatic ring is about 20° out of plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond. In the tense structure, hydrogen bonds are formed between the substrate OH and the guanidinium of Arg-381 and the OH of -124, and the phenyl rings of -448 and 449 provide steric strain. Based on the effects of mutagenesis, the substrate strain is estimated to contribute about 10(8) to TPL catalysis. Thus, the mechanisms of TPL and TIL require both substrate strain and acid/base catalysis, and substrate strain is probably responsible for the very high substrate specificity of TPL and TIL.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Residues of Ala, Ile and Arg preferably bind ethanol when they are included in an alpha helix. Ethanol molecules often make hydrogen bonds with  and nitrogen atoms from the main chain of a protein. Because of this reason, the binding of ethanol may be associated with the decrease of the length of alpha helices and the disappearance of 3/10 helices.

For each amino acid studied, a linear regression was fitted by NB and amino acid intake (AAI). The maintenance requirements were estimated as the AAI to maintain the NB equal to zero. The daily amino acid requirements for maintenance were estimated to be Lys 11, Met 29,  23, Trp 5, Arg 50, Val 29, His 6, Gly 54,  49, Leu 78 and Ile 21 mg/BWkg (0.75) per day. Therefore, the amino acid ratio for maintenance was concluded to be Lys 100, Met 276,  220, Trp 48, Arg 467, Val 275, His 60, Gly 511,  467, Leu 735 and Ile 198% independent of the scale. The essential amino acid profile and the ideal ratio for the maintenance of poultry estimated in this study contributed to improve the factorial model for estimating essential amino acid requirements for poultry.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20061171>Classical maple syrup urine disease and brain development: principles of management and formula design.</a></h2><p>Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, , Gln, ) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months.  demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This novel enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a two-step column-chromatographic procedure with high yield. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was Glu-Gly-Asn--Arg-Glu-Asp-Asn--Lys-His-Leu-Leu-Gly-Asn-Asp-Asn-Val- Lys-Arg. The enzyme had a molecular mass of approximately 86 kDa and an isoelectric point of pH 3.8. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 8.6-9.0 and displayed maximum activity at 45 degrees C. The alkaline enzyme was stable up to 50 degrees C and more than 30% of the original activity was detectable after heating at 100 degrees C and at pH 9.0 for 10 min. The enzyme hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose, lichenan (beta-1,3;1,4-linkage), and p-nitrophenyl derivatives of cellotriose and cellotetraose. Crystalline forms of cellulose (Avicel and filter paper), H3PO4-swollen cellulose, NaOH-swollen cellulose, curdlan (beta-1,3-linkage), laminarin (beta-1,3;1,6-linkage), and xylan were barely hydrolyzed at all.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9406077>Application of a U-13C-labeled amino acid tracer in lactating dairy goats for simultaneous measurements of the flux of amino acids in plasma and the partition of amino acids to the mammary gland.</a></h2><p>A preliminary study was conducted using lactating British Saanen goats (n = 5) at 109 to 213 d in milk that yielded 1.67 to 3.68 kg of milk/d to examine the application of a U-13C-labeled amino acid (AA) mixture obtained from hydrolyzed algal proteins as a tracer for measuring plasma flux (n = 5) and partition to the mammary gland (n = 3; arteriovenous difference) of 13 AA simultaneously. Except for Ile and Ser, there was incomplete (6 to 54%) equilibration of the tracer with AA from packed blood cells (> 90% erythrocytes) during the 6-h infusions. This result agreed with the large ratio of packed cells to gradients for plasma AA concentration that was also observed. However, net mass and isotope removals by the mammary gland were predominantly from plasma, indicating that the erythrocytes did not participate in kinetic exchanges. Plasma AA fluxes (millimoles per kilogram of metabolizable protein intake per kilogram of  0.75) differed among goats that consumed different protein sources; however, overall rates were lowest for Met (5 to 14) and His (8 to 17) and highest for Leu (48 to 70) and Ala (53 to 88). On average, 25% of plasma flux was partitioned to the mammary gland. Less than 20% of His, Ser, , and Ala were directed to the mammary gland; 20 to 30% of Arg, , Tyr, and Leu were directed to the mammary gland; and 30 to 40% of Pro, Ile, Lys, and Val were directed to the mammary gland. The unidirectional AA flux in the mammary gland (AA apparently available for protein syntheses, oxidation, and metabolite formation) did not match the pattern that is required for casein synthesis, suggesting differences in the metabolic requirements of AA for nonmilk protein synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2182557>Properties of a cleaved two-chain form of recombinant human growth hormone.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli cells transformed with plasmids engineered for the expression of recombinant human growth hormone as a secreted product also produced a proteolytically cleaved form of rhGH. This variant is isolated at a high resolution anion exchange chromatography stage during the manufacturing process. The higher isoelectric point of this form is demonstrated by isoelectric focusing and chromatofocusing and the two-chain nature by tryptic mapping, N- and C-terminal sequence analyses, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These data indicate that the single site of cleavage is between -142 and Tyr-143, in contrast to the two-chain variant isolated from human pituitary glands, which has a clip after residue -139. The recombinant two-chain form was further characterized by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography at both acidic and basic pHs. The assay utilizing bicarbonate-containing mobile phases was determined to be the most efficient and sensitive method. The bioactivity of this two-chain form was measured by the in vivo rat  gain assay and by the in vitro Nb2 cell bioassay.

All BDEs are smaller than those of typical secondary or tertiary C-H bonds due to the phenomenon of captodative stabilization. The stabilization is reduced by changes in the phi,psi angles. As a result the BDEs increase by about 10 kJ mol(-)(1) in beta-sheet and 40 kJ mol(-)(1) in alpha-helical environments, respectively. In effect the alpha C-H BDEs can be "tuned" from about 345 to 400 kJ mol(-)(1) by adjusting the local environment.

Since 008 is hydrophobic, it binds rapidly to liver cells. This is evident by the positive intercept at the gamma-axis in the uptake curves. At higher concentrations, a minor part of the transport occurs by diffusion at a rate of 8.307.10(-6) cm/s. This part of diffusion is measured at 4 degrees C and can be subtracted from the uptake at 37 degrees C resulting in the carrier mediated part of uptake which is saturable. Kinetic parameters for the saturable part of uptake are Km 1.5 microM and Vmax 40.0 pmol/mg per min. The transport is decreased in the absence of oxygen and in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. Uptake is accelerated at temperatures above 20 degrees C. The activation  was determined to be 30.77 kJ/mol. The membrane potential and not a sodium gradient is the main driving force for 008 transport. Cholate (a typical substrate of the multispecific bile acid transporter) and taurocholate are mutual competitive inhibitors of 008 uptake. Phalloidin, antamanide and iodipamide, typical foreign substrates of the transporter, interfere with the uptake of 008. AS 30D ascites hepatoma cells, known to be unable to transport bile acids, phalloidin and iodipamide, are also unfit to transport 008. Interestingly, sulfobromophthalein (BSP) but not rifampicin, both foreign substrates of the bilirubin carrier, inhibits the transport of 008 in a competitive manner.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1909892>Secondary structure and side-chain 1H and 13C resonance assignments of calmodulin in solution by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Heteronuclear 2D and 3D NMR experiments were carried out on recombinant Drosophila calmodulin (CaM), a protein of 148 residues and with molecular mass of 16.7 kDa, that is uniformly labeled with 15N and 13C to a level of greater than 95%. Nearly complete 1H and 13C side-chain assignments for all amino acid residues are obtained by using the 3D HCCH-COSY and HCCH-TOCSY experiments that rely on large heteronuclear one-bond scalar couplings to transfer magnetization and establish through-bond connectivities. The secondary structure of this protein in solution has been elucidated by a qualitative interpretation of nuclear Overhauser effects, hydrogen exchange data, and 3JHNH alpha coupling constants. A clear correlation between the 13C alpha chemical shift and secondary structure is found. The secondary structure in the two globular domains of Drosophila CaM in solution is essentially identical with that of the X-ray crystal structure of mammalian CaM [Babu, Y., Bugg, C. E., & Cook, W.J. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 204, 191-204], which consists of two pairs of a "helix-loop-helix" motif in each globular domain. The existence of a short antiparallel beta-sheet between the two loops in each domain has been confirmed. The eight alpha-helix segments identified from the NMR data are located at Glu-6 to -19, -29 to Ser-38, Glu-45 to Glu-54, -65 to Lys-77, Glu-82 to Asp-93, Ala-102 to Asn-111, Asp-118 to Glu-127, and Tyr-138 to -146.

The assay is highly reproducible, sensitive, and specific for the COOH-terminal domain of the GLUT1 glucose transporter. It has no cross-reactivity with the other glucose-transporter isoforms GLUT2 and GLUT4. Furthermore, the results obtained with this radioimmunoassay on the number of glucose transporters in human erythrocytes were in good agreement with previous studies based on cytochalasin B binding, suggesting that this radioimmunoassay is able to quantify the number of glucose transporters.

The refined preferred conformation of the  dipeptide (aspartame) with side chain chi 1/2 conformation g- is g-Fg- in the hydrated state, which is consistent with the structure deduced from 1H-nmr experiments. Irrespective of the Xaa and taste, all the dipeptides have the same conformation for the Asp residue, which is attributable to the hydrogen bond between protonated amino hydrogen and carboxylate oxygen and the favored hydration of the carboxylate group. This implies that the L-aspartyl residue is a necessary factor for the dipeptides to be sweet not a sufficient factor. The computed conformational preferences for sweet, bitter, and tasteless dipeptides in the hydrated state indicate to us that the conformation about the N--C alpha bond of the Xaa residue, i.e., the orientation of the hydrophobic moiety with respect to the AH/B functionalities in the aspartyl moiety, seems to be crucial to elicit the tastes. In addition, the hydrophobicity and the size of the Xaa residue are found to play a major role in determining the tastes.

In an attempt to find an explanation for this phenomenon we have analyzed various aspects of the Bm variants factor IX Deventer, factor IX Milano, factor IX Novara, and factor IX Bergamo. Proteolytic cleavage by factor XIa was normal in two Bm variants, but absent at the Arg180-Val bond in the other two. In the latter variants Arg180 was replaced by either Trp or Gln, whereas Val181---- and Pro368---- replacements have occurred in the variants that were normally cleaved by factor XIa. In all four variants the Bm effect could be neutralized with a single monoclonal antibody against factor IX. Also, after treatment with factor XIa, none of the Bm variants reacted with antithrombin III (in contrast to normal factor IXa). Purified factor IX Deventer (one of the variants with a replacement of Arg181), either with or without pretreatment with factor XIa, was found to be a more effective competitive inhibitor of the factor VIIa-tissue factor-induced factor X activation than similarly treated normal factor IX. In addition, this inhibitory effect was much more pronounced when bovine tissue factor was used instead of human tissue factor. We propose that the normal activation of factor IX not only produces a conformational change around the active site serine that allows efficient substrate binding and catalysis, but that the same conformational change is instrumental in effectively dissociating factor IXa from the activating factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. Amino acid replacements that disrupt this conformational transition directly (e.g. Pro368---- near the catalytic center) or indirectly (mutations at the Arg180-Val activation site) therefore lead to a combination of 1) the loss of coagulant activity and 2) an inhibitory effect in the ox brain prothrombin time assay.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9070615>Purification, characterization, and localization of a novel trypsin-like protease found in the human airway.</a></h2><p>A novel trypsin-like protease was purified to homogeneity from the sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases, by sequential chromatographic procedures.

Samples were then analyzed for concentrations of AAs and intermediary metabolites: alanine (Ala), arginine, asparagine (Asn), aspartate (Asp), citrulline, cysteine, glutamine, glutamate (Glu), glycine (Gly), histidine, isoleucine, leucine (Leu), lysine, methionine (Met), ornithine, phenylalanine (), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (), tryptophan, tyrosine (Tyr), and valine (Val). The concentrations of Gly, Ser, and  in maternal serum were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in CON compared with RES. Furthermore, day of gestation affected (P ≤ 0.05) concentrations of Asn, Glu, , , and Tyr in maternal serum. Status of maternal nutrition affected the Asp concentration of histotroph where RES was greater (P = 0.02) than CON. In histotroph, Ala, Leu, Met, and Val concentrations were greater (P ≤ 0.05) on day 50 compared with day 16. Additionally, Glu and Pro concentrations in histotroph were greater (P < 0.01) on days 34 and 50 compared with day 16. A day × treatment interaction was observed for the concentration of Val in allantoic fluid where day 34 CON was greater (P = 0.05) than all other days and nutritional treatments. In addition, the concentration of Gln in amniotic fluid experienced a day × treatment interaction where day 34 RES was greater (P ≤ 0.05) than day 34 CON, which was greater (P ≤ 0.05) than day 50 CON and RES. These data support our hypothesis that day of gestation and maternal nutrition affect the concentrations of various neutral and acidic AA in beef heifer utero-placental fluids and maternal serum from days 16 to 50 of gestation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Intraduodenal perfusion with a 10%  emulsion increased plasma S-28 by 6.3 +/- 1.2 fmol/ml (P < 0.01) and S-14 by 17.8 +/- 2.6 fmol/ml (P < 0.001), and suppressed by 76 +/- 3% (P < 0.001) gastrin (150 pmol/kg.h)-stimulated gastric acid. Blockade of type A CCK receptors with MK-329 (75 micrograms/kg, i.v.) abolished S-28 and S-14 responses (both P < 0.001) and completely reversed the inhibitory effect of gastric acid produced by intraduodenal . Intravenous infusions of S-14 dose-dependently inhibited gastrin-stimulated secretion with an estimated 50% inhibitory dose of 125 pmol/kg.h that achieved an incremental plasma S-14 rise of 40 +/- 2 fmol/ml; infusions of S-28 at 30 pmol/kg.h increased plasma S-28 by 47 +/- 3 fmol/ml without altering acid output. The SLI antagonist cyclo-[7-aminoheptanoly--D-Trp-Lys-(BZL)] (CyCam) reversed by 89 +/- 4% (P < 0.001) exogenous S-14-induced inhibition of gastrin-stimulated acid secretion, but did not influence gastric acid output after the infusion of S-28. CyCam also reversed by 139 +/- 9% (P < 0.001) the early phase of -induced acid inhibition; in the late phase, CyCam treatment was associated with a further 2-fold elevation of plasma peptide-YY (PYY) to 102 +/- 6 fmol/ml (P < 0.001) and a 75 +/- 5% suppression of gastric acid. Simulation of this plasma PYY increment with infusions of PYY at 50 pmol/kg.h inhibited by 44 +/- 5% gastrin-stimulated acid secretion. These results indicate that in conscious dogs, endogenous CCK mediation of intraintestinal -induced inhibition of stimulated acid secretion occurs in part through CCK type A receptor activation of S-14 secretion. Modulation of gastric acid by S-14 includes both inhibition and attenuation of further suppression via counterregulation of PYY secretion.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17964530>Identification of amino acid residues participating in the  coupling and proton transport of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) H+-pyrophosphatase.</a></h2><p>The H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase is a proton pump that hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate. It consists of a single polypeptide with 14-17 transmembrane domains (TMs). We focused on the third quarter region of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which contains a long conserved cytoplasmic loop. We assayed 1520 mutants for pyrophosphate hydrolysis and proton translocation, and selected 34 single-residue substitution mutants with low substrate hydrolysis and proton-pump activities. We also generated 39 site-directed mutant enzymes and assayed their activity. The mutation of 5 residues in TM10 resulted in low -coupling efficiencies, and mutation of conserved residues (409), Val(411), and Gly(414) showed neither hydrolysis nor pumping activity. The mutation of six, five, and four residues in TM11, 12, and 13, respectively, gave a negative effect. (388), (389), and Val(396) in cytoplasmic loop i were essential for efficient H(+) translocation. Ala(436) and Pro(560) in the periplasmic loops were critical for coupling efficiency. These low-efficiency mutants showed dysfunction of the -conversion and/or proton-translocation activity. The  efficiency was increased markedly by the mutation of two and six residues in TM9 and 12, respectively. These results suggest that TM10 is involved in enzyme function, and that TM12 regulate the -conversion efficiency. H(+)-pyrophosphatase might involve dynamic linkage between the hydrophilic loops and TMs through the central half region of the enzyme.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15060037>Characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae TrmD, a tRNA methyltransferase essential for growth.</a></h2><p>Down-regulation of expression of trmD, encoding the enzyme tRNA (guanosine-1)-methyltransferase, has shown that this gene is essential for growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Previous studies have characterized different physiological/biological aspects of this transporter, but nothing is known about the glycosylation status of the hRFVT-3 protein and role of this modification in its physiology/biology. Additionally, little is known about the residues in the hRFVT-3 protein that interact with the ligand, RF. We addressed these issues using appropriate biochemical/molecular approaches, a protein-docking model, and established intestinal/renal epithelial cells. Our results showed that the hRFVT-3 protein is glycosylated and that glycosylation is important for its function. Mutating the predicted -glycosylation sites at Asn and Asn led to a significant decrease in RF uptake; it also led to a marked intracellular (in the endoplasmic reticulum, ER) retention of the mutated proteins as shown by live-cell confocal imaging studies. The protein-docking model used in this study has identified a number of putative substrate-interacting sites: Ser, Ile, Trp, , , and Asn Mutating these potential interacting sites was indeed found to lead to a significant inhibition in RF uptake and to intracellular (ER) retention of the mutated proteins (except for the  mutant). These results demonstrate that the hRFVT-3 protein is glycosylated and this glycosylation is important for its function and cell surface expression.

The present study examined the effect of non-peptidergic delta-opioid receptor agonists, (+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha-((2R,5R)-4-Allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC80) and (-)dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid salt (SNC86), on the activity of alpha-motoneurons in decerebrate-spinal rats. The flexor reflex was facilitated by C-afferent conditioning inputs, shown by a decrease in mechanical threshold and increase in touch- and pinch-evoked responses. Systemic administration of SNC80 (10 micromol/kg) prevented and reversed the neuronal hyperactivity. We further examined the effect of this agonist on the hypersensitivity of the flexor reflex induced by intraplantar injection of Freund's adjuvant. SNC80 dose-dependently (1, 3, 5 and 10 micromol/kg) increased the mechanical threshold and decreased touch-, pinch- and Abeta-afferent inputs-evoked responses. Similar effects were seen with SNC86 (5 micromol/kg).

More specifically, IL-8 caused a transient, dose and time dependent activation of a Ser/ kinase activity towards myelin basic protein (MBP) and the MBP-derived peptide APRTPGGRR patterned after the specific concensus sequence in MBP for ERK enzymes. The activated MBP kinase was furthermore identified as an extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1) based on several criteria such as substrate specificity, molecular , activation-dependent mobility shift, and recognition by anti-ERK antibodies. For comparison, the chemotactic response of neutrophils to a stimulus of bacterial origin (fMet-Leu- or fMLP) was also examined and found to involve the activation of a similar ERK enzyme. The present data clearly indicate that in terminally differentiated, non-proliferating human cells, the MBP kinase/ERK activity can serve other purposes than mitogenic signaling, and that processes such as chemotaxis, induced by bacterial peptides as well as by human cytokines like IL-8, involve the regulation of ERK enzymes.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2542332>Purification and characterization of rat skeletal muscle fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase.</a></h2><p>Fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bis-phosphatase from rat skeletal muscle has been purified to homogeneity, and its structure and kinetic properties have been determined.

Since both show sequence almost identical to that of a PLA2 from Crotalus atrox it was tentatively classified as being of group II.

The hydrolysis of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (dlPC) shows a broad optimum between 7 and 18 mN m-1 and a cut-off pressure of 22 mN m-1. The activity toward dlPC displays a maximum at pH 8 and is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ with an apparent Kd of 0.1 mM, for both enzymes. P-1 and P-2 are heat-stable enzymes, unable to hydrolyze dilauroylphosphatidic acid monolayers. The enzymes are not lethal to mice at doses up to 5 micrograms/g  by intraperitoneal injection and they do not show myotoxic (up to 40 micrograms) or hemolytic activity (up to 8.5 micrograms/ml). Both lack anti-coagulant activity, determined by absence of changes in the recalcification time of platelet poor plasma (up to 100 micrograms/ml), and are not able to induce platelet aggregation (up to 50 micrograms/ml). However, both isoenzymes exhibit an important edema-inducing activity that is not altered at short times by the irreversible chemical inactivation of the hydrolytic activity with phenacyl bromide. P-1 and P-2 are able to release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids of neutrophils, property that is lost by the inactivation of the enzyme. This suggests that the edema-inducing activity of the active but not the inactive forms may be partly due to arachidonic acid-derived mediators. The edema-inducing activity of the active or inactive forms of the enzymes is inhibited by antagonists of histamine, suggesting that histamine plays an important role in both the active and the inactive B. neuwiedii PLA2s-induced edema.

Recently, a PrPSc-like intermediate form characterized by the formation of insoluble aggregates and protease-resistant PrP species termed insoluble PrPC (iPrPC) has been identified in uninfected mammalian brains and cultured neuronal cells, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of these diseases. Here, we explore the molecular characteristics of the spontaneously formed iPrPC in cultured neuroblastoma cells expressing wild-type or mutant human PrP linked to two familial prion diseases. We observed that although PrP mutation at either residue 183 from  to Ala (PrPT183A) or at residue 198 from  to Ser (PrPF198S) affects glycosylation at both N-linked glycosylation sites, the T183A mutation that results in intracellular retention significantly increased the formation of iPrPC. Moreover, while autophagy is increased in F198S cells, it was significantly decreased in T183A cells. Our results indicate that iPrPC may be formed more readily in an intracellular compartment and that a significant increase in PrPT183A aggregation may be attributable to the inhibition of autophagy.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879834>Effect of keratinase on ileal amino acid digestibility in five feedstuffs fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of keratinase (KE) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in rice bran, cottonseed meal (CSM), rapeseed meal (RSM), corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and peanut meal (PNM).Twelve crossbred barrows (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire, 50.5±1.4 kg  [BW]) fitted with T-cannulas at the terminal ileum were allotted to a 12×6 Youden Square design with 12 diets and 6 periods.

Numerous studies that have examined the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin embedded in a variety of model phospholipid membranes have suggested that partial unfolding of the protein is a precursor to the apoptotic response. However, these studies lacked site resolution and used model systems with negligible or a positive membrane curvature, which is distinct from the large negative curvature of the invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane where cytochrome c resides. We have used reverse micelle encapsulation to mimic the potential effects of confinement on the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin. Encapsulation of oxidized horse cytochrome c in 1-decanoyl-rac-glycerol/lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide/hexanol reverse micelles prepared in pentane yields NMR spectra essentially identical to the protein in free aqueous solution. The structure of encapsulated ferricytochrome c was determined to high precision (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 0.23 Å) using NMR-based methods and is closely similar to the cryogenic crystal structure (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 1.2 Å). Incorporation of cardiolipin into the reverse micelle surfactant shell causes localized chemical shift perturbations of the encapsulated protein, providing the first view of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction interface at atomic resolution. Three distinct sites of interaction are detected: the so-called A- and L-sites, plus a previously undocumented interaction centered on residues -36, Gly-37, -58, Trp-59, and Lys-60. Importantly, in distinct contrast to earlier studies of this interaction, the protein is not significantly disturbed by the binding of cardiolipin in the context of the reverse micelle.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11264327>Contribution of endogenous enkephalins to the enhanced analgesic effects of supraspinal mu opioid receptor agonists after inflammatory injury.</a></h2><p>This study examined a mechanism responsible for the enhanced antihyperalgesic and antinociceptive effects of the mu opioid receptor agonist (ORA) [D-Ala(2), NMePhe(4), Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) microinjected in the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) of rats with inflammatory injury induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in one hindpaw. In rats injected with CFA 4 hr earlier, microinjection of the mu opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH(2) (CTAP) in the RVM antagonized both the marginal enhancement of the potency of DAMGO and its antinociceptive effect. The delta opioid receptor antagonist naltriben (NTB) was without effect. In rats injected with CFA 2 weeks earlier, CTAP antagonized the effects of DAMGO to a lesser extent. However, NTB completely prevented the enhancement of the potency of DAMGO, whereas it did not antagonize DAMGO's antinociceptive effects. Microinjection of NTB alone, but not CTAP in the RVM of CFA-treated rats, enhanced the hyperalgesia present in the ipsilateral hindpaw and induced hyperalgesia in the contralateral, uninjured hindpaw. These results suggest that persistent inflammatory injury increased the release in the RVM of opioid peptides with preferential affinity for the delta opioid receptor, which can interact in a synergistic or additive manner with an exogenously administered mu opioid receptor agonist. Indeed, the levels of [Met(5)]enkephalin and [Leu(5)]enkephalin were increased in the RVM and in other brainstem nuclei in CFA-treated rats. This increase most likely presents a compensatory neuronal response of the CNS of the injured animal to mitigate the full expression of inflammatory pain and to enhance the antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic effects of exogenously administered mu opioid receptor analgesics.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682906>Profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus MN-ZLW-002 nutrient requirements in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus nutrient requirements to guide the design of media for high cell density culturing.

It also has immense potential to cure autoimmune and infectious diseases. The vast application of this enzyme in healthcare sector increases its market demand. However, presently the huge market demand is not achieved completely. This serves the basis to explore better producer microbial strains to bridge the gap between huge demand and supply of this therapeutic enzyme. The present study deals with the successful screening of potent microorganisms producing l-asparaginase. 47 microorganisms were screened including bacteria, fungi, and yeasts. Among all, Penicillium lilacinum showed the highest enzyme activity i.e., 39.67 IU/ml. Shigella flexneri has 23.21 IU/ml of enzyme activity (highest among all the bacterial strain tested). Further, the 3-D structure of l-asparaginase from higher producer strains was developed and validated in silico for its activity. l-asparagine (substrate for l-asparaginase) was docked inside the binding pocket of P. lilacinum and S. flexneri. Docking score for the most common substrate l-asparagine is -6.188 (P. lilacinum), -5.576 (S. flexneri) which is quite good. Moreover, the chemical property of the binding pocket revealed that amino acid residues  243, Gln 260, Gly 365, Asp 386 in P. lilacinum and residues Asp 181,  318, Asn 320 in S. flexneri have an important role in H-bonding. The in silico results supports and strengthen the wet lab results. The outcome obtained motivates to take the present study result from lab to industry for the economic/massive production of this enzyme for the diverse therapeutic application.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although opioidergic agonists depress cortical excitatory synaptic transmission, little is known about opioidergic roles in inhibitory synaptic transmission. In the IC, the opioid receptors differentially regulate the excitatory propagation: agonists of the mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and kappa (KOR) exhibit suppressive, facilitative, and little effects, respectively. Thus, we aimed to examine the effects of opioid receptor agonists on unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) in the IC. Pyramidal and GABAergic neurons in the rat IC were recorded by a multiple whole-cell patch-clamp technique. [D-Ala,N-Me-,Gly-ol]-Enkephalin acetate salt (DAMGO), an MOR agonist, reduced uIPSC amplitude by 74% in fast-spiking GABAergic interneuron (FS)→FS connections without a significant effect on FS→pyramidal cell (Pyr) connections. These effects of DAMGO were also observed in non-FS→FS and non-FS→Pyr connections: DAMGO reduced the uIPSC amplitude in non-FS→FS but not in non-FS→Pyr connections. DAMGO-induced depression of uIPSCs was blocked by the MOR antagonist, D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH. The DOR agonist, [D-Pen]-Enkephalin hydrate (DPDPE), reduced uIPSC amplitude by 39% in FS→FS and by 49% in FS→Pyr connections, which was antagonized by the DOR antagonist, naltrindole. However, DPDPE had little effect on non-FS→FS/Pyr connections. (±)-trans-U-50488 methanesulfonate salt (U50488), a KOR agonist, had little effect on uIPSC in FS→FS/Pyr connections. These results suggest that MOR-induced uIPSC depression in FS→FS and non-FS→FS, but not FS→Pyr and non-FS→Pyr connections, results in the depression of excitatory propagation in the IC, which may be an underlying mechanism of the powerful analgesic effects of MOR agonists.Copyright © 2016 IBRO.

PrnB, a highly specific l-proline transporter, only weakly recognizes other Put4p substrates, its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue. Taking advantage of the high sequence similarity between the two transporters, we combined molecular modeling, induced fit docking, genetic, and biochemical approaches to investigate the molecular basis of this difference and identify residues governing substrate binding and specificity. We demonstrate that l-proline is recognized by PrnB via interactions with residues within TMS1 (Gly(56), (57)), TMS3 (Glu(138)), and TMS6 ((248)), which are evolutionary conserved in YATs, whereas specificity is achieved by subtle amino acid substitutions in variable residues. Put4p-mimicking substitutions in TMS3 (S130C), TMS6 (F252L, S253G), TMS8 (W351F), and TMS10 (T414S) broadened the specificity of PrnB, enabling it to recognize more efficiently l-alanine, l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, and glycine without significantly affecting the apparent Km for l-proline. S253G and W351F could transport l-alanine, whereas T414S, despite displaying reduced proline uptake, could transport l-alanine and glycine, a phenotype suppressed by the S130C mutation. A combination of all five Put4p-ressembling substitutions resulted in a functional allele that could also transport l-alanine and glycine, displaying a specificity profile impressively similar to that of Put4p. Our results support a model where residues in these positions determine specificity by interacting with the substrates, acting as gating elements, altering the flexibility of the substrate binding core, or affecting conformational changes of the transport cycle.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633411>Apparent and standardised ileal amino acid digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles with or without exogenous protease in broilers and turkeys.</a></h2><p>The apparent (AIAAD) and standardised ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (wheat-DDGS) was determined for broilers and turkeys at 28 d using two experiments.

In Experiment 2, the coefficient of AIAAD was lower than 0.50 for all amino acids except for Glu (0.70) and Pro (0.81) without protease. On the other hand, the coefficient of SIAAD ranged from 0.41 () to 0.89 (Pro) without protease, whereas the range was from 0.56 (Arg) to 0.88 (Pro) with protease supplementation. With the exception of Cys and Pro, protease improved the coefficient of AIAAD and SIAAD of all other amino acids by 0.05-0.19. It was concluded that the AIAAD and SIAAD of wheat-DDGS are variable and are generally greater in broilers compared to turkeys at 28 d of age. Protease improved the ileal digestibility of a large number of amino acids in wheat-DDGS for broilers and turkeys.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9278970>A new phospholipase A2 isoform isolated from Bothrops neuwiedii (Yarará chica) venom with novel kinetic and chromatographic properties.</a></h2><p>A new phospholipase A2 isoform, called P-3, isolated from Bothrops neuwiedii (Yarará chica) venom, showed different chromatographic, enzymatic and cytotoxic properties compared to the previously purified isoforms P-1 and P-2 but it had a similar edema-inducing activity. In contrast to previously reported B. neuwiedii phospholipase A2 isoforms, P-3 did not interact with the oligosaccharide matrix of gel filtration columns (Superose, Superdex). Its molecular  was 15,000 and its N-terminal 14 amino acid sequence was Asn-Leu-Val-Gln--Glu--Leu-Ile-Met-Lys-Ile-Ala-Gly. Amino acid analyse revealed the presence of an unique histidine, presumably located at the active site, because a full inhibition of enzymatic activity was observed after treatment with p-bromophenacyl bromide. The new isoform also differentiated in its surface pressure activity profile when assayed in lipid monolayers. P-3 had an optimum activity towards dilauroylphosphatidylcholine monolayers of 27 mN/m and a cut-off pressure of 30 mN/m, whereas P-1 and P-2 had an optimum of 13 mN/m with a cut-off of 22 mN/m. P-3 retained its edema-inducing activity in the absence of hydrolytic activity, suggesting that the inflammatory activity was not dependent on the enzymatic activity. Neither the enzymatic nor the edema-inducing activity was affected by heparin. The new isoform was not lethal when a single dose of 5 micrograms/g  was injected intraperitoneally into mice. All of the isoforms displayed cytotoxic activity in vitro on B16F10 melanoma cells evaluated by direct MTT assay, with an EC50 of 31 micrograms/ml for P-3 and of 15 micrograms/ml for P-1 and P-2. The cytotoxic activity of P-3 was inhibited by p-bromophenacyl bromide treatment of the enzyme (up to 170 micrograms/ml), whereas the same treatment on P-1 and P-2 changed their EC50 to 60 micrograms/ml. The difference observed with inhibited enzymes suggests a different mechanism for the cytotoxic action of P-3 with respect to P-1 and P-2.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6106477>Conformational  studies of the growth hormone inhibitor, cyclo (Aha-Cys--D-Trp-Lys--Cys).</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29674316>Activation of renal ClC-K chloride channels depends on an intact N terminus of their accessory subunit barttin.</a></h2><p>ClC-K channels belong to the CLC family of chloride channels and chloride/proton antiporters. They contribute to sodium chloride reabsorption in Henle's loop of the kidney and to potassium secretion into the endolymph by the stria vascularis of the inner ear. Their accessory subunit barttin stabilizes the ClC-K/barttin complex, promotes its insertion into the surface membrane, and turns the pore-forming subunits into a conductive state. Barttin mutations cause Bartter syndrome type IV, a salt-wasting nephropathy with sensorineural deafness. Here, studying ClC-K/barttin channels heterologously expressed in MDCK-II and HEK293T cells with confocal imaging and patch-clamp recordings, we demonstrate that the eight-amino-acids-long barttin N terminus is required for channel trafficking and activation. Deletion of the complete N terminus (Δ2-8 barttin) retained barttin and human hClC-Ka channels in intracellular compartments. Partial N-terminal deletions did not compromise subcellular hClC-Ka trafficking but drastically reduced current amplitudes. Sequence deletions encompassing -6, -7, or Arg-8 in barttin completely failed to activate hClC-Ka. Analyses of protein expression and whole-cell current noise revealed that inactive channels reside in the plasma membrane. Substituting the deleted N terminus with a polyalanine sequence was insufficient for recovering chloride currents, and single amino acid substitutions highlighted that the correct sequence is required for proper function. Fast and slow gate activation curves obtained from rat V166E rClC-K1/barttin channels indicated that mutant barttin fails to constitutively open the slow gate. Increasing expression of barttin over that of ClC-K partially recovered this insufficiency, indicating that N-terminal modifications of barttin alter both binding affinities and gating properties.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20166730>Sequence-specific Ni(II)-dependent peptide bond hydrolysis for protein engineering. Combinatorial library determination of optimal sequences.</a></h2><p>Previously we demonstrated for several examples that peptides having a general internal sequence R(N)-Yaa-Ser/-Xaa-His-Zaa-R(C) (Yaa = Glu or Ala, Xaa = Ala or His, Zaa = Lys, R(N) and R(C) = any N- and C-terminal amino acid sequence) were hydrolyzed specifically at the Yaa-Ser/ peptide bond in the presence of Ni(II) ions at alkaline pH (Krezel, A., Mylonas, M., Kopera, E. and Bal, E. Acta Biochim. Polon. 2006, 53, 721-727 and references therein). Hereby we report the synthesis of a combinatorial library of CH(3)CO-Gly-Ala-(Ser/)-Xaa-His-Zaa-Lys--Leu-NH(2) peptides, where Xaa residues included 17 common alpha-amino acids (except Asp, Glu, and Cys) and Zaa residues included 19 common alpha-amino acids (except Cys). The Ni(II)-dependent hydrolysis at 37 and 45 degrees C of batches of combinatorial peptide mixtures randomized at Zaa was monitored by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The correctness of library-based predictions was confirmed by accurate measurements of hydrolysis rates of seven selected peptides using HPLC. The hydrolysis was strictly limited to the Ala-Ser/ bond in all library and individual peptide experiments. The effects of individual residues on hydrolysis rates were quantified and correlated with physical properties of their side chains according to a model of independent contributions of Xaa and Zaa residues. The principal component analysis calculations demonstrated partial molar side chain volume and the free  of amino acid vaporization for both Xaa and Zaa residues and the amine pK(a) for Zaa residues to be the most significant empirical parameters influencing the hydrolysis rate. Therefore, efficient hydrolysis required bulky and hydrophobic residues at both variable positions Xaa and Zaa, which contributed independently to the hydrolysis rate. This relationship between the peptide sequence and the hydrolysis rate provides a basis for further research, aimed at the elucidation of the reaction mechanism and biotechnological applications of Ni(II)-dependent peptide bond hydrolysis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2090647>A simple, continuous fluorometric assay for HIV protease.</a></h2><p>Novel fluorogenic substrates for human immunodeficiency viral protease have been developed based on the principle of fluorescence  transfer.

A total of 118 Yorkshire sows (third through sixth parity) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments from day 90 of gestation until farrowing. Dietary treatments consisted of combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA levels [14.7 or 20.6 g/d SID Lys, SID Lys and other AA met or exceeded the NRC (2012) recommendations] and 2 energy levels (28.24 or 33.78 MJ/d intake of NE) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After parturition, all sows were fed a standard lactation diet. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for parameters on metabolism, redox status, and amino acid profile. The data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models to reveal the impact of dietary levels of energy, AA, and their interaction. Sows with increased intake of AA had greater BW gain (P < 0.01) during late gestation. Furthermore, the BW loss during lactation was increased in sows with increasing intake of energy (P < 0.05) or AA (P < 0.05). Sows fed high energy had higher total litter birth  (20.2 kg vs. 18.4 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter duration of farrowing (261 min vs. 215 min, P < 0.05), compared with those fed low energy, which likely was due to higher (P < 0.05) plasma glucose and lower (P < 0.05) plasma lactate prior to parturition. High AA intake in late gestation increased the ADG of piglets during the following lactation (P < 0.05), and increased the concentrations of plasma urea, and the following AA: Lys, Met, , Val, Ile, Leu, , Asp, Ser, and Arg at farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the increased intake of energy increased total litter  of newborns and shortened the farrowing duration, which likely was due to improved energy status at farrowing. Furthermore, sows with increased intake of AA led to higher growth rate of piglets during the following lactation, accompanying with the increasing levels of plasma urea and amino acids. Therefore, the higher energy intake in late gestation appeared to improve litter  and farrowing duration, while higher AA intake may have positive effect on piglets performance in lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Periods were 7 d: 3 d for adaptation to abomasally infused treatments and 4 d for fecal and urinary collections. Blood samples were collected 3 h after feeding on d 7. In all 3 experiments, N retention was greater (P < 0.10) for lambs receiving 10EAA vs. CON, demonstrating that the basal AA supply from CON was limiting. Removal of each of the essential AA from 10EAA decreased (P < 0.10) their concentrations in plasma (except for Trp), indicating that 10EAA supplied these AA in excess of the animal's requirement.

In Exp. 2, N retention decreased (P < 0.10) in response to removal of all 3 branched-chain AA, Arg, and Trp, whereas the removal of  from 10EAA did not affect N retention. In Exp. 3, N retention decreased (P < 0.10) in response to removal of branched-chain AA and Val, but was not affected by the omission of Leu and Ile from 10EAA.

Lectin gave a single band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). In SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing and non-reducing conditions Erythrina indica leaf lectin (EiLL) split into two bands with subunit molecular  of 30 and 33 kDa, whereas 58 kDa was obtained for the intact lectin by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. EiLL agglutinated all human RBC types, with a slight preference for the O blood group. Lectin was found to be a glycoprotein with a neutral sugar content of 9.5%. The carbohydrate specificity of lectin was directed towards D-galactose and its derivatives with pronounced preference for lactose. EiLL had pH optima at pH 7.0; above and below this pH lectin lost sugar-binding capability rapidly. Lectin showed broad temperature optima from 25 to 50 degrees C; however, at 55 degrees C EiLL lost more than 90% of its activity and at 60 degrees C it was totally inactivated. The pI of EiLL was found to be 7.6. The amino acid analysis of EiLL indicated that the lectin was rich in acidic as well as hydrophobic amino acids and totally lacked cysteine and methionine. The N-terminal amino acids were Val-Glu--IIe-Ser--Ser--Ser-Glu--Glu-Ala-Gly-Asn-Asp-X-Leu--Gln-Glu-Gly-Ala-Ala-Leu-. Chemical modification studies of both EiLL and Erythrina indica seed lectin (EiSL) with phenylglyoxal, DEP and DTNB revealed an absence of arginine, histidine and cysteine, respectively, in or near the ligand-binding site of both lectins. Modification of tyrosine with NAI led to partial inactivation of EiLL and EiSL; however, total inactivation was observed upon NBS-modification of two tryptophan residues in EiSL. Despite the apparent importance of these tryptophan residues for lectin activity they did not seem to have a direct role in binding haptenic sugar as D-galactose did not protect lectin from inactivation by NBS.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205020>Crystal structures of the recombinant β-factor XIIa protease with bound -Arg and Pro-Arg substrate mimetics.</a></h2><p>Coagulation factor XII (FXII) is a key initiator of the contact pathway, which contributes to inflammatory . FXII circulates as a zymogen, which when auto-activated forms factor XIIa (FXIIa). Here, the production of the recombinant FXIIa protease domain (βFXIIa) with yields of ∼1-2 mg per litre of insect-cell culture is reported. A second construct utilized an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion (MBP-βFXIIa). Crystal structures were determined of MBP-βFXIIa in complex with the inhibitor D--Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) and of βFXIIa in isolation. The βFXIIa structure revealed that the S2 and S1 pockets were occupied by  and Arg residues, respectively, from an adjacent molecule in the crystal. The -Arg sequence mimics the P2-P1 FXIIa cleavage-site residues present in the natural substrates prekallikrein and FXII, and Pro-Arg (from PPACK) mimics the factor XI cleavage site. A comparison of the βFXIIa structure with the available crystal structure of the zymogen-like FXII protease revealed large conformational changes centred around the S1 pocket and an alternate conformation for the 99-loop, Tyr99 and the S2 pocket. Further comparison with activated protease structures of factors IXa and Xa, which also have the Tyr99 residue, reveals that a more open form of the S2 pocket only occurs in the presence of a substrate mimetic. The FXIIa inhibitors EcTI and infestin-4 have Pro-Arg and -Arg P2-P1 sequences, respectively, and the interactions that these inhibitors make with βFXIIa are also described. These structural studies of βFXIIa provide insight into substrate and inhibitor recognition and establish a scaffold for the structure-guided drug design of novel antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory agents.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2835652>Conformational determinants of high affinity delta receptor binding of opioid peptides.</a></h2><p>Detailed conformational analysis of linear and cyclic delta-selective opioid peptides was performed in conjunction with computer-analyzed receptor binding studies with the aim of determining conformational requirements for high affinity binding of peptides to the delta-receptor. The four linear delta-selective hexapeptides included in this study were: DSLET (Tyr-D-Ser-Gly--Leu-) and its D-Thr2 analog (DTLET) and two t-butyl ether analogs.

This study also includes seven cyclic pentapeptides of the type: Tyr-Cys(Pen-Gly--Cys(Pen) with various combinations of DL-cysteine and DL-penicillamine (beta-dimethyl cysteine) as the second and fifth residues resulting in varying delta affinities and selectivities. Four (DPLPE, DPDPE, DPLCE, and DCLPE) have both high delta affinity and selectivity; two (DCDCE and DCLCE) have high affinity at both delta- and mu-receptors, and one (LCLCE) has low affinity for both receptors. Our investigation has shown that all analogs that have high affinity at the delta receptor have a unique common low  conformer.

In the absence of active-site ligands, the C-terminal segment is not fixed in one position and is not detectable in the crystal structure. A key residue in the alpha9-helix is  220, which can interact with both the enzyme-bound glutathione and the second substrate, and possibly guide the reactants into the transition state. Mutation of  220 into Ala and  was shown to reduce the catalytic efficiency of GST A1-1. The mutation of an additional residue,  222, caused further decrease in activity. The presence of a viscosogen in the reaction medium decreased the kinetic parameters k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) for the conjugation of CDNB catalyzed by wild-type GST A1-1, in agreement with the view that product release is rate limiting for the substrate-saturated enzyme. The mutations cause a decrease of the viscosity dependence of both kinetic parameters, indicating that the motion of the alpha9-helix is linked to catalysis in wild-type GST A1-1. The isomerization reaction with the alternative substrate Delta(5)-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) is affected in a similar manner by the viscosogens. The transition state  of the isomerization reaction, like that of the CDNB conjugation, is lowered by  220 as indicated by the effects of the mutations on k(cat)/K(m).

In late gestation, the  requirement based on IAAO was 13.6 g/d (R(2) = 0.60, Exp. 1) and 12.3 g/d (R(2) = 0.58, Exp. 2). Based on plasma , the  requirement in early gestation was 7.0 g/d (R(2) = 0.90, Exp. 1) and 3.9 g/d (R(2) = 0.90, Exp. 2). In late gestation, the  requirement based on plasma  was 10.5 g/d (R(2) = 0.67, Exp. 2). There was a linear response to increasing  intake in late gestation in Exp. 1. Feeding a single amount of AA throughout gestation results in overfeeding AA in early gestation and underfeeding AA in late gestation. The 2-fold increase in  requirement in the last third of gestation suggests that phase feeding sows in gestation will more closely meet the demands for nutrients and that the requirement for essential AA in gestating sows should be re-evaluated in early and late gestation separately.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12761101>Purification and characterization of enterotoxigenic El Tor-like hemolysin produced by Vibrio fluvialis.</a></h2><p>The halophilic bacterium Vibrio fluvialis is an enteric pathogen that produces an extracellular hemolysin.

All diets were free of nitrogen with 2 ratios of corn starch-to-dextrose (0.31 and 1.04) and 2 levels of DEB (108 and 219 mEq/kg of diet). Final BW and BW loss between birds fed the 2 corn starch-to-dextrose ratios and between birds fed 2 levels of DEB were not different (P > 0.05).

Birds on the high-corn starch-to-dextrose (1.04) diet showed a tendency for higher (P = 0.08) feed intake. High dietary dextrose level (corn starch-to-dextrose ratio of 0.31) resulted in higher (P < 0.05) ileal DM and  digestibility.

All other amino acids were maintained at 100% of their suggested requirement level. All breeders were inseminated weekly and fertility was determined. A third trial consisted of 41-wk-old colostomized hens randomly assigned to 1 of 2 diets differing only in the amount of Ile. Urine was collected after a 6-wk feeding period. The average digestible requirements per breeder per day for both product and feed/product ratio from trials 1 and 2 for Met, Cys, TSAA, ,  + Tyr, Trp, Arg, Ile, Lys, Val, , and CP were 424, 477, 901, 689, 997, 252, 1,026, 830, 916, 799, 613 mg/d, and 20.0 g/d, respectively. The ideal profile for digestible Met, Cys, TSAA, ,  + Tyr, Trp, Arg, Ile, Lys, Val, and  was 46, 52, 98, 76, 108, 28, 112.0, 91, 100.0, 87, and 67%, respectively. A significant decrease in fertility was noted with increasing levels of Ile and Lys. Urine pH was significantly more alkaline in hens fed the higher level of Ile. It is suggested that adequate dietary Lys and Ile should be provided for maximum hatching egg production but an excess may affect fertility.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901437>Dynamics of human protein kinase Aurora A linked to drug selectivity.</a></h2><p>Protein kinases are major drug targets, but the development of highly-selective inhibitors has been challenging due to the similarity of their active sites. The observation of distinct structural states of the fully-conserved Asp--Gly (DFG) loop has put the concept of conformational selection for the DFG-state at the center of kinase drug discovery. Recently, it was shown that Gleevec selectivity for the Tyr-kinase Abl was instead rooted in conformational changes after drug binding. Here, we investigate whether protein dynamics after binding is a more general paradigm for drug selectivity by characterizing the binding of several approved drugs to the Ser/-kinase Aurora A. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, we propose a universal drug-binding mechanism, that rationalizes selectivity, affinity and long on-target residence time for kinase inhibitors. These new concepts, where protein dynamics in the drug-bound state plays the crucial role, can be applied to inhibitor design of targets outside the kinome.© 2018, Pitsawong et al.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862400>Optimal in-feed amino acid ratio for broiler breeder hens based on deletion studies.</a></h2><p>An ideal amino acid ratio (IAAR) for breeder hens is needed for maximum nitrogen retention (NR) taking into account nitrogen deposition in  (ND ), feathers (ND ) and egg mass (NEM) to improve dietary protein efficiency. Thus, the aim of this study was to apply the deletion method to derive the IAAR for broiler breeder hens. The nitrogen balance trials were performed from 31 to 35 weeks and from 46 to 50 weeks. Twelve treatments with eight replicates and one hen per cage were used. A balanced diet (BD) was formulated to meet the requirement of all nutrients. The other diets were formulated diluting 55% of BD with corn starch and refilled with amino acids (AAs) and other ingredients, except the AA tested. Each trial lasted 25 days. Feather losses, egg production and egg  were recorded daily, and the samples were stored to further determine NEM and nitrogen in feather losses (ND ). At the start and the end of each period, a group of birds were slaughtered to further determine ND and ND . The NR was calculated as the sum of ND , ND , ND , NEM and the nitrogen maintenance requirement (NMR). The deletion of valine greatly depressed the NR in peak production (31 to 35 weeks) while the deletion of the isoleucine greatly depressed the NR of the hens from 46 to 50 weeks of age. The percentual reduction in NR and the per cent of the AA to delete from the BD were used to calculate the AA requirement. The average IAAR was Lys 100, Met+Cys 86, Trp 23,  80, Arg 113, Val 90, Ile 91, Leu 133, +Tyr 108, Gly+Ser 94 and His 35. The IAAR was in line with the recommendation from the literature, validating deletion method with the advantages from a rapid and low-cost procedure.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428413>A deuterohemin peptide protects a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting Aβ aggregation.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disease and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The main hallmark of AD is the deposition of insoluble amyloid (Aβ) outside the neuron, leading to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Deuterohemin-Ala-His--Val-Glu-Lys (DhHP-6), a novel porphyrin-peptide, has both microperoxidase activity and cell permeability. In the present study, DhHP-6 efficiently inhibited the aggregation of Aβ and reduced the β-sheet percentage of Aβ from 89.1% to 78.3%. DhHP-6 has a stronger affinity (K = 100 ± 12 μM) for binding with Aβ at , Arg, Val, Glu and Glu. In addition, DhHP-6 (100 μM) significantly prolonged lifespan, alleviated paralysis and reduced Aβ plaque formation in the Aβ transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model of AD. Our results demonstrate that DhHP-6 is a potential drug candidate that efficiently protects a transgenic C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting Aβ aggregation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The 4 processed soybean products included 2 sources of enzyme-treated soybean meal (ESBM-1 and ESBM-2), extruded soybean meal, and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Twenty-seven weanling barrows (9.29 ± 0.58 kg initial BW) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Pigs were randomly allotted to three 9 × 5 Youden squares with 9 pigs and five 7-d periods in each square. Seven cornstarch-based diets were prepared using each of the protein sources as the sole source of CP and AA. A N-free diet was prepared to calculate basal endogenous losses of CP and AA, and this diet was fed to 2 groups of pigs, which resulted in a total of 9 dietary treatments. Results indicate that the SID of CP was greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, RSE, or FCM. The SID of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Met, and  were greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, and the SID of Lys was greater ( < 0.05) in SBM-CV than in ESBM-2. The SID of , Trp, Val, and total indispensable AA were not different among the soybean products, but the SID of total dispensable AA in ESBM-1 was greater ( < 0.05) than in SPC. Therefore, the SID of total AA was greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, but no other differences were observed among soybean meal (SBM) products. The SID of most AA in RSE and the SID of all AA in FCM were less ( < 0.05) than in all the SBM products, but the SID of all AA in RSE were greater ( < 0.05) than in FCM. Results of this research indicate that although processing of SBM results in increased concentration of CP, processing may also reduce the digestibility of AA, which is likely due to heat damage during processing. There are, however, differences among processed soy products, with some products having greater SID of AA than others. Results also indicate that fermentation of a mixture of rapeseed meal, wheat, and relatively low quality coproducts does not result in SID values that are similar to those of unfermented 00-rapeseed expellers or soybean products.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18261971>Development of sensitive cathepsin G fluorogenic substrate using combinatorial chemistry methods.</a></h2><p>In the current work, a synthesis of new sensitive fluorescence substrates of cathepsin G is reported. The substrate sequence was selected using combinatorial chemistry methods. The starting structure of chromogenic cathepsin G substrate Ac--Val--Gnf-ANB-NH(2), where Gnf stands for 4-guanidine-l-phenylalanine, was modified by replacing the acetyl moiety with a residue of 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl acetic acid (Mca) that served as a fluorescence donor. An amide of amino benzoic acid (ANB-NH(2)) was used as an acceptor. This peptide, exhibiting effective fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) phenomena, was used as a starting structure to construct the library Mca--Val--Gnf-X(1)-X(2)-ANB-NH(2), where in both variable X positions all proteinogenic amino acid residues except Cys were introduced. Deconvolution of such a library, performed by the iterative method in solution, revealed prime site preferences of cathepsin G. Finally, the most susceptible sequence, Mca--Val--Gnf-Ser-Trp-ANB-NH(2), was selected. The determined value of the specificity constant (k(cat)/K(M) = 252 x 10(3)M(-1)xs(-1)) was two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained for the parent compound.

Characterization of this enzyme has been difficult, however, because the recombinant enzyme is produced mainly as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli. In this study, expression of the recombinant protein into the soluble fraction was markedly improved by co-expression with chaperone molecules. The purified enzyme retained its full activity after incubation at 80°C for at least 2 h in buffer (pH 7-10), making this enzyme the most thermostable amino acid racemase so far known. Besides the nine amino acids containing hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids previously reported (Kawakami et al., Amino Acids, 47, 1579-1587, 2015), the enzyme exhibited substantial activity toward  (about 42% of relative activity toward ) and showed no activity toward Arg, His, Gln, and Asn. The substrate specificity of this enzyme thus differs markedly from those of other known amino acid racemases. In particular, the high reaction rate with Trp and Tyr, in addition to Leu, Met and  as substrates is a noteworthy feature of this enzyme. The high reactivity toward Trp and Tyr, as well as extremely high thermostability, is likely a major advantage of using BAR for biochemical conversion of these aromatic amino acids.Copyright © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The actions of VIP are mediated through VPAC(1) and VPAC(2). In contrast to VPAC(1), which has been extensively studied, little is known about the pharmacology of VPAC(2). In this study we investigated the VIP pharmacophore for VPAC(2) by using alanine and D-amino acid scanning. We found significant species differences, and the human VPAC(2) (hVPAC(2)) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which have been used in previous studies, differed significantly from the native hVPAC(2) in Sup T(1) cells and hVPAC(2) expressed in PANC1 cells. There was a close agreement between binding affinities and potencies for VPAC(2) activation. The amino acids whose backbone or side chain orientations were most important for high affinity potency are Asp(3), (6), (7), Tyr(10), Arg(12), Tyr(22), and Leu(23), whereas the side chains of Ser(2), Asp(8), Asn(9), Gln(16), Val(19), Lys(20), Lys(21), Asn(24), and Ser(25) are not essential. Comparison of the VIP pharmacophore between hVPAC(1) and hVPAC(2) demonstrated that the side chains of (7), Tyr(10), (11), and Tyr(22) were much more critical for high affinity for the hVPAC(2) than the hVPAC(1). In contrast, the orientation of the side chain of Asn(24) was more important for high affinity for the hVPAC(1). This study shows that in assessing the pharmacophore of VIP analogs for the VPAC(2), important species differences need to be considered as well as the expression system used. These results of our study should be useful for designing VPAC subtype-selective analogs, simplified analogs, and possibly metabolically stable analogs.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491915>Analysis of the correlation between dipeptides and taste differences among soy sauces by using metabolomics-based component profiling.</a></h2><p>Characterizing the relationships between the components and taste differences among soy sauces can help evaluate and improve the quality of soy sauces. Although previous studies have reported that certain taste-active dipeptides, the relationships between taste differences and dipeptides of soy sauces are unknown. Therefore, our objective in this study was to investigate the correlations between the dipeptides and the taste differences among soy sauces. To analyze the dipeptides, we constructed an analytical method using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Based on this method, we detected 237 dipeptides, the largest number ever detected in soy sauce research. Next, orthogonal projections to latent structures regressions were performed. The data matrix of components, including dipeptides and other low-molecular- hydrophilic components obtained from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), served as explanatory variables (366 in total), whereas a sensory data matrix obtained using quantitative descriptive analysis served as the response variable. The accuracy of models for the sweetness and saltiness differences constructed using the LC/MS/MS and GC/MS data matrix were higher than did models constructed using only the GC/MS data matrix. As a result of investigation of the correlation between the dipeptides and taste differences among soy sauces by using variable importance in the projection (VIP) score, many dipeptides showed the high correlation with taste differences. Specifically, Ile-Gln, Pro-Lys, Ile-Glu, -, and Leu-Gln showed the high VIP score on sweet differences.

Gel-filtration chromatography gave an apparent molecular mass of 41 kDa and SDS-PAGE showed only one protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 42 kDa, indicating that the enzyme is a single polypeptide. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 8.0 and the pI value of the enzyme was 5.0. The enzyme was relatively stable from pH 4.5 to 7.5. The optimal temperature for the enzyme activity was 30 degrees C. The activity of the enzyme was inhibited by Hg2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid. The enzyme catalysed the oxidation of D-arabinose, L-fucose, L-xylose and L-galactose, which have the same configurations of hydroxyl groups at C2- and C3-positions, with apparent K(m) values of 29.2, 28.9, 37.1 and 91.3 mM at pH 8.0, respectively, with 50 microM NADP+. The enzyme used NADP+ as a coenzyme. Apparent K(m) value at 60 mM D-arabinose for NADP+ was 44.6 microM. NADPH inhibited the enzyme activity competitively with respect to NADP+ (Ki = 78.6 microM). The amino-terminal sequence of the enzyme was Met-Lys-Leu-Ala--Glu-Ile-Asp--X-Leu-Asn-Asn-Gly-. The reaction product was D-arabinono-1,4-lactone, judged from gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

Eight mid-lactation Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 5-day continuous jugular infusions of saline (CTL), EAA mixture prepared on the profile of casein and supplied (in % of lysine (Lys)) 100% of Lys, 33.3% of methionine (Met), 110.2% of Leu, 43.6% of Arg, 50.8% of threonine (), 81.6% of valine (Val), 69.7% of isoleucine (Ile), 61.4% of phenylalanine () and 34.2% of histidine (His) (Casein, 160 g/d), EAA mixture excluding Leu (-Leu, 163 g/d) or EAA mixture excluding Arg (-Arg, 158 g/d) in a duplicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four infusion periods separated by 7-day interval period. The basal diet supplied 1.6 Mcal NE and 94.4 g MP per 1 kg DM to meet requirements for lactation. The Casein treatment provided a balanced supply (in % of MP) of 10.3% Leu and 5.3% Arg, whereas in the two subsequent -Leu and -Arg treatments, the concentration of Leu and Arg was reduced to 8.4 and 4.6% respectively. Dry matter intake (15.4 kg/day) was not affected by treatments. The Casein treatment increased milk yield (14.9%, p < 0.001), milk protein yield (120 g, p < 0.001) and milk protein efficiency (0.03, p = 0.099) than CTL treatment. However, the -Leu treatment decreased the responses of above-measured parameters by 6.25%, 70 g, 0.05 (p < 0.06) (compared with Casein). These effects of Leu were related to decreased Leu concentration and improved concentration of Ile and Val in plasma. The -Arg treatment decreased the plasma Arg concentration than the Casein treatment, whereby resulted in the decrease of milk yield (5.7%, p = 0.073), milk protein yield (60 g, p = 0.011) and milk protein efficiency (0.04, p = 0.037). In conclusion, supply of EAA profile of casein can increase the lactation production in dairy cows, and 8.6% of Leu in MP partly limits the milk protein response when the requirements of Lys, Met and His were met. The level of Arg at 4.6% MP is not deemed to an ideal profile, as evidenced by decreased milk protein efficiency.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22792284>Low level sequence variant analysis of recombinant proteins: an optimized approach.</a></h2><p>Sequence variants in recombinant biopharmaceuticals may have a relevant and unpredictable impact on clinical safety and efficacy. Hence, their sensitive analysis is important throughout bioprocess development. The two stage analytical approach presented here provides a quick multi clone comparison of candidate production cell lines as a first stage, followed by an in-depth analysis including identification and quantitation of aberrant sequence variants of selected clones as a second stage. We show that the differential analysis is a suitable tool for sensitive and fast batch to batch comparison of recombinant proteins. The optimized approach allows for detection of not only single amino acid substitutions in unmodified peptides, but also substitutions in posttranslational modified peptides such as glycopeptides, for detection of truncated or elongated sequence variants as well as double amino acid substitutions or substitution with amino acid structural isomers within one peptide. In two case studies we were able to detect sequence variants of different origin down to a sub percentage level. One of the sequence variants ( → Asn) could be correlated to a cytosine to adenine substitution at DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) level. In the second case we were able to correlate the sub percentage substitution ( → Tyr) to amino acid limitation in the chemically defined fermentation medium.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11809685>Inhibition of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein by Bcr requires phosphoserine 354.</a></h2><p>The BCR protein is involved in the inhibition of oncogenic activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. This inhibition is believed to be the result of binding to the SH2 domain of Bcr-Abl in a non-phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. We showed that the Arg to Leu mutation in the -Leu-Val-Arg-Glu-Ser (FLVRES) sequence of the SH2 domain, known to interfere with phosphotyrosine sequence binding, did not block the binding of Bcr first exon sequences to the Abl SH2 domain. We examined the structural-functional properties of a first exon mutant of BCR lacking the oligomerization domain, termed Bcr(64-413), that encodes the Ser- protein kinase activity of Bcr. The autokinase product contained a M(r) 45,000-47,000 and 55,000 protein. Both species were detected by a Bcr phosphoserine 354 sequence-specific antibody. In contrast, the S354A mutant of Bcr(64-413), although maintaining autokinase activity, produced only the M(r) 45,000-47,000 kinase product. Abl SH2 binding experiments indicated that the M(r) 55,000 species of Bcr(64-413) but not the M(r) 45,000-47,000 species bound strongly to glutathime transferase-Abl SH2. The S354A mutant of Bcr(64-413) did not bind to glutathime transferase-Abl SH2. An adenovirus encoding Bcr(64-413) S354A did not induce cell death in CML cell lines in contrast to wild-type Bcr(64-413). Our findings indicate that Ser-354 of Bcr is part of a gating mechanism, which, after its phosphorylation, allows structural changes to occur in the Bcr protein. This altered phosphoserine form of the Bcr protein selectively binds to the Abl SH2 domain of the oncoprotein, which we propose down-regulates the activity of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380606>Amino acid digestibility in soybean meal sourced from different regions of the United States and fed to pigs.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) by growing pigs of AA in soybean meal (SBM) produced in different regions of the United States. Twenty-two growing barrows (25.5 ± 1.73 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula near the distal ileum and allotted to a 22 × 8 Youden square design. Twenty-two sources of SBM were procured from soybean crushing plants located throughout the United States. For analysis, the crushing plant locations were separated into the following 3 zones: 1) Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota ( = 4); 2) Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio ( = 11); and 3) Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska ( = 7). Dietary treatments included 22 diets based on a mixture of cornstarch, sucrose, and each source of SBM as the sole source of CP. Results indicated that the concentration of most indispensable and dispensable AA in SBM were not different among zones. However, SBM from zone 2 had a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of  than SBM from zone 3 and a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Gly than SBM from zone 1. The concentration of Tyr in SBM from zone 2 was also greater ( < 0.05) than in SBM from zones 1 and 3. However, if concentrations of AA were calculated as a percent of CP, there were no differences in the concentrations of indispensable and dispensable AA among SBM from the 3 zones. Likewise, the AID of CP and the AID of indispensable and dispensable AA were not different among SBM from the 3 zones. The SID of CP and most AA was also not different among SBM from the 3 zones. However, SBM from zone 3 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of His, Asp, and Cys than SBM from zone 2, and SBM from zone 1 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of Lys than SBM from zone 2. There was also a tendency ( < 0.10) for SBM from zone 3 to have a greater SID of Ile, Leu, , Val, Ala, and Tyr than SBM from zone 2. If the concentrations of SID CP and AA were calculated as grams per kilogram, SBM among the 3 zones were not different with the exception that there was a tendency ( = 0.07) for SBM from zone 2 to contain more SID  and SID Tyr than SBM from zone 3. In conclusion, only a few differences in concentrations and digestibility of CP and AA exist among sources of SBM from different zones in the United States. These observations indicate that the protein value is not different among SBM produced in the United States regardless of the location of the crushing plants.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10525356>Purification and characterization of insulin from the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Dipnoi).</a></h2><p>The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, a facultative air breather, is considered to be the most primitive of the extant Dipnoi and so occupies a uniquely important evolutionary position in the transition from fish to tetrapods. Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of N. forsteri and its primary structure established as: A-Chain, Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His--Pro(10)-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Leu-G lu-Asn-Tyr-Cys(20)-Asn-Glu--Glu; B-Chain, Ala-Ala-Val-Asn-Gln-His-Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser(10)-His-Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu- Tyr--Val-Cys(20)-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly---Tyr-Leu-Pro- Lys(30)-Gly. This amino acid sequence is more similar to that of human insulin than to insulins from present-day amphibians. All the residues in human insulin that are considered to be important in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization are conserved in lungfish insulin except for the substitution (Leu --> ) at the position corresponding to B17 in human insulin. Consistent with the assertion that the Dipnoi is a monophyletic group, insulins from N. forsteri and from the African lungfish Protopterus annectens contain extensions to the C-terminus of the A-chain and to the N-terminus of the B-chain that have not been found in other sarcopterygian species. However, the unusual amino acid substitutions found in insulin from P. annectens (e.g., GlyB21 --> Ala, GluB22 --> Asp, and ArgB23 --> Asn) are not present in N. forsteri insulin, suggesting that they occurred in the Protopterus lineage after divergence of the genera.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2914138>Topography of surface-exposed amino acids in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin determined by proteolysis and micro-sequencing.</a></h2><p>The topography of membrane-surface-exposed amino acids in the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) was studied.

Fragments transferred were sequenced in a gas-phase sequencer. Papain cleavage sites at Gly-65, Gly-72, and Gly-231, previously only deduced from the apparent molecular  of the digestion fragments, could be confirmed by N-terminal micro-sequencing. By proteinase K, cleavage occurred at Gln-3, -71, Gly-72, Tyr-131, Tyr-133, and Ser-226, i.e., in regions previously suggested to be surface-exposed. Additionally, proteinase-K cleavage sites at -121 and Leu-127 were identified, which are sites predicted to be in the alpha-helical membrane-spanning segment D. Our results, especially that the amino acids Gly-122 to Tyr-133 are protruding into the aqueous environment, place new constraints on the amino-acid folding of BR across the purple membrane. The validity of theoretical prediction methods of the secondary structure and polypeptide folding for membrane proteins is challenged.

The inflammatory effects are induced by endotoxin release. We performed this study to evaluate the potential of direct intraperitoneal application of an endotoxin inhibitor in a laparoscopic peritonitis model in rats. The human feces specimen was prepared, and a standard fecal specimen (0.5 ml/kg b.w.) was applied via minilaparotomy. The rats were randomized to two studies. First, rats were randomized to three groups to define the survival time: (1) rats without further manipulation; (2) rats with laparoscopic lavage using NaCl; (3) rats with laparoscopic lavage using endotoxin inhibitor. Second, rats underwent the same procedure used in the first part of the study and an additional group with only NaCl lavage without peritonitis was randomized. To evaluate the immunologic or biochemical effects, animals were killed at a standard time of 20 hours until the postmortem examination was established. Interleukins 6 and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl group levels in plasma and particularly in peritoneal fluid were assayed. The first part of the experiment showed significantly increased survival after endotoxin inhibitor lavage. In the second part, administration of endotoxin inhibitor intraperitoneally caused a significant reduction of IL-6 in the peritoneal fluid, in contrast to that in the other groups. Laparoscopic application of endotoxin inhibitor intraperitoneally thus produced a beneficial effect on survival and reduction of IL-6 in peritoneal fluid. Hence, it is possible to influence the  cascade by causing intraperitoneal endotoxin inhibition.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317643>Multiple mutations and overexpression of the MdaE7 carboxylesterase gene associated with male-linked malathion resistance in housefly, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).</a></h2><p>Two unique housefly strains, MSS and N-MRS, were selected and used to clarify mechanisms of sex-associated malathion resistance in the housefly, Musca domestica. Compared with the lab-susceptible CSS strain, susceptible females and resistant males were observed in the malathion-susceptible MSS strain, while the malathion-resistant near-isogenic line, N-MRS, achieved similar resistance level between genders. Significant synergistic effect of the esterase-inhibitor DEF on resistant houseflies pointed to the important involvement of esterase in this specific malathion resistance. Examination of the carboxylesterase gene MdαE7 in malathion resistant housefly populations found seven, non-synonymous SNP mutations (Ser-, Trp-Ser, Met-Ile, Leu-, Ser-Leu, Trp-Arg and Ser-), not found in susceptible houseflies, revealing a strong correlation between these mutations and the development of malathion resistance. Further genetic analysis conducted with bioassays by topical application and nucleotide polymorphism detection provided a first line of molecular evidence for a linkage between a male-determining factor and MdαE7 gene in the MSS and N-MRS males. This linkage results in a much higher level of malathion resistance for males than females in the MSS strain.

T. cruzi autophagin-2 (TcAtg4.2) carries the majority of proteolytic activity and is responsible for processing Atg8 proteins near the carboxyl terminus, exposing a conserved glycine. This enables progression of autophagy and differentiation of the parasite, which is required for successful colonization of humans. The mechanism of substrate hydrolysis by Atg4 was found to be highly conserved among the species as critical mutations in the TcAtg4.2, including mutation of the conserved Gly-244 residue in the hinge region enabling flexibility of the regulatory loop, and deletion of the regulatory loop, completely abolished processing capacity of the mutants. Using the positional scanning-substrate combinatorial library (PS-SCL) we determined that TcAtg4.2 tolerates a broad spectrum of amino acids in the P4 and P3 positions, similar to the human orthologue autophagin-1 (HsAtg4B). In contrast, both human and trypanosome Atg4 orthologues exhibited exclusive preference for aromatic amino acid residues in the P2 position, and for Gly in the P1 position, which is absolutely conserved in the natural Atg8 substrates.

The present study examined the propensity of endomorphin-1 to modulate synovial blood flow in normal and adjuvant-inflamed at knee joints. Under deep urethane anesthesia, endomorphin-1 was topically applied to exposed normal and 1 wk adjuvant monoarthritic knee joints (0.1 ml bolus; 10(-12)-10(-9) mol). Relative changes in articular blood flow were measured by laser Doppler perfusion imaging and vascular resistances in response to the opioid were calculated. In normal knees, endomorphin-1 caused a dose-dependent increase in synovial vascular resistance and this effect was significantly inhibited by the specific mu-opioid receptor antagonist d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-O n--Pen-Th amide (CTOP) (P < 0.0001, 2-factor ANOVA, n = 5-7). One week after adjuvant , the hypoaemic effect of endomorphin-1 was completely abolished (P < 0.0001, 2-factor ANOVA, n = 5-7). Immunohistochemical analysis of normal and adjuvant-inflamed joints showed a ninefold increase in endomorphin-1 levels in the monoarthritic knee compared with normal control. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed a moderate number of mu-opioid receptors in normal knees; however, mu-opioid receptors were almost undetectable in arthritic joints. These findings demonstrate that peripheral administration of endomorphin-1 reduces knee joint blood flow and this effect is not sustainable during advanced . The loss of this hypoaemic response appears to be due to down regulation of mu-opioid receptors as a consequence of endomorphin-1 accumulation within the arthritic joint.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1333198>Purification and characterization of a sialidase from Bacteroides fragilis SBT3182.</a></h2><p>A sialidase from Bacteroides fragilis SBT3182 was purified 2,240-fold to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential chromatographies on DEAE-Toyopearl 650M, Hydroxyapatite, MonoS and Superose6 columns.

But the other Glu 121:His 143 associated complex (EH) of Cytc(4)-RCy was stabilized by the H-bonding interaction of the oxygen atoms O(epsilon1) and O(epsilon2) of Glu 121 with the Nepsilon and Ogamma atoms of His 143 and  146 of RCy. The six water molecules were present in the binding region of the two proteins in the  minimized autosolvated DH and EH-complexes. The MD studies also revealed the presence of six interacting water molecules at the binding region between the two proteins in both the complexes. Several residues Gly 82 and 84, His 143 (RCy) were participated through the water mediated (W 389, W 430, W 413, W 431, W 373, and W 478) interaction with the Asp 15, Ile 82, and 62, Tyr 63 (Cytc(4)) in DH complex, whereas in EH complex the  51, Asn 80, Tyr 146 (RCy) residues were observed to interact with Asn 108, Met 120, Glu 121 (of Cytc(4)) through the water molecules W 507, W 445, W 401, W 446, and W 440. The direct water mediated (W 478) interaction of His 143 (RCy) to Asp 15 (of Cytc(4)) was observed only in the DH complex but not in EH. These direct and water mediated H-bonding between the two respective proteins and the binding free  with higher interacting buried surface area of the DH complex compare to other EH complex have indicated an alternative possibility of the electron transfer route through the interaction of His 143 of RCy and the N-terminal Asp 15 of Cytc(4).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507836>Hydration free energies of amino acids: why side chain analog data are not enough.</a></h2><p>Using molecular dynamics based free  simulations, we computed relative solvation free energies for pairs of N-acetyl-methylamide amino acids (Ala-Ser, Val-, -Tyr, Val-Ala, -Ser, -Ala, and Tyr-Ser) and compared the results with the relative solvation free energies of the corresponding pairs of side chain analogs. We observed differences in (relative) solvent affinity DeltaDeltaDeltaA between amino acids and side chain analogs of up to 66% or, in absolute numbers, 4.9 kcal/mol (Ala-Ser). To rationalize these findings, we estimated separately contributions from what we refer to as solvent exclusion and self-solvation. While the former accounts for the reduction in solute-solvent interactions as one part of the solute occludes other parts of the solute, the latter turned out to be the determining contribution for small polar amino acids and could be shown to arise from interactions between the polar backbone and the polar functional group of the respective side chain in the gas phase. Consequently, the solvent affinity of small polar amino acids depends strongly on the backbone conformation. Our results indicate that the still widely used group additivity-solvent exclusion assumption to estimate solvation free energies for large(r) molecules (such as peptides and proteins) from model compound data (such as side chain analogs) is insufficient. To illustrate practical consequences, we compare the explicit solvent results with those of implicit solvent models. While approaches based on the generalized Born model give results in (mostly) good agreement with explicit solvent, approaches relying (primarily) on the group additivity-solvent exclusion assumption fail to reproduce DeltaDeltaDeltaA. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of our results for hydrophobicity scales.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26360925>The detection of a synthetic Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist peptide in a seized product from a racing stable.</a></h2><p>A synthetic Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist peptide with the sequence Acetyl--Glu-Trp--Pro-Gly-Tyr-Trp-Gln-Pro-Tyr-Ala-Leu-Pro-Leu-OH has been identified in a vial seized during a stable inspection. The use of peptide-based Interleukin-1 receptor antagonists as anti-inflammatory agents has not been previously reported, making this peptide the first in a new class of sports doping peptides. The peptide has been characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry and a detection method developed based on solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Using in vitro and in vivo models to study the properties of the peptide after administration, the peptide was shown to be highly unstable in plasma and was not detected in urine after administration in a rat. The poor stability of the peptide makes detection challenging but also suggests that it has limited effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory drug.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18599674>Effects of coextrusion of flaxseed and field pea on the digestibility of , ether extract, fatty acids, protein, and amino acids in grower-finisher pigs.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to determine the ileal and total tract digestibility of individual fatty acids, ether extract, , protein, and AA in a mix of flax and field pea (FP) and to determine whether extrusion improves the nutritive value of this mix. Five barrows (23-kg initial BW) fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were fed 5 diets at 3 times the maintenance  requirement according to a 5 x 5 Latin square design: a wheat and soybean meal control diet and 4 diets containing 30% raw or coextruded FP plus 70% control diet and chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. The 4 extrusion treatments included the following: 1) FP0, ground, nonextruded; 2) FP1, single-screw extruded; 3) FP2, twin-screw extruded with low intensity (screw speed 120 rpm; die temperature 110 degrees C; water input 5 kg/h); and 4) FP3, twin-screw extruded with high intensity (300 rpm; 125 degrees C; 11 kg/h). The ether extract concentration was 17.8, 19.6, 17.7, and 17.3% (as fed) in FP0, FP1, FP2, and FP4, respectively. The ADF concentration was 13.2, 11.1, 11.4, and 13.7% (as fed) in FP0, FP1, FP2, and FP4, respectively. After a 7-d acclimation, feces were collected for 2 d, and then ileal digesta was collected for 2 d.  digestibility in the test ingredients was calculated using the difference method. Extrusion of FP did not affect the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, OM, and CP for grower-finisher pigs. Extrusion increased (P < 0.05) the ATTD of GE and ether extract and the DE content of FP, and the AID of the Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, , , and Val, and total fatty acids. Extrusion tended to increase (P < 0.10) the AID of linolenic acid. Single-screw extrusion resulted in a greater (P < 0.05) ATTD of GE, OM, ether extract, and DE content of FP and AID of SFA than twin-screw extrusion. Single-screw extrusion resulted in a trend for greater (P < 0.10) AID of linolenic acid and total fatty acids than twin-screw extrusion. Twin-screw extrusion at high intensity resulted in less (P < 0.05) AID of SFA than twin-screw extrusion at low intensity, indicating that equipment and conditions should be carefully controlled for the extrusion of FP.

For every ligand, the Kd or Ki values at 0 degrees C, 12 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C were determined, a van't Hoff plot was generated and deltaH degrees' , deltaS degrees' and -TdeltaS degrees' and deltaG degrees' were calculated. Changes in free energy (deltaG degrees') ranged from -10.35 to -15.65 kcal/mol. The binding of sufentanil, ohmefentanyl, diprenorphine and D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--penicillamineThr-NH2 (CTAP) was endothermic (deltaH degrees' > 0) and driven by an increase in entropy (-TdeltaS degrees' = -13.08 to -18.57 kcal/mol). The binding of naltrexone was exothermic (deltaH degrees' = -12.56 kcal/mol) and essentially enthalpy-driven. The binding of morphine, methadone, pentazocine, [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) and Tyr-Pro-NMePhe-D-Pro-NH2 (PL017) was exothermic (deltaH degrees' = -3.53 to -9.95 kcal/mol) and occurred with an increase in entropy (-TdeltaS degrees' = -2.48 to -7.92 kcal/mol). Plots of enthalpy versus entropy and enthalpy versus free energy were linear, although enthalpy-entropy compensation was not evident. The entropy changes were not correlated with apparent lipophilicity of the compounds. These results suggest that: (1) opioid ligands bind to the mu receptor by specific mechanisms, unrelated to  solubility; (2) the mechanism of binding is not universally different for peptide and non-peptide ligands; (3) the nature of binding does not a priori determine intrinsic activity. The results reveal a novel differentiation of opioid ligands into two groups (group 1: ohmefentanyl, sufentanil, diprenorphine, CTAP and PL017; group 2: naltrexone, morphine, methadone, DAMGO, pentazocine), based on two distinct relationships between enthalpy versus free energy of binding, the details of which are yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190051>Optimal crude protein in diets supplemented with crystalline amino acids fed to high-yielding lactating sows1.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current study was to determine the requirement of standardized ileal digestible (SID) CP for maximal litter gain in high-yielding lactating sows due to insufficient supply of either His, Leu, Val, Ile, or . The content of SID Lys was formulated at 95% of the recommended level, while that of Met, Met+Cys, , and Trp was formulated at 100% of the recommended level or slightly greater using crystalline AA. A total of 540 parity 1 to 5 sows (L×Y, DanBred, Herlev, Denmark) were included in the study from day 3 after farrowing until weaning at day 26. Sows were allocated to six dietary treatments increasing in SID CP content (96, 110, 119, 128, 137, and 152 g/kg). Litters were standardized to 14 piglets at day 3 ± 2 after farrowing. At day 3 ± 2 after farrowing and at day 26 ± 3, sow BW and back fat, and litter  were recorded. On a subsample of 72 sows (parity 2 to 4), litters were also weighed at days 10 and 17 ± 3, and milk and blood were sampled at day 3 ± 2 d, and 10, 17 and at 24 ± 3 d in lactation. Sow  pools of protein and fat were determined on the 72 sows at days 3 ± 2 and 26 ± 3 d using the D2O dilution technique. All data were subjected to ANOVA, and to linear and quadratic polynomial contrasts. Variables with quadratic effects or days in milk × treatment interactions were analyzed using linear regression or one-slope linear broken line using the NLMIXED procedure of SAS. Average daily litter gain reached a breakpoint at 125 g SID CP/kg (as-fed). Multiparous sows had a greater litter gain than primiparous sows (3.33 vs. 3.02 kg/d above the breakpoint; P < 0.001) but litter size (13.1 ± 0.1) at weaning were unaffected by dietary treatment (P = 0.62). Sow BW loss was minimized at 102 g SID CP/kg. Concentrations of protein and casein in milk increased linearly with increasing SID CP (P < 0.001). Milk urea reached a minimum at 111-118 g SID CP/kg (P < 0.05) and milk fat a maximum at 116 g SID CP/kg (P < 0.05). In conclusion, 125 g SID CP/kg feed was required to maximize litter gain.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science.

Under acidic endosomal pH conditions, the toxin's protective antigen (PA) component forms a transmembrane channel in host cells. The PA channel then translocates its two enzyme components, lethal factor and edema factor, into the host cytosol under the proton motive force. Protein translocation under a proton motive force is catalyzed by a series of nonspecific polypeptide binding sites, called clamps. A 10-residue guest/host peptide model system, KKKKKXXSXX, was used to functionally probe polypeptide-clamp interactions within wild-type PA channels. The guest residues were , Ala, Leu, , Tyr, and Trp. In steady-state translocation experiments, the channel blocked most tightly with peptides that had increasing amounts of nonpolar surface area. Cooperative peptide binding was observed in the Trp-containing peptide sequence but not the other tested sequences. Trp substitutions into a flexible, uncharged linker between the lethal factor amino-terminal domain and diphtheria toxin A chain expedited translocation. Therefore, peptide-clamp sites in translocase channels can sense large steric features (like tryptophan) in peptides, and while these steric interactions may make a peptide translocate poorly, in the context of folded domains, they can make the protein translocate more rapidly presumably via a hydrophobic steric ratchet mechanism.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

In fact, we showed that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminus region of the S protein of HBV had membrane-interacting properties and was able to induce liposome fusion adopting an extended (beta-sheet) conformation (Rodríguez-Crespo et al., 1996, 1995). We describe herein studies on the interaction of peptides derived from the N-terminal region of the S protein of duck (DHBV: Met-Ser-Gly---Gly-Gly-Ile-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ile-Gly-Leu-Leu) and woodchuck hepatitis B viruses (WHV: Met-Ser-Pro-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Gln-Val-Val) with liposomes. These peptides were able to induce to a different extent aggregation,  mixing, and leakage of internal aqueous contents from both neutral and negatively charged phospholipid vesicles in a concentration-dependent and pH-independent manner. Fluorescence depolarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene-labeled vesicles indicated that both peptides become inserted into the hydrophobic core of the  bilayer. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the DHBV peptide adopts an extended conformation in the presence of lipids, whereas the WHV peptide displays a high content of alpha-helical conformation. Therefore, these results extend our previous findings obtained for human hepatitis B virus to other members of the hepadnavirus family and suggest that this region of the S protein is important in the initial steps of the infective cycle.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10095048>Effects of opioid receptor antagonists on the effects of i.v. morphine on carrageenin evoked c-Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord.</a></h2><p>This study performed in freely moving rats evaluated the ability of specific opioid receptor antagonists to reverse the inhibitory effects of morphine on carrageenin-induced c-Fos expression in the spinal cord. Our study focused on the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I-II), which is the main termination site of nociceptive primary afferent fibers and is rich in opioid receptors. In order to replicate clinical routes of administration, all agents were administered intravenously (i.v.). As previously demonstrated, pre-administered i.v. morphine (3 mg/kg) produced a marked decrease (58+/-5%) in the number of Fos-LI neurones measured at 2 h after intraplantar (i.pl.) carrageenin (6 mg/150 microl) and yet was without influence on peripheral oedema. This decrease in c-Fos expression was completely blocked by combined administration of morphine with the mu-opioid receptor antagonist, [D--Cys-Tyr-D-Orn--Pen--NH2] (CTOP-1+1 mg/kg). Naltrindole (NTI-1+1 mg/kg), a delta-opioid receptor antagonist partially blocked the effects of systemic morphine, so that the inhibitory effects of morphine after NTI injection are now 40+/-4%. However, this effect of NTI was weak since the depressive effects of morphine were still highly significant (p<0.001). In contrast, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI-1+1 mg/kg), a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, had no significant effect on the effects of morphine. These results indicate the major contribution of mu-opioid receptors to the antinociceptive effects of systemic morphine at the level of the superficial dorsal horn. The observed effect of NTI is not necessarily related to a direct action of morphine on delta-opioid receptors and some possible actions of this antagonist are discussed.Copyright 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15312782>Involvement of opioid receptors in electroacupuncture-produced anti-hyperalgesia in rats with peripheral .</a></h2><p>Our previous study showed that electroacupuncture (EA) significantly attenuated inflammatory hyperalgesia. It has also been reported that EA analgesia in uninjured animals is mediated by mu and delta opioid receptors at 2-15 Hz and by kappa opioid receptor at 100 Hz. Because persistent pain changes neural response to external stimulation, we hypothesized that (1) the mechanisms of EA anti-hyperalgesia may be different under conditions of persistent pain and that (2) combining EA with a sub-effective dose of morphine could enhance EA anti-hyperalgesia. Hyperalgesia, decreased paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus, was induced by subcutaneously injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paws of rats. Selective antagonists against mu (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen-ThrNH2, CTOP), delta (naltrinodole, NTI) and kappa (nor-binaltorphimine, BNI) opioid receptors were administered intrathecally 10 min before each of two EA treatments at acupoint Huantiao (GB30), one immediately post and the other 2 h post-CFA. Morphine was given (i.p.) 40 min before the second EA treatment. PWL was measured before and 2.5 and 5 h post-CFA. Both 10 and 100 Hz EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia were blocked spinally by mu- and delta- but not kappa-receptor antagonists. EA combined with a sub-threshold dose of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) enhanced anti-hyperalgesia additively (10 Hz EA) or synergistically (100 Hz EA) compared to that produced by each component alone. These results suggest selective involvement of mu and delta, but not kappa, receptors in EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia in rats.

A chimeric structure was suggested for cG-BPDE since DEAE chromatography of a partial alpha-chymotryptic digest of cG-BPDE separated cGMP-binding fragments from a cGMP hydrolytic fragment. Native cG-BPDE (178 kDa) appeared to be a homodimer comprised of two 93-kDa subunits. The order of potency of inhibitors of cG-BPDE hydrolysis of cGMP was as follows: zaprinast greater than dipyridamole greater than 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-8-methoxymethylxanthine greater than 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine greater than cilostamide greater than theophylline greater than rolipram. Minimum [3H]cGMP binding stoichiometry was 0.93 mol of cGMP bound/mol of monomer, but [3H]cGMP dissociation from cG-BPDE in the presence of excess unlabeled cGMP was curvilinear, suggesting multiple cGMP-binding sites. Two chymotryptic cGMP-binding fragments of 35 and 45 kDa were specifically photoaffinity labeled with [32P] cGMP, exhibited [3H]cGMP association and dissociation behavior indistinguishable from native cG-BPDE, and each had the amino-terminal sequence: -Ser-Pro-Arg--Asp-Asn-Asp-Glu-Gly-. Cochromatography of the two cGMP-binding fragments suggested that both a dimerization domain and a cGMP-binding domain were located in a 35-kDa segment of cG-BPDE. Increased [3H]cGMP binding to or [32P]cGMP photoaffinity labeling of cG-BPDE binding sites in the presence of hydrolytic site-specific cyclic nucleotide analogs suggested communication between hydrolytic and binding sites. The principle of reciprocity thus predicts that cGMP binding to the binding sites may affect the hydrolytic site. In the presence of cGMP, the binding fragments or native cG-BPDE exhibited an electronegative shift on high performance liquid chromatography-DEAE, consistent with a cGMP-induced change in cG-BPDE conformation.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28834399>Opioid Tripeptides Hybridized with trans-1-Cinnamylpiperazine as Proliferation Inhibitors of Pancreatic Cancer Cells in Two- and Three-Dimensional in vitro Models.</a></h2><p>According to the World Health Organization, the mortality rate among patients with pancreatic cancer will increase in the upcoming years.

Resolution of octreotide from its degradation products was achieved using a capillary zone electrophoretic method with bare fused silica capillaries, a 10mM ammonium formate buffer, pH 3.20, at 25 °C and an applied voltage of 25 kV. An ion trap low energy collision induced dissociation procedure was applied for the characterization of the chemical structures of the degradation products derived from an acidic, alkaline, neutral and thermal solution treatment of octreotide. The results so obtained indicated that linear octreotide degradation products were formed under acidic and alkaline conditions, due to the hydrolysis of a ring amide bond and a hitherto unknown desulfurization of the Cys-Cys disulfide bond, respectively. Degradation under neutral conditions occurred via cleavage of the exocyclic N-((2R,3R)-1,3-dihydroxybutan-2-yl) amide bond which also preceded the ring amide hydrolysis under acidic conditions. The developed method was further successfully applied to assess the kinetics of these octreotide degradations. Overall, this method is suitable for the rapid and precise assessment of the stability and quality control of octreotide as a synthetic peptide-based pharmaceutical product, and has led to the discovery of a new Cys-Cys disulfide degradation pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Preparations based on heat precipitation and ethanol extraction showed allotypic variation at three positions while material further purified by HPLC yielded only one sequence that also differed by a - replacement at residue 62. The mature protein contains 76 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 9006 and a pI of approximately equal to 5, in good agreement with experimentally measured values. The charged amino acids are mainly clustered at the termini and in one section in the middle; these three polar segments are separated by two segments relatively rich in nonpolar residues. Chou-Fasman analysis suggests three stretches of alpha-helix coinciding (or within) the high-charge-density sequences with a single beta-turn at the first polar-nonpolar junction.

YY62 with 9% overall yield. Seventy-four-fold purification was achieved by ammonium-sulfate precipitation, three consecutive open-column chromatographies (DEAE anion-exchange, Sepharose CL-6B gel-filtration, and the second DEAE anion-exchange columns), and two HPLCs (TSK G2000SWXL gel-filtration and phenyl 5PW hydrophobic interaction columns). Enzymes hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl acetate were separated into two peaks (peak I and II) on the hydrophobic HPLC, and only peak II was found to have TBO-hydrolyzing activity. The peak preparation showed a single band of 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE and a molecular mass of 39 kDa on gel-filtration under non-denatured conditions, indicating the monomeric nature of the TBO-hydrolyzing lipase. The lipase showed maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 28 degrees C. The N-terminal 15 amino acid residues were determined as Met-Asp--Tyr-Asp-Ala-Asn-Glu--Arg-His-Pro-Glu-Gln-Arg, which showed no homology to known proteins, suggesting that the purified enzyme may belong to a novel class of hydrolase.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26463125>Amino Acid Carbamates As Prodrugs Of Resveratrol.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a plant polyphenol, has important drug-like properties, but its pharmacological exploitation in vivo is hindered by its rapid transformation via phase II conjugative . One approach to bypass this problem relies on prodrugs. We report here the synthesis, characterization, stability and in vivo pharmacokinetic behaviour of prodrugs of resveratrol in which the OH groups are engaged in an N-monosubstituted carbamate ester (-OC(O)NHR) linkage with a natural amino acid (Leu, Ile, , ) to prevent conjugation and modulate the physicochemical properties of the molecule. We also report a convenient, high-yield protocol to obtain derivatives of this type. The new carbamate ester derivatives are stable at pH 1, while they undergo slow hydrolysis at physiological pH and hydrolyse with kinetics suitable for use in prodrugs in whole blood. After administration to rats by oral gavage the isoleucine-containing prodrug was significantly absorbed, and was present in the bloodstream as non-metabolized unaltered or partially deprotected species, demonstrating effective shielding from first-pass . We conclude that prodrugs based on the N-monosubstituted carbamate ester bond have the appropriate stability profile for the systemic delivery of phenolic compounds.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12122501>Pharmacological characterisation of the somatostatin analogue TT-232: effects on neurogenic and non-neurogenic  and neuropathic hyperalgesia.</a></h2><p>The putative anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity of the heptapeptide somatostatin analogue TT-232 ( D--Cys-Tyr- D--Lys-Cys--NH(2)) was investigated in the rat and mouse, as well as its effect on neuropathic hyperalgesia, gastric ulceration and the release of sensory neuropeptides. In the rat, carrageenin-induced paw oedema was inhibited dose dependently by TT-232 (3x2.5-20 microg/kg i.v.). Evans blue accumulation induced by intraarticular bradykinin injection (0.5 nmol in 0.1 ml) was slightly, but significantly inhibited by a single TT-232 dose (5-20 microg/kg). Cutaneous neutrophil accumulation over a 3-h period after intradermal (i.d.) injection of carrageenin (1 mg/site) or interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta, 3 pmol/site) was inhibited significantly by TT-232 (3x80 microg/kg i.v.), while diclofenac (3x10 mg/kg i.v.) elicited significant inhibition only in the IL-1beta test. In the mouse, TT-232 potently decreased oedema formation induced by 2.5% capsaicin applied topically to the ear. Mechano-nociception in the rat hind-paw during neuropathic pain induced by partial sciatic nerve injury (model of Seltzer) was measured using the Randall-Selitto test. TT-232 (5-20 microg/kg i.p. on the 7th day after the operation) dose-dependently inhibited the mechano-nociceptive hyperalgesia. In vitro release of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and somatostatin from the isolated rat trachea in response to electrical field stimulation (40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s) of its nervous elements was inhibited significantly by 500 nM TT-232. The role of G protein-coupled receptors in the effect of TT-232 was indicated by the prevention of its inhibitory action on the release of sensory neuropeptides by incubation the tissue for 1 or 6 h with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml). The release of sensory neuropeptides to in response to electrical nerve stimulation was not inhibited by a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (50 microM). TT-232 (up to 5 mg/kg i.p.) did not induce mucosal lesions in either the stomach or the duodenum.

Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that they can also undergo episodes of positive selection in response to shifts in physiological or environmental demands. Vampire bats experienced such a shift, as they are the only mammals feeding exclusively on blood and possessing anatomical adaptations to deal with the associated physiological requirements (e.g., ingestion of high amounts of liquid water and iron). We sequenced eight new chiropteran mitogenomes including two species of vampire bats, five representatives of other lineages of phyllostomids and one close outgroup. Conducting detailed comparative mitogenomic analyses, we found evidence for accelerated evolutionary rates at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in vampires. Moreover, the mitogenomes of vampire bats are characterized by an increased cytosine (C) content mirrored by a decrease in thymine (T) compared with other chiropterans. Proteins encoded by the vampire bat mitogenomes also exhibit a significant increase in threonine () and slight reductions in frequency of the hydrophobic residues isoleucine (Ile), valine (Val), methionine (Met), and phenylalanine (). We show that these peculiar substitution patterns can be explained by the co-occurrence of both neutral (mutational bias) and adaptive (positive selection) processes. We propose that vampire bat mitogenomes may have been impacted by selection on mitochondrial proteins to accommodate the  and nutritional qualities of blood meals.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h2><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser--Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins.

The molecular  of the purified enzyme was calculated to be approx. 185,000 and 200,000 on Superdex 200 column chromatography and non-denatured PAGE, respectively, and to be 58,000 and 61,000 on SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME), respectively. These findings suggested that the enzyme is composed of three identical subunits. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrates Lys-Ala-MCA and Gly-Pro-MCA at acidic pH. The Km and V(max) values of DPP II at optimal pH (pH 6.0) were 1330 microM and 2.9 mumol/mg per min for Gly-Pro-MCA, and 360 microM and 1.43 mumol/mg per min for Lys-Ala-MCA, respectively.

Each amino acid was added to a starter ration to bring it to a level 2.84x above the National Research Council (1984) requirement. Excesses of all amino acids except His and Leu caused significant reductions in  gain. Of the amino acid excesses that reduced growth, only Trp and Val did not also reduce feed intake. Gain:feed decreased significantly only in chicks consuming excess Arg, Lys, , and Trp. Chicks fed excesses of Ile and Val had plasma T3 levels that were statistically higher than control levels; none of the other amino acid excesses significantly altered blood concentrations of this hormone. Compared to the control, plasma T4 levels were not significantly altered by the amino acid excesses, but there was a significant difference between Trp and Val, the latter being lower. This study shows that high dietary levels of essential amino acids cause depressions in  gain and feed intake, and, with Ile and Val, these depressions are accompanied by elevations in plasma T3 levels.

A helix N-capping motif within this region has been postulated to directly contribute to agonist activity while also stabilizing formation of a helix extending toward the peptide carboxyl terminus and docking within the receptor amino terminus. We used cysteine trapping to systematically explore spatial approximations between cysteines replacing each residue in this motif of secretin (sec), (6), (7), and Leu(10), and cysteines incorporated into the extracellular face of the receptor. Each peptide was a full agonist for cAMP, but had a lower binding affinity than natural hormone. These bound to COS cells expressing 61 receptor constructs incorporating cysteines in every position along each extracellular loop (ECL) and adjacent parts of transmembrane (TM) segments. Patterns of covalent labeling were distinct for each probe, with Cys(6)-sec labeling multiple residues in the carboxyl-terminal half of ECL2 and throughout ECL3, Cys(7)-sec predominantly labeling only single residues in the carboxyl-terminal end of ECL2 and the amino-terminal end of ECL3, and Cys(10)-sec not efficiently labeling any of these residues. These spatial constraints were used to refine our model of secretin bound to its receptor, now bringing ECL3 above the amino terminus of the ligand and revealing possible charge-charge interactions between this part of secretin and receptor residues in TM5, TM6, ECL2, and ECL3, which can orient and stabilize the peptide-receptor complex.

The small domain of F448A TPL, where -448 is located, is more disordered in chain A than in wild-type TPL. The complexes of F448A TPL with l-alanine and l-phenylalanine are in an open conformation in both chains, while the complex with l-methionine is a 52:48 open:closed equilibrium mixture in chain A. Wild-type TPL with l-alanine is closed in chain A and open in chain B, and the complex with l-phenylalanine is a 56:44 open:closed mixture in chain A. Thus, the -448 to alanine mutation affects the conformational equilibrium of open and closed active sites. The structure of the 3-F-l-tyrosine quinonoid complex of F448A TPL is unstrained and in an open conformation, with a hydrogen bond from the phenolic OH to -124.

The somatostatins did not cause contraction of gastric smooth muscle cells, nor did they inhibit carbachol-stimulated contraction. However, they reversed vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced inhibition (relaxation) of carbachol-stimulated contraction. Somatostatin-28 had a half-maximal effect (EC50) at 1.6 +/- 0.8 nM, cyclo SS-8 at 0.6 +/- 0.3 nM, but somatostatin-14 had no effect even when used in concentrations as high as 1 microM. Incubation of muscle cells with peptidase inhibitors phosphoramidon (1 microM) plus amastatin (10 microM) had no effect on the EC50 of somatostatin-28 or cyclo SS-8 but increased the potency of somatostatin-14 greater than 1,000-fold. When peptides were incubated with muscle cells and the products applied to high-performance liquid chromatography, cyclo SS-8 was not degraded, but somatostatin-14 was rapidly degraded when present alone, and the addition of peptidase inhibitors partially inhibited the degradation. Cyclo SS-8 had its maximal effect at 0.5-1 min and inhibited relaxation induced by VIP, isoproterenol, glucagon, or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP). Cyclo SS-8 partially inhibited the increase in VIP-stimulated cAMP. Preincubation with pertussis toxin blocked the inhibitory action of cyclo SS-8 on VIP or DBcAMP-induced relaxation.

Regulation of protein synthesis via AA occurs at least in part by alterations in the phosphorylation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway proteins. Although the ideal profile of Lys:Met to promote milk protein synthesis during established lactation in dairy cows has been proposed to be 3:1, aside from being the most-limiting AA for milk protein synthesis, the role of Met in other key biologic  such as methylation is not well characterized in the bovine. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of increasing supplemental Met, based on the ideal 3:1 ratio of Lys to Met, on intracellular  related to protein synthesis and mTOR pathway phosphorylation status. MAC-T cells, an immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell line, were incubated (n = 5 replicates/treatment) for 12 h with 3 incremental doses of Met while holding Lys concentration constant to achieve the following: Lys:Met 2.9:1 (ideal AA ratio; IPAA), Lys:Met 2.5:1 (LM2.5), and Lys:Met 2.0:1 (LM2.0). The ratios of : (1.05:1), Lys: (1.8:1), Lys:His (2.38:1), and Lys:Val (1.23:1) were the same across the 3 treatments. Applying gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics revealed distinct clusters of differentially concentrated metabolites in response to Lys:Met. Lower , branched-chain AA, and putrescine concentrations were observed with LM2.5 compared with IPAA. Apart from greater intracellular Met concentrations, further elevations in Met level (LM2.0) led to greater intracellular concentrations of nonessential AA (Pro, Glu, Gln, and Gly) compared with IPAA and greater essential AA (EAA; Met, Ile, and Leu) and nonessential AA (Pro, Gly, Ala, Gln, and Glu) compared with LM2.5. However, compared with IPAA, mRNA expression of β-casein and AA transporters (SLC7A5, SLC36A1, SLC38A2, SLC38A9, and SLC43A1) and mTOR phosphorylation were lower in response to LM2.5 and LM2.0. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence that increasing Met while Lys and the ratios of , , His, and Val relative to Lys were held constant could increase the concentration and utilization of intracellular EAA, in particular branched-chain AA, potentially through improving the activity of AA transporters partly controlled by mTOR signaling. Because EAA likely are metabolized by other tissues upon absorption, a question for future in vivo studies is whether formulating diets for optimal ratios of EAA in the metabolizable protein is sufficient to provide the desired levels of these AA to the mammary cells.The Authors.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less Lys and  than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free Lys--Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, Lys, , , Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, , and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, , and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and Tyr were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

This ANF preparation also contained potent kinase activities which phosphorylated the Mr greater than 400,000 (high molecular ) and Mr 220,000 squid neurofilament protein subunits. High salt (1 M) extraction of this ANF preparation solubilized most of the neurofilament proteins and kinase activities and gel filtration on an AcA 44 column separated these two components. The neurofilaments eluted in the void volume of the column while the kinase activities eluted in the 17-44-kDa range of the column. Two major kinase activities were measured in this peak of activity. One of these strongly phosphorylated the phosphate acceptor peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) and was completely inhibited by the selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent kinase --Tyr-Ala-Asp--Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg--Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile- NH2 (Wiptide). Since addition of cAMP did not stimulate activity, this suggested that this kinase was a free catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase associated with the neurofilaments. The second kinase activity most effectively phosphorylated alpha-casein, and this activity was not affected by Wiptide. The alpha-casein phosphorylating activity (ANF kinase) was the principal activity responsible for neurofilament protein phosphorylation, and was not inhibited by various inhibitors against second messenger regulated kinases, suggesting it was related to the casein kinase family. Four lines of evidence indicate ANF kinase was similar to casein kinase I. These were: 1) the apparent molecular  determined by gel filtration and the chromatographic elution profile on phosphocellulose column corresponded to casein kinase I; 2) heparin, an inhibitor of casein kinase II at 2-5 micrograms/ml, stimulated both ANF kinase and purified casein kinase I at these concentrations, while CKI-7, a relatively selective inhibitor of casein kinase I, inhibited ANF kinase in a comparable dose-response fashion; 3) purified casein kinase I strongly phosphorylated both ANF protein subunits (like ANF kinase) whereas casein kinase II was relatively ineffective; and 4) tryptic peptide maps of the HMW and Mr 220,000 neurofilament proteins after phosphorylation by ANF kinase or purified casein kinase I showed similar 32P-peptide patterns.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15537772>Effect of feed intake on endogenous losses and amino acid and  digestibility by growing pigs.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of feed intake (FI) on endogenous losses and the digestibility of CP and AA by growing pigs. Six growing barrows (initial BW = 70.3 kg) had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum and were used in a 6 x 6 Latin square design. A soybean meal cornstarch-based diet and a N-free diet were formulated. Chromic oxide (0.25%; as-fed basis) was included in both diets as an inert marker. Each diet was provided at three different levels of FI. Feed intake level 1 was equal to the estimated  requirement for maintenance of the pigs, whereas levels 2 and 3 were two or three times this amount, respectively. Each experimental period lasted 7 d. The initial 4 d of each period comprised an adaptation period to the experimental diets. On d 5, fecal samples were collected, while ileal digesta were collected during two 10-h periods on d 6 and 7. Between each experimental period, a corn-soybean meal-based diet (16% CP) was fed to all pigs for 7 d. The basal ileal endogenous losses (IAA(end)) of CP and AA were measured for each level of FI from pigs fed the N-free diet. Likewise, the apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibility coefficients for CP and AA in soybean meal were calculated for each level of FI. The total-tract digestibility coefficient of  in the soybean meal-based diet also was calculated. The AID for CP and all indispensable AA except Lys, Met, and  increased (P < or =0.055) as FI increased. The IAA(end) of CP and all AA except Pro decreased linearly (P < 0.05) as FI increased when expressed as g/kg of DMI; however, the total daily IAA(end) increased as FI increased (linear, P < or =0.056) for all AA, except for , , Trp, Val, Cys, Gly, and Ser. The AA composition (% of CP) of endogenous protein was not affected by the level of FI, except for Arg, , Pro, and Ser. As FI increased, the SID decreased linearly (P < 0.04) for CP and all AA, except Arg, Trp, Asp, Pro, and Tyr. The total-tract digestibility of  was not influenced by the FI level. These results demonstrate that the FI level significantly influenced AID, SID, and IAA(end) for CP and AA. Therefore, pigs used to measure AA digestibility coefficients and IAA(end) should be fed at a level that is close to what is used under commercial conditions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28645621>Two delta opioid receptor subtypes are functional in single ventral tegmental area neurons, and can interact with the mu opioid receptor.</a></h2><p>The mu and delta opioid receptors (MOR and DOR) are highly homologous members of the opioid family of GPCRs. There is evidence that MOR and DOR interact, however the extent to which these interactions occur in vivo and affect synaptic function is unknown. There are two stable DOR subtypes: DPDPE sensitive (DOR1) and deltorphin II sensitive (DOR2); both agonists are blocked by DOR selective antagonists. Robust motivational effects are produced by local actions of both MOR and DOR ligands in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here we demonstrate that a majority of both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic VTA neurons express combinations of functional DOR1, DOR2, and/or MOR, and that within a single VTA neuron, DOR1, DOR2, and MOR agonists can differentially couple to downstream signaling . As reported for the MOR agonist DAMGO, DPDPE and deltorphin II produced either a predominant K dependent hyperpolarization or a Ca2.1 mediated depolarization in different neurons. In some neurons DPDPE and deltorphin II produced opposite responses. Excitation, inhibition, or no effect by DAMGO did not predict the response to DPDPE or deltorphin II, arguing against a MOR-DOR interaction generating DOR subtypes. However, in a subset of VTA neurons the DOR antagonist TIPP-Ψ augmented DAMGO responses; we also observed DPDPE or deltorphin II responses augmented by the MOR selective antagonist CTAP. These findings directly support the existence of two independent, stable forms of the DOR, and show that MOR and DOR can interact in some neurons to alter downstream signaling.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein had 96% identity to the deduced NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the pepR gene, which was previously designated pepPN, from L. helveticus CNRZ32. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed Pro-Met, -Leu, and Ser- as well as dipeptides containing neutral, nonpolar amino acid residues at the amino terminus. Purified PepR was determined to have a molecular mass of 125 kDa with subunits of 33 kDa. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was determined to be 4.5. The optimal reaction conditions, as determined with Pro-Leu as substrate, were pH 6.0 to 6.5 and 45 to 50 degrees C. The purified PepR had a Km of 4.9 to 5.2 mM and a Vmax of 260 to 270 mumol of protein per min/mg at pH 6.5 and 37 degrees C. The activity of purified PepR was inhibited by Zn2+ but not by other cations or cysteine, serine, aspartic, or metal-containing protease inhibitors or reducing agents. Results obtained by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that PepR is a serine-dependent protease. Gene replacement was employed to construct a PepR-deficient derivative of CNRZ32. This mutant did not differ from the wild-type strain in its ability to acidify milk. However, the PepR-deficient construct was determined to have reduced dipeptidase activity compared to the wild-type strain with all dipeptide substrates examined.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711271>Identification of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides from mare whey protein hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity is a promising strategy for treatment of type 2 . In the current study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identiﬁed from mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained by papain. The results showed that all the mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained at various hydrolysis durations possessed more potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared with intact whey protein. The 4-h hydrolysates showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.18 mg/mL. The 2 novel peptides from 4-h hydrolysate fractions separated by successive chromatographic steps were characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The novel peptides Asn-Leu-Glu-Ile-Ile-Leu-Arg and -Gln-Met-Val-Asp-Glu-Glu-Ile-Met-Glu-Lys--Arg, which corresponded to β-lactoglobulin 1 f(71-77) and β-lactoglobulin 1 f(143-155), demonstrated DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 86.34 and 69.84 μM, respectively. The DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the 2 peptides was retained or even improved after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro.

Free energies for the most destabilizing residues (Cys, Gly, Asn, Arg, and Pro) could not be fitted.

It is known that the parasite's production of amino acids from hemoglobin far exceeds its metabolic needs. Here, we show that P. falciparum effluxes large quantities of certain non-polar (Ala, Leu, Val, Pro, , Gly) and polar (Ser, , His) amino acids to the external medium. That these amino acids originate from hemoglobin catabolism is indicated by the strong correlation between individual amino acid efflux rates and their abundances in hemoglobin, and the ability of the food vacuole falcipain inhibitor E-64d to greatly suppress efflux rates. We then developed a rapid, sensitive and precise method for quantifying flux through the hemoglobin endocytic-catabolic pathway that is based on leucine efflux. Optimization of the method involved the generation of a novel amino acid-restricted RPMI formulation as well as the validation of D-norvaline as an internal standard. The utility of this method was demonstrated by characterizing the effects of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and dihydroartemisinin on the kinetics of Leu efflux. Both compounds rapidly inhibited Leu efflux, which is consistent with a role for phosphtidylinositol-3-phosphate production in the delivery of hemoglobin to the food vacuole; however, wortmannin inhibition was transient, which was likely due to the instability of this compound in culture medium. The simplicity, convenience and non-invasive nature of the Leu efflux assay described here makes it ideal for characterizing the in vivo kinetics of hemoglobin endocytosis and catabolism, for inhibitor target validation studies, and for medium-throughput screens to identify novel inhibitors of cytostomal endocytosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They have been identified as candidate targets for next-generation insecticides, yet these targets have been relatively poorly exploited for insect control. In this study, we present a pipeline of novel  allatotropin (Manse-AT) antagonist discovery with homology modeling, docking, molecular dynamics simulation and structure-activity relationship. A series of truncated and alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT were assayed for the stimulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis. The minimum sequence required to retain potent biological activity is the -terminal amidated octapeptide Manse-AT (6-13). We identified three residues essential for bioactivity (⁴, Arg6 and ⁸) by assaying alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT (6-13). Alanine replacement of other residues resulted in reduced potency but bioactivity was retained. The 3D structure of the receptor (Manse-ATR) was built and the binding pocket was identified. The binding affinities of all the analogs were estimated by calculating the free energy of binding. The calculated binding affinities corresponded to the biological activities of the analogs, which supporting our localization of the binding pocket. Then, based on the docking and molecular dynamics studies of Manse-AT (10-13), we described it can act as a potent Manse-AT antagonist. The antagonistic effect on JH biosynthesis of Manse-AT (10-13) validated our hypothesis. The IC value of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) is 0.9 nM. The structure-activity relationship of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) was also studied for the further purpose of investigating theoretically the structure factors influencing activity. These data will be useful for the design of new Manse-AT agonist and antagonist as potential pest control agents.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23139417>The phosphocholine-binding pocket on C-reactive protein is necessary for initial protection of mice against pneumococcal infection.</a></h2><p>Human C-reactive protein (CRP) protects mice from lethal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection when injected into mice within the range of 6 h before to 2 h after the administration of pneumococci. Because CRP binds to phosphocholine-containing substances and subsequently activates the complement system, it has been proposed that the antipneumococcal function of CRP requires the binding of CRP to phosphocholine moieties present in pneumococcal cell wall C-polysaccharide. To test this proposal experimentally, in this study, we utilized a new CRP mutant incapable of binding to phosphocholine. Based on the structure of CRP-phosphocholine complexes, which showed that (66), (76), and Glu(81) formed the phosphocholine-binding pocket, we constructed a CRP mutant F66A/T76Y/E81A in which the pocket was blocked by substituting Tyr for (76). When compared with wild-type CRP, mutant CRP bound more avidly to phosphoethanolamine and could be purified by affinity chromatography using phosphoethanolamine-conjugated Sepharose. Mutant CRP did not bind to phosphocholine, C-polysaccharide, or pneumococci. Mutant CRP was free in the mouse serum, and its rate of clearance in vivo was not faster than that of wild-type CRP. When either 25 μg or 150 μg of CRP was administered into mice, unlike wild-type CRP, mutant CRP did not protect mice from lethal pneumococcal infection. Mice injected with mutant CRP had higher mortality rates than mice that received wild-type CRP. Decreased survival was due to the increased bacteremia in mice treated with mutant CRP. We conclude that the phosphocholine-binding pocket on CRP is necessary for CRP-mediated initial protection of mice against lethal pneumococcal infection.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7511371>Isolation and characterisation of porin from the outer membrane of Synechococcus PCC 6301.</a></h2><p>Pore-forming protein (porin) was isolated from N,N-dimethyl-dodecylaminoxid (LDAO)-extracted outer membranes of Synechococcus PCC 6301 and purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel column.

The kinetic parameters and activation enthalpy change (Delta H (double dagger)) showed good correlation with the van der Waals volume of residue 126.

There are no ligand binding studies, and it is unknown which of the five subtypes of SS receptors mediates the action. Dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells from guinea pig bound both 125I-labeled SS-14 and 125I-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys-Nal-NH2 (where Nal indicates N-naphthylalanine) (cyclo-SS-8), a synthetic peptidase-resistant octapeptide SS analogue. SS-28 and SS-14, cyclo-SS-8, and SS analogue D--Cys--D-Trp-Lys--Cys--ol [SMS-(201-995) (octreotide)] inhibited 125I-cyclo-SS-8 binding with relative potencies of SS-28 = cyclo-SS-8 = SMS-(201-995) (octreotide), and the binding was not affected by the addition of protease inhibitors. SS-14 caused inhibition only in the presence of protease inhibitors. Ligand analysis demonstrated a two-binding-site model. Analysis of the relationship between biological function and binding suggested the high-affinity sites mediated the relaxant action of SS. 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp-(NH)p] inhibited binding by reducing the affinity of the high-affinity site. Six SS-8 analogues that distinguish SS subtypes showed that 125I-SS-14 bound to somatostatin receptor subtype 3 (SSTR3).

The collected fluorescent beads, which contained the hydrolysed peptides generated by hMIP, were sequenced by Edman degradation. The results showed that this peptidase presents a remarkable preference for polar uncharged residues at P1 and P1' substrate positions: Ser = Gln >  at P1 and Ser >  at P1'. Non-polar residues were frequent at the substrate P3, P2, P2' and P3' positions. Analysis of the predicted MIP processing sites in imported mitochondrial matrix proteins shows these cleavages indeed occur between polar uncharged residues. Previous analysis of these processing sites indicated the importance of positions far from the MIP cleavage site, namely the presence of a hydrophobic residue ( or Leu) at P8 and a polar uncharged residue (Ser or ) at P5. To evaluate this, additional kinetic analyses were carried out, using fluorogenic substrates synthesized based on the processing sites attributed to MIP. The results described here underscore the importance of the P1 and P1' substrate positions for the hydrolytic activity of hMIP.

Sites 44 and 131 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, Asn, Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Leu and Lys the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, His, Tyr, Trp and  prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free  values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from "host-guest" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667555>Synthesis, Cytotoxicity and Antioxidant Activity of New Analogs of RC-121 Synthetic Derivatives of Somatostatin.</a></h2><p>Based on the structure of RC-121 (D--c (Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys)--NH2, - synthetic derivatives of somatostatin), some analogs were synthesized and tested for in vitro cytotoxic and antioxidant activity.The new analogs were modifyed at position 5 with Dap (diaminopropanoic acid), Dab (diaminobutanoic acid) and Orn and at position 6 with the unnatural amino acids Tle (t-leucine).The in vitro cytotoxic effects of the substances were investigated against a panel of human tumor cell lines HT-29 (Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Line), MDA-MB-23 (Human Breast Cancer Cell Line), Hep G-2 (Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Line) and HeLa (cervical cancer cell line). The antioxidant capacities were tested by ORAC ( Radical Antioxidant Capacity) and HORAC (Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity) methods.All substances expressed significantly higher antioxidant capacity by comparison with galic acid and Trolox.

In neutral conditions, the weak NH temperature coefficients of the C-terminal residue (Pen5 or Thr6), associated with interproton NH-NH and alpha-NH NOE's (ROESY experiments), indicated large analogies between the backbone folding tendency of both the linear and cyclic peptides. Various gamma and/or beta turns may account for these experimental data. A similar orientation of the N-terminal tyrosine related to the folded backbones is observed for the two agonists, with a probable gamma turn around the amino acid in position 2. Finally, a short distance, about 10 A, between Tyr and  side chains and identical structural roles for threonyl and penicillamino residues are proposed for both peptides. These results suggest the occurrence of similar conformers in solution for the constrained peptide DPLPE and the flexible hexapeptide DTLET. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that the enhanced delta selectivity of DPLPE is related to a very large conformational expense of  needed to interact with the mu opioid receptor, a feature not encountered in the case of DTLET. These findings might allow peptides to be designed retaining a high affinity for delta opioid receptors associated with a very low cross-reactivity with mu binding sites.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18487312>Molecular dynamics simulation of Kv channel voltage sensor helix in a lipid membrane with applied electric field.</a></h2><p>In this article, we present the results of the molecular dynamics simulations of amphiphilic helix peptides of 13 amino-acid residues, placed at the lipid-water interface of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers. The peptides are identical with, or are derivatives of, the N-terminal segment of the S4 helix of voltage-dependent K channel KvAP, containing four voltage-sensing arginine residues (R1-R4). Upon changing the direction of the externally applied electric field, the tilt angle of the wild-type peptide changes relative to the lipid-water interface, with the N-terminus heading up with an outward electric field. These movements were not observed using an octane membrane in place of the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine membrane, and were markedly suppressed by 1), substituting  located one residue before the first arginine (R1) with a hydrophilic residue (Ser, ); or 2), changing the periodicity rule of Rs from at-every-third to at-every-fourth position; or 3), replacing R1 with a lysine residue (K). These and other findings suggest that the voltage-dependent movement requires deep positioning of Rs when the resting (inward) electric field is present. Later, we performed simulations of the voltage sensor domain (S1-S4) of Kv1.2 channel. In simulations with a strong electric field (0.1 V/nm or above) and positional restraints on the S1 and S2 helices, S4 movement was observed consisting of displacement along the S4 helix axis and a screwlike axial rotation. Gating-charge-carrying Rs were observed to make serial interactions with E183 in S1 and E226 in S2, in the outer water crevice. A 30-ns-backward simulation started from the open-state model gave rise to a structure similar to the recent resting-state model, with S4 moving vertically approximately 6.7 A. The  landscape around the movement of S4 appears very ragged due to salt bridges formed between gating-charge-carrying residues and negatively charged residues of S1, S2, and S3 helices. Overall, features of S3 and S4 movements are consistent with the recent helical-screw model. Both forward and backward simulations show the presence of at least two stable intermediate structures in which R2 and R3 form salt bridges with E183 or E226, respectively. These structures are the candidates for the states postulated in previous gating kinetic models, such as the Zagotta-Hoshi-Aldrich model, to account for more than one transition step per subunit for activation.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2246257>Mitochondrial phosphate transport. N-ethylmaleimide insensitivity correlates with absence of beef heart-like Cys42 from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphate transport protein.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial phosphate transport protein (PTP) has been purified in a reconstitutively active form from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida parapsilosis. ADP/ATP carriers that copurify have been identified. The PTP from S. cerevisiae migrates as a single band (35 kDa) in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with the same mobility as the N-ethylmaleimide-alkylated beef heart PTP. It does not cross-react with anti-sera against beef heart PTP. The CNBr peptide maps of the yeast and beef proteins are very different. The rate of unidirectional phosphate uptake into reconstituted proteoliposomes is stimulated about 2.5-fold to a Vmax of 170 mumol of phosphate min-1 (mg PTP)-1 (22 degrees C) by increasing the pHi of the proteoliposomes from 6.8 (same as ) to 8.0. The Km for Pi of this reconstituted activity is 2.2 mM. The transport is sensitive to mersalyl (50% inhibition at 60 microM) and insensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. We have purified peptides matching the highly conserved motif Pro-X-(Asp/glu)-X-X-(Lys/Arg)-X-(Arg/lys) (X is an unspecified amino acid) of the triplicate gene structure sequence of the beef heart PTP. The N-ethylmaleimide-reactive Cys42 of the beef heart protein, located between the two basic amino acids of this motif (Lys41-Cys42-Arg43), is replaced with a  in the yeast protein. This substitution most likely is responsible for the lack of N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity of the yeast protein and mersalyl thus reacts with another cysteine to inhibit the transport. Finally it is concluded that Cys42 has no essential role in the catalysis of inorganic phosphate transport by the mitochondrial phosphate transport protein.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15356277>Integrating the universal metabolism into a phylogenetic analysis.</a></h2><p>The darwinian concept of "descent with modification" applies to metabolic pathways: pathways sharing similarities must have inherited them from an exclusive, hypothetical ancestral pathway. Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, Tyr, and , and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, Val, Ile, Cys, Gly, Ser, and . The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order  and gluconeogenesis with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively).

It can distinguish the α3β2 nAChR subtype from the α6β2* (* indicates the other subunit) and α3β4 nAChR subtypes. In this study, we performed mutational studies to assess the influence of residues of the β2 subunit versus those of the β4 subunit on the binding of α-CTx LvIA. Although two β2 mutations, α3β2[F119Q] and α3β2[T59K], strongly enhanced the affinity of LvIA, the β2 mutation α3β2[V111I] substantially reduced the binding of LvIA. Increased activity of LvIA was also observed when the β2-T59L mutant was combined with the α3 subunit. There were no significant difference in inhibition of α3β2[T59I], α3β2[Q34A], and α3β2[K79A] nAChRs when compared with wild-type α3β2 nAChR. α-CTx LvIA displayed slower off-rate kinetics at α3β2[F119Q] and α3β2[T59K] than at the wild-type receptor, with the latter mutant having the most pronounced effect. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the β2 subunit contributes to α-CTx LvIA binding and selectivity. The results demonstrate that Val(111) is critical and facilitates LvIA binding; this position has not previously been identified as important to binding of other 4/7 framework α-conotoxins. (59) and (119) of the β2 subunit appear to interfere with LvIA binding, and their replacement by the corresponding residues of the β4 subunit leads to increased affinity.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1691914>Treatment of adjuvant arthritis in rats: vaccination potential of a synthetic nonapeptide from the 65 kDa heat shock protein of mycobacteria.</a></h2><p>Adjuvant arthritis induced by mycobacteria in rats is a widely used model of chronic arthritis.

Two of the rough (Rg) variants, Rg-3 and Rg-4, were devoid of glycopeptidolipids or any more elemental structures and thus were similar to those described previously. Two others, Rg-0 and Rg-1, each contained two novel lipopeptides, devoid of any of the carbohydrate substituents that confer serotypic activity on the glycopeptidolipids. The application of gas chromatography, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and 1H NMR to lipopeptide I established the structure C32:2-beta-OH-fatty acyl-D--D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninol. Lipopeptide II represented a minor variation of this structure: C32:1-beta-OH-fatty acyl-D--D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninol. These newly discovered lipopeptides are identical to the fatty acyl-tripeptide-amino alcohol "core" component of the glycopeptidolipids of the M. avium complex, and thus the Rg-0 and Rg-1 variants represent a form of "deep rough" mutation in M. avium.

Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of  and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in D-AAs in biological fluids. As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L-Val N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-, D-Glu, D-Orn and D-Lys. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, Val, , Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, , Tyr, Orn and Lys. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D- and higher values were found in the GDM group.

At low concentrations of enzyme, the values of the K(m) and k(cat) calculated from steady-state data were 2.1 microM and 7.4 s(-1), respectively. At high concentrations of enzyme, the time-courses of fluorescence enhancement associated with catalysis were very dependent on the excitation wavelength used to monitor the reaction. Because the absorbance spectrum of the substrate overlapped the fluorescence emission spectrum of the enzyme, these abnormalities were attributed to fluorescence  transfer between the enzyme and the substrate in an enzyme-substrate intermediate. The kinetic data collected with lambda(ex) = 280 nm and lambda(em) > 435 nm were analyzed according to the following mechanism in which EX was the species with enhanced fluorescence relative to substrate or products: [formula see text].

These values yielded solvent isotope effects of 2 on k(cat) and 0.9 on k(cat)/K(m). From analysis of the complete time-course of the fluorescence change (lambda(ex) = 280 nm and lambda(em) > 435 nm) during the course of substrate hydrolysis, the intermediate EX was determined to be 6.3-fold more fluorescent than the product, which, in turn, was 4.5-fold more fluorescent than ES or S. Rapid quench experiments with 2 N HCl as the quenching reagent confirmed that EX was a complex between enzyme and substrate. Consequently, the small burst in fluorescence observed when monitoring with lambda(ex) = 340 nm (0.3 product equiv per enzyme equivalent) was attributed to the fluorescence change upon transfer of substrate from an aqueous environment to a nonaqueous environment in the enzyme.

The present study compared the contribution of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonism and antagonism in the CeA to generation of the affective response of rats to an acute noxious stimulus. Vocalizations that occur following a brief tail shock (vocalization afterdischarges) are a validated rodent model of pain affect and were preferentially suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, by bilateral injection into the CeA of NMDA (.1, .25, .5, or 1 μg/side) or the NMDA receptor antagonist d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (AP5; 1, 2, or 4 μg/side). Vocalizations that occur during tail shock were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas spinal motor reflexes (tail flick and hind limb movements) were unaffected by injection of NMDA or AP5 into the CeA. Injection of NMDA, but not AP5, into the CeA increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and unilateral injection of the μ-opiate receptor antagonist H-d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP; .25 μg) into ventrolateral periaqueductal gray prevented the antinociception generated by injection of NMDA into the CeA. These findings demonstrate that although NMDA receptor agonism and antagonism in the CeA produce similar suppression of pain behaviors, they do so via different neurobiologic mechanisms.The amygdala contributes to production of the emotional dimension of pain. NMDA receptor agonism and antagonism within the CeA suppressed rats' emotional response to acute painful stimulation. Understanding the neurobiology underlying emotional responses to pain will provide insights into new treatments for pain and its associated affective disorders.Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

Replacement of the D- residue with conformationally biased beta-methyl derivatives of phenylalanine or tryptophan (2R,3R; 2R,3S; 2S,3R; 2S,3S) yielded peptides that displayed widely varying types of biological activities. In an effort to correlate the observed biological activities of these analogues with their structures, two-dimensional (1)H NMR and molecular modeling was performed. Unlike the parent (1), which is essentially a pure mu antagonist with weak delta agonist activities in the MVD bioassay, the diastereomeric beta-MePhe(1)-containing peptides exhibited simultaneous delta agonism and mu antagonism by the (2R,3R)-containing isomer 2; mu antagonism by the (2R,3S)-containing isomer 3; weak mu agonism by the (2S,3R)-containing isomer 4; and delta agonism by the (2S,3S)-containing isomer 5. Incorporation of beta-MeTrp isomers into position 1 led to peptides that were mu antagonists (2R,3R), 8; (2R,3S), 9, or essentially inactive (<10%) in the MVD and GPI assays (2S,3R), 10; (2S,3S), 11. Interestingly, in vivo antinociceptive activity was predicted by neither MVD nor GPI bioactivity. When D-Trp was incorporated in position 1, the result (7) is a partial, yet relatively potent mu agonist which also displayed weak delta agonist activity. Molecular modeling based on 2D NMR revealed that low  conformers of peptides with similar biological activities had similar aromatic pharmacophore orientations and interaromatic distances. Peptides that exhibit mu antagonism have interaromatic distances of 7.0-7.9 A and have their amino terminal aromatic moiety pointing in a direction opposite to the direction that the amino terminus points. Peptides with delta opioid activity displayed an interaromatic distance of <7 A and had their amino terminal aromatic moiety pointing in the same direction as the amino terminus.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24117191>Complete mitochondrial genome of the desert toad-headed agama, Phrynocephalus przewalskii (Reptilia, Squamata, Agamidae), a novel gene organization in vertebrate mtDNA.</a></h2><p>The mitogenome of the desert toad-headed agama, Phrynocephalus przewalskii, was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), long-and-accurate PCR and directly sequenced by primer walking.

TT-232 is a stable, peripherally acting heptapeptide (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys--NH2) somatostatin analogue with highest binding affinity for somatostatin sst4 receptors. It has been shown to inhibit acute and chronic inflammatory responses and sensory neuropeptide release from capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors. In the present study the antinociceptive effects of TT-232 were analysed using both acute and chronic models of nociception. Formalin-induced pain behaviour, noxious heat threshold and streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic mechanical allodynia were examined in rats and phenylquinone-evoked abdominal constrictions were tested in mice. TT-232 (80 microg/kg i.p.) inhibited both early (0-5 min) and late phases (25-45 min) of formalin-induced nociception as revealed by determination of the composite pain score. The minimum effective dose to elevate the noxious heat threshold and diminish the heat threshold drop (heat allodynia) evoked by resiniferatoxin (0.05 nmol intraplantarly) was 20 and 10 microg/kg i.p., respectively, as measured by an increasing-temperature hot plate. TT-232 (10-200 microg/kg s.c.) significantly inhibited phenylquinone-evoked writhing movements in mice, but within this dose range no clear dose-response correlation was found. Five weeks after streptozotocin administration (50 mg/kg i.v.) the -induced decrease in the mechanonociceptive threshold was inhibited by 10-100 microg/kg i.p. TT-232. These findings show that TT-232 potently inhibits acute chemical somatic/visceral and thermal nociception and diminishes chronic mechanical allodynia associated with diabetic neuropathy, thereby it could open new perspectives in the treatment of various pain syndromes.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503149>A peptidic hydrogel that may behave as a "Trojan Horse".</a></h2><p>A physical hydrogel prepared with the low-molecular- hydrogelator (LMWHG) CH2(C3H6CO-L--D-Oxd-OH)2 and water/ethanol mixture was applied as a potential "Trojan Horse" carrier into cells.

ATM localizes to the nucleus and at the plasma membrane, , peroxisomes, and other cytoplasmic vesicular structures. It has been shown that the C-terminal FATC domain of human ATM (hATMfatc) can interact with a range of membrane mimetics and may thereby act as a membrane-anchoring unit. Here, NMR structural and N relaxation data, NMR data using spin-labeled micelles, and MD simulations of micelle-associated hATMfatc revealed that it binds the micelle by a dynamic assembly of three helices with many residues of hATMfatc located in the headgroup region. We observed that none of the three helices penetrates the micelle deeply or makes significant tertiary contacts to the other helices. NMR-monitored interaction experiments with hATMfatc variants in which two conserved aromatic residues ( and Trp) were either individually or both replaced by alanine disclosed that the double substitution does not abrogate the interaction with micelles and bicelles at the high concentrations at which these aggregates are typically used, but impairs interactions with small unilamellar vesicles, usually used at much lower lipid concentrations and considered a better mimetic for natural membranes. We conclude that the observed dynamic structure of micelle-associated hATMfatc may enable it to interact with differently composed membranes or membrane-associated interaction partners and thereby regulate ATM's kinase activity. Moreover, the FATC domain of ATM may function as a membrane-anchoring unit for other biomolecules.© 2019 Abd Rahim et al.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781633>Anti-Proliferation Activity of a Decapeptide from  toward Human Lung Cancer H1299 Cells.</a></h2><p> peptide (PAP) is a decapeptide (Ile-Glu-Pro-Gly--Val-Gly-Met-Met-, IEPGTVGMMF) with anticancer activity that was purified from an enzymatic hydrolysate of . In the present study, the anticancer effect of PAP on H1299 cell proliferation was investigated. Our results showed that PAP promoted apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of H1299 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When the PAP concentration reached 0.92 mM, more than 95% of treated cells died after 72 h of treatment. Changes in cell morphology were further analyzed using an inverted microscope and AO/EB staining and flow cytometry was adopted for detecting apoptosis and cell cycle phase. The results showed that the early and late apoptosis rates of H1299 cells increased significantly after treatment with PAP and the total apoptosis rate was significantly higher than that of the control group. Moreover, after treatment with PAP, the number of cells in the S phase of cells was significantly reduced and the ability for the cells to proliferate was also reduced. H1299 cells were arrested in the G2/M phase and cell cycle progression was inhibited. Furthermore, the results of western blotting showed that nm23-H1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner, while the pro-apoptotic protein and anti-apoptotic protein ratios and the level of apoptosis-related caspase protein increased in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results indicated that PAP, as a natural marine bioactive substance, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of human lung cancer H1299 cells.

According to the primary structure, chemokines are divided into four families, fractalkine (CX3CL1) is the only one member of CX3C family and the only membrane-bound chemokine. Fractalkine molecule includes the extracellular N-terminal chemokine domain, mucin-like rod, the transmembrane and the intracellular domains. In membrane-bound state fractalkine has the properties of an adhesion molecule. Chemokine domain of fractalkine (CDF) is released from cell membrane by proteolysis, and this soluble form acts as a chemoattractant for leukocytes expressing fractalkine receptor CX3CR1. Fractalkine is involved in development of a number of pathological processes caused by , and therefore a search for fractalkine inhibitors is very important. For this purpose we identified several antigenic determinants--the fragments of CDF, and the following peptides were synthesized--P41-52 H-Leu-Glu--Arg-Gln-His-Arg-Leu--Cys-Ala-Asp-NH2, P53-60 H-Pro-Lys-Glu-Gln-Trp-Val-Lys-Asp-NH2 and P60-71 H-Asp-Ala-Met-Gln-His-Leu-Asp-Arg-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-NH2.

In the presence of CDF and P41-52 we observed the increased adhesion and migration of monocytes compared with spontaneous values. Peptides P53-60 and P60-71 significantly inhibited monocyte adhesion and migration stimulated by CDF. Since the chemotactic activity of chemokines was shown to be dependent on their binding to glycosaminoglycans of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, the effect ofpeptides on the interaction of CDF with heparin was analyzed by ELISA.

Eight multiparous and 4 primiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 28-d periods. Treatments consisted of total mixed diets containing no DDGS (CON), or DDGS from source 1 (DDGS-1), source 2 (DDGS-2), or source 3 (DDGS-3) at 20% of diet dry matter. The processing of DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 was intended to decrease heat damage and improve nutritional quality. The DDGS in the diets replaced a portion of the ground corn and soybean meal, allowing them to be isonitrogenous at 16% crude protein. All diets had a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 55:45. Dry matter intake (21.4 kg/d) did not differ among diets, but cows fed diets containing DDGS had greater yields of milk (34.6 vs. 31.2 kg/d), 4% -corrected milk (32.7 vs. 29.6 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (35.4 vs. 32.3) compared with cows fed the CON diet. Feed efficiency was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (1.78 vs. 1.63). Milk  yield was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with those fed CON (1.26 vs. 1.14 kg/d). Milk protein percentages (3.28, 3.13, 3.19, and 3.17% for CON, DDGS-1, DDGS-2, and DDGS-3, respectively) were greater for CON vs. DDGS and tended to be lower for DDGS-1 than for DDGS-2 and DDGS-3. Milk protein yields tended to be greater for cows fed DDGS than for those fed CON (1.09 vs. 1.02 kg/d). Concentrations of milk urea nitrogen were lower in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (9.36 vs. 10.6 mg/dL). Feeding DDGS decreased arterial plasma concentrations of Arg, Ile, Lys, and  and increased His and Leu compared with CON. Arterial plasma from cows fed DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 had greater concentrations of Ile, Trp, and Val compared with DDGS-1. In all diets, Lys, Met, and  were the first 3 limiting amino acids for protein synthesis with Lys being first limiting in DDGS-1 and DDGS-3 and Met being first limiting for CON and DDGS-2. Inclusion of DDGS did not affect the molar proportions of ruminal acetate or propionate compared with CON. Ruminal proportions of butyrate were lower in CON compared with DDGS. Total concentrations of VFA were greater in CON compared with DDGS. The concentrations of rumen ammonia were greater in CON (7.2 mg/dL) compared with DDGS (4.5 mg/dL).

We report here a unique and rapid approach toward the development of novel PTP inhibitor entities based on triazolyl pseudo-glycopeptides. By employing microwave-accelerated Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC or 'click reaction'), a series of triazole-linked serinyl, threoninyl, phenylalaninyl and tyrosinyl 1-O-gluco- or galactosides have been efficiently synthesized in high yields within only ~30 min. Successive biological assay identified these glycopeptidotriazoles as favorable PTP1B and CDC25B inhibitors with selectivity over TCPTP, LAR, SHP-1 and SHP-2. Both the structural diversity of the amino acid (Ser, ,  and Tyr) introduced and the epimeric identity (Glc or Gal) on monosaccharide scaffold were determined to impact the corresponding inhibitory activity and selectivity. In addition, the benzylated sugar scaffold was demonstrated to act as a crucial role for enhancing the binding affinity of the inhibitors with the targeted PTP. Docking simulation was eventually conducted to propose plausible binding modes of this compound series with PTP1B and CDC25B. Our approach readily realized from naturally abundant raw materials (sugar and amino acid) and via facile, regioselective and expeditious synthetic method (microwave-assisted click reaction) might provide new insights toward the 'click' fabrication of structurally diverse PTP inhibitors.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, in Swiss Webster mice, heroin has the unusual property of acting on brain delta opioid receptors whereas morphine still acts on mu receptors. The literature indicates that in diabetic mice and rats, the mu agonist potency of morphine is diminished while that to a delta receptor agonist is enhanced. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the response to heroin occurred through a delta receptor in the brain of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. One week after a cannula was surgically implanted in the lateral ventricle,  was induced by intravenous administration of 55 mg/kg of streptozotocin. Three days later the receptor selectivity of intraventricular heroin in the tail flick test was determined by coadministration of opioid antagonists. In nondiabetic rats, a rightward shift in the dose response curve for heroin was produced by naloxone. D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen-ThrNH2, a more mu receptor selective antagonist given in a single dose experiment, also inhibited heroin action. Thus, heroin acted on mu receptors. In diabetic rats, intracerebroventricular naltrindole, but not naloxone nor CTOP, inhibited the heroin response and indicated a delta agonist action for heroin. Inhibition by intrathecal yohimbine of the mu (nondiabetic) and bicuculline of the delta response (diabetic) suggested spinal alpha2-adrenergic and GABA(A) receptor mediation, respectively, for the descending systems. In conclusion, the response to heroin was changed from mu in nondiabetic rats to a delta receptor action in diabetic rats. Understanding the basis for this change in receptor selectivity of heroin could provide an important avenue for investigating determinants of opioid receptor function.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27188525>Structure-function characterization of the human mitochondrial thiamin pyrophosphate transporter (hMTPPT; SLC25A19): Important roles for Ile(33), Ser(34), Asp(37), His(137) and Lys(291).</a></h2><p>Thiamin plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism.

Among the six residues predicted by the docking model (i.e., (29), Arg(30), Ile(33), Ser(34), Asp(37) and (298)), only Ile(33), Ser(34) and Asp(37) were found to be critical for function.

We have recently demonstrated that proteolysis of HC by catalytic amounts of polymorphonuclear leukocyte proteinases (elastase or cathepsin G) generates leukocyte chemotaxins (Hoffman, M., Pratt, C. W., Brown, R. L., and Church, F. C. (1989) Blood 73, 1682-1685). One of four peptides produced when HC is degraded by neutrophil elastase has chemotactic activity for both monocytes and neutrophils with maximal migration comparable to formyl-Met-Leu-, the "gold standard" bacterially derived chemotaxin. The amino-terminal sequence of this HC peptide is Asp--His-Lys-Glu-Asn--Val-... and the peptide corresponds to Asp-39 to Ile-66 of HC. A variety of synthetic peptides derived from this sequence were evaluated for leukocyte migration activity, and a dodecapeptide from Asp-49 to Tyr-60 (Asp-Trp-Ile-Pro-Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr) was identified as the active site for leukocyte chemotactic action. The 12-mer synthetic peptide possesses significant neutrophil chemotactic action at 1 nM (60% of the maximal activity of formyl-Met-Leu-), while a peptide with the reverse sequence has essentially no chemotactic activity. Cross-desensitization experiments also show that pretreatment of neutrophils with a 19-mer peptide (Asn-48 to Ile-66) greatly reduces subsequent chemotaxis to HC-neutrophil elastase proteolysis reaction products. When injected intraperitoneally in mice, the HC-neutrophil elastase digest elicits neutrophil migration. Our results demonstrate that not only does HC function as a thrombin inhibitor, but that limited proteolysis of HC near the amino terminus yields biologically active peptide(s) which might participate in  and in wound healing and tissue repair processes.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12110379>Pharmacologically distinct binding sites in rat brain for [3H]thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and [3H][3-methyl-histidine(2)]TRH.</a></h2><p>We have used a directed peptide library, in which the histidyl residue of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was systematically replaced by a series of 24 natural and unnatural amino acids, to characterise TRH binding sites in rat brain cortex. This was achieved by measuring the ability of library peptides to compete with [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH or [3H]TRH binding to rat cortical homogenates. [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH was observed to bind to a single population of high-affinity, low-capacity sites (K(d): 4.54+/-0.62 nM, N=5; B(max): 4.38+/-0.21 fmol/mg wet  tissue, N=5), consistent with them being central TRH receptors. Displacement studies showed TRH to bind to these sites with an apparent K(i) of 22 nM. K(i) values for the library peptides at [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH-labelled sites varied from 10(-3) to 10(-9)M; the potency order was: [3-Me-His(2)]>His>Thi>Leu,,Asn>Gln, Arg, , Ala, HomoPhe. All other replacements had K(i) values >10(-4)M. [3H]TRH was observed to label a single population of low-affinity, high-capacity sites (K(d): 7.55+/-1.23 microM, N=6; B(max): 3.40+/-0.63 pmol/mg wet  tissue, N=6). The affinities of the synthetic peptides for [3H]TRH-labelled sites did not correlate with their affinities for [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH-labelled sites (r=0.33, N=18, P>0.1). They did, however, correlate significantly with previously reported binding affinities for TRH-degrading ectoenzyme (r=0.72, N=12, P<0.01). These results strongly indicate that the identity of the low-affinity, [3H]TRH-labelled site is the membrane-bound enzyme, TRH-degrading ectoenzyme, not a subpopulation of TRH receptors.

The parent peptide and its three glycopeptide derivatives were studied in aqueous solution and in the presence of micelles using 2-D NMR, CD, and molecular mechanics (Monte Carlo studies). Consistent with previous conformational studies on cyclic opioid agonist glycopeptides, it was seen that glycosylation did not significantly perturb the peptide backbone in aqueous solution, but all four compounds strongly associated with 5-30 mM SDS or DPC micelles, and underwent profound membrane-induced conformational changes. Interaction was also observed with POPC:POPE:cholesterol  vesicles (LUV) in equilibrium dialysis experiments. Although the peptide backbones of 1-4 possessed random coil structures in water, in the presence of the  phase they each formed a nearly identical pair of structures, all with a stable beta-turn motif at the C-terminus.

Some bioactive peptides had been developed to be used in the management of exercise-related disorders. In this study, we investigated whether the decapeptide CMS001 (Pro---Lys--Tyr--Pro-His-) isolated from pig spleen had anti-fatigue effects. Male Balb/c mice were administered CMS001 (20 microg/(kgd)(-1) or 5 microg/(kgd)(-1) for 30 d, intraperitoneal injections) and tested in an exhaustive swim time task. In order to examine the mechanisms of CMS001 anti-fatigue effects, we analyzed liver glycogen stores, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, lactic acid levels, ultrastructural integrity, and levels of both a free radical metabolite and an anti-oxidant enzyme. CMS001 treatment prolonged exhaustive swim time, increased liver glycogen levels, reduced BUN levels, and decreased accumulation of lactic acid in the blood, relative to mice injected with only saline. Examination of the ultrastructure of  and sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal and cardiac muscle of CMS001-treated and control mice revealed that CMS001 can reduce the damage to cardiac and skeletal muscle caused by an exhaustive swim challenge, such that the structure of most tissue specimens were normal in the peptide-treated group. Furthermore the free radical analysis after acute exercise indicated that CMS001 treatment decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. The present findings indicate that the spleen-derived peptide CMS001 has anti-fatigue effects in mice, and further suggest that the mechanism may involve reduction of tissue damaging free radicals in muscle tissues.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8281987>Peripheral mechanisms of opioid antinociception in : involvement of cytokines.</a></h2><p>It has been shown previously that opioids induce antinociceptive effects at peripheral sites in the presence of inflammatory processes. Besides being elicited by local injection of opioids, such effects can also be obtained by activation of intrinsic opioid mechanisms, e.g. following stress. In the present study the possible role of cytokines in this mechanism was investigated. Unilateral  of the hindpaw of rats was induced by local injection of Freund's complete adjuvant. Intraplantar injection of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or interleukin-6 induced a dose-dependent increase in the threshold in the paw pressure test in the inflamed but not in the non-inflamed paw. This increase was prevented by local injection of naloxone and the mu-opioid receptor specific antagonist CTOP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2) as well as by 3-E7, an universal opioid peptide antibody. In rats pretreated with cyclosporin A to suppress the immune system, the antinociceptive effect of TNF alpha was completely inhibited. In concert with previous studies these data indicate that the tested cytokines release opioid peptides (e.g. beta-endorphin and/or enkephalins) from immune cells of the inflamed tissue which act on opioid receptors present on sensory nerve terminals, resulting in antinociception.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10733960>Chloride channels of glycine and GABA receptors with blockers: Monte Carlo minimization and structure-activity relationships.</a></h2><p>GABA and glycine receptors (GlyRs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that respond to the inhibitory neurotransmitters by opening a chloride-selective central pore lined with five M2 segments homologous to those of alpha(1) GlyR/ ARVG(2')LGIT(6')TVLTMTTQSSGSR. The activity of cyanotriphenylborate (CTB) and picrotoxinin (PTX), the best-studied blockers of the Cl(-) pores, depends essentially on the subunit composition of the receptors, in particular, on residues in positions 2' and 6' that form the pore-facing rings R(2') and R(6'). Thus, CTB blocks alpha(1) and alpha(1)/beta, but not alpha(2) GlyRs (Rundström, N., V. Schmieden, H. Betz, J. Bormann, and D. Langosch. 1994. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91:8950-8954). PTX blocks homomeric receptors (alpha(1) GlyR and rat rho(1) GABAR), but weakly antagonizes heteromeric receptors (alpha(1)/beta GlyR and rho(1)/rho(2) GABAR) (Pribilla, I., T. Takagi, D. Langosch, J. Bormann, and H. Betz. 1992. EMBO J. 11:4305-4311; Zhang D., Z. H. Pan, X. Zhang, A. D. Brideau, and S. A. Lipton. 1995. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92:11756-11760). Using as a template the kinked-helices model of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the open state (Tikhonov, D. B., and B. S. Zhorov. 1998. Biophys. J. 74:242-255), we have built homology models of GlyRs and GABARs and calculated Monte Carlo-minimized  profiles for the blockers pulled through the pore. The profiles have shallow minima at the wide extracellular half of the pore, a barrier at ring R(6'), and a deep minimum between rings R(6') and R(2') where the blockers interact with five M2s simultaneously. The star-like CTB swings necessarily on its way through ring R(6') and its activity inversely correlates with the barrier at R(6'): (6')s and Ala(2')s in alpha(2) GlyR confine the swinging by increasing the barrier, while Gly(2')s in alpha(1) GlyR and (6')s in beta GlyR shrink the barrier. PTX has an egg-like shape with an isopropenyl group at the elongated end and the rounded end trimmed by ether and carbonyl oxygens. In the optimal binding mode to alpha(1) GlyR and rho(1) GABAR, the rounded end of PTX accepts several H-bonds from (6')s, while the elongated end enters ring R(2'). The lack of H-bond donors on the side chains of (6')s (beta GlyR) and Met(6')s (rho(2) GABAR) deteriorates the binding. The hydrophilic elongated end of picrotin does not fit the hydrophobic ring of Pro(2')s/Ala(2')s in GABARs, but fit a more hydrophilic ring with Gly(2')s in GlyRs. This analysis provides explanations for structure-activity relationships of noncompetitive agonists and predicts a narrow pore of LGICs in agreement with experimental data on the permeation of organic cations.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19286827>Amino acid digestibility and concentration of digestible and metabolizable  in soybean meal produced from conventional, high-protein, or low-oligosaccharide varieties of soybeans and fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine AA digestibility and the concentration of DE and ME in 5 sources of soybean meal (SBM). The 5 sources included hexane-extracted SBM produced from high-protein soybeans (SBM-HP) and conventional soybeans (SBM-CONV), and mechanically extruded-expelled SBM produced from high-protein soybeans (EE-SBM-HP), low-oligosaccharide soybeans (EE-SBM-LO), and conventional soybeans (EE-SBM-CONV). Five diets that each contained 1 source of SBM and a N-free diet were used in Exp. 1 to determine AA digestibility in each meal. Twelve growing barrows (initial BW: 67.7 +/- 1.34 kg) were allotted to a replicated 6 x 6 Latin square design with 6 periods and 6 diets in each square. Each period lasted 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. Results of the experiment showed that the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of all AA except Trp was similar for SBM-HP and SBM-CONV, but EE-SBM-HP and EE-SBM-LO had greater (P < 0.05) SID of His, Ile, Lys, , and Val than EE-SBM-CONV. The SID of all indispensable AA in EE-SBM-HP was greater (P < 0.05) than in SBM-HP. The SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, and  in EE-SBM-CONV was greater (P < 0.05) than in SBM-CONV, but the SID of Trp was also greater (P < 0.05) in SBM-CONV than in EE-SBM-CONV. Experiment 2 was conducted to measure DE and ME in the same 5 sources of SBM as used in Exp. 1. Forty-eight growing barrows (initial BW: 38.6 +/- 3.46 kg) were placed in metabolism cages and randomly allotted to 6 diets with 8 replicates per diet. A corn-based diet and 5 diets based on a mixture of corn and each source of SBM were formulated. Urine and feces were collected during a 5-d collection period, and values for DE and ME in each source of SBM were calculated using the difference procedure. Results showed that the ME in SBM-HP tended to be greater (P = 0.10) than in SBM-CONV (4,074 vs. 3,672 kcal/kg of DM). The ME in EE-SBM-HP also tended to be greater (P = 0.10) than in EE-SBM-CONV and in EE-SBM-LO (4,069 vs. 3,620 and 3,721 kcal/kg of DM), but there was no difference in ME between extracted and extruded-expelled meals. It is concluded that SBM-HP has a greater feeding value than SBM-CONV because of greater concentrations of digestible AA and ME. Likewise, EE-SBM-LO has a greater concentration of most indispensable AA than EE-SBM-CONV, but the concentration of ME is similar in these 2 meals. Results of this experiment also showed that AA digestibility values in extruded-expelled SBM are greater than in hexane-extracted SBM.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1317746>Cytotoxic analog of somatostatin containing methotrexate inhibits growth of MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer xenografts in nude mice.</a></h2><p>Nude mice bearing xenografts of MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell line were treated for 4 weeks with AN-51, a somatostatin octapeptide analog D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys--NH2 (RC-121) containing methotrexate attached to the alpha-amino group of D- in position 1.

VLFXA was separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 superfine and ion exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose and on TSK-DEAE (for HPLC) columns. VLFXA is a glycoprotein composed of a heavy chain (57.5 kDa) and two light chains (17.4 kDa and 14.5 kDa) linked by disulfide bonds. VLFXA has multiple molecular forms distinguished by their isoelectric points. The differences in their pI values may be caused by dissimilarities in the respective charged carbohydrate content or in the primary sequence of amino acids. We synthesized 6-9 amino acid residues containing peptides according to physiological cleavage regions of human factor X and human factor IX. The peptides (Asn-Asn-Leu--Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-Gly - factor X fragment, and Asn-Asp---Arg-Val-Val-Gly-Gly - factor IX fragment) were used as substrates for direct assay of VLFXA. Cleavage products of peptide hydrolysis and the molecular masses of cleavage products of human factor X were determined by MALDI-TOF MS. The MALDI-TOF MS was highly efficient for the recovery and identification of peptides released by VLFXA hydrolysis. We can conclude that VLFXA cleaves the Arg(52)-Ile(53) bond in the heavy chain of human factor X and the Arg(226)-Val(227) bond in human factor IX precursor.

This study investigated the effect of modulating MOR activity upon nociception, by stereotaxically injecting specific ligands in the VB. Nociceptive behaviour was evaluated in two established animal models of inflammatory pain, by using the formalin (acute and tonic pain) and the ankle-bend (chronic monoarthritic pain) tests. Control (saline intra-VB injection) formalin-injected rats showed acute and tonic pain-related behaviours. In contrast, intrathalamic administration of [D-Ala(2), N-Me-(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin acetate (DAMGO), a MOR-specific agonist, induced a statistically significant decrease of all tonic phase pain-related behaviours assessed until 30-35min after formalin hind paw injection. In the acute phase only the number of paw-jerks was affected. In monoarthritic rats, there was a noticeable antinociceptive effect with approximately 40min of duration, as denoted by the reduced ankle-bend scores observed after DAMGO injection. Intra-VB injection of D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2) (CTOP), a specific MOR antagonist, or of CTOP followed, 10min after, by DAMGO had no effects in either formalin or ankle-bend tests.

In previous work, stimulating MOPRs by infusing the highly selective MOPR agonist [d-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) into the lateral parabrachial region (LPBN) increased food intake. The highly selective MOPR antagonist d--Cys-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP) prevented the hyperphagic action of DAMGO. The present experiments aimed to analyze both the pattern of neural activation and the underlying cellular processes associated with MOPR activation in the LPBN. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a unilateral microinfusion of a nearly maximal hyperphagic dose of DAMGO into the LPBN. We then determined the level of c-Fos immunoreactivity in regions throughout the brain. MOPR activation in the LPBN increased c-Fos in the LPBN and in the nucleus accumbens, hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and hippocampus. Pretreatment with CTAP prevented the increase in c-Fos translation in each of these areas. CTAP also prevented the coupling of MOPRs to their G-proteins which was measured by [(35)S] guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) autoradiography.

Structure-activity exploration suggests that Bractoppin engages BRCA1 tBRCT residues recognizing pSer in the consensus motif, pSer-Pro--, plus an abutting hydrophobic pocket that is distinct in structurally related BRCT domains, conferring selectivity. In cells, Bractoppin inhibits substrate recognition detected by Förster resonance energy transfer, and diminishes BRCA1 recruitment to DNA breaks, in turn suppressing damage-induced G2 arrest and assembly of the recombinase, RAD51. But damage-induced MDC1 recruitment, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation, and TOPBP1 recruitment remain unaffected.

Rhenium complexes Re-1 through Re-3 were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically, and receptor binding affinity was demonstrated for Re-3 in SSTR-expressing cells (AR42J, IC = 91 nM). Radiolabeled complexes [Tc]Tc/[Re]Re-1/2 and [Tc]Tc-3 were prepared in high radiochemical yield (>90%, determined by radio-HPLC) by reacting [Tc]/[Re][Tc/Re(OH)(CO)] with 1-3 and correlated well with the respective Re-1 through Re-3 standards in comparative HPLC studies. All radiotracers remained intact through 24 h (Tc-labeled complexes) or 48 h (Re-labeled complexes) against 1 mM l-histidine and 1 mM l-cysteine (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Similarly, rat serum stability studies displayed no decomposition and low nonspecific binding of 9-24% through 4 h. Biodistribution of [Tc]Tc-3 in healthy CF-1 mice demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile.

The peptide sequence of ASP-1 as determined by MALDI-TOF/MS and ESI-FTICR-MS was acetylated --Ala-Val-Dhb--Ile/Leu. The peptide was further analysed by alkaline hydrolysis, ESI-Q-TOF-MS and an ion mobility assay, which detected the presence of a lactone ring in the intact peptide and a cyclic nature, subsequently revealing the linearised peptide sequence as acPhe-Leu---Val-Ala-Dhb. Based on the molecular mass (804.5 Da), peptide sequence and amino acid composition, ASP-1 was identified as a lactone ring-containing peptide similar to TL-119, a poorly studied cyclic depsipeptide. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed its predominantly random structure in aqueous solution and its β-sheet conformation in methanol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the purified peptide against S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ranged from 2 µg/mL to 64 µg/mL. At sub-MICs and 1× MIC, ASP-1 showed a strong antibiofilm characteristic. ASP-1 at a concentration of 128 µg/mL did not show haemolytic activity, and no cytotoxicity was observed against hepatic carcinoma and breast carcinoma cell lines at the same concentration. Peptide ASP-1 with anti-MRSA and antibiofilm abilities and non-haemolytic and non-cytotoxic properties has not been reported previously.

Feline trypsinogen was purified by sulfuric acid extraction, SDS-PAGE and electroelution. Only one isoform of feline trypsin and its zymogen could be demonstrated. Isoelectric focusing on agarose gel revealed an isoelectric point of greater than 10.0 for both feline trypsinogen and trypsin.

Nonetheless, their prevalence has increased significantly during the last decades. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a relatively new treatment approach for inoperable or metastasised NETs. The therapeutic effect is based on the binding of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue peptides with NETs' somatostatin receptors, resulting in internal irradiation of tumours. Pre-therapeutic patient-specific dosimetry is essential to ensure that a treatment course has high levels of safety and efficacy. This paper reviews the methods applied for PRRT dosimetry, as well as the dosimetric results presented in the literature. Focus is given on data concerning the therapeutic somatostatin analogue radiopeptides (111)In-[DTPA(0),D-(1)]-octreotide ((111)In-DTPA-octreotide), (90)Y-[DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]-octreotide ((90)Y-DOTATOC) and (177)Lu-[DOTA(0),Tyr(3),(8)]-octreotide ((177)Lu-DOTATATE).

Their role in inflammatory pain has not been fully elucidated. Here we examine peripheral antinociception elicited by exogenously applied EM-1 and EM-2 and the contribution of EM-containing leukocytes to stress- and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-induced antinociception. To this end, we applied behavioral (paw pressure) testing, radioligand binding, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry in rats with unilateral hindpaw  induced with Freund's adjuvant. EMs injected directly into both hindpaws produced antinociception exclusively in inflamed paws. This was blocked by locally applied mu-receptor-selective (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2) but not kappa-receptor-selective (nor-binaltorphimine) antagonists. Delta-receptor antagonists (naltrindole and N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib--Leu) did not influence EM-1-induced but dose-dependently decreased EM-2-induced antinociception. Antibodies against beta-endorphin, methionine-enkephalin, or leucine-enkephalin did not significantly change EM-2-induced antinociception. Both EMs displaced binding of [3H]-[D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin to mu-receptors in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using [3H]-naltrindole or [(125)I]-[D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin, no detectable delta-binding was found in DRG of inflamed hindlimbs. Numerous beta-endorphin-containing and fewer EM-1- and EM-2-containing leukocytes were detected in subcutaneous tissue of inflamed paws. Leukocyte-depleting serum decreased the number of immigrating opioid-containing immune cells and attenuated swim stress- and CRF-induced antinociception in inflamed paws. Both forms of antinociception were strongly attenuated by anti-beta-endorphin and to a lesser degree by anti-EM-1 and anti-EM-2 antibodies injected into inflamed paws. Together, exogenously applied and immune cell-derived EMs alleviate prolonged inflammatory pain through selective activation of peripheral opioid receptors. Exogenous EM-2 in addition to mu-receptors also activates peripheral delta-receptors, which does not involve actions via other opioid peptides.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26431875>Intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations generated via the extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaSR) in response to extracellular Ca(2+) or L-phenylalanine: Impact of the highly conservative mutation Ser170Thr.</a></h2><p>The extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaSR) is an allosteric protein that responds to changes in the extracellular concentration of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]e) and aromatic amino acids with the production of different patterns of oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). An increase in [Ca(2+)]e stimulates sinusoidal oscillations in [Ca(2+)]i whereas aromatic amino acid-induced CaR activation in the presence of a threshold [Ca(2+)]e promotes transient oscillations in [Ca(2+)]i. Here, we examined spontaneous and ligand-evoked [Ca(2+)]i oscillations in single HEK-293 cells transfected with the wild type CaSR or with a mutant CaSR in which Ser170 was converted to  (CaSRS170T). Our analysis demonstrates that cells expressing CaSRS170T display [Ca(2+)]i oscillations in the presence of low concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+) and respond to L- with robust transient [Ca(2+)]i oscillations. Our results indicate that the S170T mutation induces a marked increase in CaSR sensitivity to [Ca(2+)]e and imply that the allosteric regulation of the CaSR by aromatic amino acids is not only mediated by an heterotropic positive effect on Ca(2+) binding cooperativity but, as biased agonists, aromatic amino acids stabilize a CaSR conformation that couples to a different signaling pathway leading to transient [Ca(2+)]i oscillations.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1964226>Structure-activity study of neurokinins: antagonists for the neurokinin-2 receptor.</a></h2><p>A series of 21 peptides were synthesized and tested in a variety of isolated organs in order to determine their potential as neurokinin-2 (NK-2) antagonists.

Neuronal activity was assessed before and following local injection of endomorphin 1. Comparisons were made between normal knees and knees with adjuvant-induced monarthritis, tested at 48 hours and 1 week posttreatment. Expression of mu-opioid receptors in the dorsal root ganglia ipsilateral to the chronically inflamed joints was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis.In normal knees, endomorphin 1 caused up to a 75% reduction in joint afferent nerve activity, which was blocked by the mu-opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--amide. The inhibitory effect of endomorphin 1 was sustained in acutely inflamed knees. Conversely, in chronically inflamed joints, endomorphin 1 had no observable effect on the primary afferent nerve firing rate elicited by a noxious mechanical stimulus and, as such, was significantly different from the rate in normal joints. Immunohistochemical and real-time PCR analysis of the L3-L5 dorsal root ganglia ipsilateral to the chronic arthritis lesion revealed a reduction in mu-opioid receptor protein and gene expression compared with that in normal control animals.Taken together, these results provide the first electrophysiologic evidence that selective activation of peripheral mu-opioid receptors reduces normal knee joint mechanosensitivity to a noxious stimulus. Furthermore, the analgesic effect of endomorphin 1 is lost during chronic  due to down-regulation of mu-opioid receptor expression in afferent nerve cell bodies. These findings begin to explain the ambiguous efficacy of peripherally administered mu-opioid drugs in controlling chronic inflammatory joint pain.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3812085>Mechanism of synthesis and localization of mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases in rat liver.</a></h2><p>Fumarases in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of rat liver were separately purified and crystallized.

The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal portion of the mitochondrial fumarase was determined by the Edman method as Ala-Gln-Gln-Asn--Glu-Ile-Pro-Asp-, but that of the cytosolic fumarase could not be determined by the Edman method, since the N-terminal amino acid was blocked. The N-terminal amino acid of the cytosolic fumarase was identified as N-acetyl-alanine by analysis of the acidic amino acid produced by digestion of the enzyme protein with pronase E, carboxypeptidase A and B. Then the sequence of five amino acids in the N-terminal portion was determined by analyzing the acidic peptide obtained by limited proteolysis of the enzyme protein with carboxypeptidase A as Ac-Ala-Ser-Gln-Asn-Ser-. Peptide mapping of the tryptic peptides obtained from the mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases showed no difference in the amino acid sequences of the two except in their N-terminal portions.

The decay curve of the specific radioactivity of the mitochondrial fumarase, obtained after a single injection of L-[U-14]leucine, was quite unusual: its specific radioactivity remained constant for about 7 days after pulse labeling, and then decreased exponentially with a half-life of 9.7 days.

Notable exceptions to this generalization occur for Xaa equal to Pro or Sar. For Xaa = Pro only cleavage of the second amide bond is observed, consistent with a pronounced proline effect, i.e., cleavage N-terminal to Pro. When Xaa = Sar considerably enhanced cleavage of the second amide bond also is observed, suggesting that at least part of the proline effect relates to the tertiary nature of the amide nitrogen. In the competition between symmetric and asymmetric bond cleavage an attempt to establish a linear free  correlation in relating ln(y(5)(+2)/y(5)) to PA(H-Xaa-OH) did not lead to a reasonable correlation although the trend of increasing y(5)(+2)/y(5) ratio with increasing proton affinity of H-Xaa-OH was clear. Proline showed a unique behavior in giving a much higher y(5)(+2)/y(5) ratio than any of the other residues studied.© American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 2011</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2386478>Isolation and structure of a novel charged member of the red-pigment-concentrating hormone-adipokinetic hormone family of peptides isolated from the corpora cardiaca of the blowfly Phormia terraenovae (Diptera).</a></h2><p>A hypertrehalosaemic neuropeptide from the corpora cardiaca of the blowfly Phormia terraenovae has been isolated by reversed-phase h.p.l.c., and its primary structure was determined by pulsed-liquid phase sequencing employing Edman chemistry after enzymically deblocking the N-terminal pyroglutamate residue. The C-terminus was also blocked, as indicated by the lack of digestion when the peptide was incubated with carboxypeptidase A. The octapeptide has the sequence pGlu-Leu---Ser-Pro-Asp-Trp-NH2 and is clearly defined as a novel member of the RPCH/AKH (red-pigment-concentrating hormone/adipokinetic hormone) family of peptides. It is the first charged member of this family to be found. The synthetic peptide causes an increase in the haemolymph carbohydrate concentration in a dose-dependent fashion in blowflies and therefore is named 'Phormia terraenovae hypertrehalosaemic hormone' (Pht-HrTH). In addition, receptors in the -body of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) recognize the peptide, resulting in carbohydrate elevation in the blood. However, -body receptors of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) do not recognize this charged molecule, and thus no  mobilization is observed in this species.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727082>Comparison of amino acid digestibility in full-fat soybean, two soybean meals, and peanut flour between broiler chickens and growing pigs.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in full-fat soybean (FFSB), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 430 g/kg CP (SBM-43), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 470 g/kg CP (SBM-47), and peanut flour (PNF) fed to broiler chickens and pigs and to compare the digestibility of CP and AA between broiler chickens and pigs. Four diets were prepared to contain FFSB, SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF as the sole source of N. A N-free diet was formulated to estimate the basal ileal endogenous losses of CP and AA for broiler chickens and pigs. In Exp. 1, a total of four hundred sixteen 21-d-old male broiler chickens (922.1 ± 79.9 g initial BW) were assigned to 5 experimental diets in a randomized complete block design with BW as a blocking factor. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected after birds were euthanized by CO asphyxiation. In Exp. 2, twenty barrows (62.0 ± 6.9 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum were allotted to 5 experimental diets with 2 consecutive 7-d experimental periods. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected at d 6 and 7. For statistical analysis, treatments were considered a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with effects of species and experimental diets (Exp. 1 vs. Exp. 2). There were no interactions between species and diets for the digestibility of CP and AA except for Cys ( < 0.01). The AID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.01) than in broiler chickens. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the AID of CP and indispensable AA in SBM-47 were greater ( < 0.05) than in FFSB, and the AID of Lys in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. The SID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.05) than in broiler chickens except for Trp. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the SID of Lys in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. In broiler chickens, the SID of CP, Ile, Leu, , Trp, and Val in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than that in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In pigs, the SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , and Val in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In conclusion, the digestibility of CP and most AA were less in broiler chickens than in pigs, but the pattern of differences in the AA digestibility among ingredients was similar between broiler chickens and pigs.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9562614>Effects of point mutations at the flexible loop alanine-145 of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase on its stability and function.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the role of a flexible loop (residues 142-149) in the stability and function of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase, alanine-145 in this loop was substituted by site-directed mutagenesis with ten amino acids (Glu, , Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Arg, Ser, , and Val). The amount of three mutant proteins (A145E, A145I, and A145L) in cells was too small to allow the measurement of circular dichroism (CD) spectra and urea unfolding. The CD spectra of other seven mutants were identical with those of the wild-type DHFR, indicating that the native conformation of DHFR was not affected by the mutations.

In the absence of active-site ligands, the C-terminal segment is not fixed in one position and is not detectable in the crystal structure. A key residue in the alpha 9-helix is  220, which can interact with both the enzyme-bound glutathione and the second substrate, and possibly guide the reactants into the transition state. Mutation of  220 into Ala and  was shown to reduce the catalytic efficiency of GST A1-1. The mutation of an additional residue,  222, caused further decrease in activity. The presence of a viscosogen in the reaction medium decreased the kinetic parameters K(cat) and K(cat)/K(m) for the conjugation of CDNB catalyzed by wild-type GST A1-1, in agreement with the view that product release is rate limiting for the substrate-saturated enzyme. The mutations cause a decrease of the viscosity dependence of both kinetic parameters, indicating that the motion of the alpha 9-helix is linked to catalysis in wild-type GST A1-1. The isomerization reaction with the alternative substrate Delta(5)-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) is affected in a similar manner by the viscosogens. The transition state  of the isomerization reaction, like that of the CDNB conjugation, is lowered by  220 as indicated by the effects of the mutations on K(cat)/K(m). The results demonstrate that  220 and  222, in the dynamic C-terminal segment, influence rate-determining steps in the catalytic mechanism of both the substitution and the isomerization reactions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554003>Opioids and opioid receptors orchestrate wound repair.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that topical opioids including morphine and its congeners promote healing of full thickness ischemic wounds in rats. We examined the contribution of mu opioid receptor (MOPr)-mediated healing of full thickness ischemic wounds using MOPr and delta or kappa opioid receptor knockout (KO) mice. Wound closure in the early (day 5) as well as later phases was delayed in topical morphine or PBS-treated MOPr-KO mice compared with reciprocal treatments of wounds in wild-type (WT) mice. MOPr expression was significantly upregulated at 30 min in the wound margins and colocalized with wound margins and vasculature in the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. We next examined whether neuropeptide expression was involved in the mechanism of MOPr-mediated wound closure. Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (ir) was significantly increased in the skin of MOPr-KO mice as compared with WT mice. Neuropeptide-ir was increased significantly in PBS-treated wounds of MOPr and WT mice, but morphine treatment reduced neuropeptide immunoreactivity in both as compared with PBS. Wounding of keratinocytes led to the release of opioid peptide beta-endorphin (β-END) in conditioned medium, which stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells. MOPr-selective (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2, CTOP) and nonselective OPr antagonist naloxone-inhibited endothelial proliferation induced by wounded keratinocyte-conditioned medium. In addition, accelerated wound area closure in vitro by morphine was suppressed by methylnaltrexone, a nonselective OPr antagonist with high affinity for MOPr. Morphine and its congeners stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells from WT mice but not those from MOPr-KO mice. Furthermore, morphine-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in endothelial cells was significantly decreased in MOPr-KO mice as compared with WT mice. Collectively, these data suggest that MOPr plays a critical role in the proliferation phase with the formation of granulation tissue during wound healing.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The chelating mechanism between FVDVT and calcium was further investigated by Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H nuclear magnetic resonances spectroscopy. The results indicated that the  atoms of the carboxy group and the nitrogen atoms of the amido group provided major binding sites.

Their relative agonist activities in mobilising lipids over a fixed time interval (1 h) in locusts were assessed. The similar time courses for  release shown by two of the peptide analogues and adipokinetic hormone suggest that the analogues and the hormone are transported to the receptors on the  body cells, and are also degraded, at similar rates. Consequently, the analogue activities can be correlated with the structural requirements of the locust  body hormone receptors. The requirements for activity demonstrated in this study are as follows. Residues 1--8 from the N-terminus are necessary to elicit some activity (20%). Residues 5 and 7 in the octapeptide can be changed without affecting activity but L-pyroglutamic acid as the N-terminal residue is necessary formaximum activity both in the octapeptide and the decapeptide. Full activity is achieved only by adding the dipeptide glycyl threonine amide to the active octapeptide 'core'. In the decapeptide, residues cannot be interchanged to the same extent as in the octapeptide without reducing activity. The peptide probably has to be uncharged. Inactive analogues of seven residues or less do not interfere in the hormone-receptor interaction.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15787211>[Spatial structure of myelopeptides: I.

In human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged version of human MOP, we compared the signals triggered by the noninternalizing and internalizing MOP agonists morphine and DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-methyl--Gly-ol), respectively. We studied three major and well described components of MOP signaling: receptor internalization, G protein coupling, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/ERK2. Our results show that morphine and DAMGO display different profiles of receptor internalization and a similar ability to trigger the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2. Our SPR analyses revealed that morphine and DAMGO evoke similar SPR signatures and that Gαi, cAMP-dependent pathways, and ERK1/ERK2 have key roles in morphine- and DAMGO-mediated signaling. Most interestingly, we found that the so-called MOP neutral antagonists CTOP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2)), naloxone, and naltrexone behave like partial agonists. Even more intriguing, BRET experiments indicate that CTAP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH(2)) induces similar conformational changes as naltrexone at the Gαi-βγ interface, whereas it appears as an inverse agonist based on its SPR response thus indicating distinct signaling mechanisms for the two ligands. Taken together, our results support the usefulness of label-free methods such as SPR to study whole-cell responses and signaling cascades triggered by G protein-coupled receptors and complement the conventional approaches by revealing cellular responses that would have been otherwise undetectable.Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28324422>Comparative analysis of amino acid sequences from mesophiles and thermophiles in respective of carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family.</a></h2><p>A comparative study of amino acid sequence and physicochemical properties indicates the affiliation of protein from the nitrilase/cyanide hydratase family.

DAMGO (1, 5, 10 microg) or vehicle was administered directly into the masseter 5-10 min prior to the HS infusion. The DAMGO effects were assessed on mean peak counts (MPC) and overall magnitude as calculated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the HS-evoked behavioral responses. Under this condition, only the highest dose of DAMGO (10 microg) significantly reduced MPC, which was prevented when H-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP), a selective MOR antagonist, was co-administered. DAMGO pre-treatment in the contralateral masseter did not attenuate MPC. The same doses of DAMGO administered into CFA-inflamed rats, however, produced a greater attenuation of both MPC and AUC of HS-evoked nocifensive responses.

The results obtained show that the network of cooperativities between the redox and protonic centers is consistent with a synergetic process to stimulate the hydrogen uptake activity of hydrogenase. This is achieved by increasing the affinity of the cytochrome for protons through binding electrons and, reciprocally, by favoring a concerted two-electron transfer assisted by the binding of proton(s).

The predictor variables tested included average  (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, :Lys, Leu:, Ile:, Val:, BCAA:, (+Tyr):Lys, Leu:(+Tyr), Ile:(+Tyr), Val:(+Tyr), BCAA:(+Tyr), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the  statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × Ile:Lys) - (0.1479 × Ile:Lys × Ile:Lys) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

Previous studies on the sequence requirements for N-glycosylation have yielded the Asn-X-Ser/ (NXS/T) sequon and the enhanced aromatic sequons (-X-Asn-X- and -X-X-Asn-X-), which can be efficiently N-glycosylated. To further investigate the influence of sequence variation on N-glycosylation efficiency in the context of a five-residue enhanced aromatic sequon, we used the human CD2 adhesion domain (hCD2ad) to screen the i-2, i-1, i+1, and i+2 residues flanking Asn at the i position. We found that aromatic residues, especially Trp, and sulfur-containing residues at the i-2 position improved N-glycosylation efficiency, while positively charged residues such as Arg suppressed N-glycosylation. Thiol, hydroxyl, and aliphatic-based side chains at the i-1 position had higher N-glycosylation efficiency, and Cys, in particular, compensated for the negative effect of Arg at the i-2 position. Small residues and Ser at the i+1 position increased the likelihood of N-glycosylation, and  is better than Ser at the i+2 position. We devised an algorithm for prediction of N-glycosylation efficiency using the SAS software, employing the 120 sequences studied as a training set. We then introduced the optimized-enhanced aromatic sequons into other glycoproteins and observed an enhancement in N-glycan occupancy that was further supported by modeling the high-affinity interaction between the optimized sequence on hCD2ad and a human oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) subunit. The findings in this study provide useful information for enhancing or suppressing N-glycosylation at a site of interest and valuable data for a better understanding of OST-catalyzed N-glycosylation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152513>Evolution and conservation of JmjC domain proteins in the green lineage.</a></h2><p>Histone modification regulates plant development events by epigenetically silencing or activating gene expression, and histone methylation is regulated by histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and histone lysine demethylases (KDMs). The JmjC domain proteins, an important KDM family, erase methyl marks (CH3-) from histones and play key roles in maintaining homeostasis of histone methylation in vivo. Here, we analyzed 169 JmjC domain proteins from whole genomes of plants ranging from green alga to higher plants together with 36 from two animals (fruit fly and human). The plant JmjC domain proteins were divided into seven groups. Group-I KDM4/JHDM3 and Group-V JMJD6 were found in all the plant species and the other groups were detected mainly in vascular or seed plants. Group-I KDM4/JHDM3 was potentially associated with demethylation of H3K9me2/3, H3K27me2/3, and H3K36me1/2/3, Group-II KDM5A with H3K4me1/2/3, Group-III KDM5B with H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K9me1/2/3, Group-V JMJD6 with H3R2, H4R3, and hydroxylation of H4, and Group-VII KDM3/JHDM2 with H3K9me1/2/3. Group-IV/Group-VI JmjC domain-only A/B proteins were involved in hydroxylation and demethylation of unknown substrate sites. The binding sites for the cofactors Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate in the JmjC domains also were analyzed. In the α-ketoglutarate binding sites, //Ser and Lys were conserved and in the Fe(II) binding sites, two His and Glu/Asp were conserved. The results show that JmjC domain proteins are a conserved family in which domain organization and cofactor binding sites have been modified in some species. Our results provide insights into KDM evolution and lay a foundation for functional characterization of KDMs.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11135092>Kinetic studies of dipeptide-based and amino acid-based peritoneal dialysis solutions.</a></h2><p>Dipeptide-based peritoneal dialysis solutions may have potential advantages compared with the glucose or amino acid-based solutions. Dipeptides may hydrolyze in the peritoneal cavity, generating constituent amino acids and thereby increasing the osmolality of the dialysate. Dipeptides can also be a valuable source of amino acids, which are poorly soluble in water, such as tyrosine.Dwell studies in rats were performed during four hours with dipeptide solutions containing five dipeptides (Gly-His, Ala-Tyr, -Leu, Ser-, Val-Lys), 8, or 16 mmol/L of each dipeptide (low or high dipeptide group). Dwell studies were also performed with a 1.1% amino acid solution (Nutrineal(R)). The model of dipeptide hydrolysis (hydrolysis rate, KH), diffusive (rate constant, KBDD) and convective transport as well as transport of constituent amino acids consisted of mass balance equations, written for each dipeptide and amino acid.Peritoneal volume with the amino acid solution decreased much faster than that with the high and low dipeptide solutions. KH for all dipeptides did not differ between the high and low dipeptide groups. In the low dipeptide group, KH was 0.004 +/- 0.004 mL/min (mean +/- SD) for Gly-His (the lowest) and 0.088 +/- 0.048 mL/min for -Leu (the highest). KBDD was higher than KH for all dipeptides, the average being 0.2 +/- 0.05 mL/min.Dipeptides are hydrolyzed in the peritoneal cavity, generating constituent amino acids. However, the hydrolysis rate appears to be several times lower than the dipeptide diffusive transport rate from dialysate to blood. Due to the higher molecular  and intraperitoneal generation of amino acids, the dipeptide-based solutions provide more sustained ultrafiltration than the amino acid solution. The plasma concentration of amino acids at 60 minutes, in relation to the dose of amino acids delivered between 0 and 60 minutes, is considerably higher during the dwells with amino acid-based solution than during dwells with the dipeptide-based solutions.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16505477>Independence of protein kinase C-delta activity from activation loop phosphorylation: structural basis and altered functions in cells.</a></h2><p>Activation loop phosphorylation plays critical regulatory roles for many kinases. Unlike other protein kinase Cs (PKC), PKC-delta does not require phosphorylation of its activation loop (-507) for in vitro activity. We investigated the structural basis for this unusual capacity and its relevance to PKC-delta function in intact cells. Mutational analysis demonstrated that activity without -507 phosphorylation depends on 20 residues N-terminal to the kinase domain and a pair of phenylalanines (-500/-527) unique to PKC-delta in/near the activation loop. Molecular modeling demonstrated that these elements stabilize the activation loop by forming a hydrophobic chain of interactions from the C-lobe to activation loop to N-terminal (helical) extension. In cells PKC-delta mediates both apoptosis and transcription regulation. We found that the T507A mutant of the PKC-delta kinase domain resembled the corresponding wild type in mediating apoptosis in transfected HEK293T cells. But the T507A mutant was completely defective in AP-1 and NF-kappaB reporter assays. A novel assay in which the kinase domain of PKC-delta and its substrate (a fusion protein of PKC substrate peptide with green fluorescent protein) were co-targeted to  rafts revealed a major substrate-selective defect of the T507A mutant in phosphorylating the substrate in cells. In vitro analysis showed strong product inhibition on the T507A mutant with particular substrates whose characteristics suggest it contributes to the substrate selective defect of the PKC-delta T507A mutant in cells. Thus, activation loop phosphorylation of PKC-delta may regulate its function in cells in a novel way.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17884811>The A-chain of insulin contacts the insert domain of the insulin receptor. Photo-cross-linking and mutagenesis of a -related crevice.</a></h2><p>The contribution of the insulin A-chain to receptor binding is investigated by photo-cross-linking and nonstandard mutagenesis. Studies focus on the role of Val(A3), which projects within a crevice between the A- and B-chains. Engineered receptor alpha-subunits containing specific protease sites ("midi-receptors") are employed to map the site of photo-cross-linking by an analog containing a photoactivable A3 side chain (para-azido- (Pap)). The probe cross-links to a C-terminal peptide (residues 703-719 of the receptor A isoform, KTFEDYLHNVVFVPRPS) containing side chains critical for hormone binding (underlined); the corresponding segment of the holoreceptor was shown previously to cross-link to a Pap(B25)-insulin analog. Because Pap is larger than Val and so may protrude beyond the A3-associated crevice, we investigated analogs containing A3 substitutions comparable in size to Val as follows: , allo-, and alpha-aminobutyric acid (Aba). Substitutions were introduced within an engineered monomer. Whereas previous studies of smaller substitutions (Gly(A3) and Ser(A3)) encountered nonlocal conformational perturbations, NMR structures of the present analogs are similar to wild-type insulin; the variant side chains are accommodated within a native-like crevice with minimal distortion. Receptor binding activities of Aba(A3) and allo-(A3) analogs are reduced at least 10-fold; the activity of (A3)-DKP-insulin is reduced 5-fold. The hormone-receptor interface is presumably destabilized either by a packing defect (Aba(A3)) or by altered polarity (allo-(A3) and (A3)). Our results provide evidence that Val(A3), a site of mutation causing , contacts the insert domain-derived tail of the alpha-subunit in a hormone-receptor complex.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690663>Metabolic changes and nutrient repletion in lambs provided with electrolyte solutions before and after feed and water deprivation.</a></h2><p>Providing feeder calves and lambs with electrolyte solutions before and(or) after a transport period could potentially reduce tissue shrink and speed repletion of nutrients and  that are lost during transport. This trial was conducted to determine metabolic changes and nutrient repletion in lambs provided with electrolyte solutions before and after feed and water deprivation. Solutions were 1) deionized water, 2) ES1 (g/10 L: NaCl, 2.0; K carbonate, 2.8; Mg sulfate.7H2O, 2.0; equal mixture of amino acids [Lys, , , His, Trp, Met, Leu, Ile, and Val], .45; and phosphoric acid to pH 7.0), 3) ES2 (twice the concentrations as in ES1), and ES3 (g/10 L: NaCl 2.0; K carbonate, 8.0; Mg sulfate.7H2O, 4.0; amino acid mixture from ES1, .45; and phosphoric acid to pH 7.0). Eight Suffolk x Hampshire crossbred lambs (average BW 35 +/- 2 kg) were used in an 8 x 8 Latin square design with treatments arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial. Main treatments consisted of two deprivation electrolyte solutions (deionized water or ES1) and four realimentation electrolyte solutions (deionized water, ES1, ES2, and ES3). Lambs were limit-fed (600 g/d, as-fed basis) before and after a 3-d feed and water deprivation phase. Lambs provided the ES1 solution during the pre-deprivation phase had greater (P < .05) Na, Mg, Zn retention during the pre-deprivation phase, had greater (P < .05) Na and Mg losses during the 3-d deprivation phase, and greater (P < .05) cumulative Na, Cu, and Fe retentions than lambs given deionized water during the pre-deprivation phase. Compared to lambs provided water, lambs provided the ES1 solution during the realimentation phase had greater Na retention but similar K, Mg, and water retentions. However, when the concentration of electrolytes in the solution was doubled (i.e., ES2 solution), Na, K, and Mg retentions were increased (P < .05) compared with those of lambs provided deionized water or the ES1 solution. These results suggest that as the length or severity of the stress period increases, the concentration of electrolytes in the electrolyte solution may need to be increased to improve nutrient balance.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320441>Phosphate Solubilizing Bacillus megaterium mj1212 Regulates Endogenous Plant Carbohydrates and Amino Acids Contents to Promote Mustard Plant Growth.</a></h2><p>The current study was conducted to explore the potential of a phosphate solubilizing soil bacterium, Bacillus megaterium mj1212 for enhancing the growth of mustard plants.

While the development of various α subunit-selective modulators is currently underway for the treatment of anxiety disorders, a mechanistic understanding of the correlation between their bioactivity and efficacy, based on ligand-target interactions, is currently still lacking. In order to alleviate this situation, in the current study we have analyzed, using ligand- and structure-based methods, a data set of 5440 GABA modulators. The Spearman correlation (ρ) between binding activity and efficacy of compounds was calculated to be 0.008 and 0.31 against the α1 and α2 subunits of GABA receptor, respectively; in other words, the compounds had little diversity in structure and bioactivity, but they differed significantly in efficacy. Two compounds were selected as a case study for detailed interaction analysis due to the small difference in their structures and affinities (ΔpK = 0.45 log units, ΔpK = 0 log units) as compared to larger relative efficacies (ΔRE = 1.03, ΔRE = 0.21). Docking analysis suggested that His-101 is involved in a characteristic interaction of the α1 receptor with both compounds 1 and 2. Residues such as -77, -142, Asn-60, and Arg-144 of the γ chain of the α1γ2 complex also showed interactions with heterocyclic rings of both compounds 1 and 2, but these interactions were disturbed in the case of α2γ2 complex docking results. Binding pocket stability analysis based on molecular dynamics identified three substitutions in the loop C region of the α2 subunit, namely, G200E, I201T, and V202I, causing a reduction in the flexibility of α2 compared to α1. These amino acids in α2, as compared to α1, were also observed to decrease the vibrational and dihedral entropy and to increase the hydrogen bond content in α2 in the apo state. However, freezing of both α1 and α2 was observed in the ligand-bound state, with an increased number of internal hydrogen bonds and increased entropy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the amino acid differences in the loop C region of α2 are responsible for conformational changes in the protein structure compared to α1, as well as for the binding modes of compounds and hence their functional signaling.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26851853>Milk protein yield and mammary  are affected by phenylalanine deficiency but not by threonine or tryptophan deficiency.</a></h2><p>Efficient milk protein synthesis requires that the essential AA be presented to the mammary gland in the right amount and proportion to maximize protein synthesis and minimize losses.

Here we examined the contribution of the C terminus in supporting folding of the serotonin transporter (SERT; SLC6A4). Our working hypothesis posited that the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal α-helix ((603)-(613)) was important for folding of SERT. Accordingly, we disrupted the hydrophobic moment of the α-helix by replacing (604), Ile(608), or Ile(612) by Gln. The bulk of the resulting mutants SERT-F604Q, SERT-I608Q, and SERT-I612Q were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, but their residual delivery to the cell surface still depended on SEC24C. This indicates that the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal α-helix was dispensable to endoplasmic reticulum export. The folding trajectory of SERT is thought to proceed through the inward facing conformation. Consistent with this conjecture, cell surface expression of the misfolded mutants was restored by (i) introducing second site suppressor mutations, which trap SERT in the inward facing state, or (ii) by the pharmacochaperone noribogaine, which binds to the inward facing conformation. Finally, mutation of Glu(615) at the end of the C-terminal α-helix to Lys reduced surface expression of SERT-E615K. A charge reversal mutation in intracellular loop 1 restored surface expression of SERT-R152E/E615K to wild type levels. These observations support a mechanistic model where the C-terminal amphipathic helix is stabilized by an intramolecular salt bridge between residues Glu(615) and Arg(152).

A peptide was isolated and sequenced from the retrocerebral corpora cardiaca glands of the alderfly, Sialis lutaria. The sequence of the peptide was deduced from the multiple MS(N) electrospray mass data as that of an octapeptide: pGlu-Ile/Leu----Pro-Ser-Trp amide. The ambiguity about the amino acid at position 2, Leu or Ile, was solved by comparing retention time on reversed-phase HPLC and establishing co-elution with the synthetic Leu(2)-form which also had exactly the same MS(2) mass spectra as the natural peptide. The sequence represents a novel peptide of the adipokinetic hormone family which has already more than 40 members. Interestingly, the primary structure is identical to that predicted from genome information for the adipokinetic hormone of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.

ProMMP-10 was purified from the culture media of OSC-20 human oral squamous carcinoma cells stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate.

The zymogen is activated by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and processed to the active forms of Mr 47,000 and 24,000. The NH2-terminal sequence of the 47,000- and 24,000-Mr species is Phe82-Ser-Ser--Pro-Gly, which is identical to that of stromelysin 2.

The NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicates that the 81,000-, 65,000- and 57,000-M, species have the identical sequence of Phe88-Gln---Glu-Gly, suggesting the cleavage of the Arg87-Phe88 peptide bond for activation and both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal truncation in the 65,000- and 57,000-Mr forms.

Standardized ileal digestible AA contents were 29.6 +/- 1.0, 5.7 +/- 0.3, 12.1 +/- 0.8, 16.8 +/- 1.0, 10.3 +/- 0.4, 5.3 +/- 0.3, 14.0 +/- 0.7, 9.4 +/- 0.5, 2.9 +/- 0.2, and 13.8 +/- 0.8 g/kg of dry FSM for Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, and Val, respectively. In Exp. 3, the AD of P and the effects of phytase inclusion on P availability were determined. Five groups of 8 barrows (initial BW, 45 +/- 4 kg) were fed a 300 g of FSM/kg semi-synthetic diet with increasing concentrations of exogenous phytase [0, 575, 1,185, 2,400 and 2,570 phytase units (FTU)/kg]. The AD of P increased from 21 to 61% (P < 0.001). Broken-line analysis estimated the optimal phytase inclusion rate to be 1,415 FTU/kg of diet. Growth performance and carcass fatty acid (FA) profiles of pigs fed FSM were determined in Exp. 4. Two hundred pigs (100 barrows and 100 gilts; initial BW, 32 +/- 4 kg), blocked by sex, were housed in groups of 5 pigs per pen and fed 1 of 4 diets containing 0, 50, 100, or 150 g of FSM/kg. Six market pigs per diet were selected for carcass FA analysis. The ADG, ADFI, and G:F were not affected by dietary FSM (P > 0.05). Increasing FSM in the diet from 0 to 150 g of FSM/kg increased the alpha-linolenic acid content from 11.1 +/- 0.2 to 47.4 +/- 1.2 mg/g of backfat (P < 0.001) and from 5.0 +/- 0.1 to 10.1 +/- 0.6 mg/g of loin tissue (P < 0.001). Flaxseed meal despite its deficiency in lysine can be included up to 150 g/kg of diets for swine and will contribute to the enrichment of the carcass with n-3 fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18558627>Phosphoproteome analysis of isoflurane-protected heart : phosphorylation of adenine nucleotide translocator-1 on Tyr194 regulates mitochondrial function.</a></h2><p>Reversible phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins is essential in the regulation of respiratory function, energy metabolism, and mitochondrion-mediated cell death. We hypothesized that mitochondrial protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in cardioprotection during pre and postconditioning, two of the most efficient anti-ischaemic therapies.Using phosphoproteomic approaches, we investigated the profiles of phosphorylated proteins in Wistar rat heart  protected by pharmacological pre and postconditioning elicited by isoflurane. Sixty-one spots were detected by two-dimensional blue-native gel electrophoresis-coupled Western blotting using a phospho-Ser//Tyr-specific antibody, and 45 of these spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Eleven protein spots related to oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, chaperone, and carrier functions exhibited significant changes in their phosphorylation state when protected  were compared with unprotected. Using a phosphopeptide enrichment protocol followed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS, 26 potential phosphorylation sites were identified in 19 proteins. Among these, a novel phosphorylation site was detected in adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT1) at residue Tyr(194). Changes in ANT phosphorylation between protected and unprotected  were confirmed by immunoprecipitation. The biological significance of ANT phosphorylation at Tyr(194) was further tested with site-directed mutagenesis in yeast. Substitution of Tyr(194) with , mimicking the non-phosphorylated state, resulted in the inhibition of yeast growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, implying a critical role of phosphorylation at this residue in regulating ANT function and cellular respiration.Our analysis emphasizes the regulatory functions of the phosphoproteome in heart  and reveals a novel, potential link between bioenergetics and cardioprotection.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25640585>Design and synthesis of new substrates of HtrA2 protease.</a></h2><p>HtrA2 belongs to the HtrA (high temperature requirement A) family of ATP-independent serine proteases.

The information pointed to a putative mature RPCH octapeptide in D. pulex with the primary sequence of pGlu-Val-Asn--Ser--Ser-Trp amide (=Dappu-RPCH). Since Panbo-RPCH is endogenous in decapod crustaceans and in the green stink bug Nezara viridula, we assayed Dappu-RPCH in the shrimp Palaemon pacificus and in N. viridula. Here we show that this variant member of the AKH/RPCH family has no activity to concentrate the red, brown, yellow and blue pigments in the epithelium of the shrimp at physiological doses but is effective in mobilising lipids in the green stink bug N. viridula. Moreover, since Panbo-RPCH and Dappu-RPCH differ structurally at three positions, viz. Leu(2) to Val(2); Pro(6) to (6); Gly(7) to Ser(7), we tested other members of the peptide family which have single or dual amino acid substitutions at the appropriate positions, for their chromatophorotropic action at physiological doses. These studies show unequivocally that a single change from Gly(7) to Ser(7) (as in the peptide Corpu-AKH) does not inflict any loss of biological activity, and the same is true for a single change from Pro(6) to (6) (represented by the peptide Schgr-AKH-II). The change from Leu(2) to Val(2) (embodied in Manto-CC), however, is accompanied with a substantial loss of chromatophorotropic activity; combinations of Val(2) and Ser(7) (as in Anaim-AKH) or Val(2) and (6) (as in Grybi-AKH) result in almost complete loss of biological activity.

Immunoactive peptides derived from food proteins could exert immunomodulatory activity without side effects. Paphia undulata with high-protein is suitable for the production of immunoactive peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis parameters to maximize the immune activity of hydrolysates from Paphia undulata.Hydrolysis parameters, including temperature, time and the ratio of alkaline protease to Paphia undulata meat (E/S), were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: temperature, 51 °C; time, 3.14 h; E/S, 4,321 U g(-1) (Paphia undulata meat). Furthermore, hydrolysates obtained under the optimum conditions were fractionated by ultrafiltration and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. After two-step isolation, the isolated fractions (P2 and P3) including the peptides Pro-His--Cys, Val-Gly-Try-, Glu-, Leu-, and Glu-Gly-Ala-Lys, Trp-Ile or Trp-Leu, respectively, could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation ability.These results showed that response surface methodology and two-step separation were efficient for recovery of low-molecular- peptides with high spleen lymphocyte proliferation activity, and the isolated fractions of Paphia undulata hydrolysates are potential ingredients for development of functional foods.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10213505>Inhibition of PC-3 human androgen-independent prostate cancer and its metastases by cytotoxic somatostatin analogue AN-238.</a></h2><p>We evaluated whether AN-238, the cytotoxic analogue of somatostatin (SST) consisting of the radical 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (AN-201) linked covalently to the SST octapeptide carrier RC-121 (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys--NH2), could be used for targeting human primary and metastatic prostate carcinomas that express SST receptors (SSTRs). The antitumor activity and toxicity of AN-238 and its components were first characterized in nude mice bearing s.c. xenografts of PC-3 human androgen-independent prostate cancer. In experiment 1, AN-238 was injected once i.v. at 200 nmol/kg when the mean volume of s.c. tumors was about 30 mm3. Administration of AN-238 inhibited tumor growth, as shown by a 74% decrease in tumor volume and by a 71% reduction in tumor  after 7 weeks as compared with the control group. AN-201 at an equimolar dose did not show any antitumor activity. The mortality was 14.3% (one of seven mice) in the AN-238-treated group and 47% (three of seven mice) in mice that received AN-201. In experiment 2, two i.v. injections of AN-238 at 150 nmol/kg were given 10 days apart when the tumors measured 65-70 mm3. A significant inhibition of tumor volume (62.3%; P < 0.001) and tumor  (61.1%; P < 0.01) was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. AN-201, given alone at the same dose or coadministered with RC-121, had no significant effect on PC-3 tumors. The suppression of tumor growth induced by AN-238 was accompanied by a significant enhancement of apoptosis (P < 0.01). There were similar side effects in all treated groups, which included a transient loss of  and leukopenia. The effectiveness of AN-238 in a metastatic model was then investigated in animals implanted orthotopically with 2 x 10(6) PC-3 cells. Two i.v. injections of AN-238 or AN-201 at 150 nmol/kg were administered 10 days apart at 10 weeks after intraprostatic inoculation of PC-3 cells. After 4 weeks of treatment, the mean  of primary tumors in animals receiving AN-238 was 77% lower (P < 0.01) than that in controls. This reduction was also significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that in animals given AN-201, which showed only a 34% inhibition (nonsignificant versus controls). All control animals and four of six (67%) mice treated with AN-201 developed metastases in the lymph nodes; however, no lymphatic spread of cancer was found in the AN-238-treated group. Using reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we demonstrated the expression of SSTR2 and SSTR5 in intraprostatic tumors and their metastases in lymph nodes as well as in s.c. tumors.

The sera from 9 HP patients, 10 asymptomatic shimeji workers and 15 normal individuals were examined for shimeji specific IgG and IgA antibodies by ELISA using crude shimeji extract. Shimeji specific IgG- and IgA-antibodies were higher in sera from HP patients than in sera from control subjects. Crude shimeji spore extract was separated and purified by HPLC followed by SDS-PAGE, and their antigenic activity was studied by immunoblotting with a pool of sera from patients. Sera from all HP patients showed IgG and IgA antibody activities to 21, 16 and 14 kD proteins extracted from shimeji spore. The 21 kD protein contained internal peptide amino acid sequence of Gly-Gly--Val-Ile-Asn-Leu-Leu-Gly, Gln-Arg--Glu-Glu and Gln-Gly-Ile-Tyr.

The experimental design was a completely randomized one with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. The variables included P and Ca levels and phytase: P and Ca levels were: normal P-normal Ca [0.45% available P (Pa), 1.0% Ca], low P-normal Ca (0.35% Pa, 1.0% Ca), and low P-low Ca (0.35 Pa and 0.6% Ca); and phytase at 0 and 600 U/kg diet. Phytase supplementation increased  gain (P < 0.014) and feed intake (P < 0.004) at 19 d in male chickens; in females, phytase increased (P < 0.012) only  gain at 19 d. The low P-normal Ca diet reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake and  gain in both sexes at 7, 14, and 19 d, compared to the normal P-normal Ca diet; the reduction of Ca in the low P diet prevented the above depression, resulting in  gain and feed intake to a level comparable to that of the normal P-normal Ca diet. Microbial phytase supplementation had no effect (P < 0.065) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP or any AA except Met and  in male broiler chickens. In females, adding phytase increased the AID of all AA except Lys, Met, , and Pro. The low P-normal Ca diet reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of , Asp, and Ser in male chickens and reduced the AID of all the AA except Met and Pro in females compared to the normal P-normal Ca diet. The reduction of Ca in the low P diet prevented the depression of the AID of the AA caused by the low P-normal Ca diet, resulting in AID of AA having a level comparable to that of the normal P-normal Ca diet in both sexes. Phytase supplementation did not have any effect (P > 0.05) on apparent "fecal" digestibility (AFD) of CP or any of the AA in male chickens; however, in female chickens it increased the AFD of , Asp, Glu, and Ser. In summary, phytase supplementation increased growth performance in both sexes; increased AID and AFD of most of the AA, particularly in female chickens.

The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) is categorized as "orphan" CYP because of its unknown function. In recent studies it is found that this enzyme is expressed in neurovascular functions of the brain. Also, various studies have found the expression and activity of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 in cancer. It is found to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. However, three-dimensional structure, the active site topology and substrate specificity of CYP4X1 remain unclear.In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated by homology modeling using Modeller 9v8. The generated structure was accessed for geometrical errors and energy stability using PROCHECK, VERFIY 3D and PROSA. A molecular docking analysis was carried out against substrates arachidonic acid and anandamide and the docked substrates were predicted for drug-likeness, ADME-Tox parameters and biological spectrum activity.The three-dimensional model of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated and assessed with various structural validation programmes.

The association of CPE with  rafts in the trans -Golgi network and secretory granule membranes is necessary for its sorting receptor function. We now provide evidence that a domain within the C-terminal 25 residues of CPE functions as a signal for both raft association and the sorting of CPE to the regulated secretory pathway. A fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of the human interleukin-2 receptor Tac (N-Tac) and the C-terminal 25 amino acids of CPE was transfected into Neuro2A cells. This fusion protein floated in sucrose density gradients, indicating raft association, and co-localized with chromogranin A (CGA), a secretory granule marker. To define further a minimum sequence required for raft association and sorting, deletion mutants of CPE that lacked the C-terminal four or 15 residues (CPE-Delta4 and CPE-Delta15 respectively) were transfected into a clone of CPE-deficient Neuro2A cells. In contrast with full-length CPE, neither CPE-Delta4 nor CPE-Delta15 floated in sucrose density gradients. The sorting of both CPE-Delta4 and CPE-Delta15 to the regulated secretory pathway was impaired, as indicated by significantly increased basal secretion and a lack of response to stimulation. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the co-localization of mutant CPE immunofluorescence with CGA when compared with full-length CPE. Finally, the sorting of the prohormone POMC to the regulated pathway was impaired in cells transfected with either CPE-Delta4 or CPE-Delta15.

To complete the transmigration process, adherent PMNs must detach from epithelial monolayer surfaces to move forward. The mechanism that governs the detachment of adherent PMNs, however, is not clear. Here, we present evidence that cleavage of the CD11b extracellular domain containing the ligand-binding I-domain by 3 structural and functional related serine proteases (elastase, proteinase-3 and cathepsin G) serves as a novel mechanism for PMN detachment after the initial cell adhesion. Kinetic studies showed that the cleavage of CD11b is positively correlated with PMN detachment and subsequent transmigration. Moreover, the results demonstrated that elastase, proteinase-3 and cathepsin G all cleaved the purified, functionally active form of CD11b in a pattern similar to the CD11b shedding that occurs during PMN transmigration. Their cleavage sites on purified CD11b were located at (761)-Ala(762) (elastase/proteinase-3) and (760)-(761) (cathepsin G), respectively. CD11b cleavage and PMN detachment and chemotaxis, were impaired in elastase/cathepsin G-deficient Beige mice; this defect could be restored by the addition of extracellular elastase.

Glycation, the reaction of sugars with free amino groups of proteins, is one of a variety of non-enzymic post-translational modifications. The aim of the present study was to identify some of the most reactive proteins in the lens when incubated under physiological conditions. Fresh intact bovine lenses were incubated with [14C]glucose in a conventional tissue-culture medium with added antibiotics. After 3 and 6 days of incubation, the water-soluble proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions were separated by using a sugar affinity column (Affi-Gel 601). Then the radioactive fractions were identified on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the whole bovine lenses were incubated with 10 mM fructose and glucose for 3 and 6 days. The glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions in parallel with the radioactive fractions were separated by affinity chromatography, and were identified further by amino-acid sequencing. A progressive uptake of radioactive label showed that the majority of proteins incorporating both glucose and fructose were water-soluble fractions. Chromatography and SDS/polyacrylamide gel results showed that alpha- and gamma-crystallin and some proteins of a mean molecular mass of 36-37 kDa incorporated sugars early during incubation. After 6 days of incubation, more crystallins were glycated compared with 3 days, in particular beta-crystallin. Affinity-chromatography results indicated that proteins with subunit masses of 36 kDa and 20 kDa were possibly radiolabelled at an early stage. The purified glycated proteins following incubation with both glucose and fructose, which corresponded to 20 kDa and 36 kDa bands on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of both 20 kDa bands were Gly-Lys-Ile-, characteristic of gamma-crystallins, but the N-termini of both 36 kDa bands were blocked. Further sequencing after digestion of 36 kDa bands with trypsin and running on HPLC revealed that the glucose sample gave the peptide sequences as Gly-Glu-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln and Tyr-Glu-Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg, which match with bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin. The peptide sequence Tyr-Glu-Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg is only present in the published sequence of bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin and not in any other type of gamma-crystallin. The fructose sample gave the peptide sequences Ile---Tyr-Glu-Asp-Arg, Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Trp, Gln-Tyr-Leu-Leu-Arg and Val-Val-Asp-Leu-Tyr, which all matched with bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. The sequence Val-Val-Asp-Leu-Tyr only appears in the sequence of bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. gammaIII-Crystallin is the most susceptible lens protein to glycation. The primary target of glucose is gammaIIIb-crystallin, whereas that of fructose is gammaIIIa-crystallin. The early glycation of gammaIII-crystallin by glucose and fructose could result in structural alterations, leading to aggregation of crystallin and eventually cataract formation.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27980503>Stability of targeted metabolite profiles of urine samples under different storage conditions.</a></h2><p>Few studies have investigated the influence of storage conditions on urine samples and none of them used targeted mass spectrometry (MS).We investigated the stability of metabolite profiles in urine samples under different storage conditions using targeted metabolomics.Pooled, fasting urine samples were collected and stored at -80 °C (biobank standard), -20 °C (freezer), 4 °C (fridge), ~9 °C (cool pack), and ~20 °C (room temperature) for 0, 2, 8 and 24 h.

The growth rate and efficiency (grams of bacteria per gram of sugars) increased by 46 and 15%, respectively, when a mixture of 20 amino acids was added. On the other hand, neither growth rate nor efficiency increased when any one of these amino acids was added singly, except for Glu and Gln, each of which produced significant but small improvements. The stimulatory effect of the combined amino acids on bacterial growth declined when each of Leu, Trp, Tyr, Glu, Met, , and Val was removed from the original group of 20. When a mixture of only these seven amino acids was used as a supplement, their stimulatory effects on growth rate and efficiency were only 21 and 25%, respectively, of the effects that the mixture of 20 amino acids showed. The effects increased to 76 and 72% on growth rate and efficiency, respectively, when Gly, Cys, and His were supplied in addition to the seven amino acids.

The genotypic distributions of both g.3034 G>A and g.3467 T>C mutations were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, (P < 0.05), while the T3001C mutation was not (P > 0.05), based on χ(2) test analysis. The SNPs g.3001 C>T and g.3034 G>A are missense mutations (Ser/ and Ser/ respectively). Additionally, SNPs g.3034 G>A and g.3467 T>C showed a medium polymorphism level (0.25 < PIC< 0.50), whereas g.3001 C>T showed a low polymorphism level (PIC < 0.25).

In vitro studies demonstrated Kd values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist 64/natCu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist 64/natCu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas 64Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to >80% tumor blocking. 64Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient in vivo stability.

Structural analyses indicated that the primary structure of this peptide is formyl-Met--Asn-Ile-Arg-Lys-Ser-His-Pro-Leu-Met-Lys-Ile-Ile-Asn, which is identical to that of the N-terminal pentadecapeptide of porcine mitochondrial cytochrome b; we therefore named the newly isolated peptide "mitocryptide-2" (MCT-2), since we have recently purified and identified mitocryptide-1, a different class of a neutrophil-activating peptide. Synthetic MCT-2 and its human homolog hMCT-2 induced beta-hexosaminidase release in and chemotaxis of HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophilic/granulocytic cells. The induction of beta-hexosaminidase release, chemotaxis, and the increase in the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration by hMCT-2 were completely suppressed by pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of G(i)- or G(o)-type G proteins in the signaling pathways. Moreover, MCT-2 and hMCT-2 also stimulated beta-hexosaminidase secretion in human neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, these peptides partially competed with [(3)H]formyl-Met-Leu- binding to HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophilic/granulocytic cells, presenting the possibility that the receptor for MCT-2 and hMCT-2 is one of the formyl peptide receptors.

Biochemical characterization and increased muscle levels following either fasting or injection of endotoxin (ETX) suggest that the enzyme is likely cathepsin D. The wasting syndrome accompanying the tumor was measured by comparing the  of the skinned hind limb in treated and control animals. DBA/2 mice inoculated intraperitoneally with L1210 cells developed multiple solid tumors in the peritoneum and ascites; maximal tumor burden was reached by 16 days. There was a significant reduction in hind limb  (16 +/- 2%; mean +/- SE) and significant increase (31 +/- 8%) in muscle APA associated with the development of ascites and solid tumors. Plasma APA activity was substantially increased (240 +/- 33%), while liver and spleen APA were increased (10-20%) but not significantly. Chronic pepstatin administration, 30 mg.kg-1.day-1, for 7 days concurrent with the initiation of observable ascites and solid tumor formation (7 days post-inoculation), completely inhibited hind limb  loss and alleviated the tumor-dependent increase of APA in both plasma and muscle without altering tumor development.

We have therefore evaluated naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in rats after central infusion during 7 days of comparable antinociceptive doses of RB 38 A ((R,S)HONH-CO-CH2-CH(CH2C6H5)-CONH-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH), a mixed enkephalin catabolism blocker and of the selective mu, DAGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(Me)-Gly-ol) and delta, DSTBULET (Tyr-D-Ser(OtBu)-Gly--Leu-), opioid agonists. The responses were compared to those induced by RB 38 B ((S,S)HONH-CO-CH2-CH(CH2C6H5)-CONH-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH), a selective inhibitor of the 24.11 neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 'enkephalinase'. DAGO induced a severe withdrawal syndrome evidenced by a large  loss, hypothermia, jumping, mastication, teeth chattering, diarrhoea, lacrimation and salivation. In contrast, DSTBULET and RB 38 A produced only a moderate physical dependence. Only two signs were statistically different in these two groups: wet dog shakes and temperature. Chronic i.c.v. administration of DAGO, DSTBULET and RB 38 A produced a time-dependent reduction in analgesia, but 120 h after continuous infusion only RB 38 A was able to still induce a significative antinociceptive effect. The present data suggest that even in the drastic conditions used here long-term complete inhibition of enkephalin catabolism induces a weak tolerance and a moderate physical dependence, similar to that produced by delta opioid agonists. This effect was not observed after chronic selective inhibition of NEP by RB 38 B.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130500>Purification, characterization and application of a novel antimicrobial peptide from Andrias davidianus blood.</a></h2><p>The Andrias davidianus has been known as a traditional Chinese medicine for a long time. Its blood is considered as a waste or by-product of the meat production industry. Although there are reports on isolation of the antimicrobial peptides from different resources, there are no reports of their isolation from A. davidianus blood. In this work, an antimicrobial peptide, andricin B, was isolated from the blood of A. davidianus by an innovative method in which the magnetic liposome adsorption was combined with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure, antimicrobial activity and safety of andricin B were further investigated. Amino acid sequence was determined by N-terminal sequencing and found to be Gly-Leu--Arg-Leu--Ser-Val-Ile-Lys. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and prediction of three-dimensional structure by bioinformatics software suggested the presence of a well-defined random coil conformation. Andricin B was found to be active against all bacteria tested in this study as well as some fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were in the range 8-64 μg ml . Moreover, the haemolytic testing also suggested that andricin B could be considered safe at the MICs. Finally, andricin B was shown to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in the cooked meat of A. davidianus. This study shows that andricin B is a promising novel antimicrobial peptide that may provide further insights towards the development of new drugs.This is the pioneer study on screening and isolation of antimicrobial peptide from the blood of Andrias davidianus. Here, we have developed a novel method by combining magnetic liposomes adsorption with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to purify and screen the antimicrobial peptides. From this screen, we identified a novel antimicrobial peptide which we name as andricin B. Andricin B is unique as it checks the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as few fungal species.© 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9687021>Isolation and characterization of an alanyl aminopeptidase from rat liver cytosol as a puromycin-sensitive enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase.</a></h2><p>Alanyl aminopeptidase (AAP-S) was purified to homogeneity from rat liver cytosol. The molecular  of the purified enzyme was calculated to be approximately 100,000 on Sephacryl S-200 HR and to be 90,000 on SDS-PAGE in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol. These findings suggested that the enzyme exists as a monomeric form in rat liver cytosol. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrates Ala-, Tyr- and Met-MCAs, and moderately hydrolyzed Arg-, Lys-, Leu-, - and Lys-Ala-MCAs at pHs ranging from 7.5to 8.0. The enzyme also hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order for k(cat)/Km values of AAP-S at the optimal pH (pH 7.5) was Lys->Met->Arg->Ala->Leu->->Tyr->Lys-Ala-MCAs. It was strongly inhibited by bestatin, leuhistin, actinonin, amastatin, 1, 10-phenanthroline, PCMBS, Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+, and puromycin. The amino acid sequence of the first 43 residues of the enzyme was determined as Pro1-Glu-Lys-Arg-Pro5--Glu-Arg-Leu-Pro10--Glu-Val-Ser-Pro 15-Ile-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Leu20-(Cys)-Leu-Lys-Pro-Asp25-Leu-Leu- Asp--Thr30--Glu-Gly-Lys-Leu35-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gln40 -Val-Arg-Gln-. This N-terminal amino acid sequence is almost identical with those of puromycin-sensitive enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidases in rat and human brains, and the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A. These findings suggest that the AAP-S from rat liver cytosol is a puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase.

The purified beta-1,3-glucan binding protein was homogenous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 100,000 Da and an isoelectric point of approximately 5.0. Amino acid analysis showed a very high similarity with the amino acid composition of beta-1,3-glucan binding proteins recently purified from two insects, the cockroach Blaberus craniifer and the silkworm Bombyx mori.

The purified enzyme was a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of about 210 kDa and an isoelectric point of pH 4.8. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was Glu--Gly-Asp-Lys-Arg-Ile-Glu--Ser-Tyr-Glu-Arg-Pro and showed no homology to the N-terminal regions of other amylopullulanases reported to date. The enzyme was able to attack specifically the alpha-1,6 linkages in pullulan to generate maltotriose as the major end product, as well as the alpha-1,4 linkages in amylose, amylopectin and glycogen to generate various oligosaccharides. The pH and temperature optima for the pullulanase and alpha-amylase activities were pH 9.5 and 50 degrees C and pH 8.5 and 50 degrees C respectively. Both activities were strongly inhibited by well characterized inhibitors, such as diethyl pyrocarbonate and N-bromosuccinimide. The pullulanase activity was specifically inactivated by Hg2+ ions, alpha-cyclodextrin and beta-cyclodextrin while the amylase activity was strongly inhibited by EDTA and EGTA, although inhibition could be reversed by Ca2+ ions.

Because persistent pain changes neural response to external stimulation, we hypothesized that the mechanisms of EA anti-hyperalgesia may be different in persistent pain than in health. Hyperalgesia, decreased paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus, was induced by subcutaneously injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paws of rats. Selective antagonists against μ (CTOP: D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen-ThrNH2, 6.25 nmol) and κ (Nor-BIN: nor-binaltorphimine, 10 nmol) opioid receptors were infused into the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) 10 min before a 30-min EA treatment at acupoint Huantiao (GB30) 1h 30 min post-CFA. PWL was measured before and 2.5 post-CFA. Both 10 Hz and 100 Hz EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia were blocked by intra-RVM μ, but not κ, receptor antagonists. Double immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that μ receptor-containing neurons were GABAnergic and that GABAa receptor-containing neurons were serotonergic in the RVM. The results demonstrated an involvement of RVM μ, but not κ, receptors in EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia. In summary, EA may induce release of endogenous endomorphins that activate μ opioid receptors in GABAnergic neurons to suppress the release of GABA. This removes the tonic inhibition of GABA on serotonergic neurons in the RVM, and activation of these serotonergic neurons inhibits pain. EA may be used as complementary treatment for inflammatory pain.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such an inhibitory effect is most reliably evoked when touch is applied to the skin ipsilateral and closest to nociceptive inputs. However, the mechanism of this inhibition is not completely elucidated. We aimed to clarify the types of cutaneous afferent fibers and spinal opioid receptors that contribute to antinociceptive effects of microcone touch.The present study comprised two experiments with urethane-anesthetized rats. In the first experiment, unitary activity of skin afferent fibers was recorded from the saphenous nerve, and responses to a 10-min touch using a microcone disc and a flat disc (control) were compared. Greater discharge rate during microcone touch was observed in low-threshold mechanoreceptive Aδ and C afferent units, whereas many Aβ afferents responded similarly to the two types of touch. In the second experiment, the effect of an intrathecal injection of opioid receptor antagonists on the inhibitory effects of microcone touch on heart rate responses to noxious heat stimulation was examined. The magnitude of the heart rate response was significantly reduced by microcone touch in rats that received saline or naltrindole (δ-opioid receptor antagonist) injections. However, such an inhibition was not observed in rats that received naloxone (non-selective opioid receptor antagonist) or -Cys-Tyr-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2 (CTOP; μ-opioid receptor antagonist) injections.Microcone touch induced greater responses of low-threshold mechanoreceptive Aδ and C afferent units than control touch. The antinociceptive effect of microcone touch was abolished by intrathecal injection of μ-opioid receptor antagonist. These results suggest that excitation of low-threshold mechanoreceptive Aδ and C afferents produces the release of endogenous μ-opioid ligands in the spinal cord, resulting in the inhibition of nociceptive transmission that contributes to somatocardiac reflexes.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3964263>Isolation and primary structure of a peptide from the corpora cardiaca of Heliothis zea with adipokinetic activity.</a></h2><p>An adipokinetic hormone was isolated from the corpora cardiaca of the corn ear worm moth, Heliothis zea, and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography.

The molecular mass was estimated as 50,000 Da and 52,000 Da for DI and DIII, respectively. Moreover, DIII was identified as a glycoprotein with a pI of 3.8, and DI was identified as a non-glycoprotein with a pI of 5.3. When comparing the ratio of the CMC-saccharifying activity and CMC-liquefying activity, DI exhibited a steep slope, characteristic of an endoglucanase, whereas DIII exhibited a low slope, characteristic of an exoglucanase. The substrate specificity of the purified enzymes revealed that DI efficiently hydrolyzed CMC as well as xylan, whereas DIII exhibited a high activity on microcrystalline celluloses, such as Sigmacells. A comparison of the hydrolysis patterns for pNP-glucosides (DP 2-5) using an HPLC analysis demonstrated that the halosidic bond 3 from the nonreducing end was the preferential cleavage site for DI, whereas bond 2, from which the cellobiose unit is split off, was the preferential cleavage site for DIII.

Each pig was previously fitted under anaesthesia with electromagnetic flow probes around the portal vein and the hepatic artery, and with permanent catheters in the portal vein, carotid artery, one hepatic vein and the duodenum. Each solution was infused for 1 h after a fasting period (18 h) and each pig received both solutions at 8 d intervals. The observation period lasted 8 h. For most AA (his, lys, , , arg, tyr, pro) the absorption rate after infusion of PEP was significantly higher than after that of AAL during the 1st hour, but the differences quickly disappeared. After 8 h, the only differences concerned his and tyr (PEP > AAL) and met, glu and asp (AAL > PEP). There was a large uptake of blood AA by gut-wall cells, higher after AAL infusion than after PEP infusion, particularly for branched-chain AA (BCAA). The absorption of ammonia-nitrogen after both infusions was equivalent to two-thirds of urea-N passing from blood to intestinal tissues and lumen. Glucose absorbed within 8 h represented only 76% (PEP) or 69% (AAL) of the infused amounts. The cumulative hepatic total AA (TAA) uptake increased from 13 to 27% of the infused amounts between the 1st and the 8th hour after PEP infusion, and from 8 to 31% after AAL infusion. Most essential AA were largely taken up by the liver, with the exception of met (PEP) and  and of BCAA, which were poorly retained for both solutions; there was a high uptake of ala and gly, and a release of asp, glu, and gln. Urea-N released by the liver within 8 h was equivalent to 23-25% absorbed amino-N and to around 1.5 times ammonia-N taken up by the liver within 8 h.

The glycosylated variant has been identified as a concanavalin A-binding glycoprotein. Its carbohydrate moiety has a molecular mass of about 1.3 kDa (5%  of the glycosylated allergen), based on mass spectrometry analysis. Enzymatic treatment of native Ole e I with the specific glycosidase PNGase F accounts for an oligosaccharide N-linked to the polypeptide chain. This treatment does not sensibly modify the secondary structure of the protein but diminishes the affinity of the allergen for specific IgE antibodies. Tryptic digestion of Ole e I reveals the presence of a single carbohydrate-containing peptide. This peptide was recognized by the sera of hypersensitive individuals.

Besides surgery, there are no curative treatments for NE cancers and their metastases, emphasizing the need for the development of other forms of therapy. In this study, multifunctional unimolecular micelles were developed for targeted NE cancer therapy. The unimolecular micelles were formed by multi-arm star amphiphilic block copolymer poly(amidoamine)-poly(valerolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated with KE108 peptide and Cy5 dye (abbreviated as PAMAM-PVL-PEG-KE108/Cy5). The unimolecular micelles with a spherical core-shell structure exhibited a uniform size distribution and excellent stability. The hydrophobic drug thailandepsin-A (TDP-A), a recently discovered HDAC inhibitor, was physically encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of the micelles. KE108 peptide, a somatostatin analog possessing high affinity for all five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR 1-5), commonly overexpressed in NE cancer cells, was used for the first time as an NE cancer targeting ligand. KE108 exhibited superior targeting abilities compared to other common somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide, in NE cancer cell lines. The in vitro assays demonstrated that the TDP-A-loaded, KE108-targeted micelles exhibited the best capabilities in suppressing NE cancer cell growth. Moreover, the in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging on NE-tumor-bearing nude mice showed that KE108-conjugated micelles exhibited the greatest tumor accumulation due to their passive targeting and active targeting capabilities.

Comparison of low- backbone structures of these peptides suggested unique conformations of the central /Ala(i)-D-Trp(i+1)-Lys(i+2)-(i+3) fragment characteristic for specific interactions of somatostatin with each of the five distinct subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). The conformations obtained were in good agreement with experimental data obtained earlier by NMR measurements and/or X-ray crystallography. The results help rationalize experimental observations on the specificity of binding of various somatostatin analogs with different subtypes of the SSTRs. They also serve as templates for the design of conformationally constrained non-peptide scaffolds that effectively and selectively interact with different subtypes of SSTRs. Such scaffolds can be convenient carriers of radiolabels and near-infrared labels in specific agents for imaging tumors expressing different SSTR subtypes.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25938568>Genetic diversity in oxytocin ligands and receptors in New World monkeys.</a></h2><p>Oxytocin (OXT) is an important neurohypophyseal hormone that influences wide spectrum of reproductive and social processes. Eutherian mammals possess a highly conserved sequence of OXT (Cys-Tyr-Ile-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Leu-Gly). However, in this study, we sequenced the coding region for OXT in 22 species covering all New World monkeys (NWM) genera and clades, and characterize five OXT variants, including consensus mammalian Leu(8)-OXT, major variant Pro(8)-OXT, and three previously unreported variants: Ala(8)-OXT, (8)-OXT, and (2)-OXT. Pro(8)-OXT shows clear structural and physicochemical differences from Leu(8)-OXT. We report multiple predicted amino acid substitutions in the G protein-coupled OXT receptor (OXTR), especially in the critical N-terminus, which is crucial for OXT recognition and binding. Genera with same Pro(8)-OXT tend to cluster together on a phylogenetic tree based on OXTR sequence, and we demonstrate significant coevolution between OXT and OXTR. NWM species are characterized by high incidence of social monogamy, and we document an association between OXTR phylogeny and social monogamy. Our results demonstrate remarkable genetic diversity in the NWM OXT/OXTR system, which can provide a foundation for molecular, pharmacological, and behavioral studies of the role of OXT signaling in regulating complex social phenotypes.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640846>Structural basis for enzymatic evolution from a dedicated ADP-ribosyl cyclase to a multifunctional NAD hydrolase.</a></h2><p>Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a universal calcium messenger molecule that regulates many physiological processes. The production and degradation of cADPR are catalyzed by a family of related enzymes, including the ADP-ribosyl cyclase from Aplysia california (ADPRAC) and CD38 from human. Although ADPRC and CD38 share a common evolutionary ancestor, their enzymatic functions toward NAD and cADPR homeostasis have evolved divergently. Thus, ADPRC can only generate cADPR from NAD (cyclase), whereas CD38, in contrast, has multiple activities, i.e. in cADPR production and degradation, as well as NAD hydrolysis (NADase). In this study, we determined a number of ADPRC and CD38 structures bound with various nucleotides. From these complexes, we elucidated the structural features required for the cyclization (cyclase) reaction of ADPRC and the NADase reaction of CD38. Using the structural approach in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, we identified -174 in ADPRC as a critical residue in directing the folding of the substrate during the cyclization reaction. Thus, a point mutation of -174 to glycine can turn ADPRC from a cyclase toward an NADase. The equivalent residue in CD38, -221, is shown to disfavor the cyclizing folding of the substrate, resulting in NADase being the dominant activity. The comprehensive structural comparison of CD38 and APDRC presented in this study thus provides insights into the structural determinants for the functional evolution from a cyclase to a hydrolase.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28046153>Energy content and amino acid digestibility of flaxseed expellers fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to determine the DE and ME as well as the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in flaxseed expellers fed to growing pigs. In Exp. 1, the DE and ME were determined using 66 crossbred growing pigs (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 54.2 ± 2.3 kg BW) fed 1 of 11 diets in a completely randomized design. The diets included a corn-soybean meal basal diet and 10 experimental diets containing 29.16% flaxseed expellers supplemented at the expense of corn and soybean meal. In Exp. 2, 11 growing pigs (35.5 ± 3.4 kg), fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum, were assigned to 6 × 11 Youden square design with 6 periods and 11 diets. The diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets containing 40% flaxseed expellers as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was used as an indigestible marker. There was considerable variation in the chemical composition among the 10 flaxseed expellers. The CV were greater than 10% for ether extract (EE), NDF, ADF, crude fiber, and Ca and ranged from 7 to 12% for the AA. On a DM basis, the DE and ME ranged from 2,786 to 3,730 and from 2,588 to 3,530 kcal/kg, respectively. The apparent total tract digestibility of GE ranged from 59.91 to 75.83% (mean = 70.92%). Ether extract, GE, and NDF were the best predictors to determine DE and ME. The best prediction equations were DE = -3,231 + (1.58 × GE) - (25.79 × % NDF) ( = 0.90) or DE = 4,189 + (56.78 × % EE) - (30.59 × % NDF) ( = 0.85) and ME = -2,968 + (1.47 × GE) - (24.82 × % NDF) ( = 0.85) or ME = 3,931 + (53.77 × % EE) - (29.31 × % NDF) ( = 0.82), respectively. In Exp. 2, there were significant differences in the AID and SID of CP and all AA with the exception of  ( < 0.05). The AID and SID of CP averaged 70.16 and 78.04%, respectively. For the indispensable AA, the AID and SID of  were the least, with average values of 70.70 and 76.68%, respectively. The digestibility of Arg and Met were the greatest, averaging over 88 and 91% for AID and SID, respectively. The AID and SID of Lys ranged from 66.10 to 81.82% (mean = 74.14%) and from 70.90 to 85.41% (mean = 78.13%), respectively. These results indicate that there is significant variability in chemical composition, energy content, and the SID and AID of CP and AA among the selected flaxseed expellers.

The three-dimensional structures of the peptides were determined using 1H-NMR spectroscopy. It was newly discovered that hydrogen bonding was formed between the amide proton of Ile in the IFM (IFM1488-1490) motif of the III-IV linker and the hydroxyl oxygen atom of the side chain of  located adjacent to the IFM motif. This hydrogen bonding characterizes the structure around the IFM motif. By calculating the solvent-accessible surface area of the peptide corresponding to the III-IV linker, it was found that a hydrophobic cluster was formed. The hydrophobic cluster stabilizes the structure of the IFM motif. Moreover, the solvent-accessible surface area of the IFM motif correlated with the sustained currents of the incompletely inactivated sodium channels. The free  of stabilization by hydrophobic interactions (delta G, -3.9 kcal mol-1), which is calculated from the solvent-accessible surface area for the IFM motif (195 A2), was in good agreement with that calculated for the equilibrium between the open and the inactivated states of the sodium channels (-4.1 kcal mol-1). The structure of the III-IV linker peptide in a phosphate buffer also formed a hydrophobic cluster, as well as in SDS micelles, although no hydrogen bonding was formed. This distinction results in the following conformational change in the IFM motif: in SDS micelles, the side chains of Ile and  in the IFM motif were directed to the hydrophobic cluster, whereas those in a phosphate buffer were directed opposite to the cluster and solvent exposed. The secondary structures of IIIS4-S5 and IVS4-S5, which are considered to form a receptor site, assumed alpha-helical conformations around the N-terminal half of the sequences. The residue A1329 in MPD3, which is considered to interact with F1489 of the IFM motif, was found to locate within the alpha-helix. A hydrophobic cluster was formed on one side of the helix of MP-D4, which also plays an important role in the inactivation. A new concept for the process of fast inactivation is presented. In response to the voltage-dependent activation and the movement of the S4 segments, the two hydrophobic clusters due to the IVS4-S5 and the III-IV linker interact with each other. This interaction increases the hydrophobicity around the IFM motif. The increased hydrophobicity causes the conformational switching of the IF1488-1489 residues to allow F1489 to interact with A1329 of IIIS4-S5 and/or with N1662 in IVS4-S5. As a consequence of this process, the inactivation gate closes.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592684>Molecular mechanism for opioid dichotomy: bidirectional effect of μ-opioid receptors on P2X₃ receptor currents in rat sensory neurones.</a></h2><p>Here, we describe a molecular switch associated with opioid receptors-linked signalling cascades that provides a dual opioid control over P2X3 purinoceptor in sensory neurones. Leu-enkephalin inhibited P2X3-mediated currents with IC50 ~10 nM in ~25% of small nociceptive rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones. In contrast, in neurones pretreated with pertussis toxin leu-enkephalin produced stable and significant increase of P2X3 currents. All effects of opioid were abolished by selective μ-opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2 (CTOP), nonselective inhibitor naloxone, and by PLC inhibitor U73122. Thus, we discovered a dual link between purinoceptors and μ-opioid receptors: the latter exert both inhibitory (pertussis toxin-sensitive) and stimulatory (pertussis toxin-insensitive) actions on P2X3 receptors through phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent . This dual opioid control of P2X3 receptors may provide a molecular explanation for dichotomy of opioid therapy.

This article focuses on our recent results on the catalytic site in the beta subunit, and the roles of alpha/beta subunit interaction and amino/carboxyl terminal interaction of the gamma subunit in  coupling. Extensive mutagenesis of the beta subunit revealed that beta Lys-155, beta -156, beta Glu-181 and beta Arg-182 are essential catalytic residues. beta Glu-185 is not absolutely essential, but a carboxyl residue may be necessary at this position. A pseudo-revertant analysis positioned beta Gly-172, beta Ser-174, beta Glu-192 and beta Val-198 in the proximity of beta Gly-149. The finding of the roles of beta Gly-149, beta Lys-155, and beta -156 emphasized the importance of the glycine-rich sequence (Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys-/Ser, E. coli beta residues between beta Gly-149 and beta -156) conserved in many nucleotide binding proteins. The A subunits of vacuolar type ATPases may have a similar catalytic mechanism because they have conserved glycine-rich and Gly-Glu-Arg (corresponding to beta Gly-180-beta Arg-182) sequences. The results of these mutational studies are consistent with the labeling of beta Lys-155 and beta Lys-201 with AP3-PL, and of beta Glu-192 with DCCD [15]. The DCCD-binding residue of a thermophilic Bacillus corresponds to beta Glu-181, an essential catalytic residue discussed above. The defective coupling of the beta Ser-174--> mutant was suppressed by the second mutation alpha Arg-296-->Cys, indicating the importance of alpha/beta interaction in  coupling. The gamma subunit, especially its amino/carboxyl interaction, seems to be essential for  coupling between catalysis and transport judging from studies on gamma Met-23-->Lys or Arg mutation and second-site mutations which suppressed the gamma Lys-23 mutation.

It is an approximately 140-kDa single-chain protein and has the following sequence of amino acid residues at the N terminus: Pro-Val-Asn-Ile-Asn-Asn--Asn-Tyr-Asn-Asp-Pro-Ile-Asn-Asn---Ile- Leu. Comparison of this amino acid sequence with those of the botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, and E showed 40 to 50% identical residues in comparable positions. The specific toxicity of the neurotoxin, approximately 2 x 10(6) 50% lethal doses for mice per mg of protein injected, was not enhanced significantly by mild trypsinization, although the protease cleaved the neurotoxin within a disulfide loop that generated at least two primary fragments, approximately 47 and approximately 86 kDa, that remained linked by an interchain disulfide.

All in all, the identification of these oxidation events in plastids revealed that several enzymes of the amino acid metabolism rapidly undergo cysteine oxidation upon oxidative stress.© 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2524482>Pig gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase.

(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3652-3656). The peptides labeled with radioactive PLP could be released from the gastric membrane vesicles quantitatively by chymotrypsin treatment, and two peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatographies. These peptides were not obtained from vesicles incubated with PLP in the presence of ATP. The sequences of the two peptides were NH2-Asn-Ser--Asn-Lys--COOH and NH2-Ser--Asn-Lys--COOH, exactly corresponding to residues 493-498 and 494-498, respectively, of pig gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase sequenced recently (Maeda, M., Ishizaki, J., and Futai, M.

NBCe1-A transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) is involved in forming part of the ion permeation pathway, and a missense mutation S427L in TM1 impairs ion transport, causing proximal renal tubular acidosis. In the present study, we examined the topology of NBCe1-A-TM1 in detail and its structural perturbation induced by S427L. We analyzed the N-terminal cytoplasmic region (Cys-389-Gln-424) of NBCe1-A-TM1 using the substituted cysteine scanning accessibility method combined with extensive chemical stripping, in situ chemical probing, and functional transport assays. NBCe1-A-TM1 was previously modeled on the anion exchanger 1 TM1 (AE1-TM1); however, our data demonstrated that the topology of AE1-TM1 differs significantly from NBCe1-A-TM1. Our findings revealed that NBCe1-A-TM1 is unusually long, consisting of 31 membrane-embedded amino acids (-412 to -442). The linker region (Arg-394-Pro-411) between the N terminus of TM1 and the cytoplasmic domain is minimally exposed to aqueous and is potentially folded in a helical structure that intimately interacts with the NBCe1-A cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, AE1-TM1 contains 25 amino acids connected to an aqueous-exposed cytoplasmic region. Based on our new NBCe1-A-TM1 model, Ser-427 resides in the middle of TM1. Leucine substitution at Ser-427 blocks the normal aqueous access to -442, Ala-435, and Lys-404, implying a significant alteration of NBCe1-TM1 orientation. Our study provides novel structural insights into the pathogenic mechanism of S427L in mediating proximal renal tubular acidosis.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23999161>Characterization of 2-(methylamino)alkanoic acid capacity to restrict blood-brain phenylalanine transport in Pah enu2 mice: preliminary findings.</a></h2><p>Our laboratory seeks a pharmacotherapeutic intervention for PKU that utilizes non-physiological amino acids (NPAAs) to block the accumulation of phenylalanine () in the brain. In previous studies (Vogel et al. 2013), methylation of the amino group of 2-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) provided an enhanced degree of selectivity for  restriction into the brain of Pah(enu2) mice in comparison to unmethylated AIB, leading to the hypothesis that 2-(methylamino)alkanoic acid analogs of AIB might represent targeted inhibitors of  accretion into the brain.Pah(enu2) and control mice were intraperitoneally administered (500-750 mg/kg , once daily; standard 19% protein diet) AIB, methyl AIB (MAIB), isovaline, and two MAIB analogs, 2-methyl-2-(methylamino)butanoic (MeVal) and 3-methyl-2-(methylamino)pentanoic (MePent) acids for one week, followed by brain and blood isolation for amino acid analyses using UPLC.In the brain, AIB significantly reduced  accretion in Pah(enu2) mice, while MeVal significantly improved glutamine and aspartic acids. Four of five test compounds improved brain threonine and arginine levels. AIB, MAIB and IsoVal significantly reduced blood , with no effect of any drug intervention on other sera amino acids.Further evaluation of AIB and the 2-(methylamino)alkanoic acids as inhibitors of brain  accumulation in Pah(enu2) mice is warranted, with more detailed evaluations of route of administration, combinatorial intervention, and detailed toxicity studies.© 2013.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10529239>Characterization of stromelysin 1 (MMP-3), matrilysin (MMP-7), and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) derived fibrin(ogen) fragments D-dimer and D-like monomer: NH2-terminal sequences of late-stage digest fragments.</a></h2><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) participate in physiological remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recently we determined that both fibrinogen (Fg) and cross-linked fibrin (XL-Fb) are substrates for selected MMPs. Specifically, XL-Fb clots were solubilized by MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) by cleavage at gamma Gly 404-Ala 405, resulting in a D-like monomer fragment. Similarly, MMP-7 (matrilysin) and MT1-MMP (membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase) solubilized XL-Fb clots. However, the molecular mass of fragment D-dimer, obtained after MMP-7 and MT1-MMP degradation of XL-Fb, is similar to that of fragment D-dimer from plasmin degradation ( approximately 186 kDa). In contrast, fragment D-like monomer, from MMP-3 degradation of both fibrinogen (Fg) and XL-Fb, is similar to fragment D from plasmin degradation of Fg ( approximately 94 kDa). Reduced chains from MMP-3, MMP-7, and MT1-MMP digests of Fg and XL-Fb were subjected to direct sequence analyses and D/D-dimer alpha-chain showed cleavage at both alpha Asp 97- 98 and alpha Asn 102-Asn 103. Degradation of the beta-chain resulted in microheterogeneity of cleavage sites at beta Asp 123-Leu 124, beta Asn 137-Val 138, and beta Glu 141-Tyr 142, whereas all three enzymes cleaved the gamma-chain at gamma  83-Leu 84. In both Fg and XL-Fb, several cleavage sites obtained by proteolysis with MMP-3, MMP-7, and MT1-MMP were found to be in very close proximity to those obtained by plasmin on these same substrates. That does not occur with other MMPs such as MMP-1, -2, and -9 and MT2-MMP. The degradation of XL-Fb by MMPs suggests both plasmin-dependent and independent mechanisms of fibrinolysis that might be relevant in , angiogenesis, arthritis, and atherosclerosis.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7747964>Identification and purification of a new staphylococcal enterotoxin, H.</a></h2><p>A staphylococcal enterotoxin which elicited an emetic response in monkeys but did not share antigenic determinants with any of the identified enterotoxins was identified and purified from Staphylococcus aureus FRI-569.

An additional experiment was conducted to determine effects on growth performance and blood characteristics of including SPC in diets fed to weanling pigs. In Exp. 1, a N-free diet and diets containing soybean meal, fish meal, or SPC ground to a mean particle size of 70, 180, or 700 μm as the only source of AA were fed to 6 barrows (initial BW: 12.90 ± 1.51 kg) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum. In Exp. 2, 36 barrows (13.70 ± 1.86 kg BW) were allotted to a randomized complete block design with 6 diets and 6 replicate pigs per diet. A corn-based diet and diets containing corn and soybean meal, fish meal, or SPC ground to the 3 particle sizes were used. In Exp. 3, 160 pigs (initial BW: 7.06 ± 1.07 kg) were allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 8 pens per treatment and 5 pigs per pen. Pigs were fed one of 4 diets during phase 1 (d 0 to 14 postweaning), and a common diet in phase 2 (d 14 to 28 postweaning). The 4 diets used in phase 1 included a control diet containing fish meal and spray-dried plasma protein, and diets in which fish meal, spray-dried plasma protein, or both fish meal and spray-dried plasma protein were replaced by SPC ground to 180 μm. Results of Exp. 1 indicated that the SID of His, Lys, and  tended ( < 0.10) to be greater in SPC ground to 180 μm than in soybean meal, and the SID of Arg, Ile, , and Trp was greater ( < 0.05) in SPC ground to 70 or 180 μm than in soybean meal. There were no differences in the DE and ME (DM-basis) among corn, soybean meal, fish meal, and SPC ground to 70, 180, or 700 μm. Results of Exp. 3 indicated that growth performance of pigs fed the 4 experimental diets in phase 1 was not different in phase 1, phase 2, or in the entire experiment.

Here, we explored and detected the most favorable adsorption conformation of cytochrome c on graphene by measuring the adsorption energy, the number of contact atoms, and the minimal distance between protein and surface. From the root mean square deviation of the protein backbone, the radius of gyration, and the proportion of secondary structure, it is revealed that cytochrome c does not deform significantly and the secondary structures are preserved to a large extent. The residues, Lys,  and  contribute significantly to the adsorption of cytochrome c to graphene. The long hydrophobic and flexible alkyl tail of Lys, the π-π stacking interaction between  and graphene, and the presence of abundant  constitute the driving force for the stable adsorption of cytochrome c on graphene. Cytochrome c is adsorbed to graphene with the group heme lying almost perpendicular to the graphene, and the distance between Fe atom and the graphene is 10.15 A, which is shorter than that between electron donor and receptor in many other biosystems.

Recently, the somatostatin analogue [Tyr3]octreotide (D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-(ol)) was derivatized with the chelator DOTA (tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic acid), enabling stable radiolabelling with both the high- beta particle-emitter yttrium-90 and the Auger electron-emitter indium-111. The thus produced radiolabelled compounds are promising for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.

We also demonstrated receptor-specific, time- and temperature-dependent internalization of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2)-positive rat pancreatic tumour cell lines. In this study we have investigated the effects of differences in the amount of injected peptide on tissue distribution of 111In-labelled [DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotide in normal, i.e. non-tumour-bearing, and CA20948 tumour-bearing rats. This was done in order to find the amount of peptide at which the highest uptake in target tissues is achieved, and thereby to increase the potential of radionuclide therapy while simultaneously ensuring the lowest possible radiotoxicity in normal organs. Uptake of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in sst2-positive organs showed different bell-shaped functions of the amount of injected peptide, being highest at 0.05 (adrenals), 0.05-0. 1 (pituitary and stomach) and 0.25 (pancreas) microg.

During fermentation, most of the fusion protein leaked out from the periplasm to the growth medium at a level of approximately 40 mg/liter. This level was notably low compared with similar products containing identical CH1, CL, and superantigen moieties, and the Fv framework was therefore engineered. Using hybrid molecules, the light chain was found to limit high expression levels. Substituting five residues in VL increased the level almost 15 times, exceeding 500 mg/liter in the growth medium. Here, the substitutions -10 --> Ser, -45 --> Lys, -77 --> Ser, and Leu-78 --> Val were most powerful. In addition, replacing four VH residues diminished cell lysis during fermentation. Thereby the product was preferentially located in the periplasm instead of the growth medium, and the total yield was more than 700 mg/liter.

The threshold of VPY, TAY, AAPY and GFP were 1.65 mmol/L, 1.76 mmol/L, 2.97 mmol/L and 6.26 mmol/L, respectively. The peptide TAY, VPY and AAPY had an umami-enhancement effect on the monosodium glutamate (MSG) + sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, their concentrations were 2.5 g/L, 5 g/L and 5 g/L, respectively, while GFP has no significant umami-enhancement effect in solution. In addition, the peptides have better taste than its composing amino acids, which indicates that the taste of peptide does not depend on its composing amino acids.Copyright © 2018.

In trial 1, 11 dietary treatments were fed from 1 to 18 d of age containing 1.20% digestible Lys. Diet 1 (23.2% CP) was formulated with DL-Met, L-Lys, and L- to contain 1.70 total Gly + Ser to digestible Lys ratio whereas diets 2 (23.4% CP) to 11 were formulated with additional Gly to contain 1.90 total Gly + Ser to digestible Lys ratio. Free AA were added sequentially in the order of limitation (L-Val, L-Ile, L-Arg, L-Trp, L-His, L-, and L-Leu) from diets 3 to 10 to decrease CP content from 22.6 to 18.8%, respectively.

Nitrogen excretion (mg/b/d) decreased (P < 0.001) by 14.1% when broilers were fed diet 4 compared with birds fed diet 2 from 15 to 16 d of age. Broilers fed diet 4 had lower (P = 0.011) plasma UA concentration than birds fed diet 2 at 18 d of age.

In order to identify the structural domain of factor XI that binds high Mr kininogen, CNBr-digested factor XI was passed over a 5F7 antibody affinity column. One of two CNBr peptides that bound to this 5F7 affinity column inhibited binding of 125I-factor XI to high Mr kininogen, as did intact factor XI. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate of an inhibitory peptide purified by high performance liquid chromatography revealed an Mr of 10,000-15,000. Gas-phase sequencing of this peptide revealed the following amino-terminal sequence: X-X-Val--Gln-Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-. These data together with the amino acid composition of the isolated peptide indicate that both the epitope recognized by antibody 5F7 and at least a portion of the high Mr kininogen binding site are contained within the amino-terminal portion of factor XI comprising residues Glu-1 through Met-102. Further cleavage of this peptide with o-iodosobenzoic acid at a tryptophanyl peptide bond revealed that an Mr 5,000 peptide (with the amino-terminal sequence Trp---Cys-Val-Leu) bound to a high Mr kininogen affinity column and inhibited binding of 125I-factor XI to high Mr kininogen. Finally, a synthetic peptide comprising residues -56 through Ser-86 inhibited 125I-factor XI binding to high Mr kininogen.

The results show that DHP's backbone helical regions and turns have average order parameters of S = 0.87 ± 0.03 and S = 0.76 ± 0.08, respectively. Furthermore, DHP is primarily a monomer in solution based on the overall tumbling correlation time τ is 9.49 ± 1.65 ns calculated using the prolate diffusion tensor model in the program relax.

Caution should be used when the model contains >4 fitting parameters. The program caver3.0 was used to identify tunnels inside DHP obtained from MD simulation snapshots that are consistent with the importance of the Xe binding site, which is located at the central intersection of the tunnels. These tunnels provide diffusion  for small ligands such as O, HO and HO to enter the distal pocket independently of the trajectory of substrates and inhibitors, both of which are aromatic molecules.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

All corn was yellow dent corn collected from different areas in China. In Exp. 1, 60 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 40.7 ± 3.5 kg BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 10 diets to determine the DE and ME of corns. Diets were formulated to contain 96.8% of 1 of the 10 corn samples and 3.2% of other microingredients. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 30.5 ± 2.3 kg) fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were assigned to a 6 × 11 Youden square design with 6 periods and 11 diets. Diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets formulated with 96.6% 1 of the 10 corns as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was added to each diet as an indigestible marker for calculating the AA digestibility. On a DM basis, the starch, ether extract (EE), CP, NDF, and ADF contents of corns averaged 74.05% (69.98 to 78.59%), 3.83% (2.04 to 4.73%), 9.63% (7.74 to 10.43%), 10.80% (10.27 to 11.46%), and 2.27% (2.03 to 2.57%), respectively. The CV of EE, CP, and ADF was 22.59, 8.22, and 8.21%, respectively. The DE and ME of corns averaged 4,087 and 3,981 kcal/kg, respectively, and ranged from 3,999 to 4,161 kcal/kg and from 3,898 to 4,067 kcal/kg, respectively. The DE and ME values were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the EE content. Optimal prediction equations of ME were ME = 940.35 + (0.72 × DE) + (21.88 × EE) (R2 = 0.94) or ME = 1,051.50 + (0.82 × DE) - (282.05 × ash) (R2 = 0.99). In Exp. 2, significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the SID of Arg, His, , Ala, Pro, Cys, and Tyr. The SID of Lys (average 73.79%), Met (average 87.32%), and  (average 80.06%) ranged from 61.45 to 78.47%, from 74.09 to 90.91%, and from 79.19 to 85.79%, respectively. The standardized ileal digestible Met was positively correlated (P < 0.01) with the Met and CP contents. The obtained prediction equations were standardized ileal digestible Met = 31.34 + (3.43 × CP) + (116.04 × Met) and standardized ileal digestible Met = 104.92 + (294.71 × Met) - (7.03 × NDF). In conclusion, sources had an effect on the energy values and ileal digestibility of most AA in corn. The ME can be predicted by the DE combined with either the EE or ash content. The AA concentrations and SID of AA in corn varied largely.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

Our hypothesis was that at a given level of milk protein output, p[EAA] would remain steady in response to increasing EAAduo until the EAA requirement was met, at which point p[EAA] would increase rapidly in response to greater duodenal flow of EAA until p[EAA] reached a plateau as other  processes degraded excess EAA to avoid toxicity. Thus, the requirement of each EAA would be fulfilled when p[EAA] increased rapidly. To investigate this hypothesis, we compiled a literature database that included 102 studies with 420 treatment means that reported p[EAA], dietary nutrient content, , and milk production. A second database was produced to validate relationships developed in the first database and included 32 studies with 98 treatment means. All relationships were evaluated as regression equations with study as a random factor. Breed, days in milk, , and milk protein production had no effect on the plasma concentration of any EAA. Other than metabolizable protein supply, nutritional content of the rations did not affect p[EAA]. Only p[Arg] was affected by parity, with primiparous cows having higher concentrations of Arg than older cows. No break points in the relationship between p[EAA] versus EAAduo were detected as either steep increases or plateaus. Plasma Arg, Ile, Lys, , and Val concentrations were best associated with their respective EAAduo as quadratic equations, whereas His, Leu, Met, and  were associated only linearly. Adding a quadratic term improved the adjusted R(2) or decreased the root mean square error marginally (<2.0%). Thus, we conclude that the main effect of EAAduo on p[EAA] is linear. Abomasal or duodenal infusions of Met, Lys, His, Lys+Met, and casein revealed that Met or Lys infused alone increased the plasma concentration of the infused EAA and lowered the concentration of other EAA, particularly His. Infusion of Lys+Met or His alone was associated with increases in concentrations of these EAA without affecting others. We conclude that over a wide range of protein intakes in lactating cows, plasma levels of EAA increase linearly with duodenal flow. No evidence was found that EAA requirements are reflected in blood plasma concentrations.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Within the local neuronal  of the amygdala, a population of inhibitory, intercalated neurons (ITCs) modulates the flow of information among various nuclei of amygdala, including the basal nucleus (BA) and the centromedial nucleus (CeM) of the amygdala. These ITCs have been shown to be important during fear extinction and are target of a variety of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here we provide evidence that the activation of μ-opioid receptors (MORs) by the specific agonist DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin) hyperpolarizes medially located ITCs (mITCs) in acute brain slices of mice. Moreover, we use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with local electrical stimulation or glutamate uncaging to analyze the effect of MOR activation on local microcircuits. We show that the GABAergic transmission between mITCs and CeM neurons is attenuated by DAMGO, whereas the glutamatergic transmission on CeM neurons and mITCs is unaffected. Furthermore, MOR activation induced by theta burst stimulation in BA suppresses plastic changes of feedforward inhibitory transmission onto CeM neurons as revealed by the MOR antagonist CTAP d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2. In summary, the mITCs constitute a target for the opioid system, and therefore, the activation of MOR in ITCs might play a central role in the modulation of the information processing between the basolateral complex of the amygdala and central nuclei of the amygdala.Copyright © 2015 Blaesse, Goedecke et al.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478310>Claudin-3 and claudin-5 protein folding and assembly into the tight junction are controlled by non-conserved residues in the transmembrane 3 (TM3) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) segments.</a></h2><p>The mechanism of tight junction (TJ) assembly and the structure of claudins (Cldn) that form the TJ strands are unclear. This limits the molecular understanding of paracellular barriers and strategies for drug delivery across tissue barriers. Cldn3 and Cldn5 are both common in the blood-brain barrier but form TJ strands with different ultrastructures. To identify the molecular determinants of folding and assembly of these classic claudins, Cldn3/Cldn5 chimeric mutants were generated and analyzed by cellular reconstitution of TJ strands, live cell confocal imaging, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. A comprehensive screening was performed on the basis of the rescue of mutants deficient for strand formation. Cldn3/Cldn5 residues in transmembrane segment 3, TM3 (Ala-127/Cys-128, Ser-136/Cys-137, Ser-138/-139), and the transition of TM3 to extracellular loop 2, ECL2 (-141/Ile-142) and ECL2 (Asn-148/Asp-149, Leu-150/-151, Arg-157/Tyr-158), were identified to be involved in claudin folding and/or assembly. Blue native PAGE and FRET assays revealed 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-resistant cis-dimerization for Cldn5 but not for Cldn3. This homophilic interaction was found to be stabilized by residues in TM3. The resulting subtype-specific cis-dimer is suggested to be a subunit of polymeric TJ strands and contributes to the specific ultrastructure of the TJ detected by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In particular, the Cldn5-like exoplasmic face-associated and particle-type strands were found to be related to cis-dimerization.

ACOT12, the primary acetyl-CoA thioesterase in the liver of human, mouse, and rat, is responsible for cleavage of the thioester bond within acetyl-CoA, producing acetate and coenzyme A for a range of cellular processes. The enzyme is regulated by ADP and ATP, which is believed to be mediated through the ligand-induced oligomerization of the thioesterase domains, whereby ATP induces active dimers and tetramers, whereas apo- and ADP-bound ACOT12 are monomeric and inactive. Here, using a range of structural and biophysical techniques, it is demonstrated that ACOT12 is a trimer rather than a tetramer and that neither ADP nor ATP exert their regulatory effects by altering the oligomeric status of the enzyme. Rather, the binding site and mechanism of ADP regulation have been determined to occur through two novel regulatory regions, one involving a large loop that links the thioesterase domains ((154)-(178)), defined here as RegLoop1, and a second region involving the C terminus of thioesterase domain 2 (Gln(304)-Gly(326)), designated RegLoop2. Mutagenesis confirmed that Arg(312) and Arg(313) are crucial for this mode of regulation, and novel interactions with the START domain are presented together with insights into domain swapping within eukaryotic thioesterases for substrate recognition. In summary, these experiments provide the first structural insights into the regulation of this enzyme family, revealing an alternate hypothesis likely to be conserved throughout evolution.© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903647>The Production and Utilization of GDP-glucose in the Biosynthesis of Trehalose 6-Phosphate by Streptomyces venezuelae.</a></h2><p>Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase OtsA from streptomycetes is unusual in that it uses GDP-glucose as the donor substrate rather than the more commonly used UDP-glucose. We now confirm that OtsA from Streptomyces venezuelae has such a preference for GDP-glucose and can utilize ADP-glucose to some extent too. A crystal structure of the enzyme shows that it shares twin Rossmann-like domains with the UDP-glucose-specific OtsA from Escherichia coli However, it is structurally more similar to Streptomyces hygroscopicus VldE, a GDP-valienol-dependent pseudoglycosyltransferase enzyme. Comparison of the donor binding sites reveals that the amino acids associated with the binding of diphosphoribose are almost all identical in these three enzymes. By contrast, the amino acids associated with binding guanine in VldE (Asn, , and Val) are similar in S. venezuelae OtsA (Asp, Ser, and , respectively) but not conserved in E. coli OtsA (His, Leu, and Asp, respectively), providing a rationale for the purine base specificity of S. venezuelae OtsA. To establish which donor is used in vivo, we generated an otsA null mutant in S. venezuelae The mutant had a cell density-dependent growth phenotype and accumulated galactose 1-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, and GDP-glucose when grown on galactose. To determine how the GDP-glucose is generated, we characterized three candidate GDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases. SVEN_3027 is a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, SVEN_3972 is an unusual ITP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, and SVEN_2781 is a pyrophosphorylase that is capable of generating GDP-glucose as well as GDP-mannose. We have therefore established how S. venezuelae can make and utilize GDP-glucose in the biosynthesis of trehalose 6-phosphate.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7764275>Structure determination of N-terminal-blocked peptide from hog kidney aldose 1-epimerase by tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The blocked-N-terminal structure of hog kidney aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase, EC 5.1.3.3) was determined to be Ac-Val-Ser-Val--Arg-Ser-Val--Gly-Asp... by a coupling of conventional methods (enzymatic digestion, amino acid analysis, and Edman sequencing) and tandem mass spectrometry.

The complex of metabolic derangements of protein in cancer patients may be reflected by alteration in the plasma free amino acid profile. In this study, we try to investigate the plasma free amino acid profile in patients with colorectal cancer and liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, which are the most common cancers in Taiwan.Fasting venous blood samples were drawn from sixteen control volunteers and 42 cancer-bearing patients including 14 early stage colorectal cancer patients (Duke A and B), 18 late stage ones (Duke C and D) and 10 liver cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Seventeen amino acid levels were measured using a Beckman amino acid analyzer.About one third of early or late colorectal cancer patients had  loss more than 10% in half a year and were defined as malnourished. For individual amino acids, in early colorectal cancer patients, the plasma level of most essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids decreased (significantly in Tyr, Ala, Met,  and ). In late stage colorectal cancer patients and patients with liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma levels of most essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids decreased more obviously. For group amino acids, the plasma levels of essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, gluconeogenic amino acids and branched-chain amino acids were also lower in the cancer patients than those in control volunteers. The difference was also noticeably significant in patients with late stage colorectal cancer and liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. The plasma free amino acid patterns in colorectal cancer patients are quite different from those in patients with non-gastrointestinal cancer and  loss. The plasma level of essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids was not kept within normal range in colorectal cancer patients. Elevation of plasma aromatic amino acids and methionine levels usually observed in liver cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma was not apparent in our cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.The plasma free amino acid patterns in our colorectal cancer patients and cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were rather characteristic.

The deduced amino acid sequence of Syrian hamster PrPC identifies two potential sites for the addition of Asn-linked carbohydrates at amino acids 181-183 (Asn-Ile-) and 197-199 (Asn--). We have altered these sites by replacing the threonine residues with alanine and expressed the mutant proteins transiently in CV1 cells utilizing a mutagenesis vector with the T7 promoter located upstream from the PrP gene. The T7 RNA polymerase was supplied by infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus. The 3 mutant proteins (PrPAla183, PrPAla199 and PrPAla183/199) have a reduced relative molecular  compared to wild-type (wt) PrP. Deglycosylation as well as synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin reduced the relative molecular  of all the PrP species to that of the double mutant PrPAla183/199. Our results indicate that both single-site mutant prion proteins are glycosylated at non-mutated sites and they suggest that both potential sites for Asn-linked glycosylation are utilized in wt PrPC. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that while wt PrPC localizes to the cell surface, all the mutant PrP molecules accumulate intracellularly. The site of accumulation of PrPAla183 is probably prior to the mid-Golgi stack since this protein does not acquire resistance to endoglycosidase H.

Contribution of endogenous enkephalins to the enhanced analgesic effects of supraspinal mu opioid receptor agonists after inflammatory injury. J. Neurosci. 21, 2536-2545]. It also increases levels of endogenous opioids that act at MOPr elsewhere in the CNS [Zangen, A., Herzberg, U., Vogel, Z., Yadid, G., 1998. Nociceptive stimulus induces release of endogenous beta-endorphin in the rat brain. Neuroscience 85, 659-662]. This study tested the hypothesis that a sustained release of endogenous opioids leads to a downregulation of MOPr in the locus coeruleus (LC) and induces a state of endogenous opioid tolerance. Four days after injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the left hindpaw of the rat, both the magnitude and duration of the antinociception produced by microinjection of DAMGO in the right LC were reduced. Saturation isotherms demonstrated a 50% decrease in MOPr B(max) in homogenates of the LC from CFA-treated rats; K(d) was unchanged. Receptor autoradiography revealed that this decrease was bilateral. The decreased efficacy of DAMGO in CFA-treated rats most likely results from a decreased number of MOPr in the LC. Microinjection of the MOPr antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP) in the LC did not exacerbate hyperalgesia in the ipsilateral hindpaw or produce hyperalgesia in the contralateral hindpaw of CFA-treated rats. The downregulation in MOPr is therefore unlikely to result from the induction of endogenous opioid tolerance in the LC.

Based on the triplet puzzle theory, it has been discovered that opioid receptors are structurally more closely related to chemokine receptors than to other class A G-protein-coupled receptors. Their similarity is established in terms of the number of triplet homologies Asn-Leu-Ala, -Leu-Pro, and Tyr-Ala- in the amino acid code of extensive numbers of members of these two receptor groups. Such widespread similarities probably mean that many opioid and chemokine receptor subtypes utilize some of these mutual triplets to form heteromers.

Experiments using amino-acid-substituted peptides indicated that the residues (52)-(53)-Lys(54)-Lys(55) are required for the activity. Peptide Leu(49)-(76) induced the release of calcein trapped inside the vesicles whose lipid composition resembles that of E. coli membrane, suggesting that peptide Leu(49)-(76) can destabilize the E. coli membrane. CD measurements showed that the alpha-helicity of peptide Leu(49)-(76) increased from 3.5 to 36% by addition of the vesicles.

Another agonist, TRC4-neurokinin A, binds to both wild-type and mutant receptors in a single fast step, with similar affinities and kinetics and promotes only calcium signaling. Kinetic modeling of ligand binding and receptor interconversions is carried out to analyze phenotypic changes in terms of binding alterations or changes in the transitions between conformational states.

This first part of a series of reports addresses the physicochemical basis of oxidation-induced UPE in the skin, with a special focus on the contribution of amino acid oxidation.UPE of biological samples and protein/amino acid solutions following oxidation with H(2)O(2) in the presence of Fe(2+) was recorded using a sensitive photomultiplier system. Signals were analyzed with regard to overall signal intensity and spectral distribution.Increasing concentrations of H(2)O(2) in aqueous bovine serum albumin solutions induced linearly correlated UPE and protein carbonyl compounds, with a substantially higher sensitivity for the measurement of UPE. In single amino acid solutions, strong UPE signals were generated by oxidation from , Trp, His, and Cys, and weak signals from Lys and . Analysis of reaction products by MS revealed high oxidative material turnover for Cys and His, whereas barely detectable oxidative material turnover seems to be sufficient to generate a UPE signal of similar strength from Trp and . Combination of different amino acids did not result in a simple addition of individual oxidation-induced UPE signals, but in interactions ranging from antagonism to clear synergism. Synergism was evident between Trp- and UPE-generating amino acids such as , Cys, and His, with the strongest synergism by far observed between Trp and His. The strikingly different individual UPE spectra of His and Trp, despite being of comparable overall strength, were congruent with a pure Trp UPE spectrum after combining His with Trp in solution, indicating  transfer between both amino acids. Combination of Trp and DNA, which also gives UPE signals following oxidation, did not result in a synergistically enhanced or antagonized overall UPE signal, but in a simple addition of individual UPE signals.Measurement of UPE could be proven to be a highly sensitive method to assess oxidative processes in biological molecules. The reported data indicate that UPE generated by oxidation stressed skin is mainly due to non-fluorescent photon emission via Trp, whereby Trp acts as an  receptor from other excited species of oxidation-modified amino acids.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28201818>Collective repacking reveals that the structures of protein cores are uniquely specified by steric repulsive interactions.</a></h2><p>Protein core repacking is a standard test of protein modeling software. A recent study of six different modeling software packages showed that they are more successful at predicting side chain conformations of core compared to surface residues. All the modeling software tested have multicomponent  functions, typically including contributions from solvation, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding and Lennard-Jones interactions in addition to statistical terms based on observed protein structures. We investigated to what extent a simplified  function that includes only stereochemical constraints and repulsive hard-sphere interactions can correctly repack protein cores. For single residue and collective repacking, the hard-sphere model accurately recapitulates the observed side chain conformations for Ile, Leu, , , Trp, Tyr and Val. This result shows that there are no alternative, sterically allowed side chain conformations of core residues. Analysis of the same set of protein cores using the Rosetta software suite revealed that the hard-sphere model and Rosetta perform equally well on Ile, Leu, ,  and Val; the hard-sphere model performs better on Trp and Tyr and Rosetta performs better on Ser. We conclude that the high prediction accuracy in protein cores obtained by protein modeling software and our simplified hard-sphere approach reflects the high density of protein cores and dominance of steric repulsion.© The Author 2017.

Its activity was inhibited completely by 10(-5) M L-trans-epoxysuccinylleucylamido(4-guanidino) butane (E-64) and 1 mM iodoacetamide (IAA), but by only 53% using the specific cathepsin L inhibitor, Z---CHN2 (5 x 10(-5) M). Partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was Leu-Pro-Asp-Ser-Val-Asn-Trp-Arg-Glu-Gly-Ala-Val--Ala-Val which showed 80% homology to human cathepsin S. Immunoblot analysis showed that sera from infected patients exhibited IgE antibody reaction. It is proposed that cleavage of immunoglobulin by an excreted-secreted, cathepsin S-like, allergenic protease is a mechanism of immune evasion used by the sparganum.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9676240>Extracellular alpha-amylase from Thermus filiformis Ork A2: purification and biochemical characterization.</a></h2><p>An extracellular alpha-amylase produced by the thermophilic bacterium Thermus filiformis Ork A2 was purified from cell-free culture supernatant by ion exchange chromatography. The molecular mass was estimated to be 60,000 Da by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was rich in both basic and hydrophobic amino acids, presenting the following NH2-terminal amino acid sequence: -Ala-Asp-Leu-Ile-Val-Lys-Ile-Asn-. Amylolytic activity on soluble starch was optimal at pH 5.5-6.0 and 95 degrees C, and the enzyme was stable in the pH range of 4.0-8.0. Calcium enhanced thermostability at temperatures above 80 degrees C, increasing the half-life of activity to more than 8 h at 85 degrees C, 80 min at 90 degrees C, and 19 min at 95 degrees C. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited amylase activity, the inhibition being reversed by the addition of calcium or strontium ions. The alpha-amylase was also inhibited by copper and mercuric ions, and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, the latter being reversed in the presence of dithiothreitol. Dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol activated the enzyme. The alpha-amylase exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics for starch, with a K(m) of 5.0 mg.ml-1 and kcat/K(m) of 5.2 x 10(5) ml.mg-1s-1. Similar values were obtained for amylose, amylopectin, and glycogen. The hydrolysis pattern was similar for maltooligosaccharides and polysaccharides, with maltose being the major hydrolysis product. Glucose and maltotriose were generated as secondary products, although glucose was produced in high levels after a 6-h digestion. To our knowledge this is the first report of the characterization of an alpha-amylase from a strain of the genus Thermus.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485983>Increased N-glycosylation efficiency by generation of an aromatic sequon on N135 of antithrombin.</a></h2><p>The inefficient glycosylation of consensus sequence on N135 in antithrombin explains the two glycoforms of this key anticoagulant serpin found in plasma: α and β, with four and three N-glycans, respectively. The lack of this N-glycan increases the heparin affinity of the β-glycoform. Recent studies have demonstrated that an aromatic sequon (-Y-Asn-X-) in reverse β-turns enhances N-glycosylation efficiency and stability of different proteins. We evaluated the effect of the aromatic sequon in this defective glycosylation site of antithrombin, despite of being located in a loop between the helix D and the strand 2A. We analyzed the biochemical and functional features of variants generated in a recombinant cell system (HEK-EBNA). Cells transfected with wild-type plasmid (K133-Y-N135-X-S137) generated 50% of α and β-antithrombin. The S137T, as previously reported, K133F, and the double mutant (K133F/S137T) had improved glycosylation efficiency, leading to the secretion of α-antithrombin, as shown by electrophoretic and mass analysis. The presence of the aromatic sequon did not significantly affect the stability of this conformationally sensitive serpin, as revealed by thermal denaturation assay. Moreover, the aromatic sequon hindered the activation induced by heparin, in which is involved the helix D. Accordingly, K133F and particularly K133F/S137T mutants had a reduced anticoagulant activity. Our data support that aromatic sequons in a different structural context from reverse turns might also improve the efficiency of N-glycosylation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23164225>Milk protein responses in dairy cows to changes in postruminal supplies of arginine, isoleucine, and valine.</a></h2><p>An ideal profile of essential AA (EAA) can improve the efficiency of metabolizable protein (or PDIE, the equivalent in the INRA feeding system) utilization in dairy cows. Compared with other EAA, existing recommendations for the requirements of Arg, Ile, and Val are few and inconsistent. Four multiparous Holstein dairy cows at 22±6 wk of lactation received 4 treatments (duodenal infusions of 445±22.4 g/d of an EAA mixture complementing a low-protein diet in a 4×4 Latin square design with a period length of 1 wk). The control treatment provided a balanced supply (in % of PDIE) of 5.1% Arg, 5.2% Ile, and 5.9% Val, whereas in the 3 subsequent treatments of -Arg, -Ile, and -Val, the concentrations of these 3 EAA were reduced to 3.5, 4.1, and 4.5%, respectively. All treatments were made isonitrogenous and were balanced to provide 7 other EAA (Lys, Met, His, Leu, , , and Trp), according to the recommendations described in the literature. Combined, the diet and the infusions provided 14.3±0.1% crude protein on a dry matter basis, and 66.0±1.2 g of PDIE/Mcal of net  for lactation. Neither dry matter intake (19.2 kg/d) nor milk yield (30.4±0.4 kg/d) was affected by treatments. The -Arg and -Ile treatments did not modify milk protein synthesis or the efficiency of N utilization. However, the -Val treatment decreased milk protein content by 4.9% and milk crude protein content by 4.3%, and tended to decrease the efficiency of N use for milk protein yield by 3.7% (compared with the control). These effects of Val were related to a decrease in the plasma concentration of Val as well as a trend toward decreasing plasma concentrations of Met, His, and the sum of all EAA and nonessential AA in the -Val treatment, which indicates a different utilization of all AA in response to the Val deficit. The deletion of Ile, compared with the deletion of Val, tended to decrease the milk protein-to-fat ratio by 3.8%. In conclusion, the supply of Arg at 3.5% of PDIE was not limiting for milk protein synthesis. The slight effect on the milk protein-to-fat ratio caused by decreasing the supply of Ile suggests a need to reevaluate the Ile requirement more precisely. A low Val supply could be limiting for milk protein synthesis, provided that the requirements of Lys, Met, and His are met.Copyright © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

Nineteen stage III melanoma patients and 19 normal donors were studied for their responses to 810. All patients were immunized in vivo with an allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine. PBMC cytotoxicity was tested on autologous EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BCL) pulsed with 810 and autologous melanomas. Proliferative responses of PBMC to 810 were evaluated by using [3H]Tdr incorporation assays. Western blotting revealed that the 43-kDa protein was not specific to melanoma but was common to various cells. However, the percentage of cytotoxicity of PBMC against autologous 810-pulsed BCL was significantly greater in melanoma patients than in normal controls (p < 0.005). Cytotoxicity was increased after melanoma cell vaccine immunization in 15 patients (78%). Proliferative responses to 810 were observed only in melanoma patients and were enhanced in 12 patients (63%) after vaccination.

Recent studies identified gasdermin D (GSDMD) as an effector for pyroptosis downstream of the inflammasome signaling . Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases allows its N-terminal domain to associate with membrane lipids and form pores that induce pyroptotic cell death. Despite the important role of GSDMD in pyroptosis, the molecular mechanisms of GSDMD recognition and cleavage by inflammatory caspases that trigger pyroptosis are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the catalytic domains of inflammatory caspases can directly bind to both the full-length GSDMD and its cleavage site peptide, FLTD. A GSDMD-derived inhibitor, -acetyl--Leu--Asp-chloromethylketone (Ac-FLTD-CMK), inhibits GSDMD cleavage by caspases-1, -4, -5, and -11 in vitro, suppresses pyroptosis downstream of both canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes, as well as reduces IL-1β release following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. By contrast, the inhibitor does not target caspase-3 or apoptotic cell death, suggesting that Ac-FLTD-CMK is a specific inhibitor for inflammatory caspases. Crystal structure of caspase-1 in complex with Ac-FLTD-CMK reveals extensive enzyme-inhibitor interactions involving both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Comparison with other caspase-1 structures demonstrates drastic conformational changes at the four active-site loops that assemble the catalytic groove. The present study not only contributes to our understanding of GSDMD recognition by inflammatory caspases but also reports a specific inhibitor for these caspases that can serve as a tool for investigating inflammasome signaling.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889653>Ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed extruded diets containing different protein sources.</a></h2><p>This study compared apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of macronutrients and amino acids in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed dry extruded diets. The control diet contained fish meal as the main protein source, while in the other diets 50% of the fish meal protein was replaced by not de-hulled solvent-extracted soybean meal, meat meal or bacterial protein meal. Ileal digestibility was obtained with animals modified with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA method). There were no significant differences in the average digestibility of CP, Lys, Trp, Val, Ala or Glu between IRA modified and intact animals. Average ileal digestibilities of His, , Asp, Cys, Gly, Hyp, Pro, Ser, starch and total carbohydrates (CHO) were significantly lower compared with total tract values. Average ileal digestibility of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , Tyr and crude  was significantly higher than total tract digestibility. Digestibility measured in IRA modified animals showed less variability compared with values from intact animals. There were significant differences among diets in ileal as well as total tract digestibility of orude protein, most amino acids, starch and CHO, and in ileal digestibility of crude . Ileal crude protein digestibility of the diets ranged from 81.0-86.4% and total tract digestibility from 82.5-86.4%. Ileal amino acid digestibilities ranged from 70.1 (Asp) to 93.3% (Arg) and total tract values ranged from 72.8 (Cys) to 92.2% (Arg). Both ileal and total tract digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids were significantly lower for diets containing meat meal or bacterial protein meal compared with the control fish meal-based diet and the diet with soybean meal. Although ileal digestibility may be more accurate than total tract digestibility in estimating the protein and amino acid supply in blue foxes, total tract digestibility may be acceptable because of numerically small differences between ileal and total tract digestibilities for protein and most amino acids. It was further concluded that ileal digestibilities of starch and CHO in the blue fox are lower than corresponding total tract digestibilities.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h2><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis.

In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, Lys, , Ser, Tau,  and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and Tyr) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied.

Here, we reflect on energetics and metabolic efficiency of  DSM 17395, a versatile heterotrophic roseobacter. Fourteen different substrates (5 sugars, 9 amino acids) and their degradation pathways were assessed for energetic efficiencies based on catabolic ATP yields, calculated from net-formed ATP and reducing equivalents. The latter were converted into ATP employing the most divergent coupling ratios (i.e., ions ATP) currently known for FF ATP synthases in heterotrophic bacteria. Catabolic ATP yields of the studied pathways in  varied ∼3-fold. Actual free  costs for ATP synthesis were estimated to 81.6 (3.3 ions ATP) or 104.2 (4.3 ions ATP) kJ per mol ATP, yielding an average thermodynamic efficiency of ∼37.7% or ∼29.5%. Growth performance (rates, yields) and carbon assimilation efficiency were determined for  growing in process-controlled bioreactors with ten different single substrates (Glc, Man, Nag, , Trp, His, Lys, , Val, or Leu) and with two defined substrate mixtures. Carbon assimilation efficiencies into biomass ranged from ∼28% to 61%, with His/Trp and /Leu yielding the lowest and highest levels. These efficiencies correlated with catabolic and ATP yields only to some extent. Substrate-specific metabolic demands and/or functions, as well as the composition of the substrate mixtures, apparently affected the energetic costs of growth. This includes energetic burden associated with, e.g., slow growth, stress, and/or production of tropodithietic acid. Heterotrophic members of the bacterioplankton serve the marine ecosystem by transforming organic matter, an activity that is governed by the bacterial growth efficiencies procurable under given environmental conditions. In marine ecology, this causal connection is accounted for by the concept of bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) that refers to the carbon assimilation efficiency within natural communities. The here studied marine bacterium  DSM 17395 is a copiotrophic representative of the globally abundant  group and the investigated 15 catabolic pathways are widespread among these marine heterotrophs. Combining pathway-specific catabolic ATP yields with in-depth quantitative physiological data could (i) provide a new baseline to study growth energetics and efficiency in further  group members and other copiotrophic marine bacteria in productive coastal ecosystems, and (ii) contribute to a better understanding of factors controlling BGE (incl. the additional energetic burden arising from widespread secondary metabolite formation) from laboratory studies with pure cultures.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2603803>Ornitho-kininogen and ornitho-kinin: isolation, characterization and chemical structure.</a></h2><p>Ornitho-kininogen was purified from chicken and duck blood plasmas by a two-stage method using chromatography on columns of S-alkylated papain-Cellulofine and DEAE-5PW. The isolated preparation from chicken plasma gave a single band on SDS-PAGE with or without 2-mercaptoethanol and on disc-PAGE. The molecular  of ornitho-kininogen was estimated as 74,000 on SDS-PAGE using the Ferguson plot method. Ornitho-kininogen was found to have the similar properties to those of mammalian high molecular  kininogen (HMWK), in terms of the amino acid composition, molecular , and susceptibility to plasma kallikrein. No kininogen corresponding to mammalian low molecular  kininogen (LMWK) and rat T-kininogen could be detected in chicken plasma. In fact, ornitho-kininogen was degraded rapidly by bovine plasma kallikrein, liberating a kinin. This kinin was isolated from the digest by reversed-phase HPLC. The primary structure of the isolated kinin was determined as Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly---Pro-Leu-Arg. The sequence of this peptide, named ornitho-kinin, was similar to that of bradykinin except for the substitution of -6 and Leu-8 for Ser-6 and -8. The isolated ornitho-kinin induced a contraction of chicken smooth muscle and had a strong hypotensive effect in the chicken. However, it did not contract the isolated rat uterus. It is suggested that this specificity difference is due to the replacement of -8 by Leu-8. The sequence of residues 1-30 of ornitho-kininogen exhibited 43% identity with that of bovine kininogen.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22273147>New lyophilized kit for rapid radiofluorination of peptides.</a></h2><p>Radiolabeling compounds with positron-emitting radionuclides often involves a time-consuming, customized process. Herein, we report a simple lyophilized kit formulation for labeling peptides with (18)F, based on the aluminum-fluoride procedure. The prototype kit contains IMP485, a NODA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetate)-MPAA (methyl phenylacetic acid)-di-HSG (histamine-succinyl-glycine) hapten-peptide, [NODA-MPAA-D-Lys(HSG)-D-Tyr-D-Lys(HSG)-NH(2)], used for pretargeting, but we also examined a similar kit formulation for a somatostatin-binding peptide [IMP466, NOTA-D--Cys--D-Trp-Lys--Cys-Throl] bearing a NOTA ligand to determine if the benefits of using a kit can be extended to other AlF-binding peptides. The NODA-MPAA ligand forms a single stable complex with (AlF)(2+) in high yields. In order to establish suitable conditions for a facile kit, the formulation was optimized for pH, peptide to Al(3+) ratio, bulking agent, radioprotectant, and the buffer. For optimal labeling, the kit was reconstituted with an aqueous solution of (18)F(-) and ethanol (1:1), heated at 100-110 °C for 15 min, and then simply and rapidly purified using one of two equally effective solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods. Al(18)F-IMP485 was isolated as a single isomer complex, in high yield (45-97%) and high specific activity (up to 223 GBq/μmol), within 20 min. The labeled product was stable in human serum at 37 °C for 4 h and in vivo, urine samples showed the intact product was eliminated. Tumor targeting of the Al(18)F-IMP485 in nude mice bearing human  xenografts pretargeted with an anti-CEACAM5 bispecific antibody showed very low uptake (0.06% ± 0.02 ID/g) in bone, further illustrating its stability. At 1 h, pretargeted animals had high Al(18)F-IMP485 tumor uptake (28.1% ± 4.5 ID/g), with ratios of 9 ± 4, 123 ± 38, 110 ± 43, and 120 ± 108 for kidney, liver, blood and bone, respectively. Tumor uptake remained high at 3 h postinjection, with increased tumor/nontumor ratios. The NOTA-somatostatin-binding peptide also was fluorinated with good yield and high specific activity in the same kit formulation. However, yields were somewhat lower than those achieved with IMP485 containing the NODA-MPAA ligand, likely reflecting this ligand's superior binding properties over the simple NOTA. These studies indicate that (18)F-labeled peptides can be reproducibly prepared as stable Al-F complexes with good radiochemical yield and high specific activity using a simple, one-step, lyophilized kit followed by a rapid purification by SPE that provides the (18)F-peptide ready for patient injection within 30 min.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308399>Effect of the duration of prefeeding on amino acid digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles in broiler chicken.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the duration of prefeeding on prececal amino acid (AA) digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in broilers. The experimental diets with DDGS at levels of 0, 10, and 20% were offered ad libitum for 7, 5, and 3 d, starting on 14, 16, and 18 d of age. Titanium dioxide was used as an indigestible marker. Six pens of 10 birds were allocated to each treatment. Digesta was sampled on a pen basis from the distal two-thirds of the intestine section between Meckel's diverticulum and 2 cm anterior to the ileo-ceca-colonic junction. Ingested and digested amounts of AA were determined for each pen. Digestibility of AA in the diets was not significantly affected by the duration of prefeeding but was significantly reduced by inclusion of DDGS. Digestibility of AA in DDGS was determined by using a linear regression approach. The digestibility of AA in DDGS ranged from 76% (Arg, 5 d of feeding) to 33% (Asp, 3 d of feeding). There was no significant effect of prefeeding time on AA digestibility of DDGS. Lysine digestibility of DDGS was 72%. The mean digestibility of the AA Arg, Cys, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , and Val of DDGS across the 3 prefeeding times was 66%.

Growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and third metacarpal bone characteristics were response variables. Weaned pigs (n = 56; 8.20 ± 0.5 kg initial BW; 28 d of age) were individually housed and randomly allotted to 1 of 7 diets for 21 d. The diets were 1) POC mash, 2) NC mash, 3) NC pelleted at 90°C, 4) NC mash + 500 U/kg U-phytase, 5) NC mash + 500 U/kg C-phytase, 6) NC + 500 U/kg C-phytase pelleted at 80°C, and 7) NC + 500 U/kg C-phytase pelleted at 90°C. The POC and NC diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and isolysinic. The content of Ca and available P was 1.01 and 0.40% and 0.83 and 0.22% in the POC and NC diets, respectively. Pig BW and feed intake were measured on d 7, 14, and 21, and feces were collected for 2 d. On d 21, pigs were killed and ileal digesta and the third metacarpal bone collected. Pigs fed POC had greater (P < 0.05) ADG, G:F, P digestibility, and bone mineralization but lower (P < 0.01)  digestibility than pigs fed NC. Pelleting the NC diet did not improve performance, nutrient digestibility, or P use. Adding the U-phytase to NC mash diet increased (P < 0.05) ADG, G:F, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP and Ile, Leu, , , Val, and Ser, and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P compared with pigs fed NC. Pigs fed C-phytase in NC mash diets had increased (P < 0.05) G:F and an AID of CP and AA and ATTD of P compared with pigs fed NC but not different than pigs fed U-phytase NC mash diets.

In order to understand the differences in pH optima and reaction rates of RNase A towards low molecular  substrates and polymer substrates, the subsite structure of bovine pancreatic RNase A was studied. The kinetic studies of various sizes of oligouridylic acids showed that the size of the subsite is three nucleotides long. The kinetic studies on the inhibition of pUp, X-ray crystallographies of RNase A-ApC and pTp complexes, 31P-NMR studies on the binding of RNase A-pAp, and pTp showed the presence of P0, P2 and B3 sites. The location of the P0 site was assigned to be Lys66 by X-ray crystallography of the RNase A-pTp complex. The location of the P2 and/or P3/B3 site was determined by studying the enzymatic activities of several S-peptide analogs in which N-Leu was substituted for Lys7 and/or Lys1 coupled with S-protein toward various chain lengths of oligouridylic acids. The experiment suggested that P2 is Lys7 and P3/B3 is Lys1. 2. Several new pyrimidine base specific RNases were isolated and their primary structures were determined. They were two non-secretory RNases, a bovine liver alkaline RNase, a bovine brain RNase, and a bullfrog liver RNase. The bovine brain RNase has extra 16 amino acids at the C-terminus with O-glycosylated Ser. The bullfrog liver RNase was an extremely heat-stable RNase so far known. 3. Two new RNases belonging to RNase T1 family were isolated and their primary structures were elucidated. They were RNases isolated from Aspergillus saitoi and a mushroom (hiratake). The former RNase has a similar structure to RNase T1, but it was a base non-specific and guanylic acid preferential enzyme. From the results of X-crystallographic studies of this RNase, we suggested that the mechanism of RNase T1 RNase is essentialy a general acid-base catalysis between His40 and Glu58. 4. We isolated several fungal, plant and animal base non-specific acid RNases with a molecular mass about 24 kDa or more, and elucidated their primary structures. These RNases contain two sequences containing common 7-8 amino acid residues in common which include most of the amino acid residues important for the catalysis. Therefore, we proposed to designate these RNases as RNase T2 family RNase. On the basis of chemical modifications, kinetic studies and protein engineering studies of RNase Rh from Rhizopus niveus and RNase M from A. saitoi, we assigned that the catalytic site of RNase Rh consists of His46, His104, His109, Glu105, and Lys108. In the mechanism we proposed for RNase Rh, His46 and His109 work as a general acid and base catalysts. His104 was a phosphate binding site, and Glu105 and Lys108 might work to polarize a P=O bond of the substrate or stabilize the pentacovalent intermediate. However, in the reverse reaction of the transfer reaction step and the hydrolysis step of RNase Rh, His109 and His46 work as an acid and base catalyst, respectively. The X-ray crystallographic studies of RNase Rh, an RNase Rh-2'-AMP or d(ApC)complex, and the protein engineering studies of several mutant enzymes assigned the components of the major base recognition site (B1 site) and the minor base recognition site (B2 sites) of RNase Rh. The enzymatic studies of several mutant enzymes indicated that (i) Asp51 is very crucial for adenine base recognition, and the replacement of Asp51 by other amino acid, such as , Ser, Glu, Asn makes RNase Rh more guanylic acid preferential, (ii) the replacement of Trp49 by , and Tyr57 by Trp make the enzyme more pyrimidine and purine bases preferential, respectively. These trials are the first example of marked artificial change in the base specificity of RNases.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062849>Immune system stimulation induced by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in starter pigs1.</a></h2><p>Changes in plasma free amino acid (AA) flux reflect the modification of AA  in different  states. Infectious diseases repartition AA away from protein retention toward processes involved in immune defense, thus impacting AA utilization in pigs. The current study sought to evaluate the effects of disease induced by a live pathogen on plasma free AA flux and whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization. Twenty gilts (BW 9.4 ± 0.9 kg) were surgically catheterized into the jugular vein, individually housed in  crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Intramuscular inoculation of a live field strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was used to induce disease. Whole-body N-balance was conducted across 3 d both before PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV-) and also after PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of a labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for measurement of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dietary N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood chemistry, hematology, body temperature, and serum viremia indicated that PRRSV induced effective immune response in pigs (P < 0.05). Challenge with PRRSV reduced the AID of N (P < 0.05), but had no effect on apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy (P = 0.12). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Met and  was increased by PRRSV infection (P < 0.05). A strong tendency of increased Val flux was observed in PRRSV+ pigs (P = 0.06). Infection with PRRSV increased the pool size for Lys, Met, , Trp, Leu, Val, and Gln (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PRRSV alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size, in growing pigs. The increase in  and Met flux in PRRSV+ pigs may be associated with enhanced utilization of these AA for the synthesis of immune system metabolites and increased catabolism of these AA. Thus, dietary Met, , and Val requirements may increase in pigs infected with PRRSV, relative to the requirements for other AA.© The Author(s) 2019.

An assay for this Leu- cleaving activity, based on the cleavage of the 14C-labeled substrate acetyl-Val--Leu--[epsilon-([14C]CH3)2]Lys-NHCH3, was used to examine the properties of this enzyme activity. beta-Endorphin-(1-31) competitively inhibited the Leu--cleaving enzyme activity on the pentapeptide substrate. Over 90% of activity was recovered in the cytosolic fraction. Leu--cleaving activity behaved like a thiol endopeptidase because it was inhibited by low concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, p-chloromercuribenzoyl sulfate, and low concentrations of Hg2+. Low concentrations of sulfhydryl compounds stimulated Leu--cleaving activity. The activity was optimal between pH 8.5 and 9.0. The Km of Leu--cleaving activity in the cytosolic fraction was 35 microM and in the particulate fraction 88 microM with Vmax values of 193 and 15 nmol mg protein-1 h-1, respectively. The apparent molecular mass of the Leu--cleaving enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be approximately 200 kilodaltons. These properties of Leu--cleaving activity indicate that the Leu--cleaving enzyme is distinct from any known brain endopeptidase.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147416>Decreased pain responses of C-C chemokine receptor 5 knockout mice to chemical or inflammatory stimuli.</a></h2><p>Chemokines are small chemotactic cytokines that elicit many physiological and pathological effects through binding to their corresponding receptors. Recent studies have suggested that C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 5 interacts with μ-opioid receptor and modifies a nociceptive reaction. We examined effects of CCR5 deficiency on pain responses by employing CCR5 knockout (KO) mice. We found that pain responses of CCR5 KO mice to chemical or  stimuli were milder than those of CCR5 wild type (WT) mice. However, there was no remarkable change in thermal nociception. To prove the involvement of CCR5 deletion in lowered nociception, we examined pain reactions with CCR5 WT mice following treatment of a CCR5 antagonist (D-Ala(1)-peptide T-NH(2,) DAPTA). Chemical or inflammatory pain behavior was significantly relieved by intracerebroventricular infusion of the inhibitor. When we assessed expression level of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the periaqueductal gray where the receptors are critical for analgesic effects, immunoreactivity of MOR was significantly higher in CCR5 KO mice than WT mice without change in phosphorylation level of the receptor. Reduced nociceptive responses in CCR5 KO mice were moderated by administration of naloxone and d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP), MOR antagonists. Our data indicate that CCR5 deficiency is related to up-regulation of MOR without an increase in the receptor desensitization which might result in increased analgesic effects against chemical or inflammatory stimuli. Alternatively, higher amount of opioid ligands in CCR5 mice might be linked to these results. Therefore, CCR5 appears to be a therapeutic target for treatment of pain related diseases such as inflammatory hyperalgesia.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Two forms of MGP were isolated from demineralization and urea extracts of bovine cortical bone, one 79 residues in length with the COOH terminus -Arg-Gln and the other 83 residues in length with the COOH terminus -Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala. The 84-residue form of bovine MGP predicted from the message structure could not be detected in the bone extracellular matrix extracts, and it therefore seems probable that the lysine at position 84 was removed by the action of a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme prior to secretion. A plausible sequence of proteolytic cleavages that could generate the 79-residue form of MGP would be a trypsin-like cleavage at Arg80-Arg81 or Arg81-Gly82 followed by carboxypeptidase B-like cleavage to remove COOH-terminal arginine(s). Since essentially equal amounts of the 79- and 83-residue forms of MGP were also detected in bovine articular cartilage and plasma, it seems likely that the COOH-terminal processing events identified in bone apply to many of the other tissues which synthesize this protein. Only one form of MGP was detected in human bone extracts, a 77-residue protein that lacks the COOH-terminal residues Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg-Gly--Lys. This shortened version of human MGP is consistent with the proposed model for COOH-terminal processing, since the amino acid substitution in the COOH terminus of the human protein, Lys79 for Gln79, would allow removal of the additional basic residues from the human MGP COOH terminus by the action of the carboxypeptidase B-like enzymic activity. Recent studies have shown that MGP is strongly induced by retinoic acid in fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, a response which suggests that MGP mediates an action of retinoic acid on an aspect of cell growth or differentiation. If this hypothesis is true, the present evidence for complex COOH-terminal processing events could provide a means to regulate the as yet unknown activity of MGP in the extracellular environment in a mechanism similar to the activation of hormones such as anaphlotoxins and kinins.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378498> and nitrogen balance of dairy cattle as affected by provision of different essential amino acid profiles at the same metabolizable protein supply.</a></h2><p>Amino acid composition of metabolizable protein (MP) is important in dairy cattle diets, but effects of AA imbalances on  and N utilization are unclear. This study determined the effect of different AA profiles within a constant supplemental MP level on whole-body  and N partitioning in dairy cattle. Five rumen-fistulated Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (2.8 ± 0.4 lactations; 81 ± 11 d in milk; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to a 5 × 5 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 58% corn silage, 16% alfalfa hay, and 26% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net  and MP requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (SAL) or 562 g/d of essential AA delivered in 4 profiles where individual AA content corresponded to their relative content in casein. The profiles were (1) a complete essential amino acid mixture (EAAC), (2) Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV), (3) His, Ile, Leu, Met, , Trp, Val (GR1+ILV), and (4) Arg, His, Lys, Met, , , Trp (GR1+ALT). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine  and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, digestibility, and plasma constituents. Compared with SAL, infusion of EAAC increased milk, protein, and lactose yield, increased  retained as body protein, and did not affect milk N efficiency. Total N intake and urine N output was higher with all AA infusions relative to SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusions of GR1+ILV and GR1+ALT produced the same milk yield and the same yield and content of milk fat, protein, and lactose, and had similar  and N retention. Milk N efficiency was not different between EAAC and GR1+ILV, but was lower with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC, and tended to be lower with GR1+ALT compared with GR1+ILV. Infusion of ILV tended to decrease dry matter intake compared with the other AA infusions. Milk production and composition was not different between ILV and SAL. Compared with EAAC, infusion of ILV decreased or tended to decrease milk, protein, and lactose yields and milk protein content, and increased milk fat and lactose content. Milk N efficiency decreased with ILV compared with SAL, EAAC, and GR1+ILV. Milk urea concentration was not affected by essential amino acid (EAA) infusions. Plasma urea concentration did not differ between EAAC and SAL, tended to increase with ILV and GR1+ILV over SAL, and increased with GR1+ALT compared with EAAC and SAL. In conclusion, removing Arg, Lys, and  or removing Ile, Leu, and Val from a complete EAA profile when the total amount of EAA infused remained constant did not impair milk production, but milk N efficiency decreased when Ile, Leu, and Val were absent. Infusion of only Ile, Leu, and Val decreased milk protein yield and content and reduced milk N efficiency compared with a complete EAA profile.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of herkinorin, a non-opioid μ-opioid receptor agonist derived from salvinorin A, on blood vessels in the rat retina and to investigate the mechanism underlying the herkinorin-induced retinal vasodilatory response. Ocular fundus images were captured using an original high-resolution digital fundus camera in vivo. The retinal vascular responses were evaluated by measuring the diameter of retinal arterioles in the fundus images. Both systemic blood pressure and heart rate were continuously recorded. Herkinorin increased the retinal arteriolar diameter without significantly changing mean blood pressure and heart rate. The retinal vasodilator response to herkinorin was almost completely prevented following treatment with naloxone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist and H-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH (CTOP), a selective μ-opioid receptor antagonist. N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nonselective nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, or indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the herkinorin-induced retinal vasodilator responses. In addition, N-propyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase, diminished the herkinorin-induced retinal vasodilator responses. Seven days after an intravitreal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, loss of inner retinal neurons and abolishment of the retinal vasodilator response to herkinorin were observed. These results suggest that herkinorin dilates rat retinal arterioles through stimulation of retinal μ-opioid receptors. The μ-opioid receptor-mediated retinal vasodilator response is likely mediated by NO generated by neuronal NO synthase. Retinal neurons play an important role in the retinal vasodilator mechanism involving μ-opioid receptors in rats.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In Exp. 1, 15 ileal-cannulated pigs (50.5 ± 2.9 kg BW) were allotted to 5 diets in a 2-period incompletely randomized design. Pigs were provided a cornstarch N-free diet (CST) or a diet containing 5% inulin (INU), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), or Solka-Floc (SFC). Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, ash, and GE were greater ( < 0.05) in the MCC and SFC diets than in the INU and CMC diets. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, carbohydrates (CHO), and GE and the DE content in the CST and INU diets were greater ( < 0.01) than in the CMC, MCC, and SFC diets. Hindgut disappearance of DM, CHO, and GE in the INU diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other N-free diets. The ileal endogenous flow of His, Ile, Leu, Met, , Val, and all dispensable AA in the CMC diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other diets. In Exp. 2, 6 ileal-cannulated pigs were allotted to 3 diets containing either a corn-soybean meal control diet or the control diet with 5% INU or CMC in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser, , and Val were greater ( < 0.05) in the CMC diet than in the control and INU diets. Incorporation of 5% INU or CMC in the control diet reduced ( < 0.01) the AID of arabinoxylan and insoluble and total NSP. The ATTD of NSP and cellulose and the hindgut disappearance of NSP, β-glucan, and cellulose in the CMC diet were less ( < 0.01) than in the control and INU diets. Inclusion of 5% INU in the diet increased ( < 0.01) hindgut fermentation of insoluble and total NSP compared with the control and CMC diets. In conclusion, depending on the viscosity and fermentability of the NSP, different sources will have different effects on nutrient digestibility and hindgut fermentation. Addition of 5% INU to a corn-soybean meal diet reduced digestibility of the NSP component in the ileum and increased hindgut fermentation of total NSP. In contrast, the inclusion of CMC increased the AID and SID of the diet and reduced total tract digestion and hindgut fermentation of NSP component. Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is not recommended as a source of synthetic fiber in a N-free diet to determine the SID of AA of diets.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22167202>Characterization of central carbon metabolism of Streptococcus pneumoniae by isotopologue profiling.</a></h2><p>The metabolism of Streptococcus pneumoniae was studied by isotopologue profiling after bacterial cultivation in chemically defined medium supplemented with [U-(13)C(6)]- or [1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose.

Apparently, α-ketoglutarate was generated from unlabeled glutamate via the aspartate transaminase reaction. A fraction of  and Tyr obtained label via the chorismate route from erythrose 4-phosphate, generated via the pentose phosphate pathway, and phosphoenolpyruvate. Strikingly, the data revealed no significant flux from phosphoglycerate to Ser and Gly but showed formation of Ser via the reverse reaction, namely by hydroxymethylation of Gly. The essential Gly was acquired from the medium, and the biosynthesis pathway was confirmed in experiments using [U-(13)C(2)]glycine as a tracer. The hydroxymethyl group in Ser originated from formate, which was generated by the pyruvate formate-lyase. Highly similar isotopologue profiles were observed in corresponding experiments with pneumococcal mutants deficient in PavA, CodY, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pointing to the robustness of the core metabolic network used by these facultative pathogenic bacteria.

No heme destruction was detected in a triple variant (Tyr67-->/Asn52-->Ile/Cys102-->) with the catalytic hydrogen peroxide concentration of 1 mM, even following the loss of catalytic activity, whereas both double variants Tyr67-->/Cys102--> and Asn52-->Ile/Cys102--> showed a greater rate of peroxide-induced heme destruction than observed with the wild-type protein.Heme destruction and catalytic inactivation are two independent processes. An internal water molecule (Wat166) is shown to be important in the heme destruction process.

We have now shown that each of these strains possesses characteristic polar glycopeptidolipids (GPL) which are sufficiently different to allow unequivocal strain identification. Thin layer chromatographic analysis demonstrated that M. habana synthesizes a family of apolar GPLs and three distinct polar GPLs (pGPL-I to -III) which exhibited migration patterns different from those of M. simiae serotype I (pGPL-Sim). Using a combination of chemical, mass spectrometric, and proton-NMR analyses, the GPLs from M. habana were determined to be based on the same generic structure as those from the M. avium complex, namely N-fatty acyl-D--(O-saccharide)-D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninyl-O-m onosaccharide. The de-O-acetylated apolar GPLs contain a 3-O-Me-6-deoxy-Tal attached to the allo- and either a 3-O-Me-Rha or a 3,4-di-O-Me-Rha attached to the alaninol. In the pGPLs, oligosaccharides were found to be attached to the allo-.

The corresponding oligosaccharide from pGPL-Sim was shown to be of identical molecular  to pGPL-II but terminating with a 3,4-di-O-Me-GlcA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based serological studies using anti-M. habana and anti-M. simiae sera against whole cells and purified pGPLs firmly established the polar GPLs as important antigens and indicated that the terminal epitopes L-Fuc-, 2,4-di-O-Me-D-GlcA, and 4-O-Me-D-GlcA uniquely present in pGPL-I, -II, and -III, respectively, confer sufficient specificity for the identification of M. habana as a distinct serotype of M. simiae.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25593312>Substrate tRNA recognition mechanism of eubacterial tRNA (m1A58) methyltransferase (TrmI).</a></h2><p>TrmI generates N(1)-methyladenosine at position 58 (m(1)A58) in tRNA. The Thermus thermophilus tRNA() transcript was methylated efficiently by T. thermophilus TrmI, whereas the yeast tRNA() transcript was poorly methylated. Fourteen chimeric tRNA transcripts derived from these two tRNAs revealed that TrmI recognized the combination of aminoacyl stem, variable region, and T-loop. This was confirmed by 10 deletion tRNA variants: TrmI methylated transcripts containing the aminoacyl stem, variable region, and T-arm. The requirement for the T-stem itself was confirmed by disrupting the T-stem. Disrupting the interaction between T- and D-arms accelerated the methylation, suggesting that this disruption is included in part of the reaction. Experiments with 17 point mutant transcripts elucidated the positive sequence determinants C56, purine 57, A58, and U60. Replacing A58 with inosine and 2-aminopurine completely abrogated methylation, demonstrating that the 6-amino group in A58 is recognized by TrmI. T. thermophilus tRNAGGU()GGU() contains C60 instead of U60. The tRNAGGU() transcript was poorly methylated by TrmI, and replacing C60 with U increased the methylation, consistent with the point mutation experiments. A gel shift assay revealed that tRNAGGU() had a low affinity for TrmI than tRNA(). Furthermore, analysis of tRNAGGU() purified from the trmI gene disruptant strain revealed that the other modifications in tRNA accelerated the formation of m(1)A58 by TrmI. Moreover, nucleoside analysis of tRNAGGU() from the wild-type strain indicated that less than 50% of tRNAGG() contained m(1)A58.

The exposure of SR vesicles (10 mg/ml protein) to low peroxynitrite concentrations ( < or = 0.2 mM) resulted in a decrease of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity primarily through oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Most of this deactivation (ca.70%) could be chemically reversed by subsequent reduction of the enzyme with either dithiothreitol (DTT) or sodium borohydride (NaBH4), indicating that free cysteine groups were oxidized to disulfides. The initial presence of 5 mM glutathione failed to protect the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. However, as long as peroxynitrite concentrations were kept < or = 0.45 mM, the efficacy of DTT to reverse Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation was enhanced for reaction mixtures which initially contained 5 mM glutathione. At least part of the disulfides were formed intermolecularly since gel electrophoresis revealed protein aggregation which could be reduced under reducing conditions. The application of higher peroxynitrite concentrations ( > or = 0.45 mM) resulted in Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation which could not be restored by exposure of the modified protein to reducing agents. On the other hand, treatment of modified protein with NaBH4 recovered all SR protein thiols. This result indicates that possibly the oxidation of other amino acids contributes to enzyme inactivation, corroborated by amino acid analysis which revealed some additional targets for peroxynitrite or peroxynitrite-induced processes such as Met, Lys, , , Ser, Leu and Tyr. Tyr oxidation was confirmed by a significant lower sensitivity of oxidized SR proteins to the Lowry assay. However, neither bityrosine nor nitrotyrosine were formed in significant yields, as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and immunodetection, respectively. The Ca(2+)-ATPase of SR is involved in cellular Ca(2+)-homeostasis. Thus, peroxynitrite mediated oxidation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase might significantly contribute to the loss of Ca(2+)-homeostasis observed under biological conditions of oxidative stress.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2374706>Transfer RNAs of potato (Solanum tuberosum)  have different genetic origins.</a></h2><p>Total transfer RNAs were extracted from highly purified potato .

However, the MC system, and more specifically the MC4 receptor (MC4R), also interacts with neurochemical systems that regulate socioemotional behaviors, including oxytocin (OT) and dopamine. In monogamous prairie voles, OT and dopamine interact to promote partner preference formation, a laboratory measure of an enduring social bond between mates. Here we investigated the effects of MC receptor activation on partner preference formation in prairie voles, as well as the interaction between the MC and OT systems during this process. Peripheral administration of the brain penetrant MC3/4R receptor peptide agonist, Melanotan II (MTII), and the highly selective, small-molecule MC4R agonist, Pf-446687, enhanced partner preference formation in the prairie vole, but not in the non-monogamous meadow vole. MTII-induced partner preferences were enduring, as they were present 1 week after drug manipulation. The prosocial effects of MCR agonists may be mediated, in part, through modulation of OT, as coadministration of an OT receptor antagonist prevented MTII-induced partner preferences. MTII also selectively activated hypothalamic OT neurons and potentiated central OT release. As OT has been shown to enhance some aspects of social cognition in humans, our data suggest that the MC4R may be a viable therapeutic target for enhancing social function in psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, potentially through activation of the OT system.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3831969>Strategies for the isolation of insect peptides.</a></h2><p>Two distinct diuretic peptides affect the rate of fluid secretion of the Malpighian tubules in Locusta.

The cyclic part binds to gram-negative lipopolysaccharides, rendering the bacterial outer membrane permeable to hydrophobic antibiotics. The tail confers chemotactic and opsonic activities upon the conjugates. These two activities appear to be the basis for the conjugates' antibacterial activities. The conjugates are 8 to 10 times less toxic than the parent PMB or PME antibiotics. Fourteen of 18 mice lethally challenged with erythromycin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae survived following intraperitoneal administration of erythromycin and [fMLF]PMBN, whereas erythromycin or the peptide conjugate alone had no effect. Moreover, the clearance of Klebsiella from blood was markedly enhanced by intravenous injection of the [fMLF]PMEN peptide conjugate compared to the clearance of the organism from the mice treated with buffer alone as a control and was similar to that achieved by the PME antibiotic. Blood clearance was also significantly enhanced by administration of PMEN either alone or in a mixture with fMLF, although the effect was less than that produced by the peptide conjugate. Since resistance to polymyxins, the parent molecules of the synthetic cyclic peptides, is rare, the emergence of bacteria resistant to the antimicrobial properties of the peptide conjugates may be precluded as well.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18203976>Nutrient digestibility and performance responses of growing pigs fed phytase- and xylanase-supplemented wheat-based diets.</a></h2><p>Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementing phytase and xylanase on nutrient digestibility and performance of growing pigs fed wheat-based diets.

We have constructed stalk glycosylation mutants of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a type I ectoprotein that is vigorously shed when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Surprisingly, stalk glycosylation did not significantly inhibit release. Introduction of an N-linked glycan directly adjacent to the native stalk cleavage site resulted in a 13-residue, proximal displacement of the cleavage site, from the Arg-626/Ser-627 to the -640/Leu-641 bond. Substitution of the wild-type stalk with a Ser-/-rich sequence known to be heavily O-glycosylated produced a mutant (ACE-JGL) in which this chimeric stalk was partially O-glycosylated; incomplete glycosylation may have been due to membrane proximity. Relative to levels of cell-associated ACE-JGL, rates of basal, unstimulated release of ACE-JGL were enhanced compared with wild-type ACE. ACE-JGL was cleaved at an Ala/ bond, 14 residues from the membrane.

Primary mammary epithelial cells were obtained from Holstein dairy cows and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium (DMEM/F12) containing lactogenic hormones (prolactin and glucocorticoids). Free  (117 μg/ml) was substituted partly with peptide-bound  (phenylalanylphenylalanine, phenylalanyl threonine, threonyl-phenylalanyl-phenylalanine) in the experimental media. After incubation with experimental medium, cells were collected for gene expression analysis and medium was collected for milk protein or amino acid determination. The results showed that peptide-bound  at 10% (11.7 μg/ml) significantly enhanced αs1 casein gene expression and milk protein synthesis as compared with equivalent amount of free . When 10%  was replaced by phenylalanylphenylalanine, the disappearance of most essential amino acids increased significantly, and gene expression of peptide transporter 2 and some amino acid transporters was significantly enhanced. These results indicate that the  and  oligopeptides are important for milk protein synthesis, and peptide-bound amino acids could be utilised more efficiently in milk protein synthesis than the equivalent amount of free amino acids.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1981569>[Ser5]-somatostatin-14: isolation from the pancreas of a holocephalan fish, the Pacific ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei).</a></h2><p>The holocephalan fishes were the first class of vertebrate in evolution to develop a pancreatic gland with both endocrine and exocrine parenchyma.

Due to the unavoidable contamination in their feed, pigs are more likely to be exposed to AFB and indirectly harm human health. Therefore, identifying the porcine CYP3A isoforms involved in AFB-8,9-epoxidation is critical. In this study, we used codon optimization and N-terminal coding sequence modification to modify a CYP3A46 recombinant protein that exhibits good structure and catalytic activities and revealed its strong AFB-8,9-epoxidase activity for the first time. Site-directed mutagenesis, kinetics and docking analyses were performed and demonstrated that residues -108, Ser-119, -215, -304 and -309 play important roles in AFB-8,9-epoxidation and its responsiveness to α-naphthoflavone. Interestingly, we uncovered the dual and reverse roles of -304 in CYP3A46, CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 in AFB oxidation. Unlike the π-π interaction between the -304 phenyl of CYP3A4 and the AFB aromatic ring, -304 of CYP3A46 may function to provide steric hindrance to bind AFB. -108 and -215 could stabilize AFB with a potentially productive orientation through van der Waals interactions with AFB. Ser-119 and -309 are likely to function to form H-bonds with AFB. This study broadens our knowledge of AFB bioactivation in pigs and may contribute to reduce the deleterious effects of AFB in pigs and humans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, the weak binding of Ca/CaM to the human 12 AA cytosolic domain was studied using C-terminal anchored peptides. We now show the binding of N labeled -454 cytosolic domain peptides in solution or membrane anchored using NMR demonstrates a significant role for the lipid bilayer. Although binding is increased by the mutation Phe454Ala, this mutation was previously shown to abrogate actin binding. On the other hand, Ca/CaM binding is abrogated by phosphorylation of nearby -457, a post-translation modification required for actin binding and subsequent in vitro lumen formation. Binding of Ca/CaM to a membrane proximal peptide from the long 72 AA cytosolic domain anchored to lipid nanodiscs was very weak compared to lipid free conditions, suggesting membrane specific effects between the two isoforms. NMR analysis of N labeled Ca/CaM with unlabeled peptides showed the C-lobe of Ca/CaM is involved in peptide interactions, and hydrophobic residues such as Met-109, Val-142 and Met-144 play important roles in binding peptide. This information was incorporated into transmembrane models of CEACAM1 binding to Ca/CaM. The lack of Ca/CaM binding to phosphorylated -457, a residue we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by CaMK2D, also dependent on Ca/CaM, suggests stepwise binding of the cytosolic domain first to Ca/CaM and then to actin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This protein differs from other well-studied viral and cellular fusion proteins because of its distinct molecular architecture and apparent lack of involvement of coiled coils in the low-pH-induced structural transitions that lead to fusion. A highly conserved loop (the cd loop), which resides at the distal tip of each subunit and is mostly buried in the subunit interface of the native E homodimer at neutral pH, has been hypothesized to function as an internal fusion peptide at low pH, but this has not yet been shown experimentally. It was predicted by examination of the X-ray crystal structure of the TBE virus E protein (F. A. Rey et al., Nature 375:291-298, 1995) that mutations at a specific residue within this loop (Leu 107) would not cause the native structure to be disrupted. We therefore introduced amino acid substitutions at this position and, using recombinant subviral particles, investigated the effects of these changes on fusion and related properties. Replacement of Leu with hydrophilic amino acids strongly impaired () or abolished (Asp) fusion activity, whereas a  mutant still retained a significant degree of fusion activity. Liposome coflotation experiments showed that the fusion-negative Asp mutant did not form a stable interaction with membranes at low pH, although it was still capable of undergoing the structural rearrangements required for fusion. These data support the hypothesis that the cd loop may be directly involved in interactions with target membranes during fusion.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806643>Protective role of μ opioid receptor activation in intestinal  induced by mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion in mice.</a></h2><p>Intestinal ischemia is a clinical emergency with high morbidity and mortality.

Ischemia was induced by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (45 min), followed by reperfusion (5 hr). Sham-operated (SO) and normal (N) mice served as controls. Each group received subcutaneously 1) saline solution, 2) the μOR selective agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0.01 mg kg(-1) ), 3) DAMGO and the selective μOR antagonist [H-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2] (CTAP; 0.1 mg kg(-1) ), or 4) CTAP alone. I/R induced intestinal  as indicated by histological damage and the significant increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an index of tissue neutrophil accumulation. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA levels were also increased in I/R mice compared with SO. DAMGO significantly reduced tissue damage, MPO activity, and TNF-α mRNA levels in I/R, and these effects were reversed by CTAP. By contrast, DAMGO did not modify IL-10 mRNA levels or gastrointestinal transit. DAMGO's effects are receptor mediated and likely are due to activation of peripheral μORs, because it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. These findings suggest that activation of peripheral μOR protects from the inflammatory response induced by I/R through a pathway involving the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Reduction of acute  might prevent I/R complications, including motility impairment, which develop at a later stage of reperfusion and likely are due to inflammatory cell infiltrates.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27589480>Design and Synthesis of an Investigational Nonapeptide KISS1 Receptor (KISS1R) Agonist, Ac-d-Tyr-Hydroxyproline (Hyp)-Asn---azaGly-Leu-Arg(Me)-Trp-NH (TAK-448), with Highly Potent Testosterone-Suppressive Activity and Excellent Water Solubility.</a></h2><p>Metastin/kisspeptin is an endogenous ligand of KISS1 Receptor (KISS1R).

LCAT is activated through an unknown mechanism by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and other mimetic peptides that form a belt around HDL. Here, we report the crystal structure of LCAT with an extended lid that blocks access to the active site, consistent with an inactive conformation. Residues -123 and -382 in the catalytic domain form a latch-like interaction with hydrophobic residues in the lid. Because these residues are mutated in genetic disease, lid displacement was hypothesized to be an important feature of apoA-I activation. Functional studies of site-directed mutants revealed that loss of latch interactions or the entire lid enhanced activity against soluble ester substrates, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry revealed that the LCAT lid is extremely dynamic in solution. Upon addition of a covalent inhibitor that mimics one of the reaction intermediates, there is an overall decrease in HDX in the lid and adjacent regions of the protein, consistent with ordering. These data suggest a model wherein the active site of LCAT is shielded from soluble substrates by a dynamic lid until it interacts with HDL to allow transesterification to proceed.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10773071>Repair of tRNAs in metazoan .</a></h2><p>The integrity of 3'-ends of tRNAs is essential for aminoacylation and consequently for protein synthesis. The CCA-termini are generated and, if truncated by exonucleolytic activity, restored by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. However, further truncations at the 3'-end can occur by exonuclease activity or during processing of overlapping tRNA primary transcripts in metazoan . In the latter case, the upstream tRNA is released in a 3'-truncated form (lacking up to six bases) and subsequently completed. In human , tRNA(Tyr)(missing the discriminator nucleotide A(73)) is completed by a discriminator adding activity followed by CCA addition. Since in vivo a high percentage of further 3'-terminally degraded human tRNA(Tyr)transcripts could be observed, it was tested in an in vitro system whether this repair mechanism for tRNA 3'-ends acts also on these further degraded tRNA versions. Additionally, 3'-truncated versions of two non-overlapping mitochondrial tRNAs (tRNA()and tRNA()) were examined. The results show that these transcripts can be repaired during incubation.

Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that in the -72-->Ile mutant several residues that have been shown to play a role in ligand binding fluctuate around orientations and distances similar to those observed in the x-ray structure of the CO derivative of the native hemoglobin, although the overall structure remains in the T state. Visible absorption spectroscopy data indicate that in the deoxy form the Soret band is less asymmetric in the mutant than in the native protein, suggesting a more planar heme structure; moreover, these data suggest a similar heme-solvent interaction in both the liganded and unliganded states of the mutant protein, at variance with that observed in the native protein. The "conformation sensitive" band III of the deoxy mutant protein is shifted to lower  by >100 cm-1 with respect to the native one, about one-half of that observed in the low temperature photoproducts of both proteins, indicating a less polar or more hydrophobic heme environment. Resonance Raman spectroscopy data show a slight shift of the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode of the deoxy mutant toward lower frequency with respect to the native protein, which can be interpreted in terms of either a change in packing of the phenyl ring of -97, as also observed from the simulation, or a loss of water in the heme pocket. In line with this latter interpretation, the number of water molecules that dynamically enters the intersubunit interface, as calculated by the molecular dynamics simulation, is lower in the mutant than in the native protein. The 10-ns photoproduct for the carbonmonoxy mutant derivative has a higher iron-proximal histidine stretching frequency than does the native protein. This suggests a subnanosecond relaxation that is slowed in the mutant, consistent with a stabilization of the R structure. Taken together, the molecular dynamics and the spectroscopic data indicate that the higher oxygen affinity displayed by the -72-->Ile mutant is mainly due to a local perturbation in the dimer interface that propagates to the heme region, perturbing the polarity of the heme environment and propionate interactions. These changes are consistent with a destabilization of the T state and a stabilization of the R state in the mutant relative to the native protein.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323370>Electroacupuncture alleviates affective pain in an inflammatory pain rat model.</a></h2><p>Pain has both sensory-discriminative and emotional-affective dimensions.

An inflammatory pain rat model, produced by a complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) injection into the hind paw, was combined with a conditioned place avoidance (CPA) test to determine whether EA inhibits spontaneous pain-induced affective response and, if so, to study the possibility that rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) opioids underlie this effect. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g, Harlan) were used. The rats showed place aversion (i.e. affective pain) by spending less time in a pain-paired compartment after conditioning than during a preconditioning test. Systemic non-analgesic morphine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited the affective reaction, suggesting that the affective dimension is underpinned by mechanisms different from those of the sensory dimension of pain. Morphine at 0.5 and at 1 mg/kg did not induce reward. Rats given EA treatment before pain-paired conditioning at GB 30 showed no aversion to the pain-paired compartment, indicating that EA inhibited the affective dimension. EA treatment did not produce reward or aversive effect. Intra-rACC administration of D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen- amide (CTOP), a selective mu opioid receptor antagonist, but not norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI), a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, blocked EA inhibition of the affective dimension. These data demonstrate that EA activates opioid receptors in the rACC to inhibit pain-induced affective responses and that EA may be an effective therapy for both the sensory-discriminative and the affective dimensions of pain.© 2011 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348648>Specific cyclic ADP-ribose phosphohydrolase obtained by mutagenic engineering of Mn-dependent ADP-ribose/CDP-alcohol diphosphatase.</a></h2><p>Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a messenger for Ca mobilization.

The enzyme was purified about 230-fold from a concentrated spinal cord extract. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it stained as a protein of Mr 55,000. The purified enzyme is optimally active at around pH7 and has essential thiol groups. It appears to be highly specific for dynorphin B (Km = 11 microM) but not for alpha-neoendorphin or dynorphin A, two other opioids included in the prodynorphin precursor. From its specificity, molecular size, and inhibitory spectrum, this enzyme is different from other known dynorphin-converting or -degrading enzymes and appears to be a unique and novel endoprotease.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20818167>Synthetic substrates for measuring activity of autophagy proteases: autophagins (Atg4).</a></h2><p>Atg4 cysteine proteases (autophagins) play crucial roles in autophagy by proteolytic activation of Atg8 paralogs for targeting to autophagic vesicles by  conjugation, as well as in subsequent deconjugation reactions. However, the means to measure the activity of autophagins is limited. Herein, we describe two novel substrates for autophagins suitable for a diversity of in vitro assays, including (i) fluorogenic tetrapeptide acetyl-Gly-L--L--Gly-AFC (Ac-GTFG-AFC) and (ii) a fusion protein comprised of the natural substrate LC3B appended to the N-terminus of phospholipase A(2) (LC3B-PLA(2)), which upon cleavage releases active PLA(2) for fluorogenic assay. To generate the synthetic tetrapeptide substrate, the preferred tetrapeptide sequence recognized by autophagin-1/Atg4B was determined using a positional scanning combinatorial fluorogenic tetrapeptide library. With the LC3B-PLA(2) substrate, we show that mutation of the glycine proximal to the scissile bond in LC3B abolishes activity. Both substrates showed high specificity for recombinant purified autophagin-1/Atg4B compared to closely related proteases and the LC3B-PLA(2) substrate afforded substantially higher catalytic rates (k(cat)/K(m) 5.26 x 10(5) M(-1)/sec(-1)) than Ac-GTFG-AFC peptide (0.92 M(-1)/sec(-1)), consistent with substrate-induced activation. Studies of autophagin-1 mutants were also performed, including the protease lacking a predicted autoinhibitory domain at residues 1 to 24 and lacking a regulatory loop at residues 259 to 262. The peptide and fusion protein substrates were also employed for measuring autophagin activity in cell lysates, showing a decrease in cells treated with autophagin-1/Atg4B siRNA or transfected with a plasmid encoding Atg4B (Cys74Ala) dominantnegative. Therefore, the synthetic substrates for autophagins reported here provide new research tools for studying autophagy.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8011636>Prediction and site-specific mutagenesis of residues in transmembrane alpha-helices of proton-pumping nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases from Escherichia coli and bovine heart .</a></h2><p>Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase from bovine heart consists of a single polypeptide of 109 kD. The complete gene for this transhydrogenase was constructed, and the protein primary structure was determined from the cDNA. As compared to the previously published sequences of partially overlapping clones, three residues differed: Ala591 (previously ), Val777 (previously Glu), and Ala782 (previously Arg). The Escherichia coli transhydrogenase consists of an alpha subunit of 52 kD and a beta subunit of 48 kD. Alignment of the protein primary structure of the bovine trashydrogenase with that of the transhydrogenase from E. coli showed an identity of 52%, indicating similarly folded structures. Prediction of transmembrane-spanning alpha-helices, obtained by applying several prediction algorithms to the primary structures of the revised bovine heart and E. coli transhydrogenases, yielded a model containing 10 transmembrane alpha-helices in both transhydrogenases. In E. coli transhydrogenase, four predicted alpha-helices were located in the alpha subunit and six alpha-helices were located in the beta subunit. Various conserved amino acid residues of the E. coli transhydrogenase located in or close to predicted transmembrane alpha-helixes were replaced by site-specific mutagenesis. Conserved negatively charged residues in predicted transmembrane alpha-helices possibly participating in proton translocation were identified as beta Glu82 (Asp655 in the bovine enzyme) and beta Asp213 (asp787 in the bovine enzyme) located close to the predicted alpha-helices 7 and 9 of the beta subunit. beta Glu82 was replaced by Lys or Gln and beta Asp213 by Asn or His. However, the catalytic as well as the proton pumping activity was retained. In contrast, mutagenesis of the conserved beta His91 residue (His664 in the bovine enzyme) to Ser, , and Cys gave an essentially inactive enzyme. Mutation of alpha His450 (corresponding to His481 in the bovine enzyme) to  greatly lowered catalytic activity without abolishing proton pumping. Since no other conserved acidic or basic residues were predicted in transmembrane alpha-helices regardless of the prediction algorithm used, proton translocation by transhydrogenase was concluded to involve a basic rather than an acidic residue. The only conserved cysteine residue, beta Cys260 (Cys834 in the bovine enzyme), located in the predicted alpha-helix 10 of the E. coli transhydrogenase, previously suggested to function as a redox-active dithiol, proved not to be essential, suggesting that redox-active dithiols do not play a role in the mechanism of transhydrogenase.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29627244>Jugular arginine infusion relieves lipopolysaccharide-triggered inflammatory stress and improves immunity status of lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of jugular l-Arg infusion on performance and immune function during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  of lactating dairy cows. Eight Holstein cows (multiparous, 608.8 ± 31.5 kg) at mid-lactation were randomly assigned to 5-d jugular infusions of control (saline), Arg (3 g/h), LPS (0.033 μg/kg per h), and LPS + Arg (0.033 μg/kg per h of LPS and 3 g/h of Arg) in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 infusion periods separated by 10-d noninfusion periods. Jugular solutions of saline, Arg, LPS, and LPS + Arg were continuously infused using peristaltic pumps for approximately 6 h/d during infusion periods. Milk yield was measured on each day of the infusion period. Milk samples were obtained on the last 2 d of each infusion period, and blood samples were obtained on the last day of each infusion period before infusion (0 h) and at 3 and 6 h. We found that the jugular LPS infusion significantly increased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein, whereas Arg attenuated the increase in IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels and tended to decrease the lipopolysaccharide binding protein level. Arginine alleviated the decrease in dry matter intake and milk fat yield and the increase of somatic cell count induced by LPS. Total casein in milk was decreased during the LPS-induced  period, and jugular Arg infusion significantly increased the content of total casein. In contrast, lactalbumin in milk increased during the LPS-induced  period, whereas jugular Arg infusion significantly decreased the content of lactalbumin. The concentrations of plasma Gly, , Ile, Leu, Arg, , and total free AA were significantly decreased by LPS treatment, but Arg attenuated this tendency. These results indicated that jugular Arg infusion (18 g/d) has protective effects on relieving inflammatory stress and improving immunity status triggered by LPS. In conclusion, Arg could attenuate inflammatory stress and improve milk performance of lactating dairy cows. This protective effect may be due to the ability of Arg to suppress LPS effects and improve immunity status.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, concentrations of opioid peptides are increased in peripheral blood and at the sites of inflammatory reactions.Using flow cytometric assay of whole human blood, we investigated direct effects of endogenous and synthetic opioid peptides on surface expression of complement receptors CD35 and CD11b/CD18 and Fcã receptor III CD16, and superoxide anion generation of neutrophils.The endogenous opioid peptides beta-endorphin(1-31) and met-enkephalin, representing the N-terminal fragment of beta-endorphin(1-31), and the synthetic delta opioid receptor agonists D-Ala(2)-D-Leu(5)-enkephalin and D-Pen(2)-enkephalin produced concentration-dependent stimulation of neutrophil activity. Incubation with met-enkephalin 10(-7) M or beta-endorphin(1-31) 10(-7) M led to an increase in receptor expression of up to 10% (met-enkephalin) and 15% (beta-endorphin(1-31)). After incubation with D-Ala(2)-D-Leu(5)-enkephalin or D-Pen(2/5)-enkephalin, receptor expression was increased by up to 30%. This correlated with concentration-dependent stimulation of the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, as shown by an increase of up to 40% in oxidative burst activity. All effects were abolished after preincubation with naloxone or with the selective delta opioid antagonist naltrindole, whereas the selective micro receptor antagonist d--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2) showed only partial inhibitory effects.Our data suggest a delta opioid receptor-mediated stimulatory effect on neutrophil function. beta-Endorphin(27-31), the C-terminal fragment of beta-endorphin(1-31), did not alter neutrophil function, indicating that beta-endorphin(1-31) mediates its effect on neutrophils via the N-terminal fragment.

Food- and water-sated male and female AA (Alko, alcohol) rats consistently drank 10% alcohol during daily 30-min access periods in their home cages in the middle of the 12-h light phase. On 3 consecutive days, the animals received the mu-opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2 (CTOP, 1 micrograms ICv), the delta-receptor antagonist N,N-diallyl-Try-Aib-Aib--Leu-OH (ICI 174,864, 3 micrograms ICV), or saline 15 min before the alcohol access period.

Cu is a positron emitter with a half-life () of 12.7 h. VIP and PACAP38 are two basic C-terminally amidated peptides (28 amino acids and 38 amino acids, respectively) that possess a remarkable amino acid homology (3-6). VIP was initially isolated from porcine intestine, and PACAP38 was isolated from bovine hypothalamus (7-9).(Later, another form of PACAP was isolated with sequence homologous to N-terminal 27 amino acid secued of PACAP28 and named PACAP27.). VIP (HSDAVFTDNYTRLRKQMAVKKYLNSILN-NH) is a hydrophobic, basic peptide that contains three lysine residues (1520, and 21, ), two arginine residues (12 and 14, ), two tyrosine residues (10 and 22, ), an essential histidine residue at the N terminus, and an amidated C-terminus (10). The sequence of PACAP27 shows 68% identity with VIP (11). Like VIP, PACAP27 also has an amidated C-terminal and histidine residue at the N terminus. VIP and PACAP are known regulators within the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. VIP has been shown to have a broad range of activities as a neuroendocrine mediator in diverse cells and tissues (12). Similarly, PACAP has also been shown to act as a hormone, a neurohormone, a neurotransmitter, and a trophic factor in a number of tissues (11). VIP and PACAP act through common G-protein–coupled receptors (11, 12). Three main subtypes of VIP/PACAP receptors are identified as PAC, VPAC, and VPAC. PACAP binds with high affinity to all three receptors, but VIP binds with high affinity to VPAC and VPAC and with low affinity to PAC. These receptors have been shown to be overexpressed on many human tumors, including breast (100% receptor incidence), prostate (100%), ovarian (100%), pancreas (65%), lung (58%), colon (96%), stomach (54%), liver (49%), and urinary bladder (100%) carcinomas, as well as lymphomas (58%) and meningiomas (100%) (5, 13). These receptors are potential molecular targets for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of various cancers (14-17). I-Labeled VIP (I-VIP) was prepared for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric carcinomas, as well as carcinoid tumors (18-20). The results were generally promising in that both primary and metastatic lesions in the liver, lung, and lymph nodes were visualized (21, 22). Tc-Labeled VIP (Tc-VIP) analogs were also developed because Tc is more readily available for clinical applications (23-25). In the initial Tc radiolabeling, VIP was conjugated at the N terminal of the histidine residue with a bifunctional chelating agent for Tc labeling. This Tc-VIP analog had relatively high radiochemical impurities and a loss of biological activity because the histidine residue was required for the VIP biological activity. In an effort to improve Tc labeling, Pallela et al. (24) prepared TP3654 (named according to its molecular ) using 4-aminobutyric acid as a spacer and extended the peptide to include a tetrapeptide moiety of Gly-Gly-(d)-Ala-Gly, which provided an N configuration for Tc chelation. The biological activity of Tc-TP3654 was similar to that of native VIP28, and the binding to the human colorectal cancer was receptor-specific with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC) of 1.5 × 10 M. To prepare a PET probe for VIP imaging, Thakur et al. (25) synthesized Cu-TP3982 (IC = 8.1 × 10 M) for PET imaging of oncogene VPAC receptors overexpressed in human breast cancer cells by synthesizing a protected diaminedithiol (NS)-VIP for Cu chelation. Cu-TP3939, another VIP analog, was also successfully prepared for PET imaging of experimental human prostate cancer in mice (1, 2). This analog with Lys, Nle, (3-OH, 4-OH) , Val, and  was found to be more potent and more biologically stable than the native VIP28 (26, 27). It contains a carboxy terminus lysine residue separated from VIP-asparagine by a γ-aminobutyric acid spacer, and NS is used as the chelating agent. Zhang et al. (1) showed that Cu-TP3939 is a promising molecular imaging probe for PET imaging of prostate cancer. Another study (2) from the same research group also demonstrated the potential use of PET imaging of Cu-TP3939 for human breast cancers.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11420432>Effect of the N2 residue on the stability of the alpha-helix for all 20 amino acids.</a></h2><p>N2 is the second position in the alpha-helix.

The dependence of peptide helicity on N2 residue identity has been used to determine a free- scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory that includes a parameter for the N2  (n2). The rank order of DeltaDeltaG((relative to Ala)) is Glu(-), Asp(-) > Ala > Glu(0), Leu, Val, Gln, , Ile, Ser, Met, Asp(0), His(0), Arg, Cys, Lys,  > Asn, > Gly, His(+), Pro, Tyr. The results correlate very well with N2 propensities in proteins, moderately well with N1 and helix interior preferences, and not at all with N-cap preferences. The strongest energetic effects result from interactions with the helix dipole, which favors negative charges at the helix N terminus. Hydrogen bonds to side chains at N2, such as Gln, Ser, and , are weak, despite occurring frequently in protein crystal structures, in contrast to the N-cap position. This is because N-cap hydrogen bonds are close to linear, whereas N2 hydrogen bonds have poor geometry. These results can be used to modify protein stability rationally, help design helices, and improve prediction of helix location and stability.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16766530>Characterization of the stomatin domain involved in homo-oligomerization and  raft association.</a></h2><p>The cytoplasmically oriented monotopic integral membrane protein stomatin forms high-order oligomers and associates with  rafts. To characterize the domains that are involved in oligomerization and detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) association, we expressed truncation and point mutants of stomatin and analyzed their size and buoyancy by ultracentrifugation methods. A small C-terminal region of stomatin that is largely hydrophobic, Ser--Ile-Val--Pro-Leu-Pro-Ile (residues 264-272), proved to be crucial for oligomerization, whereas the N-terminal domain (residues 1-20) and the last 12 C-terminal amino acids (residues 276-287) were not essential. The introduction of alanine substitutions in the region 264-272 resulted in the appearance of monomers. Remarkably, only three of these residues, Ile-Val- (residues 266-268), were found to be indispensable for the DRM association. Interestingly, the exchange of Pro-269 and to some extent the residues 270-272, which are essential for oligomerization, did not affect the DRM association of stomatin. This suggests that the formation of oligomers is not necessary for the association of stomatin with DRMs. Internal deletions near the membrane anchoring domain resulted in the formation of intermediate size oligomers suggesting a conformational interdependence of large parts of the C-terminal region. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of the tagged, monomeric, non-DRM mutant ST-(1-262)-green fluorescent protein and wild type stomatin StomGFP showed a significantly higher lateral mobility of the truncation mutant in the plasma membrane suggesting a membrane interaction of the respective C-terminal region also in vivo.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30723747>The Functions and Mechanism of a New Oligopeptide BP9 from Avian Bursa on Antibody Responses, Immature B Cell, and Autophagy.</a></h2><p>The bursa of Fabricius is an acknowledged central humoral immune organ unique to birds, which is vital to B cell differentiation and antibody production.

The results of immunization experiments showed that mice injected with 0.01 and 0.05 mg/mL BP9 plus JEV vaccine generated the significant increased antibody levels, compared to those injected with JEV vaccine only. The microarray analysis on the molecular basis of BP9-treated immature B cell showed that vast genes were involved in various immune-related biological processes in BP9-treated WEHI-231 cells, among which the regulation of cytokine production and T cell activation were both major immune-related processes in WEHI-231 cells with BP9 treatment following network analysis. Also, the differentially regulated genes were found to be involved in four significantly enriched  in BP9-treated WEHI-231 cells. Finally, we proved that BP9 induced the autophagy formation, regulated the gene and protein expressions related to autophagy in immature B cell, and stimulated AMPK-ULK1 phosphorylation expression.

The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, Ile, Leu, , Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, , Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, , and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, , and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

We now report structure-activity studies which optimize the potency of this cyclic hexapeptide series with the synthesis of cyclo (N-Me-Ala-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-), II, which is 50-100 times more potent than somatostatin for the inhibition of insulin, glucagon and growth hormone release. The hydroxyl group of tyrosine is seen to lend a 10-fold enhancement to the potency. Potency also is found to be correlated with hydrophobicity. II is found to improve the control of postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic animals when given in combination with insulin. The analog is found to be quite stable in the blood and in the gastrointestinal tract, but the bioavailability after oral administration is only 1-3%.

We have isolated and characterized a novel antimicrobial peptide from the azurophil granule fraction of discontinuous Percoll gradients. We have named this peptide human neutrophil peptide 4 (HNP-4) based on its structural similarity to a group of antimicrobial polypeptides known as defensins (HNP 1-3). Using size exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, HNP-4 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence determined from isolated HNP-4 and from tryptic fragments of reduced and alkylated peptide is: NH2-Val-Cys-Ser-Cys-Arg-Leu-Val--Cys-Arg-Arg--Glu- Leu-Arg-Val-Gly-Asn-Cys-Leu-Ile-Gly-Gly-Val-Ser---Tyr-Cys-Cys-- Arg-Val - COOH. Based on this sequence, HNP-4 has a calculated molecular  of 3715 and a theoretical pI of 8.61. HNP-4 shows structural similarity to the family of three human defensins. HNP-4 and the defensins have identical cysteine backbones and, like the defensins, HNP-4 is rich in arginine (15.2 mol %). However, the amino acids at 22 of the 33 positions differ between HNP-4 and human defensins. Further, HNP-4 is significantly more hydrophobic than the defensins, as determined by its retention time on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. In vitro, purified HNP-4 was shown to kill Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Compared to a mixture of the other human defensins, HNP-4 was found to be approximately 100 times more potent against E. coli and four times more potent against both S. faecalis and C. albicans.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10199800>Several mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene including a nonsense and a frameshift mutation associated with dominantly inherited obesity in humans.</a></h2><p>The melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4-R) has been implicated in  regulation. Recently, two independent groups reported frameshift mutations associated with a dominant form of obesity (1, 2). We screened the coding region of the MC4-R in 306 extremely obese children and adolescents (mean  mass index: BMI 34.4 +/- 6.6 kg/m2), 25 healthy underweight students (mean BMI 17.1 +/- 0.8 kg/m2), 52 normal  individuals (mean BMI 22.0 +/- 1.0 kg/m2), 51 inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 14.3 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) and 27 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 21.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m2) by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). Several mutations were identified, including the frameshift mutation described (1). The mutations were as follows: a) The deletion of 4 bp (delta of CTCT at codon 211) results in a frameshift, thus rendering a truncated protein. This mutation has been assumed to be associated with dominantly-inherited morbid obesity in humans (1). Both the index patient (BMI 42.06 kg/m2, height 171 cm, age 19.6 years) and her mother (BMI 37.55 kg/m2, height 164 cm, age 42.5 years) were heterozygous for the deletion. b) A nonsense mutation at position 35 of the MC4-R was detected in two obese probands (BMI 31.29 kg/m2 and BMI 45.91 kg/m2). This mutation leads to a truncated protein that encompasses the N-terminal extracellular domain. Both carriers additionally showed (c) a missense mutation (Asp-37-Val). In both of these cases Tyr-35-Stop and Asp-37-Val were maternally transmitted, thus these variations form a haplotype. d) e) A male obese proband harbored two missense mutations (Ser-30-, Gly-252-Ser). f)-i) Four different missense mutations (Pro-78-Leu, -112-Met, Arg-165-Trp, Ile-317-) were detected in four different male probands, respectively. All of these mutations (a to i) were found solely in extremely obese individuals whose BMIs were all above the 99th percentile. j) A silent mutation (C-579-T, Val-193-Val) was detected in a male underweight individual. k) A previously described polymorphism (Val-103-Ile; 3) was detected with similar frequencies in all different study groups. 1) We identified a novel polymorphism (Ile-251-Leu) with similar allele frequencies in all groups under study. In conclusion, our data indicate that mutations in the MC4-R are not uncommon. Whereas our data support the evidence for dominantly inherited obesity as revealed by the three obese probands with haplo-insufficiency, the functional significance of the missense mutations remains to be determined.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11391672>Determination of amino acid enantiomers in human urine and blood serum by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Amino acid (AA) enantiomers were determined as N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl-(2)-propyl esters by chiral gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in 24 h samples of the urine of three healthy volunteers and in their blood sera. In urine the largest amounts were determined for D-Ser (64-199 micromol/day) and D-Ala (24-138 micromol/day). In blood sera, D-Ala (2.3-4.2 micromol/L) and D-Ser (1.0-2.9 micromol/L) were most abundant.

Here, structural analysis of the Cry4Ba-receptor-binding domain revealed that its N-terminal subdomain encompasses β2-β3 and β4-β5 hairpins which are stabilized by inter-hairpin hydrogen bonding between (328) in β2 and (369) in β5. Functional importance of these two side-chains was demonstrated by single-Ala substitutions (T328A and T369A), adversely affecting toxin activity against Aedes aegypti larvae. Unlike toxicity restoration of the inactive E417A/Y455A toxin mutated within another receptor-binding subdomain, defective bioactivity of T328A and T369A mutants cannot be restored by Cyt2Aa2 as also observed for β2-β3 (Y332A) and β4-β5 (F364A) loop-mutants. ELISA-based analysis further verified a loss in binding of all four bio-inactive mutants (T328A, Y332A, T369A and F364A) to the immobilized Cyt2Aa2. Protein-protein docking suggested that the two critical loop-residues (Tyr(332) and (364)) correspondingly located at β2-β3 and β4-β5 loops can clearly interact with four counterpart surface-exposed residues of Cyt2Aa2. Altogether, our present data demonstrate structural importance of (328) and (369) toward hydrogen-bonded stabilization of two receptor-binding hairpins (β2-β3 and β4-β5) for synergistic toxicity of Cry4Ba with Cyt2Aa2.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The defect lies in completely different levels which result two different plasma aminograms (PAG). In 24 patients with hepatic encephalopathy stage III-IV (7 patients with acute and 17 with chronic liver failure) the PAG were evaluated. The determination of the plasma amino acids (PAA) was carried out on Multichrom B (Beckmann, Munich). In hepatic coma high concentrations of Met, Tyr, Ala, Lys and Arg are found. The deviations of PAA from normal controls show between acute and chronic hepatic failure no qualitative but only quantitative differences. In diabetic coma the three branches chain AA (Val, Leu and Ile) were elevated upon 3--5 times of normal. Near normal concentrations are found for the AA , Ser, Gly, Ala, Met and the aromatic AA ( and Tyr). The quotient between the branched chain and aromatic AA lies for hepatic coma at a mean of 1.18 and by diabetic coma at 7.18 (p less than 0.001). In hepatic coma a correlation exists between the level of the AA-quotient improvement and the decrease with a deterioriation of the metabolic encephalopathy. The high level of the AA-quotient in the patients of diabetic "coma" gives therefore a good explanation for the rare unconscious state of these patients.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20357116>Shared mechanisms for opioid tolerance and a transition to chronic pain.</a></h2><p>Clinical pain conditions may remain responsive to opiate analgesics for extended periods, but such persistent acute pain can undergo a transition to an opiate-resistant chronic pain state that becomes a much more serious clinical problem. To test the hypothesis that cellular mechanisms of chronic pain in the primary afferent also contribute to the development of opiate resistance, we used a recently developed model of the transition of from acute to chronic pain, hyperalgesic priming. Repeated intradermal administration of the potent and highly selective mu-opioid agonist, [d-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), to produce tolerance for its inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) hyperalgesia, simultaneously produced hyperalgesic priming. Conversely, injection of an inflammogen, carrageenan, used to produce priming produced DAMGO tolerance. Both effects were prevented by inhibition of protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon). Carrageenan also induced opioid dependence, manifest as mu-opioid receptor antagonist (d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2))-induced hyperalgesia that, like priming, was PKCepsilon and G(i) dependent. These findings suggest that the transition from acute to chronic pain, and development of mu-opioid receptor tolerance and dependence may be linked by common cellular mechanisms in the primary afferent.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726107>Short communication: Evaluation of amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 to guide the design of media for high-cell-density culture. The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, , Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and Lys, consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and Tyr ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, , Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, Lys, His, and  exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, Ile, Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, Tyr, and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Thus, there is a keen interest in methods which allow non-invasive monitoring of molecular targets involved in angiogenesis which would support information for planning and controlling corresponding therapies. Moreover, such techniques would provide an insight into the formation of new sprouting blood vessels, the involved processes and regulatory mechanisms in patients. At the moment, development of radiotracer based techniques is mainly concentrated on three different targets which include peptidic and non-peptidic alpha v beta 3-integrin binding antagonists, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and single chain anti-fibronectin antibody fragments. Development of radiolabeled MMP inhibitors is based on either the decapeptide Cys---His-Trp-Gly---Leu-Cys resulting from a phage display library or small molecular  compounds. The in vitro data for these tracers are very promising. However, more detailed in vivo data are necessary to evaluate the potency of MMP-inhibitors for in-vivo imaging. The radiolabelled anti-ED-B single chain antibody fragment scFv L-19 shows selective accumulation in the tumor vasculature in a murine tumour model. In a first patient study a selective localisation of the (123)I-labeled tracer in lesions of different tumours was found. On the basis of the lead structure cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-dPhe-Val) a variety of different radiolabeled RGD-peptides has been developed for the non-invasive determination of the alpha v beta 3 expression. These developments include peptides labeled with minimum structural alteration, peptide carbohydrate conjugates, peptidomimetics based on the RGD-structure as well as heterodimeric, homodimeric and homotetrameric ligand systems. Many of the tracers show high alpha v beta 3-affinity and selectivity in vitro and receptor selective tumour accumulation with high image contrast in different murine tumour models.

The very N-terminal amino acid sequence largely determines whether or not a given protein is Nt-acetylated. Currently, there are six distinct NATs characterized, NatA-NatF, in humans of which the in vivo substrate specificity of Naa50 (Nat5)/NatE, an alternative catalytic subunit of the human NatA, so far remained elusive. In this study, we quantitatively compared the Nt-acetylomes of wild-type yeast S. cerevisiae expressing the endogenous yeast Naa50 (yNaa50), the congenic strain lacking yNaa50, and an otherwise identical strain expressing human Naa50 (hNaa50). Six canonical yeast NatA substrates were Nt-acetylated less in yeast lacking yNaa50 than in wild-type yeast. In contrast, the ectopically expressed hNaa50 resulted, predominantly, in the Nt-acetylation of N-terminal Met (iMet) starting N-termini, including iMet-Lys, iMet-Val, iMet-Ala, iMet-Tyr, iMet-, iMet-Leu, iMet-Ser, and iMet- N-termini. This identified hNaa50 as being similar, in its substrate specificity, to the previously characterized hNaa60/NatF. In addition, the identification, in yNaa50-lacking yeast expressing hNaa50, of Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue such as Ser, , Ala, or Val, revealed a kinetic competition between Naa50 and Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), and implied that Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue cannot be removed by MetAPs, a deduction supported by our in vitro data. As such, Naa50-mediated Nt-acetylation may act to retain the iMet of proteins of otherwise MetAP susceptible N-termini and the fraction of retained and Nt-acetylated iMet (followed by a small residue) in such a setting would be expected to depend on the relative levels of ribosome-associated Naa50/NatA and MetAPs.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The effects of these mutations were assessed here using both steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic methods. While G50S and G52S reduced the apparent affinity for ATP by approximately 10-fold, substitution at Gly55 had no effect on nucleotide binding. In contrast to ATP, only mutation at position 50 interfered with ADP binding. These three mutations lowered the rate of phosphoryl transfer by 7-300-fold. The combined data indicate that G50 and G52 are the most critical residues in the loop for catalysis, with replacement at position 52 being the most extreme owing to a larger decrease in the rate of phosphoryl transfer (29 vs 1.6 s-1 in contrast to 500 s-1 for wild-type C). Surprisingly, all three mutations lowered the affinity for Kemptide by approximately 10-fold, although none of the loop glycines makes direct contact with the substrate. The inability to correlate the rate constant for net product release with the dissociation constant for ADP implies that other steps may limit the decomposition of the ternary product complex. The observations that G52S (a) selectively affects ATP binding and (b) significantly lowers the rate of phosphoryl transfer without making direct contact with either the nucleotide or the peptide imply that this residue serves a structural role in the loop, most likely by positioning the backbone amide of Ser53 for contacting the gamma-phosphate of ATP. -minimized models of the mutant proteins are consistent with the observed kinetic consequences of each mutation.

Further, the residues Lys 18,  20, Ala 21, Val 22,  46, Glu 48, Lys 50, Lys 58,  75, Gln 77, Arg 97 and Ile 98 form hot point motif, which on interaction enhances BDNF's function.These results suggest that PUFAs and their metabolites especially, LXA4, modulate insulin resistance by establishing a physical interaction with BDNF. Similar interaction(s) was noted between BDNF and resolvins and protectins but were of lesser intensity compared to LXA4.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590064>N-terminal domains of ARC1 are essential for interaction with the N-terminal region of Exo70A1 in transducing self-incompatibility of Brassica oleracea.</a></h2><p>Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mating system to prevent inbreeding and promote outcrossing. ARC1 and Exo70A1 function as the downstream targets of the S-locus receptor kinase and play conservative roles in Brassica SI signaling. Based on the sequence homology, Exo70A1 is divided into four subdomains: leucine zipper (Leu(128)-Leu(149)), hypervariable region (Ser(172)-Leu(197)), SUMO modification motif (Glu(260)-Ile(275)), and pfamExo70 domain (His(271)-(627)). ARC1 contains four domains as follows: leucine zipper (Leu(116)-Leu(137)), coiled-coil domain ((210)-Val(236)), U-box (Asp(282)-Trp(347)) motif, and ARM (Ala(415)-(611)) domain. Bioinformatics analysis, yeast two-hybrid screening and pull-down assays show that leucine zipper and coiled-coil motifs of ARC1116-236 are required for the interaction with Exo70A1, while the addition of ARM motif results in loss of the interaction with Exo70A1. Meanwhile, the N-terminal of Exo70A1 without any domains shows a weak interaction with ARC1, and the level of LacZ expression increases with addition of leucine zipper and reaches the maximum value with hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif, indicating that hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif of Exo70A1172-275 is mainly responsible for the binding with ARC1, whereas pfamExo70 domain has little affinity for ARC1. Lys(181) located in the Exo70A1 hypervariable region may be the ubiquitination site mediating the interaction between ARC1 and Exo70A1. Therefore, both the leucine zipper with coiled-coil structure of ARC1116-236, and the hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif of Exo70A1172-275 are the core interaction domains between ARC1 and Exo70A1. Any factors affecting these core domains would be the regulators of ARC1 mediating ubiquitin degradation in self-incompatible system.© The Author 2016.

The fluorescent assay was used to monitor proteinase production, purification, and inhibition. The Km for the fluorogenic substrate, 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoyl-gamma-aminobutyryl-Ile-His-Pro - -His-Leu-Val-Ile-His-- [5-(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, was found to be 4.3 microM at the optimum pH of 4.5. Reaction products were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid analysis or by 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectrometry. Cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate was between the histidine-threonine residues, releasing the fluorescent product, threonine-[5-(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. Proteolytic activity was expressed as nanomoles of fluorescent product released at 22 degrees C/60 min, pH 4.5, and the release of 0.9 nmol product was equivalent to one hemoglobin proteolytic unit (O.D.A700 increase of 0.100) produced at 37 degrees C/60 min, pH 3.5. The aspartic proteinase inhibitor pepstatin had an IC50 of 27 nM when tested in a dose-response study with the purified enzyme. The apparent Ki for pepstatis was 2.9 nM. Several synthetic inhibitors of the enzymes were identified with IC50's in the nanomolar range. The most potent compound, A70450, was characterized as a fast, tight-binding inhibitor having an IC50 of 1.3 nM and apparent Ki of 0.17 nM.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2738058>Purification and characterization of an N-acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase from rabbit muscle.</a></h2><p>An N-acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase has been purified to homogeneity (7,000-fold with 20% yield) from rabbit muscle. This overall enrichment and its general properties as a soluble protein suggest that it is of cytosolic origin and not a component of ribosomes or other cellular organelles. The enzyme has an Mr of 230,000-245,000 and a subunit Mr of 76,000-80,000. An extensive survey of the substrate specificity of the pure enzyme reveals that our earlier conclusions (Radhakrishna, G., and Wold, F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9572-9575) that the enzyme is specific for Ac-Met-peptides are wrong. The enzyme catalyzes the rapid removal of Ac-, Ac-Ala, Ac-Met, Ac-Ser, and more slowly Ac-Gly from peptides of different lengths. Other acetylated amino acids (Cys, Tyr, Asp, Val, , Ile, Leu) may be removed at 1% or less of the rate of the above good substrates from some peptide substrates. The nature of the amino acid in the second position of the acetylated peptide generally has only a minor effect on the reaction rate; however, with charged amino acids (Arg, Asp) in the second position the reaction is retarded, and with proline it is virtually abolished. Except for slow rate of hydrolysis of acetylated dipeptides, the hydrolase does not appear to be severely affected by the peptide length in the range studied (from 2 to 11 amino acid residues). The hydrolase also cleaves formylamino acids from formylated peptides. The biological function of the enzyme is not clear.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541889>Five functional adipokinetic peptides expressed in the corpus cardiacum of the moth genus Hippotion (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae).</a></h2><p>This is the first study that finds five adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) in the corpus cardiacum of an insect. From two species of the sphingid moth genus Hippotion, eson and celerio, three novel and two known AKHs were isolated and sequenced by deduction from multiple MS(n) electrospray mass data: two octapeptides are pGlu-Leu----Ser-Ser-Trp amide (denoted Hipes-AKH-I) and its (7) analogue (Hipes-AKH-II); two nonapeptides are pGlu-Leu----Ser-Ser-Trp-Gly amide (Manse-AKH) and its (7) analogue (Hipes-AKH-III), as well as a decapeptide pGlu-Leu---Ser-Ser-Gly-Trp-Gly-Gln amide (Manse-AKH-II). All sequences were confirmed by identical behaviour of natural and synthetic peptides in reversed-phase HPLC and liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry, resulting in identical retention times and tandem mass spectral data. High resolution mass spectrometry and retention time data also confirmed that the amino acid at position 10 in Manse-AKH-II is Gln and not the isobaric Lys. Conspecific injections of all five peptides in synthetic form and low doses caused hyperlipaemia in H. eson. Our results and pertaining literature suggest that five genes code for the mature peptides, which are very likely released during flight to provide energy for long distance migration in this genus via  oxidation; as all five peptides are active at low doses in a conspecific bioassay, it may be speculated, but not proven, that there is only one AKH receptor present in Hippotion that can bind all five peptides with high affinity.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
