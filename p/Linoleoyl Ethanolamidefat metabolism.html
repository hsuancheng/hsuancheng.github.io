<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558037>Synthesis of phenoxyacyl-ethanolamides and their effects on fatty acid amide hydrolase activity.</a></h1><p>N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are involved in numerous biological activities in plant and animal systems. The metabolism of these lipids by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a key regulatory point in NAE signaling activity. Several active site-directed inhibitors of FAAH have been identified, but few compounds have been described that enhance FAAH activity. Here we synthesized two sets of phenoxyacyl-ethanolamides from natural products, 3-n-pentadecylphenolethanolamide and cardanolethanolamide, with structural similarity to NAEs and characterized their effects on the hydrolytic activity of FAAH. Both compounds increased the apparent Vmax of recombinant FAAH proteins from both plant (Arabidopsis) and mammalian (Rattus) sources. These NAE-like compounds appeared to act by reducing the negative feedback regulation of FAAH activity by free ethanolamine. Both compounds added to seedlings relieved, in part, the negative growth effects of exogenous NAE12:0. Cardanolethanolamide reduced neuronal viability and exacerbated oxidative stress-mediated cell death in primary cultured neurons at nanomolar concentrations. This was reversed by FAAH inhibitors or exogenous NAE substrate. Collectively, our data suggest that these phenoxyacyl-ethanolamides act to enhance the activity of FAAH and may stimulate the turnover of NAEs in vivo. Hence, these compounds might be useful pharmacological tools for manipulating FAAH-mediated regulation of NAE signaling in plants or animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681513>Role of anorectic N-acylethanolamines in intestinal physiology and satiety control with respect to dietary fat.</a></h1><p>Anandamide is a well-known agonist for the cannabinoid receptors. Along with endogenous anandamide other non-endocannabinoid N-acylethanolamines are also formed, apparently in higher amounts. These include mainly oleoylethanolamide (OEA), palmitoyelethanolamide (PEA) and linoleoylethanolamide (LEA), and they have biological activity by themselves being anorectic and anti-inflammatory. It appears that the major effect of dietary fat on the level of these molecules is in the gastrointestinal system, where OEA, PEA and LEA in the enterocytes may function as homeostatic signals, which are decreased by prolonged consumption of a high-fat diet. These lipid amides appear to mediate their signaling activity via activation of PPARα in the enterocyte followed by activation of afferent vagal fibers leading to the brain. Through this mechanism OEA, PEA and LEA may both reduce the consumption of a meal as well as increase the reward value of the food. Thus, they may function as homeostatic intestinal signals involving hedonic aspects that contribute to the regulation of the amounts of dietary fat to be ingested.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The exact enzymatic pathways involved in their biosynthesis in specific tissues are not clarified. It has been suggested that endogenous anandamide could stimulate food intake by activation of cannabinoid receptors in the brain and/or in the intestinal tissue. On the other hand, endogenous OEA and PEA have been suggested to inhibit food intake by acting on receptors in the intestine. At present, there is no clear role for endogenous anandamide in controlling food intake via cannabinoid receptors, neither centrally nor in the gastrointestinal tract. However, OEA, PEA and perhaps also LEA may be involved in regulation of food intake by selective prolongation of feeding latency and post-meal interval. These N-acylethanolamines seem to be formed locally in the intestine, where they can activate PPARalpha located in close proximity to their site of synthesis. The rapid onset of OEA response and its reliance on an intact vagus nerve suggests that activation of PPARalpha does not result in formation of a transcription-dependent signal but must rely on an unidentified non-genomic signal that translates to activation of vagal afferents. Whether GPR119, TRPV1 and/or intestinal ceramide levels also contribute to the anorectic and weight-reducing effect of exogenous OEA is less clear. Prolonged intake of dietary fat (45 %) may promote over-consumption of food by decreasing the endogenous levels of OEA, PEA and LEA in the intestine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24151297>Ethanolamide oxylipins of linolenic acid can negatively regulate Arabidopsis seedling development.</a></h1><p>N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are fatty-acid derivatives with potent biological activities in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. Polyunsaturated NAEs are among the most abundant NAE types in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, and they can be metabolized by either fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) or by lipoxygenase (LOX) to low levels during seedling establishment. Here, we identify and quantify endogenous oxylipin metabolites of N-linolenoylethanolamine (NAE 18:3) in Arabidopsis seedlings and show that their levels were higher in faah knockout seedlings. Quantification of oxylipin metabolites in lox mutants demonstrated altered partitioning of NAE 18:3 into 9- or 13-LOX pathways, and this was especially exaggerated when exogenous NAE was added to seedlings. When maintained at micromolar concentrations, NAE 18:3 specifically induced cotyledon bleaching of light-grown seedlings within a restricted stage of development. Comprehensive oxylipin profiling together with genetic and pharmacological interference with LOX activity suggested that both 9-hydroxy and 13-hydroxy linolenoylethanolamides, but not corresponding free fatty-acid metabolites, contributed to the reversible disruption of thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts of seedling cotyledons. We suggest that NAE oxylipins of linolenic acid represent a newly identified, endogenous set of bioactive compounds that may act in opposition to progression of normal seedling development and must be depleted for successful establishment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25752187>Lipoxygenase-derived 9-hydro(pero)xides of linoleoylethanolamide interact with ABA signaling to arrest root development during Arabidopsis seedling establishment.</a></h1><p>Ethanolamide-conjugated fatty acid derivatives, also known as N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), occur at low levels (μg per g) in desiccated seeds, and endogenous amounts decline rapidly with seedling growth. Linoleoylethanolamide (NAE18:2) is the most abundant of these NAEs in seeds of almost all plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, NAE18:2 may be oxidized by lipoxygenase (LOX) or hydrolyzed by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) during normal seedling establishment, and this contributes to the normal progression of NAE depletion that is coincident with the depletion of abscisic acid (ABA). Here we provide biochemical, genetic and pharmacological evidence that a specific 9-LOX metabolite of NAE18:2 [9-hydro(pero)xy linoleoylethanolamide (9-NAE-H(P)OD)] has a potent negative influence on seedling root elongation, and acts synergistically with ABA to modulate the transition from embryo to seedling growth. Genetic analyses using mutants in ABA synthesis (aba1 and aba2), perception (pyr1, pyl1, pyl2, pyl4, pyl5 and pyl8) or transcriptional activation (abi3-1) indicated that arrest of root growth by 9-NAE-H(P)OD requires an intact ABA signaling pathway, and probably operates to increase ABA synthesis as part of a positive feedback loop to modulate seedling establishment in response to adverse environmental conditions. These results identify a specific, bioactive ethanolamide oxylipin metabolite of NAE18:2, different from those of ethanolamide-conjugated linolenic acid (NAE18:3), as well as a molecular explanation for its inhibitory action, emphasizing the oxidative metabolism of NAEs as an important feature of seedling development.© 2015 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855974>High-fat diet-induced insulin resistance does not increase plasma anandamide levels or potentiate anandamide insulinotropic effect in isolated canine islets.</a></h1><p>Obesity has been associated with elevated plasma anandamide levels. In addition, anandamide has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in vitro, suggesting that anandamide might be linked to hyperinsulinemia.To determine whether high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance increases anandamide levels and potentiates the insulinotropic effect of anandamide in isolated pancreatic islets.Dogs were fed a high-fat diet (n = 9) for 22 weeks. Abdominal fat depot was quantified by MRI. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Fasting plasma endocannabinoid levels were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All metabolic assessments were performed before and after fat diet regimen. At the end of the study, pancreatic islets were isolated prior to euthanasia to test the in vitro effect of anandamide on islet hormones. mRNA expression of cannabinoid receptors was determined in intact islets. The findings in vitro were compared with those from animals fed a control diet (n = 7).Prolonged fat feeding increased abdominal fat content by 81.3±21.6% (mean±S.E.M, P<0.01). In vivo insulin sensitivity decreased by 31.3±12.1% (P<0.05), concomitant with a decrease in plasma 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (from 39.1±5.2 to 15.7±2.0 nmol/L) but not anandamide, oleoyl ethanolamide, , or palmitoyl ethanolamide. In control-diet animals (body weight: 28.8±1.0 kg), islets incubated with anandamide had a higher basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as compared with no treatment. Islets from fat-fed animals (34.5±1.3 kg; P<0.05 versus control) did not exhibit further potentiation of anandamide-induced insulin secretion as compared with control-diet animals. Glucagon but not somatostatin secretion in vitro was also increased in response to anandamide, but there was no difference between groups (P = 0.705). No differences in gene expression of CB1R or CB2R between groups were found.In canines, high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance does not alter plasma anandamide levels or further potentiate the insulinotropic effect of anandamide in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20959516>Dietary fat decreases intestinal levels of the anorectic lipids through a fat sensor.</a></h1><p>This study was undertaken to investigate the link between dietary fat content and intestinal levels of anorectic N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), including oleoylethanolamide (OEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and linoleoylethanolamide (LEA). Male rats were fed high-fat diets (HFDs) with variable percentages of fat [20-45% of total  (E%)] for 1-7 d; afterward, the jejunums were isolated, and jejunal NAE levels were measured by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Enzyme activities and mRNA expression levels were measured for two synthesizing enzymes, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE1), and one degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). We found a dose-response relation between the quantity/percentage of dietary fat, irrespective of the  density, and the reduction of intestinal levels of OEA, PEA, and LEA. The reductions were present after 1 d of 45E% HFD. LEA, the major NAE species, was shown to have an anorectic potency slightly less than that of OEA but higher than PEA. Regulation at the enzyme level seems not to explain the changes in NAE levels. The results suggest the presence of a fat sensor, mediating the reduced intestinal NAE levels. The intestinal NAE levels are reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to dietary fat intake, and this may contribute to the well-known hyperphagic effect of HFDs.</p></html>
