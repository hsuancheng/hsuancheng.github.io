<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal microbiota.</a></h2><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and %) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in  gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and % of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680281></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680256></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668932>Z-505, an Oral Ghrelin Receptor Agonist, Attenuates Anorexia After Total Gastrectomy in Rats.</a></h2><p>Anorexia is a serious problem in patients with gastric cancer who have undergone gastrectomy. Ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone primarily secreted from the stomach, has been proposed to prevent anorexia. Significant reduction in plasma ghrelin levels after gastrectomy may contribute to lack of appetite and  loss. In this study, we investigated the effects of Z-505, a ghrelin receptor agonist, on anorexia after total gastrectomy (TG) in a rat model.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish a TG model, and then sham-operated (control) and TG rats were randomly assigned to four subgroups receiving administration of Z-505 (100 mg/kg, p.o., once daily) or vehicle for 14 d from day 14 to day 27 after TG. The food intake, , and fat  were evaluated during the test period. Moreover, the neuronal activity in the hypothalamus was evaluated on day 21 to investigate the mechanism of action of Z-505.In TG rats, Z-505 significantly improved the decrease in cumulative food intake induced by the surgery over 14 d (TG + vehicle; 213.8 ± 15.3 g, n = 12 versus TG + Z-505; 258. ± 13.1 g, n = 14, P < 0.05). Z-505 also significantly increased fat  and had a milder effect on  over 14 d. In addition, Z-505 significantly increased the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (TG + vehicle; 17.8 ± .0, n = 12 versus TG + Z-505; 72. ± 11.8, n = 12, P < 0.001).Z-505 may be a useful therapeutic treatment for anorexia after TG.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The comparative efficacy of various bariatric procedures for the remission of type  diabetes has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to compare the effects of the two most common bariatric procedures, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, on remission of diabetes and β-cell function.We conducted a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised trial at Vestfold Hospital Trust (Tønsberg, Norway), in which patients (aged ≥18 years) with type  diabetes and obesity were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (the Oseberg study). Randomisation was performed with a computerised random number generator and a block size of 10. Treatment allocation was masked from participants, study personnel, and outcome assessors and was concealed with sealed opaque envelopes. Surgeons used identical skin incisions during both surgeries and were not involved in patient follow-up. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of participants with complete remission of type  diabetes (HbA of ≤6·0% [42 mmol/mol] without the use of glucose-lowering medication) at 1 year after surgery. The primary physiological outcome was disposition index (a measure of β-cell function) at 1 year after surgery, as assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Primary outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial is ongoing and closed to recruitment, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between Oct 15, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017, 1305 patients who were preparing for bariatric surgery were screened, of whom 319 consecutive patients with type  diabetes were assessed for eligibility. 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to gastric bypass (n=54) or sleeve gastrectomy (n=55). 107 (98%) of 109 patients completed 1-year follow-up, with one patient in each group withdrawing after surgery (per-protocol population). In the intention-to-treat population, diabetes remission rates were higher in the gastric bypass group than in the sleeve gastrectomy group (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 44]; relative risk [RR] 1·57 [1·14 to ·16], p=0·0054); results were similar in the per-protocol population (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 45]; RR 1·57 [1·14 to ·15], p=0·0036). In the intention-to-treat population, disposition index increased in both groups (between-group difference 55 [-111 to 220], p=0·52); results were similar in the per-protocol population (between-group difference 21 [-214 to 256], p=0.86). In the gastric bypass group, ten of 54 participants had early complications and 17 of 53 had late side-effects. In the sleeve gastrectomy group, eight of 55 participants had early complications and 22 of 54 had late side-effects. No deaths occurred in either group.Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type  diabetes at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on β-cell function. The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with obesity and type  diabetes could improve diabetes care and reduce related societal costs.Morbid Obesity Centre, Vestfold Hospital Trust.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, VANFUN, CNKI, and VTTMS) were searched using index words to find relevant studies published before November 2018. Meta-analyses of relative risk (RR) were performed for the identification of risk factors. RESULTS Data from 22 cohort studies (2270 infants with and 21 605 infants without NI) were included in the meta-analysis. Infant  of <2500 g (RR: 3.44, 95% CI: .31-5.11), gestational age of <37 weeks (RR: 3.85, 95% CI: 1.87-7.92), mechanical ventilation use (RR: 3.16, 95% CI: .21-4.50), venipuncture (RR: 3.01, 95% CI: 1.20-7.57), the incidence of asphyxia (RR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.04-.71), and feeding intolerance (RR: .12, 95% CI: 1.60-.81) were identified as the risk factors for the incidence of NI. There was no significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that <2500 g infant , gestational age of <37 weeks, mechanical ventilation utility, venipuncture, asphyxia incidence, and feeding intolerance are the risk factors for NI nosocomial infection in infants in NICU.

We investigated whether UA levels are altered among adolescents with ED.Morning salivary UA concentrations were compared between adolescents referred to treatment at the Herman Dana Center receiving a DSM-V diagnosis of an ED and matched healthy controls.Salivary UA was significantly elevated among ED compared with control values (ED mean 3.9 ± 1. mg/dl, control mean .9 ± 1.9 mg/dl, t = - 3.13 df = 81, p = 0.003).Salivary UA is elevated among adolescents with ED. Further studies are required to replicate and extend this finding and evaluate its generalizability as a state or trait marker as regards ED subtypes, other  fluids (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid), and recovery or premorbid stages, as well as its putative mechanistic relevance to ED.Level III, case-control analytic study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667208>An osteogenic helioxanthin derivative suppresses the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.</a></h2><p>The helioxanthin derivative 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thieno[,3-b:5,4-c']dipyridine--carboxamide (TH) is a low-molecular- compound that was identified through screening for osteogenic compounds that enhance the activity of mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we found that TH suppressed osteoclast differentiation.Using the hematopoietic stem cells of ddY mice, TH was added to the culture in the experimental group, and the number of osteoclasts was measured with rhodamine phalloidin staining and TRAP staining. In osteo assay, bone resorption area was compared by the von Kossa staining.Specifically, TH inhibited the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-degrading activity of phosphodiesterase (PDE), promoted nitric oxide (NO) production, and dose-dependently suppressed osteoclast differentiation in an osteoclast formation culture of mouse bone marrow cells. The NO-competitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) attenuated the suppressive activity of TH on osteoclast differentiation. Conclusion: Given the previously reported suppressive action of cGMP on osteoclastogenesis, our data suggest that TH negatively impacts osteoclast differentiation at least to some extent by stimulating NO production and inhibiting PDE activity, both of which lead to the upregulation of intracellular cGMP. This study supports the potential use of TH as a novel antiosteoporotic reagent that not only stimulates bone formation but also inhibits bone resorption.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

This study makes use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to 1) examine differences in the contextual factors, including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and overall atmosphere, between meal and snack occasions; and ) explore differences in the context of snacking occasions across children's gender and  status. Data for the current study came from the Family Matters Study, which included 150 families with children aged 5-7 years old (n = 25 from each of the following groups: Black/African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, White). Parents completed an 8-day EMA observation period, during which they were surveyed after each eating occasion with the study child; questions explored contextual factors including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and the overall atmosphere of each eating occasion. Differences between meals and snacks were observed; a smaller percentage of snacks (compared to meals) were prepared by the parent, consisted of only homemade food, and were planned ahead of time, as opposed to being served in response to a child's request. Snacks were more likely than other meals to be eaten on the couch and in the presence of a screen. Furthermore, important differences in snacking context were observed by child gender and  status. Findings illuminate opportunities to improve children's overall dietary intake via interventions focused on improving the quality of foods served during snacks, as well as the contextual environment in which snacks are eaten.Copyright © 2019.

Ponds 1 and  were fed with Conventional Feed (fish meal) and ponds 3 and 4 were fed with Formulated Feed (Soybean +  + ). Water quality parameters like surface water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, chlorophyll  and organic carbon were monitored for 195 days. Significant variation (p < 0.05) in the water quality parameters were observed during the culture period between ponds respectively. Growth parameters like daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and condition index (CI) were monitored simultaneously which showed a discrete growth during the first 90 days and then a stable growth form. Length and  relationship of prawns were calculated for all the culture ponds which showed highly positive relationship (p < 0.01) proving unique contribution of feed towards the growth of prawns. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) values (Ranging from .74 ± .05 to .95 ± 0.04) also proved the greater acceptance of feed towards the growth of prawns. Biochemical analysis of the feed and prawn (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and astaxanthin) also proved the feed efficiency towards growth and coloration of prawn.

While the guidelines for pediatric surgeries remained to be explored. The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of an ERAS protocol for Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) infants undergoing pull-through procedures.An infant-specific ERAS protocol was developed and implemented at multiple centers from June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The study included 145 consecutive patients who underwent pull-through surgery for HSCR in three Children's hospitals. Patients were primarily divided into three groups based on the clinical classification and surgical methods. Group I included patients with the short segment type who received transanal endorectal pull-through (TEPT) surgery. Group II comprised of patients with the classical type and long segment type who received laparoscopic-assisted pull-through (LAPT) surgery. Group III involved patients with the long segment type (who had received ileostomy or colostomy during the neonatal period) and total colonic aganglionosis who received open pull-through (OPPT) surgery. Patients in the three groups mentioned above were randomly and equally assigned into the ERAS group and traditional (TRAD) group with random number table row randomization. The primary outcome was the length of postoperative hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes of interest included white blood cell (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) on postoperative day 1 (POD 1), the blood glucose at the time of anesthesia and 24 h after surgery, time to first defecation, time to regular diet, plasma markers of nutrition status on POD 5, plasma natrium on POD 5, the mean intraoperative fluid volume, time to discontinuation of intravenous infusion, incidence of postoperative complications, re-admission within 30 days, hospitalization costs, parental satisfaction, and growth from admission to 6 months after surgery.73 and 75 patients were assigned to the TRAD and ERAS groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in demographic data. The LOS decreased from 9.5 days in the TRAD group to 7.9 days (P < 0.001) in the ERAS group. WBC count on POD 1 showed no significant difference between the two groups. CRP on POD 1 in the ERAS group was significantly lower (P < 0.001). In the ERAS group, the blood glucose was higher at anesthesia compared to the TRAD group (P < 0.001). On the contrary, the blood glucose at 24 h after surgery was significantly lower in the ERAS group (P < 0.001). Intraoperative fluid volume was lower in the EARS group (P < 0.001). ERAS could also reduce the time to first defecation (P < 0.001), discontinuation of intravenous infusion (P < 0.001) and regular diet (P < 0.001). In the ERAS group, the concentrations of prealbumin and retinol conjugated protein on POD 5 were higher than those in the TRAD group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). The plasma natrium had no difference in the two groups on POD 5 (P > 0.05). The rate of complications (P > 0.05) and 30-day re-admission (P > 0.05) were not significantly different between the two groups. Hospitalization costs were also reduced (P < 0.001). ERAS group has a higher parental satisfaction rate, although there was no statistical difference (96% vs 89%). There was no difference in growth between the ERAS and the TRAD groups from admission to 6 months after the surgery ( for age z score: P > 0.05,  for length z score: P > 0.05). We also found that the shortening of LOS by the application of ERAS protocol was more obvious in the OPPT group (-.5 ± 1.0) than that in the TEPT (-1.9 ± 1.3) and LAPT (-1.3 ± 0.4) groups.Implementation of the ERAS protocol in infants undergoing HSCR pull-through operations is safe and efficient. The ERAS protocol is worthy of recommendation.Clinical Trials.gov identifier: .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Thus, DOAC therapy in this population remains controversial.  To investigate rivaroxaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation identified as extremely obese or of high .  A retrospective chart review was performed at  academic medical centers in patients ≥18 years old and BMI >40 kg/m or  >120 kg, newly initiated on warfarin or rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation or VTE treatment. The primary end point was incidence of clinical failure, defined as VTE recurrence, stroke incidence, and mortality, within 12 months of initiation. Secondary end points included length of stay (LOS) and bleeding complications.  A total of 176 patients were included, with 84 and 92 patients in the rivaroxaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Clinical failure was lower in the rivaroxaban group but did not reach statistical significance when compared with warfarin (5% vs 13%;  = 0.06). LOS was significantly shorter in the rivaroxaban arm ( days [1-3] vs 4 days [-7],  < 0.0001). Percentage of bleeding complications was higher in the rivaroxaban arm but not statistically significant (8% vs %,  = 0.06).  Although not statistically significant, rivaroxaban trended toward a lower incidence of clinical failure while demonstrating a significantly shorter LOS when compared with warfarin for VTE treatment or atrial fibrillation in morbidly obese or high- patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670603>Naringenin Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Rate: A Case Study.</a></h2><p>Our studies in primary human adipocytes show that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, increases oxygen consumption rate and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), glucose transporter type 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes.

It is unclear what walking speeds and durations significantly affect plantar tissue viability and risks for foot ulcers in non-diabetics and diabetics.The aim of this study was to establish the normal response of plantar skin blood flow to different speeds and durations of walking exercise in non-diabetics that would be needed to quantify impaired responses in diabetics.Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure plantar skin blood flow of the first metatarsal head in 12 non-diabetics. A 3 ×  factorial design, including 3 speeds (slow at 3 km/h, moderate at 6 km/h, and fast at 9 km/h) and  durations (10 and 20 min), was used in this study. Skin blood flow after walking was expressed as a ratio of skin blood flow before walking. The 3 ×  two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated  was used to examine the main effects of speeds and durations and their interaction.The walking speed significantly affected skin blood flow responses (p < 0.01). Walking at 9 km/h significantly increased plantar skin blood flow (5.71 ± 1.89) compared to walking at 6 km/h (.1 ± 0.29) and 3 km/h (1.16 ± 0.14), especially at 20-minute walking duration (p < 0.01). The walking duration showed a trend of significance on affecting skin blood flow responses (p = 0.06).

One-third of VLBW infants received life support compared with 65% of non-VLBW. Surgery was reported for 34% of VLBW and 68% of non-VLBW infants. Congenital heart disease was reported in 8% of VLBW and 36% of non-VLBW, with conotruncal abnormalities most common. Survival exceeded 50% for infants >2500 g and >37 weeks of gestation.Survival of VLBW infants with ectopia cordis was poor and substantially worse compared with non-VLBW, with notable discrepancies in resuscitative efforts and surgical interventions. Although gestational age and  strongly influence current survival, more detailed information regarding the severity of cardiac and noncardiac abnormalities is required to fully determine prognosis and inform counseling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years,  mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole- stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4 pathways following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue metabolism and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate metabolism). More pathways were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino acid, tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean  mass.These preliminary data show different metabolic changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, -bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean  mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669555>Optimization, stabilization, and characterization of amphotericin B loaded nanostructured lipid carriers for ocular drug delivery.</a></h2><p>The current study sought to formulate, optimize, and stabilize amphotericin B (AmB) loaded PEGylated nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and to study its ocular biodistribution following topical instillation. AmB loaded PEGylated NLC (AmB-PEG-NLC) were fabricated by hot-melt emulsification followed by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) technique. 1,-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)] (mPEG-2K-DSPE) was used for surface PEGylation. mPEG-DSPE with different PEG molecular , 1K, 2K, 5K, 10K, and 20K, were screened for formulation stability. Furthermore, the AmB loaded PEGylated (2K) NLC (AmB-PEG2K-NLC) was optimized using Box-Behnken design with respect to the amount of AmB, castor oil, mPEG-2K-DSPE, and number of high-pressure homogenization cycles as the factors; particle size, zeta potential, PDI, entrapment efficiency, and loading efficiency as responses. Stability of the optimized AmB-PEG2K-NLC was assessed over 4 weeks, at 4°C as well as 25°C and effect of autoclaving was also evaluated. AmB-PEG2K-NLC were tested for their in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), AmB resistant Candida albicans (ATCC 200955) and Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC 204305). Cytotoxicity of AmB-PEG2K-NLC was studied in human retinal pigmented epithelium cells. In vivo ocular biodistribution of AmB was evaluated in rabbits, following topical application of PEGylated NLCs or marketed AmB preparations. PEGylation with mPEG-2K-DSPE prevented leaching of AmB and increased the drug load significantly. The optimized formulation was prepared with a particle size of 218 ± 5 nm; 0.3 ± 0.02 PDI, 4.6 ± 0.1% (w/w) drug loading, and 92.7 ± .5% (w/w) entrapment efficiency. The optimized colloidal dispersions were stable for over a month, at both 4°C and 25°C. AmB-PEG2K-NLCs showed significantly (p<0.05) better antifungal activity in both wild-type and AmB resistant Candida strains and, was comparable to, or better than, commercially available parenteral AmB formulations like Fungizone and AmBisome®. AmB-PEG2K-NLC did not show any toxicity up to a highest concentration of 1% (v/v) (percent formulation in medium). Following topical instillation, AmB was detected in all the ocular tissues tested and statistically significant (p>0.05) difference was not observed between the formulations tested. An optimized autoclavable and effective AmB-PEG2K-NLC ophthalmic formulation with at least one-month stability, in the reconstituted state, has been developed.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International Diabetes Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and  mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal  individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Work related rhinitis was more common in acrylate than isocyanate-induced asthma (p<0.001). The increase in post-challenge fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was significantly greater in acrylate-induced OA (26.0, 8.-38.0 ppb) than in OA induced by other LMW agents (3.0, -1.0-10.0 ppb, p<0.001) or isocyanates (5.0, .0-16.0 ppb, p=0.010). Multivariable models confirmed that OA induced by acrylates was significantly and independently associated with a post-challenge increase in FeNO (≥17.5 ppb).Acrylate-induced OA shows specific characteristics, concomitant work-related rhinitis and exposure-related increases in FeNO, suggesting that acrylates may induce asthma through different immunological mechanisms than other LMW agents. Our findings reinforce the need for a re-evaluation of the hazard classification of acrylates, and further investigation of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their respiratory sensitizing potential.Copyright © 2019.

This medicine has been used mainly for alleviating neuropathic pains for centuries in Korean traditional medicine. KCHO-1 was developed to treat pain, joint contracture and muscular weakness in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study was carried out to investigate the chronic toxicity of KCHO-1 oral administration in rats for 26 weeks.Sprague-Dawely rats were divided into four groups and 10 rats were placed in the control group and the high-dose group, respectively. Group 1 was the control group and the remaining groups were the experimental groups. In the oral toxicity study, 500 mg/kg, 1,000 mg/kg, and ,000 mg/kg of KCHO-1 were administered to the experimental group, and 10 ml/kg of sterile distilled water was administered to the control group. Survival rate, , feed intake, clinical signs, and visual findings were examined. Urinalysis, ophthalmologic examination, necropsy, organ , hematologic examination, blood chemical examination and histopathologic examination were performed.Mortality and toxicological lesions associated with the administration of test substance were not observed in all groups.NOAEL(No observed adverse effect level) of KCHO-1 is higher than 2000 mg/kg/day.

The mechanism of protection is uncertain.The percentages of mediating effects of 19 biomarkers were determined by comparing the hazard ratios for the effect of randomized treatment from an unadjusted model and from a model adjusting for the biomarker of interest. Multivariable analyses were used to assess the joint effects of biomarkers that mediated most strongly in univariable analyses.Early changes after randomization in levels of 3 biomarkers (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, serum bicarbonate, and serum urate) were identified as mediating the effect of canagliflozin on heart failure. Average post-randomization levels of 14 biomarkers (systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, ,  mass index, gamma glutamyltransferase, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, serum albumin, erythrocyte concentration, serum bicarbonate, and serum urate) were identified as significant mediators. Individually, the 3 biomarkers with the largest mediating effect were erythrocyte concentration (45%), hemoglobin concentration (43%), and serum urate (40%). In a parsimonious multivariable model, erythrocyte concentration, serum urate, and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio were the 3 biomarkers that maximized cumulative mediation (102%).A diverse set of potential mediators of the effect of canagliflozin on heart failure were identified. Some mediating effects were anticipated, whereas others were not. The mediators that were identified support existing and novel hypothesized mechanisms for the prevention of heart failure with sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)  oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to  weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668855>Expression and purification of an immunogenic SUMO-OmpC fusion protein of Salmonella Typhimurium in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Salmonella is found to be a major causes of food borne diseases globally. Poultry products contaminated with this pathogen is one of the major sources of infections in humans. Outer membrane protein C (OmpC) of Salmonella Typhimurium is a promising DNA vaccine candidate to mitigate Salmonella infection in poultry. However, the large-scale production of bioactive recombinant OmpC (rOmpC) protein is hindered due to the formation of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The objective of this work was to attain high level expression of rOmpC protein, purify and evaluate its functional properties. The ompC gene was optimized and fused with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) gene for high level expression as soluble protein. The fusion protein with ~58 kDa molecular  was observed on SDS-PAGE gel. The expression levels of rOmpC fusion protein reached maximum of 38% of total soluble protein (TSP) after 8 h of 0.% rhamnose induction. Protein purification was carried out using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) purification column. Western blot were performed to analyse expression and immunoreactivity of rOmpC fusion protein. The results indicate that SUMO fusion system is ideal for large scale production of functional rOmpC fusion protein expression in E. coli.Copyright © 2019.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; () a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their energy intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in  gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and acid response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

Mcal/kg NEg), and finisher (FIN) for 13 d (73% SFC: 1.23 Mcal/kg NEg). Twenty British-crossbred, ruminally-cannulated steers (183 kg ± 44 kg) six months of age were blocked by  into five pens containing Calan gate feeders and received a control (CON) diet (17.% CP, 35.8% NDF, 86.7% DM) without LY on d -12 to d 0. After that, animals were randomly assigned to treatments (TRT), five animals per TRT: CON or LY at inclusion rates of 5 g/d (LY1), 10 g/d (LY2), or 15 g/d (LY3) top dressed every morning at 0800 for 45 d. The DMD and NDFD were assessed during seven separate collection days using in situ nylon bags containing 5 g of GRW, TRANS, or FIN diets, incubated at 1200 for 48 h. Protozoa counts (PC) were determined during five collection periods. Data were analyzed as a repeated measure within a randomized complete block design, assuming a random effect of the pen. For GRW, TRT altered the total gas production of the nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC) (P = 0.045) and the fractional rate of degradation (kd) of the fiber carbohydrate (FC) pool (P = 0.001) in a cubic pattern (P ≤ 0.05): LY2 had the most gas production and fastest kd. TRT also influenced DMD (P = 0.035) and NDFD (P = 0.012) with LY2 providing the greatest digestibility. For TRANS, TRT tended to affect the NFC kd (P =0.078) and influenced pH (P = 0.04) and DMD (P< 0.001) in which LY2 yielded the fastest kd, highest pH, and greatest DMD. For FIN, there was an effect of TRT on total gas production (P < 0.001) and kd (P = 0.004) of the NFC pool, FC kd (P = 0.012), in vitro CH4 concentration (P < 0.001), PC (P < 0.001), DMD (P = 0.039), and NDFD (P = 0.008). LY1 had the highest PC and provided the greatest DMD and NDFD. LY2 had the fastest kd of both the NFC and FC pools and had the least CH4 concentration. LY3 had the greatest NFC gas production. No specific dose-response pattern was observed, but 10 g/d provided the most beneficial result for all diets. We concluded that supplementation with LY affected IVGP as well as ruminal parameters and digestibilities.© The Author(s) 2019.

Selenium is a nutritionally essential trace metalloid well documented to elicit compelling pharmacological activities in vitro and in vivo. Report on the influence of selenium on arsenic-mediated behavioral derangement is lacking in literature. Hence, to fill this knowledge gap, rats were either exposed to arsenic per se in drinking water at 60 µg AsONa/L or co-administered with inorganic selenium at 0.25 mg/kg or organic selenium diphenyl diselenide (DPDS) at .5 mg/kg  for 45 successive days. Neurobehavioural data from rats in a new environment using video-tracking software evinced that inorganic and organic forms of selenium significantly (p < 0.05) abrogated arsenic-induced motor and locomotor insufficiencies such as increased negative geotaxis and fecal pellets numbers as well as the diminution in grip strength,  rotation, maximum speed, absolute turn angle and total distance travelled. The augmentation in the behavioral activities in rats co-administered with arsenic and both forms of selenium was substantiated using track and occupancy plots analyses. Selenium mitigated arsenic-induced decreases in glutathione level and acetylcholinesterase activity as well as the increase in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Moreover, selenium diminished inflammatory parameters (myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta levels), caspase-3 activity and ameliorated histological lesions in the cerebellum, cerebrum and liver of the rats. Collectively, selenium abated arsenic-induced behavioral derangements via anti-inflammation, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms in rats.Copyright © 2019.

The in vitro features of monolithic tablets were correlated with their in vivo behavior in order to provide a tool for the development of targeted formulations containing macromolecular bioactive agents. The impact of BS on various matrices (neutral, ionic) was studied in simulated fluids using the disintegration time (DT) as main parameter. Dry tablets were characterized by spectroscopic methods (X-ray diffraction and Infra-Red) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The selected formulations were followed in a beagle dog model. The in vivo and in vitro DT of tablets formulated with BS were compared. Results: anionic excipients carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and carboxymethylstarch (CMS) protected the active ingredient from the gastric acidity, ensuring its targeted delivery in the intestine. The SEM analysis, before and after transit in simulated fluids, showed that BS remained in the tablets allowing their good follow-up in vivo. The incorporation of 30% protein in tablets with 40% BS had no impact on their behavior.

Desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin, sirolimus and trimipramine, identified by in silico LINCS analysis as candidate treatments modulating the TBI-induced transcriptomics networks, were tested in neuron-BV2 microglial co-cultures, using tumour necrosis factor α as a monitoring biomarker for neuroinflammation, nitrite for nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity and microtubule associated protein -based immunostaining for neuronal survival. Based on (a) therapeutic time window in silico, (b) blood-brain barrier penetration and water solubility, (c) anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro ( < 0.05) and (d) target engagement of Nrf2 target genes ( < 0.05), desmethylclomipramine was validated in a lateral fluid-percussion model of TBI in rats. Despite the favourable in silico and in vitro outcomes, in vivo assessment of clomipramine, which metabolizes to desmethylclomipramine, failed to demonstrate favourable effects on motor and memory tests. In fact, clomipramine treatment worsened the composite neuroscore ( < 0.05).  loss ( < 0.05) and prolonged upregulation of plasma cytokines ( < 0.05) may have contributed to the worsened somatomotor outcome. Our pipeline provides a rational stepwise procedure for evaluating favourable and unfavourable effects of systems-biology discovered compounds that modulate post-TBI transcriptomics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667027>A Miniature Dual-Biomarker-Based Sensing and Conditioning Device for Closed-Loop DBS.</a></h2><p>In this paper, a dual-biomarker-based neural sensing and conditioning device is proposed for closing the feedback loop in deep brain stimulation devices. The device explores both local field potentials (LFPs) and action potentials (APs) as measured biomarkers. It includes two channels, each having four main parts: (1) a pre-amplifier with built-in low-pass filter, () a ground shifting circuit, (3) an amplifier with low-pass function, and (4) a high-pass filter.

More specifically, when certain samples in data sets encounter severe contamination, these methods cannot identify and filter out the ill ones, and thus lead to the functional degeneration of the associated models. To address this issue, we propose a general framework, named robust and sparse  learning (RSWL), to compute the adaptive  based on an objective for robustness and sparsity. More importantly, the degree of the sparsity is steerable, such that only k well-reserved samples are activated during the optimization of our model. As a result, the severely polluted or damaged samples are eliminated, and the robustness is ensured. The framework is further leveraged against a -D image reconstruction task. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678846>Cd accumulation, biomass and yield of rice are varied with silicon application at different growth phases under high concentration cadmium-contaminated soil.</a></h2><p>Many reports suggest that exogenous Si addition could reduce Cd translocation to aerial part and make grain safe for rice production. But it remains unclear whether its supplementation during different growth phases can differentially impact Cd uptake in rice. Here, Positive effects of Si applied at different growth phases on biomass and yield of rice were observed. Dry  of shoot including stem, leaf and grain was enhanced significantly by 15% when Si added at transplanting stage. Grain-yields supplied with Si at transplanting, jointing and heading stages were increased obviously by 14%, 11% and 12%, respectively. Higher percentage of filled spikelet and lower unfilled spikelet number per panicle were found when Si supplied at jointing stage. The increases of Cd accumulation in rice plants by Si application were mainly manifested in roots. Compared to CK, Cd accumulation in root when Si applied at transplanting and tillering stages were elevated by 75% and 64%, respectively. While Cd accumulation in aboveground tissues were all declined by Si addition. Bioconcentration and translocation factors were decreased significantly when Si added at jointing stage. In addition, higher soil pH, lowest available Cd-concentration in soil and Cd concentration in xylem sap at 15d after flowering were found when the Si was applied at jointing stage. Overall, Si application at transplanting would be more beneficial to the growth of rice and increased Cd content in root, while Si supplied at jointing would be more favorable for grain filling and reducing Cd accumulation in shoot.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A non-supplemented, methionine-deficient diet (NS) was used as control. Treatments were arranged in a  × 3 factorial completely randomized design with eight replications. Broilers in the EC group were infected with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria spp. (E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. praecox, and E. mitis) at 14 days of age. Performance analysis, light and electron microscopy of the jejunum, analysis of genes related to apoptosis and cell proliferation in the jejunum, and blood tests were performed at 6 days post-inoculation (dpi). EC broilers had poorer performance than UC broilers, regardless of diet (P < 0.001). Broilers fed the dl-Met diet had greater  gain (P = 0.004) and lower feed conversion ratio (P = 0.019) than broilers fed other diets. Jejunal sections from EC broilers fed the NS diet showed short (P = 0.001) and wide villi (P < 0.001) with increased crypt depth (P < 0.001) and reduced villus / crypt ratio (P = 0.001), jejunal absorptive surface area (P < 0.001), number of neutral goblet cells (Eimeria challenge: P = 0.048; diet P = 0.016), and mucin  (MUC2) gene expression (P = 0.018). EC birds fed the dl-MMet diet had higher enterocyte height (P < 0.001). Birds fed the dl-MMet diet had low lamina propria width (P = 0.009). UC broilers fed the dl-Met diet had the highest number of acidic goblet cells (P = 0.005), whereas EC broilers assigned the dl-MMet diet showed the highest number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (P = 0.033). Reduced expression of caspase-3 (CASP3) (P = 0.005), B-cell lymphoma  (BCL2) (P < 0.001), mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) (P < 0.001), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (RPS6KB1) (P < 0.001) genes was observed in EC animals. MTOR expression levels were highest in birds fed the dl-MMet diet (P = 0.004). Plasma activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was influenced by both diet (P = 0.002) and Eimeria challenge (P = 0.005), with EC broilers assigned the NS diet showing the highest levels. EC broilers fed the NS diet had higher creatine kinase (CK) activity (P = 0.049). EC broilers had lower plasma uric acid (P = 0.004) and higher serum mucoproteins level (P < 0.001). These results indicate that methionine dipeptide supplementation is able to mitigate the harmful intestinal effects of Eimeria spp. in broilers.© The Author(s) 2019.

The retrospective study included a total of 192 patients with ureteral stones, comprising 128 (66.7%) men and 64 (33.3%) women. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n: 125) consisted of people who spontaneously passed their stones, Group  (n: 67) consisted of people who could not pass stones spontaneously. The groups were compared with regard to the relationship between input data and stone passage rate by using both ANN and standard statistical tests. To implement the ANN, the patients were randomly divided into three groups: (a) training group (n = 132), (b) validation group (n = 30), and (c) test group (n = 30). The accuracy rate of ANN in the estimation of the stone passage ratio was 99.1% in the group a, 89.9% in the group b, and 87.3% in the group c. It was revealed that certain criteria (stone size, , pain score, ESR, and CRP) were relatively more significant for saving treatment cost and time and for avoiding unnecessary treatment. ANN can be highly useful for the avoidance of unnecessary interventions in patients with ureteral stones as it showed remarkably high performance in the estimation of stone passage rate (99.16%).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678099>Sexual Activity After Bariatric Surgery: A Prospective Monocentric Study Using the PISQ-IR Questionnaire.</a></h2><p>Obesity can lead to pelvic floor disorders, interfering with women's sexual life; Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-International Urogynecology Association-Revised (PISQ-IR) is a new instrument to measure sexual life in women with pelvic floor disorders.To assess the utility of using PISQ-IR in morbidly obese women undergoing bariatric surgery and to show the improvement of bariatric surgery on sexuality.This prospective monocentric study included all women who underwent bariatric surgery from June 2016-May 2017. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was performed by 1 surgeon, and data were collected by 1 researcher. Demographics, medical history, number of deliveries, and type of bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) were collected at baseline. At the 1-year follow-up consultation, postoperative complications, percentage of total  loss (TWL) and percentage excess  loss were assessed. Questionnaires were given at baseline and at 1-year follow-up.Postoperative complications and total  loss were measured at the 1-year follow-up. Sexual activity, using the PISQ-IR, and pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and anal incontinence, using the urinary symptom profile and PFDI (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory) 20, were compared before surgery and at 1-year follow-up.72 patients were included at baseline, 54 (75%) were considered for final analysis (30 RYGB and 24 SG), and 51 patients were considered for PISQ-IR. The mean preoperative  mass index was 41 ± 5.4 kg/m, and mean age was 43 ± 11.8 years. Both procedures induced an important  loss (mean TWL of 33%) and had a similar percentage of TWL for each procedure: 31 (15-46) for SG vs 34 (9-51) for RYGB. 9 patients (17 [6%]) became sexually active 1 year after surgery. For the sexually inactive population after 1 year, there was no differences in the PISQ-IR in the follow-up. When  mass index loss was >13 kg/m, a higher percentage of the sexually active population improved their different scores, and there were significant results for both global quality of life and desire (P = .026 and .046). The other questionnaires showed a significant decrease in urinary incontinence symptoms (P < .001) associated with  loss, whereas there was no difference in terms of pelvic organ prolapse or anal incontinence.PISQ-IR is a useful instrument to measure sexual function regarding pelvic floor disorders.

Coal smoke has largely been unexplored as a source of cadmium exposure. We investigated the relationship between gestational cadmium exposure and fetal growth, and assessed coal smoke as a potential source of airborne cadmium, among non-smoking pregnant women in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where coal combustion in home heating stoves is a major source of outdoor and indoor air pollution.This observational study was nested within the Ulaanbaatar Gestation and Air Pollution Research (UGAAR) study, a randomized controlled trial of portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaner use during pregnancy, fetal growth, and early childhood development. We measured third trimester blood cadmium concentrations in 374 out of 465 participants who had a live birth. We used multiple linear and logistic regression to assess the relationships between log-transformed maternal blood cadmium concentrations and birth , length, head circumference, ponderal index, low birth , small for gestational age, and preterm birth in crude and adjusted models. We also evaluated the relationships between log-transformed blood cadmium concentrations and the density of coal-burning stoves within 5000 m of each participant's apartment as a proxy of coal smoke emissions from home heating stoves.The median (25th,75th percentile) blood cadmium concentration was 0.20 (0.15, 0.29) μg/L. A doubling of blood cadmium was associated with a 95 g (95% CI: 34, 155 g) reduction in birth  in adjusted models. An interquartile range increase in coal stove density (from 3.4 to 4.9 gers/hectare) surrounding participants' apartments was associated with a 12.% (95% CI: 0.3, 25.6%) increase in blood cadmium concentrations.Gestational cadmium exposure was associated with reduced birth . In settings where coal is a widely used fuel, cadmium may play a role in the putative association between air pollution and impaired fetal growth.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the production of P(3HB), urea and glucose feeding streams were developed to characterize the fed-batch culture conditions for new Cupriavidus necator NSDG-GG mutant. Feeding urea in repeated fed-batch stage (RFB-I) at 6, and 12 h in cultivation led to insignificant kinetic effect on the cell dry mass (CDM) and P(3HB) accumulation. Feeding glucose in repeated fed-batch stage (RFB-II) demonstrated that the incremental feeding approach of glucose after urea in fill-and-draw (F/D) mode at 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h in fermentation increased CDM and P(3HB) concentration. In the 1 cycle in RFB-II, the cumulative CDM reached the value of 26.22 g/L and then it increased with the successive repeated fed-batches to attain biomass of 145 g/L at the end of 5 cycle of RFB-II. The final cumulative P(3HB) concentration at the end of 5 cycle of RFB-II reached 111 g/L with the overall yield of 0.50 g P(3HB) g gluc; the CDM productivity from the RFB-II cycles was in the range of 0.84-1.3 g/(L·h). The RFB-II of glucose in an increment mode produced nearly . times more increase in CDM and P(3HB) productivities compared to the decrement RFB-II mode. Repeated cultivation had also the advantage of avoiding extra time required for innoculum preparation, and sterilization of bioreactor during batch, thereby it increased the overall industrial importance of the process.Copyright © 2019.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671757>Maternal Human Milk Oligosaccharide Profile Modulates the Impact of an Intervention with Iron and Galacto-Oligosaccharides in Kenyan Infants.</a></h2><p>There is little data on human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) composition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and .5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; () effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut microbiota. There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and -for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut microbiota response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671025>Social work and toddler overweight risk: Identifying modifiable child and parent factors across the socioeconomic gradient.</a></h2><p>: Childhood obesity is associated with long-term health consequences, yet little is known about the prevalence of child and parent risk factors of overweight across the socioeconomic gradient in early life.

A secondary aim was to evaluate if the amount of weightbearing and daily steps influenced the risk of sustaining a DVT.One-hundred and fifty patients with Achilles tendon rupture repair were randomized to treatment with early functional mobilization, encouraging full weightbearing and ankle motion in orthosis, or treatment-as-usual, i.e.,  weeks of unloading in plaster cast followed by 4 weeks weightbearing in orthosis. At  and 6 weeks postoperatively, all patients were screened for DVT using compression duplex ultrasound. During the first  weeks postoperatively, patient-reported loading, pain and step counts were assessed.At  weeks, 28/96 (29%) of the patients in early functional mobilization group and 15/49 (31%) in the control group (n.s) had sustained a DVT. At 6 weeks, the DVT rate was 35/94 (37%) in the early functional mobilization and 14/49 (29%) in the control group (n.s). During the first postoperative week, the early functional mobilization group reported low loading and higher experience of pain vs. the control group (p = 0.001). Low patient-reported loading ≤ 50% (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.28-14.3) was found to be an independent risk factor for DVT, in addition to high BMI and higher age.Early functional mobilization does not prevent the high incidence of DVT during leg immobilization in patients with Achilles tendon rupture as compared to treatment-as-usual. The low efficacy of early functional mobilization is mainly explained by postoperative pain and subsequent low weightbearing. To minimize the risk of DVT, patients should be encouraged to load at least 50% of  on the injured leg 1 week after surgery.Therapeutic, level 1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667519>Short-term dietary reduction of branched-chain amino acids reduces meal-induced insulin secretion and modifies microbiome composition in type  diabetes: a randomized controlled crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that increased circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with insulin resistance and type  diabetes (T2D). This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg ) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole- and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial insulin secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition.

Sym004 has been clinically tested for treatment of solid tumors. The present work characterizes the non-linear pharmacokinetics (PK) of Sym004 and its constituent antibodies and investigates two types of covariate models for interpreting the interindividual variability of Sym004 exposure. Sym004 serum concentration data from 330 cancer patients participating in four Phase 1 and  trials (n = 247 metastatic colorectal cancer, n = 87 various types advanced solid tumors) were pooled for non-linear mixed effects modeling. Dose regimens of 0.4-18 mg/kg Sym004 dosed by i.v. infusion weekly or every 2nd week were explored. The PK profiles for futuximab and modotuximab were parallel, and the parameter values for their population PK models were similar. The PK of Sym004 using the sum of the serum concentrations of futuximab and modotuximab was well captured by a -compartment model with parallel linear and saturable, Michaelis-Menten-type elimination. The full covariate model including all plausible covariates included in a single step showed no impact on Sym004 exposure of age, Asian race, renal and hepatic function, tumor type and previous anti-EGFR treatments. The reduced covariate model contained statistically and potentially clinically significant influences of , albumin, sex and baseline tumor size. Population PK modeling and covariate analysis of Sym004 were feasible using the sum of the serum concentrations of the two constituent antibodies.

The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth , and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35. nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5., 14. ng/mL [24., 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth  (nine studies, n=11, 114., 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

To evaluate the joint effects of long-term PM (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 1.0 μm) exposure and obesity on children's lung function, a cross-sectional sample of 6740 children (aged 7-14 years) was enrolled across seven northeastern Chinese cities from 2012 to 2013.  and lung function, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF), were measured according to standardized protocols. Average PM, PM, PM and nitrogen dioxide (NO) exposure levels were estimated using a spatiotemporal model, and sulphur dioxide (SO) and ozone (O) exposure were estimated using data from municipal air monitoring stations. Two-level logistic regression and general linear models were used to analyze the joint effects of  mass index (BMI) and air pollutants. The results showed that long-term air pollution exposure was associated with lung function impairment and there were significant interactions with BMI. Associations were stronger among obese and overweight than normal  participants (the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PM and lung function impairments in three increasing BMI categories were 1.50 (1.07-.11) to .55 (1.59-4.07) for FVC < 85% predicted, 1.44 (1.03-.01) to .51 (1.53-4.11) for FEV < 85% predicted, 1.34 (0.97-1.84) to .04 (1.24-3.35) for PEF < 75% predicted, and 1.34 (1.01-1.78) to 1.93 (1.26-.95) for MMEF < 75% predicted). Consistent results were detected in linear regression models for PM, PM and SO on FVC and FEV impairments (P < 0.05). These modification effects were stronger among females and older participants. These results can provide policy makers with more comprehensive information for to develop strategies for preventing air pollution induced children's lung function deficits among children.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Measurements included: 1) height and ; ) questionnaires to assess extracurricular exercise and diet (calcium, vitamin D); 3) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy). Whole  less head (SUB) scans yielded bone mineral content (BMC) and  composition. Lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck (FN) scans yielded BMC and areal bone mineral density (BMD); radius scans yielded ultradistal and 1/3 BMD. ANCOVA compared group means for percent gains from BL to FU2, accounting for biological maturity, BL height, height change, inter-scan interval, organized activity, calcium and vitamin D.In 62 girls (21 CON, 41 INT), intention to treat analyses detected INT vs. CON advantages for L1-L4 BMC and BMD (4.1%, 5.6%: p<0.05). HI effort participants (n=19) demonstrated advantages for BMC and BMD at L1-L4 and FN (5.7% to 8.%, p<0.01) vs. CON.Over two school years, this resistance intervention yielded lumbar spine advantages; enthusiastic participation (HI) yielded lumbar spine and femoral neck advantages.

Knowledge on the compositional variation of MCLL during treatment is important for a better understanding on the degradation pathway of organic pollutants. In this work, the structural change of MCLL during Fenton oxidation process was examined using spectroscopic techniques. The removal rates of COD, TOC and UV reached 78.9 ± 1.3%, 70. ± 1.4% and 90.64 ± 1.6%, respectively, under the optimal condition (i.e., dosage of HO = 9.0 mL/200 mL, HO/Fe(II) molar ratio = 3.0, pH = 3.0, time = 40 min). Spectral analyses suggested that aromatic/CC structure and CO bonds in MCLL can be successfully destroyed by Fenton oxidation, resulting in a decrease in molecular . One fulvic-like and one humic-like components were identified in MCLL, both of which can be removed by Fenton treatment. In addition, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopic analyses suggested the oxidative changes of MCLL structure in the order of fulvic-like component/unsaturated conjugated bond > aromatic structure > humic-like component. The results may provide a new insight to the understanding on the structure variation of MCLL during treatment, which is beneficial for the design of cost-effective treatment strategies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase ).The primary outcome was  change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included  change at the end of phase  and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD)  mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000.  measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months.

The Tromsø Study: Fit Futures.</a></h2><p>Determinants of bone acquisition in late adolescence and early adulthood are not well-described. This -year follow-up study explored the associations of  (BW),  mass index (BMI), and changes in  status with adolescent bone accretion in a sample of 651 adolescents (355 girls and 296 boys) between 15 and 19 years of age from The Tromsø Study: Fit Futures. This Norwegian population-based cohort study was conducted from 2010 to 2011 and was repeated from 2012 to 2013. We measured femoral neck, total hip, and total  bone mineral content and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We measured height, BW, calculated BMI (kg/m ), and collected information on lifestyle at both surveys. Mean BMI (SD) at baseline was 22.17 (3.76) and 22.18 (3.93) in girls and boys, respectively. Through multiple linear regression, baseline BW and BMI were positively associated with ∆aBMD over  years of follow-up at all skeletal sites in boys (  < 0.05), but not in girls. ∆BW and ∆BMI predicted ∆aBMD and ∆BMC in both sexes, but the strength of the associations was moderate. Individuals who lost  during follow-up demonstrated a slowed progression of aBMD accretion compared with those gaining , but loss of BW or reduction of BMI during  years was not associated with net loss of aBMD. In conclusion, our results confirm that adequate BW for height in late adolescence is important for bone health. Associations between change in  status and bone accretion during follow-up were moderate and unlikely to have any clinical implication on adolescents of normal . Underweight individuals, particularly boys, are at risk of not reaching optimal peak bone mass and could benefit from an increase in BMI. © 2019 The Authors.  is published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.© 2019 The Authors.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be used to detect potential abnormalities in the microvasculature in this population. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a newly developed handheld swept source OCT (SS-OCT) device to successfully acquire structural vitreoretinal and retinal microvascular images in awake premature infants.OCT and OCTA images were acquired at the time of routine ROP examinations from awake, unsedated preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit using a clinical research prototype handheld probe integrated with an SS-OCT system working at 1,060 nm wavelength and an imaging speed of 200,000 A-scans per second (200 kHz), enabling volume OCT and OCTA scans. Each volume was acquired with approximately 36˚ field of view (~6.3×6.3 mm in infants) in 4.8 s. Quality of acquired OCT and OCTA volume images, microvascular information, and vitreoretinal features were determined by 3-masked grader consensus.Twelve infants (5 females, mean gestational age 28.3 weeks, median birth  901 g, stages 0 to 3 ROP) underwent a total of 73 individual eye imaging sessions. High-quality OCT images of the fovea and the optic nerve were present in 69/73 (94.5%) and 56/73 (76.7%) scans, respectively. Vitreous bands were observed in 10/73 (13.7%); punctate hyperreflective vitreous opacities in 47/73 (64.4%); epiretinal membrane (ERM) in 6/73 (8.%); and cystoid macular edema (CME) in 12/73 (16.4%) scans. Mild vessel elevation was noted in 3/73 (4.1%) images, and severe vessel elevation in 4/73 (5.5%) scans. OCTA images obtained in 8 awake infants revealed good quality images of the foveal microvasculature in 11/19 (58%) eye imaging sessions for 6/8 (75%) infants; and peripapillary microvasculature in 14/19 (74%) eye imaging sessions for 5/8 (63%) infants.The SS-OCTA handheld device can capture important vitreoretinal characteristics such as peripapillary and foveal microvasculature, as well as hyperreflective punctate vitreous opacities and tractional vitreous bands, which may predict ROP severity. These images were captured in awake, premature infants without the use of direct ocular contact, an eyelid speculum, or sedation.2019 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, , average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

In this multicenter study, the clinical presentation and genetic background of Chinese children with Dent disease are studied to improve the cognition and diagnostic ability of pediatricians. In this prospective cohort, we described the genotype and phenotype of a national cohort composed of 45 pediatric probands with Dent disease belonging to 45 families from 12 different regions of China recruited from 2014 to 2018 by building up the multicenter registration system. The CLCN5 gene from 32 affected families revealed 28 different mutations. The OCRL gene from 13 affected families revealed 13 different mutations. The incidence of low-molecular- proteinuria (LMWP) in both Dent disease type 1 populations and Dent disease type  populations was 100.0%; however, the incidence of other manifestations was not high, which was similar to previously reported data. Therefore, LMWP is a key clinical feature that should alert clinicians to the possibility of Dent disease. A high amount of LMWP combined with positive gene test results can be used as the diagnostic criteria for this disease. The diagnostic criteria are helpful in reducing the missed diagnosis of this disease and are beneficial for protecting the renal function of these patients through early diagnosis and early intervention.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with LGA birthweight.LGA was significantly higher in those with T1DM (39%) than T2DM (17%) (p<0.001). Among those with T1DM, there was a nonsignificant association between LGA and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.39; p=0.06) and excess maternal  gain (T1DM odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.43; p=0.069).

The few studies that have been conducted mostly involve people with neurologic consequences and the possible clinical evolutions of the disease. The aim of this study was to describe the nutritional status of patients with HTLV-1, including those with associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, and to evaluate food security in these patients.A retrospective observational study was conducted in people with HTLV-1 admitted to a referral hospital. We collected data from 17 medical records, including anthropometric data (i.e.,  mass index, mid-upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold, and mid-arm muscle circumference), laboratory test results (i.e., haemoglobin, haematocrit, albumin, globulin, iron fixation capacity, and iron), the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) method, and food security (Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale) data. The data were analysed using the R-project software. To evaluate possible associations between the outcomes and predictors (age at hospitalisation, food security, presence of children <18 years of age living in the household, income, schooling, ANSG, BMI, difference between ideal  and hospitalisation, TSF, MUAC ICU days, hospitalisation outcome, rehospitalisation in the first year after discharge, interval between readmissions, death, associated conditions, constipation upon admission), we used Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, Fisher's exact, chi-square tests with continuity correction, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Hypothesis tests were considered statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05.The mean age of the patients was 57 (52-60) years. The patients were predominantly women (59%) and had an income lower than the local minimum wage with at least 6 years of schooling (52.3%). Only 18.% of patients were eutrophic according to their BMI and 23.5% of patients were malnourished based on the SGA method. Patients predominantly had food security (64.7%) and good intestinal functions (64.7%) during their hospital stay.Despite having a limited number of patients in this study, HTLV-1 patients admitted to hospital are at high risk of malnutrition based on the scores from the SGA method.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or  documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (.%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR .5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The nitric oxide (NO) concentration in exhaled gas (FeNO) has been used as an indicator of POT, but the effect of SCUBA diving on FeNO has rarely been studied. The study presented here aimed to assess alterations to pulmonary function and FeNO following a 12-h dive using breathing apparatus with a relatively high partial pressure of oxygen.Six healthy, male, non-smoking military SCUBA divers were recruited (age 31.8 ± .7 years, height 179 ± 0.09 cm, and  84.6 ± 14 kg). Each diver completed a 12-h dive using a demand-controlled semi-closed-circuit rebreather. During the 12 h of immersion, divers were subjected to 672 oxygen toxicity units (OTU). A complete pulmonary function test (PFT) was completed the day before and immediately after immersion. FeNO was measured using a Nobreath™ Quark (COSMED™, Rome, Italy), three times for each diver. The first datapoint was collected before the dive to establish the "basal state", a second was collected immediately after divers emerged from the water, and the final measurement was taken 24 h after the dive.Despite prolonged inhalation of a hyperoxic hyperbaric gas mixture, no clinical pulmonary symptoms were observed, and no major changes in pulmonary function were detected. However, a major decrease in FeNO values was observed immediately after emersion [0-12 ppb (median, 3.8 ppb)], with a return to baseline [-60 ppb (median, 26 ppb) 24 h later (3-73 ppb (median, 24.7 ppb)].These results suggest that if the OTU remain below the recommended limit values, but does alter FeNO, this type of dive does not persistently impair lung function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675537>Low dietary magnesium intake alters vitamin D-parathyroid hormone relationship in adults who are overweight or obese.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D metabolism is dependent on magnesium (Mg) as a cofactor; therefore, poor Mg status may alter the relationship between vitamin D metabolite serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s25OHD) and serum parathyroid hormone (sPTH). We hypothesized that low dietary Mg intake may alter sPTH response to s25OHD in a population with excess , thereby leading to a worsening of cardiometabolic health. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study on adults who were either overweight or obese (owt/ob). Dietary Mg intake was measured using a Mg food frequency questionnaire (MgFFQ).  composition information was measured using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Blood samples were obtained for all biochemical analyses. A total of 57 participants, 22 to 65 years of age, with a  mass index between 25 to 45 kg/m were divided into 3 groups, according to dietary Mg intake percentiles (Low Mg Group = <33 percentile, Medium Mg Group = 33 to 66 percentile, High Mg Group = >66 percentile). Higher s25OHD was negatively associated with lower sPTH in the High Mg Intake group (r = -0.472, P = .041), but not in other groups. A positive relationship between s25OHD and serum high-molecular  adiponectin concentrations was observed in the High Mg Group (r = 0.532, r = 0.022), but not in other groups. Serum Interleukin-6 concentrations were negatively associated with s25OHD (r = -0.316, P = .017) for the entire study group. Based on these results, our study demonstrated that a low dietary Mg intake may alter PTH response to 25OHD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-two male lambs, with an average  of 20.8 ± .9 kg, were fed with different levels of spineless cactus in replacement for 0, 33, 66 or 100% of maniçoba hay (i.e. 0, 200, 400, 600 g kg of dietary DM). The replacement maniçoba hay by spineless cactus did not influence dry matter intake (g d) and cold carcass  (P > .05), but increased (P < .05) the carcass finishing fat but did not influence (P < .05) the physical characteristics of the lambs' meat. Lower values for odor, flavor and purchase intention of meat were observed with 66% of replacement. Therefore, replacement of 33% maniçoba hay by spineless cactus can be recommended as optimal level, because it improve the fattening of the carcass, without causing negative effects on performance or meat quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to determine the frequency of ARFID symptoms and study its characteristics and associated gastrointestinal symptoms.We conducted a retrospective review of charts from 410 consecutive referrals (ages 18-90 y; 73.0% female) to a tertiary care center for neurogastroenterology examination, from January through December 2016. Blinded coders (n=4) applied DSM-5 criteria for ARFID, with substantial diagnostic agreement (κ=.66).Twenty-six cases (6.3%) met the full criteria for ARFID and 71 cases (17.3%) had clinically significant avoidant or restrictive eating behaviors with insufficient information for a definitive diagnosis of ARFID. Of patients with ARFID symptoms (n=97), 90 patients (92.8%) cited fear of gastrointestinal symptoms as motivation for their avoidant or restrictive eating. A series of binary logistic regressions showed that likelihood of having ARFID symptoms increased significantly in patients with eating- or -related complaints (odds ratio [OR], 5.09; 95% CI, .54-10.21); with dyspepsia, nausea, or vomiting (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, .04-6.32); with abdominal pain (OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.87-11.81); or with more than 1 diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder (OR=1.63, 95% CI, 1.26-.10).In a retrospective study of patients undergoing neurogastroenterology examinations, we found ARFID symptoms to be most frequently related to fear of gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients undergoing neurogastroenterology or motility examinations should be evaluated for symptoms of ARFID, particularly when providers consider dietary interventions.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The optimal protein quantity and pattern to support muscle mass maintenance in cancer patients is unknown. The aim of the current exploratory study was to observe the pattern and quantity of dietary protein intake as well as the prevalence of muscle wasting in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing primary anti-neoplastic treatment. The secondary aim was to assess the potential contributory factors associated with maintenance of muscle mass.A longitudinal observational study was conducted in patients with NSCLC undergoing first line of anti-neoplastic treatment. Nutrient intake was assessed by repeated 24-h recalls and skeletal muscle by routine thoraco-abdominal CT scans at baseline and after three cycles of treatment. Descriptive analyses, paired samples t-test, binomial logistic and linear regression analyses were performed.Out of 186 consecutively screened patients, 62 were included and 52 patients were available for analysis. Protein intake increased from baseline to follow up, but were lower in muscle wasters (1.0 g/kg/d) than in muscle maintainers (1.4 g/kg/d). The majority of the meals contributed less than 20 g of protein and less than 10% of the meals contributed at least 40 g of protein. Significant loss of skeletal muscle area was observed in 26 out of 52 patients. A higher protein intake (OR 18.7, p = 0.01), energy intake (OR 1.1, p = 0.04) and stable  (OR 1., p = 0.03) were associated with muscle maintenance in the univariate regression, whereas age, sex, cachexia, tumour stage, treatment adherence and response did not. In the multivariate regression, a trend was seen for protein intake (OR 35., p = 0.08) and  (OR 1., p = 0.06).Muscle wasting occurred frequently and early during primary anti-neoplastic treatment. Protein intake seems important for maintaining skeletal muscle. Validated dietary methods in cancer patients must be identified and the optimal protein quantity and intake pattern to support muscle maintenance should be explored in future trials.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Enhancing DIT can lead to  loss. Factors that increase DIT are expected to lower  mass index and  fat mass. Although various methods have been developed for measuring DIT in humans, there is currently no method available for calculating absolute DIT values in mice. Therefore, we attempted to measure DIT in mice by applying the method more commonly used for humans. Mouse energy metabolism was first measured under fasting conditions; EE was plotted against the square root of the activity count, and a linear regression equation was fit to the data. Then, energy metabolism was measured in mice that were allowed to feed ad libitum, and EE was plotted in the same way. We calculated the DIT by subtracting the predicted EE value from the fed EE value for the same activity count. The methodology for measuring DIT in mice may be helpful for researching ways of combatting obesity by increasing DIT. •The methodology for measuring absolute DIT values in mice is developed.•For mice, the proportion of DIT compared with calorie intake and EE are 12.3% and 21.7%, respectively.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673966>Genome-wide association studies for growth traits in buffaloes using the single step genomic BLUP.</a></h2><p>Growth traits are important for the profitability of buffalo breeding systems, since in general, these animals are raised both for meat and milk.

We had previously identified that rutin inhibits doxorubicin (Dox-) -induced cognitive decline in healthy rats. However, it was important to also establish that it does so in rats with mammary carcinoma without compromising Dox's antitumor potential. Mammary carcinoma was induced in female rats by intraperitonial administration of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (i.p.). Rats that developed mammary carcinoma were treated with Dox after pretreatment with vehicle or rutin. After Dox exposure (50 days), episodic and spatial memory was assessed using the novel object recognition task and the Morris water maze, respectively. Tumor progression was evaluated by measurement of tumor  and volume and histological analysis. Blood samples were collected to estimate hematological parameters. Oxidative status and TNF-α levels were estimated in brain homogenates. Dox treatment significantly reduced tumor size and volume. Pretreatment with rutin did not significantly alter Dox's tumor suppression potential, suggesting that it does not influence Dox's anticancer activity. In addition, rutin ameliorated Dox-induced cognitive decline, myelosuppression, and brain oxidative stress. The present study indicates that rutin protects against Dox-induced cognitive decline and myelosuppression without affecting its antitumor potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678947>Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of the combined effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide and exercise on maintenance of  loss and health after a very low-calorie diet.</a></h2><p>The success rate of  loss maintenance is limited.

Previously, we reported a series of novel bicyclic and monocyclic ACC1-selective inhibitors. Among them, compound 1a exhibited highly potent cellular activity (acetate uptake IC = 0.76 nM) as well as promising in vivo PD efficacy. However, compound 1a caused severe  reduction in repeated dose administration in the mouse model. Since 1a showed potent inhibitory activity against mouse ACC1 as well as strong inhibition of mouse ACC2, we further examined a series of 1a analogues in order to reduce undesirable  change. The replacement of acetamide moiety with ureido moiety dramatically improved selectivity of mouse ACC1 against ACC2. In addition, analogue 1b displayed favorable bioavailability in mouse cassette dosing PK study, hence in vivo PD studies were also carried out. Oral administration of 1b significantly reduced the concentration of malonyl-CoA in HCT-116 xenograft tumors at doses of more than 30 mg/kg. Furthermore, compound 1b showed significant antitumor efficacy in 786-O xenograft mice at an oral dose of 30 mg/kg (T/C = 0.5%). Accordingly, our novel potent ACC1-selective inhibitor represents a set of useful orally-available research tools, as well as potential therapeutic agents particularly in terms of new cancer therapies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average  mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained  at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.5%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.% versus 48.5%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21.5 units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%).

Targeting microglialactivationhas proven to be a viable option to develop a disease-modified therapy for PD. Galectin-1, which has been reported to have an anti-neuroinflammation effect was used in the present study to evaluate its therapeutic effects on microglia activation and neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease model. It was found that galectin-1 attenuated the inflammatory insult and the apoptosis of SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells from conditioned medium of activated microglia induced by Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Nonetheless, galectin-1 administration (0.5 mg/kg) inhibited the microglia activation, improved the motor deficits in PD mice model induced by MPTP (25 mg/kg  of mouse, i.p.) and prevented the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Administration of galectin-1 resulted in p38 and ERK1/ dephosphorylation followed by IκB/NFκB signaling pathway inhibition. Galectin-1 significantly decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- (COX-). The protective effects and modulation of the MAPK/IκB/NFκB signaling pathway were abolished with β-D-galactose which blocked the carbohydrate-recognition domain of galectin-1. The present study demonstrated that galectin-1 inhibited microglia activation and ameliorated neurodegenerative process in PD model by modulating MAPK/IκB/NFκB axis through its Carbohydrate-recognition domain.Copyright © 2019.

Our primary aim was to analyze procedure-related and 30-day mortality and complications between PEG and PRG in relation to indications.   A single-center retrospective analysis was performed thath included all adult patients receiving initial PEG (January 2008 until April 2016) and PRG (January 2010 until April 2016). Outcomes were mortality (procedure-related, 30-day), complications (early (≤ 30 days) and late) and success rates.   A total of 760 procedures (469 PRG and 291 PEG) were analyzed. Most common indications were head and neck cancer (HNC), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success rates for placement were 91. % for PEG and 97.1 % for PRG (   = 0.001). Procedure-related mortality was 1.7 % in PEG and 0.4 % in PRG (   = 0.113). The 30-day mortality was 10.7 % in PEG and 5.1 % in PRG (   = 0.481 after multivariate logistic regression) CVA was associated with higher 30-day mortality, whereas ALS, higher , and prophylactic placements in HNC were associated with lower rates. Tube-related complications were less frequent in PEG, both early (.7 % vs. 26.4 %,   ≤ 0.001) and late (8.6 % vs. 31.5 %,   ≤ 0.001). The percentage of major complications and infections did not differ.   With respect to procedure-related and 30-day mortality, PEG and PRG compare equally. PRG had a higher procedural success rate. Tube-related complications and pain are less frequent after PEG compared to PRG. The choice for either PEG or PRG therefore should primarily be based on local facilities and expertise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672925>Influence of Educational Level on Psychosocial Correlates and Perceived Environmental Correlates of Physical Activity in Adults at Risk for Type  Diabetes: The Feel4Diabetes-Study.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate whether the relationship between psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and physical activity (PA) in adults at risk for type  diabetes is influenced by educational level.Based on the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score questionnaire, this study selected 164 adults (Mage: 38 (5.34) y, 13.4% men) at type  diabetes risk from 11 low socioeconomic neighborhoods in Flanders (Belgium). Participants filled out questionnaires on psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 5 consecutive days. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance in SPSS.Educational level significantly influenced the association between perception of  and light PA (P = .01) and total PA (P = .03) on weekend days. Educational level did not influence the associations between other psychosocial and perceived environmental factors (ie, perceived social influence; environmental, time and attitudinal barriers, perceived self-efficacy; knowledge and fatalism) and PA.Educational level did not influence the relationship between most psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and PA in this sample of adults at type  diabetes risk. This suggests that addressing different psychosocial and perceived environmental correlates in lower and higher educated participants might not be necessary.

Previous attention has been mostly paid to the effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles on the survival, growth and physiology of animals. In comparison, the effects on gut microbiota and incidence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil fauna remain poorly understood. We conducted a microcosm study to explore the responses of the non-target soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus gut microbiota and resistomes to copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and copper nitrate by using bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results showed that exposure to Cu resulted in higher bioaccumulation (P < 0.05) and lower  and reproduction (P < 0.05) of Enchytraeus crypticus than exposure to CuO NPs. Nevertheless, exposure to CuO NPs for 21 days markedly increased the alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota of Enchytraeus crypticus (P < 0.05) and shifted the gut microbial communities, with a significant decline in the relative abundance of the phylum Planctomycetes (from 37.26% to 19.80%, P < 0.05) and a significant elevation in the relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria (P < 0.05). The number of detected ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut significantly decreased from 45 in the Control treatment to 16 in the Cu(NO) treatment and 20 in the CuO NPs treatment. The abundance of ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut were also significantly decreased to 38.48% when exposure to Cu(NO) and 44.90% when exposure to CuO NPs (P < 0.05) compared with the controls. These results extend our understanding of the effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles on the gut microbiota and resistome of soil invertebrates.Copyright © 2019.

Altered thyroid function is a risk factor for poor outcomes of pregnancy. However, the associations between thyroid function biomarkers and maternal hemodynamics during pregnancy in HDP remain unclear.From January 2016 to January 2018, pregnant women diagnosed with HDP admitted to the Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the third trimester. Normally distributed variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and skewed variables were expressed as median (25th percentile, 75th percentile). Correlations between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or free thyroxine (FT4) and maternal hemodynamic parameters were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Bonferroni's correction for multiple correlations was performed. Logistic regression models with odd ratio (OR) and 95%CI were applied to confirm the associations.A total of 163 third-trimester pregnant women with HDP with a mean gestational age of 35.62 ± .83 weeks were recruited. The infant birth  of patients with elevated TSH levels was lower than that of patients with normal TSH levels (2635 ± 867 g vs. 3037 ± 673 g, p = 0.002).

The XRD pattern analysis showed the systematic decrease in the lattice parameters owing to the enhanced oxidation states of the Co/Mn ions. The electronic structure study by XPS measurements suggested the presence of mixed valence states of the B-site ions (Co2+/Co3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+) with significant enhancement of the average oxidation states due to hole doping. The mere absence of electronic states near the Fermi level in the valence band (VB) spectra for both of the pure (x=0.0) and Sr doped (x=0.5) systems indicated the insulating nature of the samples. Sr substitution is observed to increase the spectral  near the Fermi level suggesting for an enhanced conductivity of the hole doped system. The dc magnetization data divulged a Griffiths like phase above the long-range ordering temperature. A typical re-entrant spin glass like phase driven by the inherent anti-site disorder (ASD) has been recognized by ac susceptibility study for both the pure and doped systems. Most interestingly, the emergence of a new cluster glass like phase (immediately below the magnetic ordering temperature and above the spin-glass transition temperature) solely driven by the Sr substitution has been unravelled by ac magnetization dynamics study. Observation of these dual glassy states in a single system is scarce and hence placed the present system amongst the rare materials. The isothermal magnetization measurements further probed the exhibition of the giant exchange bias effect originated from the interfacial exchange interactions due to existence of low temperature antiferromagnetic clusters embedded in the glassy matrix.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675673>Antidepressant and antinociceptive activities in animal models and in vitro assessment of the anti-thyroid activity of bis(DL-pyroglutamate)magnesium complex.</a></h2><p>Magnesium is an essential element related with biochemistry of the brain and different types of depression have been associated with its deficiency.The structure of a novel magnesium bis(DL-pyroglutamate) (Mg(DL-pGlu)) was elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Wistar rats were used in the in vivo experiments. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test (FST) and the antinociceptive activity was evaluated using hot plate test. In both, non-specific effects were evaluated by the open field test. Anti-thyroid activity was examined using Lang's method. Albumin binding behavior was evaluated by 3D fluorescence spectroscopy.For the Mg(DL-pGlu) complex (30 mg/kg), the FST test on Wistar rats revealed a decrease of 22% in the immobility time and an increment of 106% in the swimming time. The compound alters neither the locomotor activity nor the  after chronic administration. At the same dose, it showed antinociceptive activity, increasing the response latency. It blocks iodination reactions generating a charge transfer complex with iodine hence indicating anti-thyroid activity (K = 45366.5 ± 29 M). Albumin 3D fluorescence spectroscopy experiments showed intensity increase of peak A and decrease of peak B.The results showed that the new compound produced a lowering of the immobility time and an increment of the swimming ability of the rats. The compound is able to increase the response latency in 70.0%, to capture iodine (anti-thyroid activity) and to interact with albumin through covalent type of interaction of the free NH groups.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

However, interest in functional verification and industrial applications of sericin has been growing for several years. We used ultrasonication to simplify the extraction process of the silk peptide under low salt conditions at 20 °C, instead of using the conventional conditions of high salt and temperature. The concentration of the silk peptide was measured to determine the optimized extraction time and solvent, which were 4 h and 0.1 N NaOH, respectively. The molecular  of the enzyme-treated silk peptide was measured using SDS-PAGE and GPC. Silk peptide treated with papain after ultrasound had a molecular  of less than 5 kDa, and the papain treated-silk peptide reduced solar ultraviolet-induced COX- expression through inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. This is the first study investigating simultaneous extraction of fibroin and sericin, which can be used for mass production of food materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score≥+3.).β-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and glycolysis-related metabolites, were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, , menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use).198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77% female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted β =0.050 (95% CI 0.024,0.076),p=1.71x10 , β =6.54x10 (1.87x10 ,0.001),p=0.006 and β =.40x10 (6.49x10 ,4.14x10 ),p=0.007 (β= increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1μg/L BTM increase). Inverse relationships of β-CTX (β=-0.276 [-0.434,-0.118],p=6.03x10 ) and osteocalcin (-0.004 [-0.007,-0.001],p=0.020) with triglycerides were also identified. We explored the generalizability of these associations in 3,664 perimenopausal women (age 47.9 [4.4] years) from a UK family cohort. We confirmed a positive, albeit lower magnitude, association between β-CTX and citrate (adjusted β =0.020 [0.013,0.026],p=1.95x10 ) and an inverse association of similar magnitude between β-CTX and triglycerides (β=-0.354 [-0.471,-0.237],p=3.03x10 ).Bone resorption is positively related to circulating citrate and inversely related to triglycerides.

To date, mid- and long-term results of calcar-guided short-stem designs have been rarely available.Two hundred and sixteen calcar-guided short stems were included in combination with a cementless cup in a prospective study. Patients were allowed full -bearing on the first day postoperatively. Harris hip score (HHS) as well as pain and satisfaction on visual analogue scale (VAS) were assessed during a median follow-up of 61.7 months. Standardised radiographs were analysed at predefined time points regarding radiological alterations such as bone resorption and remodelling, radiolucency, osteolysis and cortical hypertrophy using modified Gruen zones.At mid-term follow-up, no revision surgery of the stem had to be performed in the whole collective. At 5 years, HHS was 97.8 (SD 4.7), satisfaction on VAS was 9.7 (SD 0.7), rest pain on VAS was 0.1 (SD 0.5), and load pain on VAS was 0.6 (SD 1.).

Upon farrowing, 115 primiparous sows (farrowing : 222.7 ± 20.0 kg) were initially allotted to 4 treatments in a  ×  factorial arrangement with two litter sizes: 10 and 13 piglets (LS10 vs. LS13), and two lactation lengths: 21 and 27 d (LL21 vs. LL27). Upon weaning, sows were rebred and those farrowed successfully (n = 66) kept 10 piglets and weaned at 21 d in the second parity. Sows were fed ad libitum during lactation in both parities. Feed intake, BW loss, backfat loss, litter size, and litter  gain during lactation in both parities were determined. Litter  gain in LS13 was greater (P < 0.05) than that in LS10 (54.4 vs. 47.7 kg) during the first lactation. Sows in LS13 had a greater (P < 0.05) BW loss than sows in LS10 (24.1 vs. 17.4 kg).  loss was not different between LL27 and LL21. Sows in LS13 tended to have a greater (P = 0.075) removal rate than those in LS10 (47.5 vs. 32.%). Sows in LL27 had a smaller (P < 0.05) removal rate than those in LL21 (28.0 vs. 51.7%). In the second parity, gestation BW gain in LL27 tended to be greater (P = 0.098) than that in LL21 when the previous litter size was 10 piglets (56.1 vs. 33. kg). Litter performance and feed intake of sows were not affected by previous litter size, lactation length, and their interaction. The farrowing , farrowing  protein and lipid,  loss was not different between LS13 and LS10, whereas backfat loss in LS13 was smaller (P < 0.05) than that in LS10 during the second lactation (0.9 vs. .4 mm). The predicted  lipid loss in LS13 was also smaller than that in LS10 (.3 vs. 5.3 kg) during the second lactation. Sows in LL27 had a smaller (P < 0.05) BW loss and  lipid loss during the second lactation than sows in LL21 (4.0 vs. 9.0 kg; .3 vs. 4.8 kg). The concentration of milk fat in LL27 was smaller (P < 0.05) than that in LL21 (7.9 vs. 9.1%). In conclusion, increasing suckling intensity to primiparous sows increased litter  gain but increasing litter size reduced piglet ADG. Sow performance in the second lactation was not negatively affected by increasing suckling intensity of the first lactation. Interestingly, sows with an increased suckling intensity in the first lactation had reduced loss of  reserves in the second lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

GFC demonstrated the polynuclear nature of the Fe :G7 at various ratios. The effectiveness of the Fe fertilizers depend on the Fe :ligand ratio and the ligand type being the Fe :G7 (1:1 and 1:) the most effective. The Fe :G7 (1:1) also presented a better response for the uptake of other micronutrients.The Fe :G7 molar ratios have shown to be critical for the Fe plant uptake under hydroponic conditions and calcareous soil. Thus, the Fe :G7 at equimolar ratio and 1: molar ratio can be an environmentally friendly alternative to less degradable synthetic chelates to correct Fe chlorosis in strategy I plants.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future  loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future  loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of  loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future  loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of  loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

Particularly, the CNTs and CB have been subjected to us sonication for different time intervals and the performed analysis reveals that both kinds of nanoparticles show decreased average hydrodynamic diameters and large content of surface defects. Really, the increased content of CNTs and CB defects, achieved during the sonication time, leads to an increased reactivity toward 1,1-diphenyl--pycryl (DPPH) radicals and an enhanced anti-oxidant activity toward macro-radicals, coming from the photo-degradation of the host polymer matrix. The studies of photo-oxidative behavior of the nanocomposites, based on Ultra High Molecular  (UHMWPE), reveal that the us treatment of the nanoparticles has a benefic effect on the oxidative resistance of the nanocomposites, especially at long exposure times. Overall, the ultra-sound-assisted treatment can be considered twofold powerful tool: (i) for disruption of the nanoparticles aggregations, and (ii) for capitalization of surface defects, amplifying and tuning in a controlled way the radical scavenging activity of the carbonaceous nanoparticles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the effect of Illicium verum extracts (IVE) or Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts (ELE) on growth performance, serum and liver antioxidant ability of nursery piglets, as well as the difference of IVE and ELE on Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire (DLY) and Chinese native Licha-black (LCB) piglets. A total of 96 nursery piglets (48 DLY and 48 LCB piglets) with an average  of 11.22 ± 0.32 kg were randomly divided into four treatments in a  × 4 factorial design. Each treatment had four replicates with 3 DLY and 3 LCB piglets per replicate respectively. Treatments included: basal diet, basal diet + 500 mg/kg IVE, basal diet + 250 mg/kg ELE and basal diet + 50 mg/kg chlortetracycline (CHL). All piglets were housed individually for the 42 days trial period after 7 days adaptation. Results showed that there were significant interactions (p < .05) between piglets species and dietary treatments in average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency, serum and hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic integral optical density (IOD) of α-tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), hepatic relative mRNA expressions of nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2)/TNF-α and protein expression of TNF-α. Regardless of piglets species, supplementation with IVE and ELE increased (p < .05) ADG and feed efficiency, T-SOD and GSH-Px in serum and liver, hepatic IOD of Nrf2, hepatic mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2/TNF-α. However, CHL treatment resulted in lower (p < .05) serum GSH-Px and hepatic mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2/TNF-α, and higher hepatic MDA and IOD of TNF-α. Compared to LCB, DLY piglets had higher (p < .05) ADG and feed efficiency, serum and hepatic MDA, and protein expression of TNF-α, but lower (p < .05) ADFI, liver index, serum and hepatic GSH-Px, hepatic IOD of TNF-α, mRNA expressions of Nrf2/TNF-α were observed. In conclusion, Illicium verum (500 mg/kg) and Eucommia ulmoides leaf (250 mg/kg) extracts can increase the growth performance and antioxidant ability of DLY and LCB piglets, while chlortetracycline produces undesirable side-effects on the antioxidant ability of DLY and LCB piglets. Illicium verum and Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts produced different antioxidant effects in DLY and LCB piglets with the Chinese native Licha-black pig responding better than Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678802>Valorization of extracted organic matter from municipal solid waste leachate: Application to soils from France and Togo.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobic like (HPO*) and transphilic like (TPH*) fractions of organic matter (OM) were extracted from municipal solid waste leachate (MSWL) to assess their opportunity of valorization as organic amendments. Two soils with different carbon organic (C) content were studied: a soil from Togo (C = 0.3% in top horizon) and a soil from France (C = 4.% in top horizon). HPO* and TPH* fractions were characterized by combining elemental analysis, determination of specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA) index and distribution of apparent molecular  (AMW). Comparison to natural organic matter (NOM) fractions from surface water confirmed high similarities in composition except a lower oxygen percentage explained by the different genesis processes. HPO* and TPH* adsorption tests were conducted under batch experiments on each horizon of both soils to evaluate the impact of OM fractions on the physico-chemical characteristics of soils, to determine the carbon adsorption and to calculate their adsorption capacity. Whatever the soil, C adsorption did not correlate with clay content but rather with initial C content in the horizon. HPO* fraction was better adsorbed than TPH* fraction. Besides, while C adsorption percentages on each horizon of soils were higher for French soil, the adsorption capacities, explained as the ratio of organic carbon mass adsorbed on soils on its initial carbon mass, were  to 10 times higher for soil from Togo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Deep mine biofilm samples that contain high amounts of mucoid exopolysaccharide often pose difficulties to obtaining refined community DNA. To circumvent this hindrance, we report our own developed "MINES" method for optimal biofilm DNA recovery suitable for all types of high-resolution downstream applications. The method is also suitable for samples collected from landfill compost, kitchen digest (KD), and for Gram-positive Geobacillus sp. strain WSUCF1 and Gram-negative E. coli DH5α strains. In one form of the method, use of a gentle preprocessing technique to loosen the mucoid layer, combined with a multi-lytic polyzyme treatment to maximize yields from all cell types in the biofilm sample, yielded 1 μg of high molecular  DNA (16-20 kb) per gram of the biofilm sample, with an A260/280 and A260/230 ratio of about . Furthermore, amplification of 16S rRNA genes as well as restriction digestion with BamH1 and HindIII suggest that the newly developed method can minimize any inhibitory effects of contaminants. Results indicate that it is an appropriate methodology for the extraction of total genomic DNA for functional metagenomic studies and may be applicable to other environmental samples from which DNA extraction is challenging. IMPORTANCE: Our present knowledge of microorganisms and their enzymes from deep mine subsurface is based largely on laboratory studies of pure microbial cultures. These methods tend to hit nearly only 1% of the entire microbial community, In this regard, Metagenomics, has emerged as a strategic approach to explore unculturable microbes through the sequencing and analysis of DNA extracted from the environmental samples.

In order to develop a simplified process with a stronger purity of protease, we investigated the  earthworm and  lugworm. We purified water extracts cut off at 10 kDa of molecular  using ultrafiltration because proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. We purified EW1 (raw earthworm extract), EW2 (molecular  (m.w) > 10 kDa of earthworm extract), and EW3 (m.w < 10 kDa) from the  earthworm. Likewise, we purified LW1 (wild lugworm extract), LW2 (m.w > 10 kDa), and LW3 (m.w < 10 kDa) from the  lugworm. Using a fibrin assay, we found that fibrinolytic activity of the specimens had a rank order of clear zone diameter: EW2 > EW1 > EW3 > LW2 > LW1 > LW3. In particular, EW2 and LW2 showed a potent fibrinolytic effect in two different worm specimens. The protein content of each sample was detected as .34 (EW1), 3.03 (EW2), .80 (LW1), 3.71 (LW2) mg/ml respectively, and their molecular  were measured using SDS-PAGE. The samples contained the following amounts of total fatty acids: EW1, 3.61%; EW2, 0.48%; LW1, 4.96%; and LW2, 0.23%.

Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine carrier protein cystinosin. CTNS mutations result in either complete absence or reduced cystine transporting function of the protein. The diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is generally based on measuring leukocyte cystine level, demonstration of corneal cystine crystals by the slit lamp examination and confirmed by genetic analysis of the CTNS gene.A boy born to consanguineous Caucasian parents had the characteristic clinical features of the infantile nephropathic cystinosis including renal Fanconi syndrome (polydipsia/polyuria, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low molecular  proteinuria, glycosuria, cystine crystals in the cornea) and elevated WBC cystine levels. Initially we performed RFLP analysis of the common in the Northern European population 57-kb deletion of proband's DNA, then a direct Sanger sequencing which revealed no mutations in the coding part of the CTNS gene. To confirm the diagnosis we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA obtained from patient-derived fibroblasts in combination with cDNA sequencing. This revealed the skipping of exon 4 and exon 5 in the CTNS in our patient. Therefore, we detected a novel 9-kb homozygous deletion in the CTNS gene at genomic DNA level, spanning region from intron 3 to intron 5. In order to identify the inheritance pattern of the deletion we analyzed DNA of proband's mother and father. Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of the CTNS mutation.Analysis of CTNS gene transcript allowed to identify a large homozygous deletion in the patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis. Mutational detection at RNA level may be an efficient tool to establish the genetic defect in some cystinosis patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677259>Do Patients Diagnosed with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Benefit from Primary Tumor Surgery? A Propensity-Adjusted, Population-Based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Analysis.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND With the progress in surgical techniques and management of complications, pancreatic resection can be safely performed in experienced hospitals. Pancreatic resection enables surgeons to assess the effect of surgery for metastatic cases, even when there is limited information. In the present study we evaluated the role of primary tumor resection for metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC) by using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. MATERIAL AND METHODS Metastatic pancreatic cancer patients treated at our hospital from 2004 to 2015 were identified. The effect of surgery on cancer-specific survival was assessed by restricted mean survival time (RMST) and stabilized inverse probability of treatment -adjusted analysis after propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS A total of 2694 mPC patients were included. Of this population, 365 adults underwent primary tumor resection. After propensity matching, postsurgical patients had longer RMST than non-surgery patients (1: 1 PSM 11.60 months vs. 8.98 months; 1:  PSM 11.61 months vs. 9.10 months; p<0.01). Stabilized inverse probability of treatment -adjusted analysis yielded similar results (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our study supports the hypothesis that patients with mPC can benefit from primary tumor surgery. However, the surgical inclusion criteria and the appropriate role of surgery, such as its effect on symptom control, quality of life, and the extent to which it prolongs survival for metastatic pancreatic cancer, remain to be completely assessed by well-designed, prospective, randomized clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672447>The Rho GTPase RND3 regulates adipocyte lipolysis.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in diet- and obesity-related insulin resistance, with implications for several metabolic diseases. Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type  diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced  loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate  of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5--fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for fatty liver) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects).  mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% . After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001).

Family history of DM was collected from prepartum women using anamnesis. During the study period 208,728 deliveries met the inclusion criteria, of them 8.% (n=17040) were of non-diabetic mothers with family history of DM. Rates of neurological hospitalization with or without family history were analyzed.Offspring born to non-diabetic mothers with family history of DM had higher rates of neurological hospitalizations. The cumulative incidence of long-term neurological hospitalizations was higher as compared with those without family history of DM (log-rank test P=0.007). Neurological hospitalizations was higher by 13% in the study group, after controlling for confounders such as maternal age, maternal obesity, hypertensive disorders, birth  and cesarean delivery.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and  gain, which can increase the risk of type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced  gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole- glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673826>Population pharmacokinetics of methotrexate in Mexican pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</a></h2><p>To develop and validate a population pharmacokinetic model of Methotrexate (MTX) in Mexican children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for the design of personalized dosage regimens based on the anthropometric and physiological characteristics of each patient.A prospective study was developed in 50 children (1-15 years old) with ALL diagnosis attended at Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Service from Hospital Central "Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto" and under treatment with high doses of MTX administered in 24-h continuous intravenous infusion.

Initial MTX dosing regimens were established by stochastic simulation with final population pharmacokinetic model.The establishment of MTX dosing criteria in children with ALL should be adjusted based on the BSA of each patient to optimize oncological therapy and reduce the development of adverse effects.

A subsample of 59 patients filled out the same questionnaires at a 6-month follow-up after discharge.Findings evidenced statistically significant changes in all outcome  at both discharge and follow-up. Between 30.1 and 38.6% of patients at discharge and 35.-54.% at the 6-month follow-up showed clinically significant symptomatic change; additionally, 19.8-29.1% of patients at discharge and 22.9-38.3% at follow-up improved reliably. However, 34.9-39.8% remained unchanged and -4.8% worsened. At the 6-month follow-up, 21.3-25.9% showed no symptomatic change and 0-3.7% had deteriorated. Unchanged and deteriorated patients had an earlier age of ED onset and were more likely to suffer a comorbid personality pathology and to be following concurrent pharmacological treatment.Results suggested that intensive and multimodal residential treatment may be effective for the majority of ED patients, and that therapeutic outcomes tend to improve over time. Prevention strategies should focus on early onset subjects and those with concurrent personality pathology.Level III, evidence obtained from a longitudinal cohort study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673991>Safety and Efficacy of Enoxaparin in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>International guidelines support the use of low molecular  heparins for the treatment of thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy. However, evidence of the benefit and harm associated with specific low molecular  heparins such as enoxaparin is dated. No current systematic review and meta-analysis describing the safety and efficacy of enoxaparin for thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy exists.PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on August 17, 2018 for clinical trials or observational studies in pregnant women receiving enoxaparin; patients with a prosthetic heart valve were excluded. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model, and heterogeneity was measured using the I statistic.Of the 485 records identified in the search, 24 studies published clinical trials, and observational studies were found dating back to 2000. Only one observational cohort and one randomized control trial focused on the use of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis and therefore efficacy was not assessed; the other studies included women with recurrent pregnancy loss (15 studies), history of placental vascular complications (five studies), and recurrent in vitro fertilization failure (two studies) and were therefore analyzed in terms of safety only. Bleeding events were non-significantly more often reported for enoxaparin compared to untreated controls (RR 1.35 [0.88-.07]) but less often reported for enoxaparin versus aspirin (RR 0.93 [0.62-1.39]); thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia, and teratogenicity were rarely reported events; in patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, encouragingly the rates of pregnancy loss were significantly lower for enoxaparin compared to untreated controls (RR 0.58 [0.34-0.96]) and enoxaparin + aspirin versus aspirin alone (RR 0.42 [0.32-0.56]) as well as observably lower for enoxaparin versus aspirin alone (RR 0.39 [0.15-1.01]), though significant heterogeneity was observed (I > 60).Literature on the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin for thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis remains scanty, and therefore efficacy was not assessed; in terms of safety, when including other indications for enoxaparin in pregnancy, we found that enoxaparin was associated with significantly lower complications than aspirin. Given differences in study design and study heterogeneity, pregnancy loss results should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, reports of thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia, and congenital malformations were rare.Sanofi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671610>Rice Novel Semidwarfing Gene  Can Be as Effective as Green Revolution Gene .</a></h2><p>Gene effects on the yield performance were compared among promising semidwarf genes, namely, novel gene , representative gene  with different two source IR8 and Jukkoku, and double dwarf combinations of  with each  allele, in a Koshihikari background.

Compared with the yield of Koshihikari (mean, 665.3 g/m), that of the line carrying Jukkoku_ allele showed the highest value (772.6 g/m, 16.1% higher than Koshihikari), while that of IR8_,  and IR8_ plus , was slightly decreased by 7.1%, 5.5%, and 9.7% respectively. The line carrying Jukkoku_ also showed the highest value in number of panicles and florets/panicle, 16.% and 11.1% higher than in Koshihikari, respectively, and these effects were responsible for the increases in yield. The 1000-grain  was equivalent among all genetic lines. Except for the semidwarf line carrying Jukkoku_, semidwarf line carrying  was equivalent to line carrying IR8_in the yield of unpolished rice, and yield components such as panicle length, panicle number, floret number /panicle. Therefore, the semidwarfing gene  is one of the best possible choices in practical breeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672669>Factors Mediating Type  Diabetes Remission and Relapse after Gastric Bypass Surgery.</a></h2><p>Defining factors associated with remission and relapse of type  diabetes (T2D) after gastric bypass (RYGB) may allow targeting modifiable factors. We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.5%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.5%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was 5.3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total  (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year  loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both  loss and  maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

As a result, hostile tumor environment would be developed and profoundly hinders anti-cancer drug activities and fuels tumor progression. In this study, we develop a strategy of sequential sustain release of anti-angiogenic drug, Bevacizumab(BVZ), and anti-cancer drug, Doxorubicin(DOX), using poly (D, L-Lactide)- Poly (ethylene glycol) -Poly (D, L-Lactide) (PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA) hydrogel as a local delivery system. The release profiles of the drugs from the hydrogel were investigated in vitro which confirmed that relatively rapid release of BVZ (73.56 ± 1.39%) followed by Dox (61.21 ± 0.62%) at pH 6.5 for prolonged period. The in vitro cytotoxicity test revealed that the copolymer exhibited negligible cytotoxicity up to .5 mg ml concentration on HaCaT and HeLa cells. Likeways, the in vitro degradation of the copolymer showed 41.63 ± .62% and 73.25 ±4.36%  loss within 6 weeks at pH 7.4 and 6.5, respectively. After a single intratumoral injection of the drug-encapsulated hydrogel on Hela xenograft nude, hydrogel co-loaded with BVZ and Dox displayed the highest tumor suppression efficacy for up to 36 days with no noticeable damage on vital organs. Therefore, localized co-delivery of anti-angiogenic drug and anti-cancer drug by hydrogel system may be a promising approach for enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity  in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal- (77%) -6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity  included  mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal- children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal- children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal- population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of  fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

The purpose of this study was to understand the biomechanical characteristics of bone, implant devices and the bone-implant interface.In-situ digital image correlation was performed on polyurethane foam, a known bone substitute in a modified three-point bend test frame. We introduced this modified rig as an enhanced methodology for characterizing bone and implant device mechanical performance. This new methodology was validated using aluminum rod specimens, in three and four-point bend setups followed by new configurations to reveal implications of load configurations on joint displacement and implant performance. Bone substitute specimens were constructed with nitinol staples or locking plate to minimize gapping at the 1 tarsometatarsal during testing.Bone-implant interface characterization was enabled by digital image correlation, identifying maximum strain concentrations of 1.5% along the interfaces. Interfacial characteristics were analyzed in context with gap displacement allowed by the implant over cyclical loading. The locking plate implant and nitinol staples gapped an average of . mm and 3. mm respectively under 50 Newtons. Removing all load, the locking plate implant and nitinol staples averaged ~0.8 mm and ~0.3 mm of residual gapping respectively.Our results demonstrate that locking plates provide more initial stability and resistance against gapping under load but are unable to recover compression throughout repetitive loading as seen with the nitinol staple technology. This could lead to a paradigm shift in materials used for early  bearing protocols post-operation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous work has shown that many different types of xenoestrogens regulate expression of the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein (StAR), a cholesterol-transporting protein vital to steroid hormone biosynthesis; however, the regulatory mechanisms of StAR are incompletely characterized in fish. To learn more about endogenous expression patterns of StAR in the ovary, LMB were collected from the St. John's River (Florida, USA) over an entire breeding season to investigate StAR expression. Plasma 17β-estradiol and StAR mRNA levels were positively correlated in females, and StAR mRNA levels displayed ∼100-fold increase between primary oocyte growth stages and final maturation. To further study the regulation of StAR, female LMB in the laboratory were fed at ≃% of their  on a diet laden with 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2, 70 or 200 ng EE2 per gram feed). Diets were designed to achieve a physiologically-relevant exposure to EE2, and StAR expression was assessed in vivo. We observed a dose-dependent suppression of StAR mRNA levels, however both diets led to high, pharmacological levels in the blood and do not represent normal physiological ranges of estrogens. In the 200 ng EE2/gm feed group, ovarian StAR mRNA levels were suppressed to approximately 5% of that of the LMB control group. These investigations suggest that LMB StAR increases in expression during oocyte maturation and that it is suppressed by E2 feedback when estrogens levels are high, through the HPG axis. A .9 kb segment of the LMB StAR promoter was examined for putative E2 response elements using in silico software, and a putative estrogen receptor binding element (ERE/-1745) was predicted in the promoter. The functionality of the ERE was examined using MA-10 mouse Leydig cells transfected with the LMB StAR promoter. ER interaction with ERE/-1745 was evaluated under basal and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-treated conditions in the presence and absence of E2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that ER1 binding to the promoter was enriched under basal conditions and E2 exposure elicited an increase in enrichment (4-fold) above that observed under basal conditions. ER2 was not strongly enriched at the ERE/-1745 site, suggesting that StAR may be preferentially regulated by ERα. Taken together, these different experiments provide evidence that LMB StAR is under the control of estrogens and that ERα binds directly to the LMB StAR promoter in an E2-responsive manner.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize related research. Medline, Cochrane Central, and Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau databases were searched for publications on apple or pear intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD)/ cardiometabolic disease (CMD). Studies in adults (healthy or at risk for CVD) that quantified apple or pear intake were included. Random-effects models meta-analysis was used when ≥3 studies reported the same outcome. In total, 22 studies were eligible including 7 randomized controlled trial, 1 nonrandomized trial, and 14 prospective observational studies. In RCTs, apple intake significantly decreased BMI, but made no difference in , serum lipids, blood glucose, or blood pressure. In observational studies, apple or pear intake significantly decreased risk of cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular death, type  diabetes mellitus, and all-cause mortality. No association was reported for cerebral infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage.

Ten Italian Simmental calves were used for the experiment and were offered 6 L of bulk whole milk/d from an open-bucket starting at day  from birth and through 5 weeks. Blood samples were collected at birth and weekly to assess biochemical indicators related to energy metabolism and liver function, minerals, markers of inflammation, and oxidative stress.  (BW), heart girth (HG), and solid feed intake were positively affected by aging. Calves increased solid feed intake consumption after  week and reached a BW gain of 28.16 kg at 5 weeks. Most of blood biomarkers were affected by age, mostly concerned the period after birth and day 1, whereas no changes were observed for haptoglobin, urea, β-hydroxybutyrate, Na, and K. The amount of milk fed to calves throughout this study contributes to the maintenance of glucose concentration over time, coupled also with a considerable amount of starter intake. Glucose levels associated to the high ADG (0.89 ± 0.09 kg/d, mean ± SEM) suggest that calves experienced a positive energy balance throughout the entire pre-weaning period. Similar levels of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, together with a gradual increase of albumin, reflect good liver functionality and a stable condition regarding the inflammatory status. These results suggest that blood biomarkers of Simmental calves in the pre-weaning phase vary with growing stages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore derived and externally validated a household-level risk score to predict tuberculosis among contacts of patients with tuberculosis.In this prospective cohort study, we recruited tuberculosis-affected households from 15 desert shanty towns in Ventanilla and 17 urban communities in Callao, Lima, Peru. Tuberculosis-affected households included index patients with a new diagnosis of tuberculosis and their contacts who reported being in the same house as the index patient for more than 6 h per week in the  weeks preceding index patient diagnosis. Tuberculosis-affected households were not included if the index patient had no eligible contacts or lived alone. We followed contacts until 2018 and defined household tuberculosis, the primary outcome, as any contact having any form of tuberculosis within 3 years. We used logistic regression to identify characteristics of index patients, contacts, and households that were predictive of household tuberculosis, and used these to derive and externally validate a household-level score.Between Dec 12, 2007, and Dec 31, 2015, 16 505 contacts from 3 301 households in Ventanilla were included in a derivation cohort. During the 3-year follow-up, tuberculosis occurred in contacts of index patients in 430 (13%, 95% CI 12-14) households. Index patient predictors were pulmonary tuberculosis and sputum smear grade, age, and the maximum number of hours any contact had spent with the index patient while they had any cough. Household predictors were drug use, schooling of the female head of a household, and lower food spending. Contact predictors were if any of the contacts were children, number of lower- (-mass index [BMI] <20·0 kg/m) adult contacts, number of normal- (BMI 20·0-24·9 kg/m) adult contacts, and number of past or present household members who previously had tuberculosis. In this derivation cohort, the score c statistic was 0·77 and the risk of household tuberculosis in the highest scoring quintile was 31% (95% CI 25-38; 65 of 211) versus % (95% CI 0-4; four of 231) in the lowest scoring quintile. We externally validated the risk score in a cohort of 4248 contacts from 924 households in Callao recruited between April 23, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015. During follow-up, tuberculosis occurred in contacts of index patients in 120 (13%, 95% CI 11-15) households. The score c statistic in this cohort was 0·75 and the risk of household tuberculosis in the highest scoring quintile was 28% (95% CI 21-36; 43 of 154) versus 1% (95% CI 0-5; two of 148) in the lowest scoring quintile. The highest-scoring third of households captured around 70% of all tuberculosis among contacts. A simplified risk score including only five variables performed similarly, with only a small reduction in performance.This externally validated score will enable comprehensive biosocial, household-level interventions to be targeted to tuberculosis-affected households that are most likely to benefit.Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council, Department of Health and Social Care, Department for International Development, Joint Global Health Trials consortium, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Innovation for Health and Development.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Particularly protein-protein interactions (i.e., PPIs), which are responsible for a variety of cellular functions from intracellular signaling to enzyme-substrate specificity, have been studied broadly over the past decades. Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) in particular are used extensively to help determine interaction specificity or candidate interaction motifs at the residue level. However, not all studies successfully report their results as a candidate interaction motif. In many cases, this may be due to a lack of suitable tools for simple analysis and motif generation. Peptide Specificity Analyst (PeSA) was developed with the goal of filling this information gap and providing an easy to use software to aid peptide array analysis and motif generation. PeSA utilizes two models of motif creation: (1) frequency-based using a user-defined peptide list, and () -based using experimental binding results. The ability to produce motifs effortlessly will make studying, interpreting and disseminating peptide specificity results in an effortless and straightforward process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to design and validate a simple, quick and universal weekly rescreening tool to identify hospital acquired nutritional deterioration during a child's hospital stay.A prospective, longitudinal sample of children aged 0-16 years admitted to a paediatric tertiary hospital with a length of stay ≥7 days were included in the study. Agreement between nutritional deterioration markers of reduction in  (kg),  mass index (kg/m), energy intake (kcal/day) and protein intake (g/day) over a 7-day period and two proposed rescreening questions was determined using sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve and positive and negative predictive values.Sixty-one children were included in the study with 224 full 7-day datasets. The sensitivity and specificity of the rescreening question 'Has the child had reduced nutritional intake in the last 7 days' for identifying children with a ≥25% reduction in energy intake over the previous 7-day period were 61.9% (95% CI 41.1-82.7) and 82.% (95% CI 76.9-87.5) respectively.

The assessment of muscle mass was based on preoperative Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (SMI) values. The assessment of malnutrition was based on the Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment, whereas laboratory markers and anthropometric measurements were also recorded. Muscle strength and physical performance were evaluated by measuring patients' handgrip strength and gait speed respectively.76.8% of the study sample were severely malnourished and moderately or suspected of being malnourished, while the prevalence of low muscle mass was 49.1%. Age was significantly higher in low SMI patients compared to normal SMI individuals (67. ± 9. vs 60 ± 10.8, p < 0.001). Albumin was significantly lower in low SMI compared to normal SMI patients, as well as BMI, mid-upper arm circumference, calf circumference and corrected mid arm muscle area. Moreover, malnourished patients exhibited higher rates of low muscle mass (57.8% vs 42.%, p = 0.022) than well-nourished patients. SMI was also significantly correlated with patients' handgrip strength and gait speed.Low muscle mass is strongly correlated with malnutrition and should be taken into consideration when evaluating the nutritional status of patients with oesophago-gastric cancer.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Our primary objectives were (1) evaluation of The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) results; () comparison with results of patients who completed the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form 87 (CHQ-CF87) previously, or the PedsQL Generic Core Scales (PedsQL) survey subsequently; and (3) determination of factors associated with SF-36 domains.Survivors from the d-TGA Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society cohort (1985-1989) completed the SF-36 (2010) as a measure of FHS (n = 210; age 21-26 years). Patient characteristics, medical history, psychosocial factors, and previous adolescent CHQ-CF87 FHS assessment (2000) were explored for association with SF-36 domains, along with comparison with recent PedsQL data (2017).Patients scored themselves the same/higher than published normative data in 10 of 10 SF-36 summary scores/domains and similar in 5 of 6 PedsQL summary scores/domains. Factors commonly associated with lower summary scores/domains of the SF-36 were presence of cardiac symptoms, heart condition impacting physical activity/overall health/quality of life, unemployment, and lack of postsecondary education. Less commonly associated factors were lower birth , greater total medication number, female sex, shorter procedure-free interval, poor health knowledge, lower family income, younger age at SF-36, living with parents, and being married. These factors accounted for 17% to 47% of the variation in FHS summary scores/domains. FHS was minimally related to d-TGA morphology and repair type.Patients with d-TGA surviving into adulthood, regardless of morphology or repair type, can primarily expect normal FHS. Addressing the challenges of patients with d-TGA entering adulthood requires consideration of psychosocial factors and clinical management.Copyright © 2019 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Between 2008 and 2011, a longitudinal study on the growth of breastfed infants was carried out in the Czech Republic. Forty-three GP pediatricians addressed parents at 18-month preventive examinations and collected data on the families' socio-economic conditions and the infants' feeding conditions. The children were measured (length, , and head circumference), and anthropometric measurements from 10 previous preventive examinations were obtained from the health records. Out of the collected 1775 questionnaires, 960 children were selected according to the criteria of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study. For the purpose of this study, 799 children who were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 6 months were selected. We found that the proportions of children who were classified as overweight (>90th percentile) or obese (>97th percentile) at 6, 12, and 18-month examinations were far below the proportions of the Czech references. An update of the Czech references and growth charts is highly recommended by GP pediatricians for the valid assessment of growth and nutritional status, including a screening of overweight and obesity in primary preventive health care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675995>β-arrestin- up-regulates toll-like receptor  signaling and inhibits apoptosis in human endometrial cancer heterotransplants in nude mice.</a></h2><p>β-arrestin-(Arr2) functions as an anti-apoptotic factor and affects cell proliferation, but its downstream molecular pathway in endometrial carcinoma (EC) is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the stable overexpression of Arr2 on the proliferation and apoptosis of human EC heterotransplants and the expression of associated molecules, including Toll-like receptor (TLR2), serine-threonine kinase Akt (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β(GSK3β) and some typical inflammatory cytokines such as NF-κB p56, TNF-α and IL-6 & IL-8.Human EC cell line Ishikawa, stably transfected with Arr2 full-length plasmid, was injected subcutaneously into nude mice. They were treated with 0, 10, 20 mg/kg paclitaxel and the volume and  of the tumor tissue were measured and calculated. The necrotic index were assessed by H&E staining and microscopic observation. The levels of caspase-3, caspase-9, TLR2, NF-κB p56, Akt, GSK3β were measured by western blot, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 were measured by real-time PCR.We found that Arr2 overexpression promoted the growth of human EC heterotransplants. Arr2 attenuated the promotion of caspase-3 and caspase-9 by paclitaxel and mediated the increase of TLR2 and several inflammatory cytokines. The levels of Akt and GSK3β were not affected.Arr2 overexpression was associated with the increase of TLR2 and several inflammatory factors, meanwhile inhibited paclitaxel-induced anti-tumor effect on human EC heterotransplants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675942>An educational intervention to prevent overweight in pre-school years: a cluster randomised trial with a focus on disadvantaged families.</a></h2><p>Early prevention is a promising strategy for reducing obesity in childhood, and Early Years settings are ideal venues for interventions. This work evaluated an educational intervention with the primary aim of preventing overweight and obesity in pre-school children.A pragmatic, cluster randomised trial with a parallel, matched-pair design was undertaken. Interventions were targeted at both the cluster (Early Years' Centres, matched by geographical area) and individual participant level (families: mother and -year old child). At the cluster level, a staff training intervention used the educational resource Be Active, Eat Healthy. Policies and provision for healthy eating and physical activity were evaluated at baseline and 12-months. The intervention at participant level was the Healthy Heroes Activity Pack: delivered over 6 months by Centre staff to promote healthy eating and physical activity in a fun, interactive way. Child and parent height and  were measured at four time-points over  years. The trial primary outcome was the change in BMI z-score of the child between ages  and 4 years. Secondary outcomes consisted of parent-reported  administered at baseline and two-year follow-up.Five pairs of Early Years' Centres were recruited. Four pairs were analysed as one Centre withdrew (47 intervention families; 34 control families). At the cluster level, improvement in Centre policies and practices was similar for both groups (p = 0.830). At the participant level, the intervention group reduced their mean BMI z-score between age  and 4 years (p = 0.002; change difference 0.49; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.80) whereas the control group showed increasing BMI z-score throughout. Changes in parent-reported outcomes and parent BMI (p = 0.582) were similar in both groups.The Healthy Heroes educational resource deterred excess  gain in pre-school children from poor socioeconomic areas. With training, Early Years' staff can implement the Healthy Heroes programme.ISRCTN22620137 Registered 21st December 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677416>Limited impact of influenza A virus vaccination of piglets in an enzootic infected sow herd.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have questioned the effect of maternal derived antibodies (MDAs) to protect piglets against infection with influenza A virus (IAV). The lack of protection against IAV infections provided by MDAs has encouraged alternative vaccination strategies targeting young piglets in an attempt to stimulate an early antibody response. There is a lack of studies documenting the efficacy of piglet vaccination. In the present study, we monitored a group of vaccinated and non-vaccinated piglets in a Danish sow herd that initiated piglet vaccination with ¼ dose of an inactivated swine influenza vaccine at the time of castration (day 3-4). A total of 160 piglets from 11 sows were included and either vaccinated with 0.5 mL inactivated swine influenza vaccine or sham-vaccinated. From week 0 until week 6, all included piglets were clinically examined and nasal swapped once per week and weighed at weeks 0, 3 and 6. Blood samples were collected from sows at week 0 and from piglets at week 3. Vaccination of piglets had limited effect on clinical signs, , antibody development and viral shedding, within the first 6 weeks of life. At least 50% of all pigs of each treatment group tested positive for IAV at week , and very early onset of IAV shedding was observed. In total, 18 pigs were IAV positive in nasal swabs for more than one consecutive sampling time indicating prolonged shedding and 14 pigs were IAV positive with negative samplings in between indicating re-infection with the same IAV strain.Copyright © 2019.

Sixty multiparous, pregnant lactating Holstein cows with somatic cell count <200,000/mL were blocked by days in milk and milk yield and randomly assigned to receive a daily top-dressed dietary supplement containing 1 or 3 mg of vitamin D (1mgD or 3mgD), or 1 or 3 mg 25(OH)D (1mg25D or 3mg25D) for 28 d (n = 15/treatment). Cows were kept in a freestall barn and fed a total mixed ration in individual feeding gates. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk and blood samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to the start of treatment. At 21 d, cows fed 1mgD and 3mg25D received an intramammary challenge with Streptococcus uberis. Cows were observed for severity of mastitis, and blood and milk samples were collected every 12 h to measure inflammation. The 1mg25D and 3mg25D cows had greater serum 25(OH)D concentrations at 21 d compared with 1mgD and 3mgD cows (62 ± 7, 66 ± 8, 135 ± 15, and 232 ± 26 ng/mL for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). The 3mg25D cows had greater concentrations of Ca and P in serum at 21 d compared with other treatments (Ca = .38, .4, .37, and .48 ± 0.02 mM, 1.87, 1.88, and .10 ± 0.08 mM for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). Yields of milk and milk components, DMI, , and concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and Mg in serum did not differ among treatments. Abundance of mRNA transcripts for interleukin-1β (IL1β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in milk somatic cells before S. uberis challenge were increased in cows fed 25(OH)D compared with cows fed vitamin D. Furthermore, IL1β, iNOS, β-defensin 7, and β-defensin 10 in milk somatic cells increased as concentrations of 25(OH)D increased in serum. Cows fed 3mg25D had less severe mastitis at 60 and 72 h after challenge with S. uberis compared with cows fed 1mgD. Concentrations of bacteria, somatic cells, and serum albumin in milk after challenge did not differ between treatments; however, an interaction between treatment and day was detected for lactate dehydrogenase in milk. Expression of adhesion protein CD11b on milk neutrophils after the S. uberis challenge was greater among 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Transcripts of CYP24A1 and iNOS in milk somatic cells during mastitis also were greater in 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Feeding 25(OH)D increased serum 25(OH)D more effectively than supplemental vitamin D, resulting in increased serum mineral concentrations, increased expression of vitamin D-responsive genes, and altered immune responses to intramammary bacterial challenge.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

The elaborate matrix of vegetables, and the presence of phytates and other inhibitors make study of these mechanisms difficult. In this qualitative study, extracts from freeze-dried savoy cabbage, broccoli, kale and spinach were subjected to digestion in vitro at pH .0 and pH 7.5 and analysed using SEC-ICP-MS. The results suggest that low molecular  species (peak 6), related to the iron and zinc fractions, which appeared after acidic digestion in all vegetables, except in kale, were considerably reduced after digestion at pH 7.5. Low molecular  species (peak 9), related to the phosphorus fraction, were present in all vegetables, except in kale, after alkaline digestion. While cabbage, broccoli and spinach showed similar degradation patterns, kale showed a different degradation behaviour.Copyright © 2019.

We present a simple, low-cost method for the sensitive and efficient extraction from soil of thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid, the three neonicotinoid insecticides approved in New Zealand as seed coatings. We have validated this method by applying it to uncontaminated soil samples spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of the three targets. Absolute recoveries were >80% with instrument detection limits <1 ng g wet soil. We also applied the method to soil samples collected from maize fields in New Zealand's North Island and found imidacloprid in 43 out of 45 samples and clothianidin in every one. Mean imidacloprid concentrations varied from 0.5 to 9.4 ng g (wet ) and clothianidin from .1 to 26.7 ng g (wet ). Imidacloprid concentrations exceed the New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Exposure Limit of 1 ng g (dry ) at eight of the nine sites sampled. These results are remarkable because we have detected multiple neonicotinoid residues at every site sampled. Imidacloprid residues appear to persist at significant concentrations at five of our sites from an application at least two years previously. This is only the third study to report the presence of neonicotinoid residues in NZ's environment and the first to show that those residues are persistent in the environment at nominally hazardous concentrations.Copyright © 2019.

This was a randomised controlled trial included 114 women with placenta praevia (between 24 and 28 weeks). They were randomly assigned to group I (17α-OHP-C) who received weekly injection of 17α-OHP-C (250 mg/IM) till completing 37 weeks' gestation or group II (Non 17α-OHP-C). The percentage of placenta praevia patients went into PTD in the 17α-OHP-C group was significantly less in comparison to the PTD in the Non 17α-OHP-C group (∼37%  63.5%,  = .004). Furthermore, the mean gestational age was significantly longer (36.7 ± 0.7  34.9 ± 1. weeks,  < .000), the mean number of bleeding attacks was significantly less and the mean birth  was significantly higher (2841 ± 159  2561 ± 168 g,  < .000). In conclusion, maintenance tocolysis with intramuscular 17α-OHP-C in placenta praevia women appears beneficial in decreasing the number of bleeding attacks, the percentage of PTD and the neonatal ICU admission.IMPACT STATEMENT Over the last two decades, a large number of studies indicated that placenta praevia is a major risk factor for preterm labour and prematurity with its neonatal complications. Increasing caesarean section rates had proportionally increased the incidence of placenta praevia. Up to now, the effective and safe tocolytic agent among these patients is not established. The results of this study (prospective, randomised and controlled with calculated sample size) added a considerable support for hydroxyprogesterone caproate as an effective, safe and cheap tocolytic agent with excellent patient compliance. Our findings may prompt researchers to conduct a large multicentre study to evaluate the prophylactic use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate to decrease preterm labour due to placenta praevia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668669>Early prenatal exposure to suspected endocrine disruptor mixtures is associated with lower IQ at age seven.</a></h2><p>Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics with the ability to interfere with hormone action, even at low levels. Prior environmental epidemiology studies link numerous suspected EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, results for some chemicals were inconsistent and most assessed one chemical at a time.To evaluate the overall impact of prenatal exposure to an EDC mixture on neurodevelopment in school-aged children, and identify chemicals of concern while accounting for co-exposures.Among 718 mother-child pairs from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA) study, we used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to assess the association between 26 EDCs measured in 1st trimester urine or blood, with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (IV) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 7 years. Models were adjusted for child sex, gestational age, mother's education, mother's IQ (RAVEN), , and smoking status. To evaluate generalizability, we conducted repeated holdout validation, a machine learning technique.Using repeated holdout validation, IQ scores were 1.9-points (CI = -3.6, -0.) lower among boys for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in the WQS index. BPF made the largest contribution to the index with a  of 14%. Other chemicals of concern and their  included PBA (9%), TCP (9%), MEP (6%), MBzP (4%), PFOA (6%), PFOS (5%), PFHxS (4%), Triclosan (5%), and BPA (4%). While we did observe an inverse association between EDCs and IQ among all children when training and testing the WQS index estimate on the full dataset, these results were not robust to repeated holdout validation.Among boys, early prenatal exposure to EDCs was associated with lower intellectual functioning at age 7. We identified bisphenol F as the primary chemical of concern, suggesting that the BPA replacement compound may not be any safer for children. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential neurotoxicity of replacement analogues.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the placenta in MCLR-induced significant reduction in fetal , especially the changes in placental structure and function. Pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with MCLR (5 or 20 μg/kg) from gestational day (GD) 13 to GD17. The results showed MCLR reduced fetal  and placenta . The histological specimens of the placentas were taken for light and electron microscopy studies. The internal space of blood vessels decreased obviously in the placental labyrinth layer of mice treated with MCLR. After the ultrastructural examination, the edema and intracytoplasmic vacuolization, dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum and corrugation of the nucleus were observed. In addition, maternal MCLR exposure caused a reduction of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  (HSD11B2) expression in placentae, a critical regulator of fetal development. Several genes of placental growth factors, such as Vegfα and Pgf and several genes of nutrient transport pumps, such as Glut1 and Pcft were depressed in placentas of MCLR-treated mice, however nutrient transporters Fatp1 and Snat4 were promoted. Moreover, significant increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) revealed the occurrence of oxidative stress caused by MCLR, which was also verified by remarkable decrease in the glutathione levels, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that GRP78, CHOP, XBP-1, peIF2α and pIRE1 were remarkable increased in placentas of MCLR-treated mice, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway was activated by MCLR. Furthermore, oxidative stress and ER stress consequently triggered apoptosis which contributed to the impairment of placental development. Collectively, these results suggest maternal MCLR exposure results in reduced fetal , which might be associated with ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and impairment in placental structure and function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a typical surfactant, R-6-AO not only stabilizes oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions at concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.6 mM, but also forms gel emulsions at concentrations beyond the CGC with the oil volume fraction freely adjustable between % and 95%. Cryo-TEM images reveal that R-6-AO molecules self-assemble into left-handed helical fibers with cross-sectional diameters of about 10 nm in pure water which can be turned to very stable hydrogels at concentrations above the CGC. Compared with traditional high internal phase emulsions, the gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO can be prepared with different oils such as n-dodecane, n-decane, n-octane, soybean oil, olive oil and tricaprylin, due to the tricyclic diterpene hydrophobic structure in their molecules which enable them to adopt a unique arrangement in the fibers. The intriguing properties of gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO are believed to be significant and helpful for the preparation of new soft materials and other applications.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

According to the transactional model parental factors can play a significant role in influencing infant sleep development. The purpose of the current study was to explore the combined effect of infants' factors (temperament and sleep onset problems), and parental factors (parental mental health in terms of post-partum affective disorders, consistent bedtime routines and fathers' involvement at bedtime), on infant bedtime difficulties (e.g. fussing, crying or protesting), including both maternal and paternal perspectives.Sixty Italian intact two-parent families of infants (34 boys and 26 girls) ageing from 8 to 12 months (M = 10.73, SD = .54) were enrolled in the study. The parents filled out self-report questionnaires to measure the aforementioned variables. To investigate which infant and parental factors predicted infants' bedtime difficulties, two multiple linear regressions (MR), one for fathers and one for mothers, and relative  analyses (RWA) were conducted.With regard to infants' bedtime difficulties reported by fathers (R = .35) they were explained by infant involvement in constant bedtime routines (β = -.35, p = .030) and paternal involvement at bedtime (β = -.45, p = .007). Instead infants' bedtime difficulties reported by mothers (R = .32) were explained by minutes the child taken to fall asleep (β = .24, p = .04), infant involvement in constant bedtime routines (β = -.31, p = .01) and bedtime paternal involvement (β = -.27, p = .05).The main results of this study emphasized the protective role of consistent bedtime routines and bedtime paternal involvement in reducing infants' bedtime difficulties perceived both from mothers and fathers.

Renal volume, renal artery blood flow (RABF), renal cortex perfusion and diffusion, and cardiac index were measured with magnetic resonance imaging.Ten of 12 males [mean (SE) age 23.9 (0.8) years] recruited, completed the study. Increase in  and extracellular fluid volume were significantly less after infusion B than infusions A and C, but changes in blood volume did not significantly differ between infusions. All infusions increased renal volume, with no significant differences between infusions. There was no significant difference in RABF across the infusion time course or between infusion types. Renal cortex perfusion decreased during the infusion (mean 18% decrease from baseline), with no significant difference between infusions. There was a trend for increased renal cortex diffusion (4.% increase from baseline) for the crystalloid infusion. All infusions led to significant increases in cardiac index.A smaller volume of colloid (4% succinylated gelatin) was as effective as a larger volume of crystalloid at expanding blood volume, increasing cardiac output and changing renal function. Significantly less interstitial space expansion occurred with the colloid.The protocol was registered with the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (https://eudract.ema.europa.eu) (EudraCT No. 2013-003260-32).Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

This phase I study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties, safety, and intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of OMDI.  Fourteen healthy male volunteers (7 Japanese and 7 Caucasian) 20-35 years of age received 1 drop of OMDI 0.0025% at 9:00 h in both eyes for 7 days. Blood samples were taken predose and up to 8 h postdose on days 1, 3, and 7. The plasma concentration of OMD was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters measured included the maximum plasma concentration () and the half-life () of OMD. IOP, adverse events (AEs), ophthalmic examinations, vital signs, and laboratory values were assessed.   for all subjects was reached after 10-15 min and decreased with a  of ∼30 min.  statistical analyses found significant differences in some pharmacokinetic parameters between Japanese and Caucasian subjects, likely due to differences in . These differences reduced over 7 days of dosing and were not thought to be clinically meaningful. There was no OMD accumulation after 7 days of repeated dosing. Mean IOP was reduced by ∼4-5 mmHg between baseline and  h postdose, remaining stable from day 3 onward. All AEs were mild and considered treatment related.  Pharmacokinetic parameters of OMD were similar between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. There was no accumulation of OMD after 7 days of dosing. OMDI was well tolerated and demonstrated clinically significant IOP reductions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677207>1-Palmitoyl--linoleoyl-3-acetyl-rac-glycerol Ameliorates Chemoradiation-Induced Oral Mucositis.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate whether necroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis in a murine model and whether 1-palmitoyl--linoleoyl-3-acetyl-rac-glycerol (PLAG) ameliorates this disorder.A chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis model was established by treating mice with concurrent 5-fluorouracil (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and head and neck X-irradiation (20 Gy). Phosphate buffer saline or PLAG (100 mg/kg or 250 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered daily.   were recorded daily, and mice were sacrificed on Day 9 for tongue tissue analysis.On Day 9, chemoradiotherapy-treated (ChemoRT) mice had tongue ulcerations and experienced significant  loss (Day 0: 26.18±1.41 g; Day 9: 19.44±3.26 g). They also had elevated serum macrophage inhibitory protein  (MIP-) (control: 5.57±3.49 pg/mL; ChemoRT: 130.14±114.54 pg/mL) and interleukin (IL)-6 (control: 198.25±16.91 pg/mL; ChemoRT: 467.25±108.12 pg/mL) levels. ChemoRT-treated mice who received PLAG exhibited no  loss (Day 0: 25.78±1.04 g; Day 9: 26.46±1.68 g) and had lower serum MIP- (4.42±4.04 pg/mL) and IL-6 (205.75±30.41 pg/mL) levels than ChemoRT-treated mice who did not receive PLAG. Tongue tissues of mice who received PLAG also displayed lower phosphorylation levels of necroptotic signalling proteins.PLAG mitigated chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis by modulating necroptosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The focus was on pigs weaned light, as they may be better off when weaned at a later age and/or offered a specialist nursery feeding regime. Piglets (n = 1448) from one farrowing batch of 110 sows that farrowed over  wks, were individually weighed and their morphometric measurements were taken at birth. Pigs were weaned on the same day, but variation in birth date resulted in variable weaning ages (mean age d 34.1, SD = .5). The youngest 50% at weaning were classified Y and the oldest 50% as O; within an age class, the lightest 50% were classified L, the heaviest 50% as H, and housed accordingly. Pigs were individually weighed at weaning, 7- and 15- wks post-weaning. At weaning Y were 6 d younger and 1.4 kg lighter than O pigs, whereas L were 3. kg lighter than H pigs. Pigs were randomly allocated to a 3-stage superior (SUP) or control (CON) nursery feeding regime, with SUP pigs having a 65% greater allowance (on a kg/pig basis) of the first and second stage feeds than the CON. Pigs weaned Y had a higher mortality rate from weaning to 7- wks post-weaning than pigs weaned O (9.14 vs. 4.98%; P = 0.046). As expected, age and  significantly (P < 0.001) affected performance to both 7 and 15-wks post weaning: at 15- wks pigs weaned Y were 5.5 kg lighter than pigs weaned O; pigs weaned L were 9.0 kg lighter than H pigs. It was estimated that pigs weaned YL needed ~4 d more (P = 0.018) to reach 60 kg  (BW) than pigs weaned OL. Feed intake was not affected by feeding regime, age and , or their interactions. Performance was not affected by feeding regime (P > 0.05), but was affected by the  x feeding regime interaction (P = 0.044) to 7- wks post-weaning: L pigs on SUP were 1. kg heavier than L pigs on the CON regime; this was not the case for the H pigs. Performance up to 7- wks post-weaning was positively associated with birth  to cranial circumference ratio and weaning  (P < 0.05) for both YL and OL pigs; for the latter additional performance predictors were weaning age (P = 0.044) and feeding (P = 0.027). Improved growth for L pigs up to 7 wks post-weaning could be obtained by a greater allowance of the nursery diets. However, weaning at a later age benefitted performance of L pigs to a common BW, suggesting that this might be a strategy with longer term benefits.© The Author(s) 2019.

The outcome was whole  aBMD (g/cm²) measured at 22 years of age using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The effects of exposures,  and length/height gain, were analyzed using conditional relative  (CWh) and conditional length/height (CH). Linear regression models were adjusted for multiple confounders, including mother's educational level, family income, maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, breastfeeding and skin color.In the adjusted models, among men greater height gain at 4, 11, and 18 years of age was associated with higher whole  aBMD, and the result with greatest magnitude was at 11 years of age (β 0.018 g/cm²; 95%CI 0.006; 0.030). Among women, aBMD was associated with height gain at all assessments from 1-15 years, with greatest effect size at 4 years of age (β 0.017 g/cm²; 95%CI 0.007; 0.027).

Remicade (innovator infliximab [IFX]) may cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. Hence, evidence is needed to optimize treatment while carefully weighing benefits and risks to the mother and child. Here, we report on birth and infant outcomes (up to  years) following gestational exposure to IFX based on a summary of cumulative pregnancy reports in women exposed to IFX during pregnancy from the Janssen global safety database.Prospective and medically confirmed safety data on IFX-exposed pregnancies from Janssen's global safety surveillance database since authorization in 1998 are summarized. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize pregnancy and infant outcomes overall, by disease and timing of exposure.As of 23 August 2018, 1850 maternally IFX-exposed pregnancies with known outcomes were identified from the safety database. Of the 1850 pregnancies (mean age 29.7 years), 1526 (82.5%) resulted in live births. When reported, most women had Crohn's disease (67.7%) or ulcerative colitis (18.4%), and 82.8% of live births were exposed to IFX in the first trimester. Spontaneous abortion/intrauterine death/ectopic pregnancy/molar pregnancy (12.1%), preterm births (9.%), low birth  infants (3.6%), congenital anomalies (.0%), and infant infections (1.%) were documented. The type of congenital anomalies and frequency of serious infant infections observed were consistent with the general population. Frequencies of congenital anomalies and other adverse outcomes were similar in women exposed to IFX in the first trimester and those exposed in the third trimester. More preterm births (13-18.8%) and infant complications (8.7-12.5%) were reported with concomitant immunosuppressant use.The observed prevalence of adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes including congenital anomalies following exposure to IFX did not exceed estimates reported for the general population and no unexpected patterns were observed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673504>Safety evaluation of calcium L-methylfolate.</a></h2><p>Calcium L-methylfolate (L-5-MTHF-Ca; CAS Number 151533-22-1) is a source of folate and an alternative to folic acid for use in human food and food supplements. The safety of L-5-MTHF-Ca was evaluated by testing for genotoxicity, subchronic and prenatal developmental toxicity. In  assays L-5-MTHF-Ca was not mutagenic and did not induce other chromosomal events. Additionally, L-5-MTHF-Ca was not genotoxic in the  micronucleus test nor did it induce DNA damage in rat liver cells. In a subchronic toxicity study, rats administered up to 400 mg/kg bw/day of L-5-MTHF-Ca  oral gavage for 13 weeks had no treatment-related mortalities, and no treatment-related effects were identified on behaviour, , food consumption, ophthalmology, haematology, or organ . No treatment-related macroscopic or histopathological findings were observed. Calcium and sodium levels increased with increasing dosage, however the slight increases were within historical control ranges and reversible after the recovery period. L-5-MTHF-Ca is neither teratogenic nor embryotoxic. Based on the results of the  and  studies, the safe use of L-5-MTHF-Ca as an ingredient in foods is supported. The no observed adverse effect level was the highest dose in the subchronic toxicity study,  400 mg/kg bw/day for male and female rats.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669004>Evaluating steady-state resting energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry in adults with overweight and obesity.</a></h2><p>Determining a period of steady state (SS) is recommended when estimating resting energy expenditure (REE) using a metabolic cart. However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and obesity.In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study ; n = 51)  loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a 5-min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first 5-min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE).  composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study  participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), 5-min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated  ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ± 5 kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the 5-min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast 5 min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and obesity. However, future trials should validate alternative methods in similar populations to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We evaluated how the clinical phenotype of patients initiating GLP-1RA changed from 2010 to 2018.This was a retrospective study conducted at six diabetes outpatient clinics in Northeast Italy. We collected data of T2D patients who initiated new GLP-1RA between 2010 and 2018. We recorded baseline characteristics, including demographics, anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, lipid profile, liver enzymes, renal function and concomitant medications. We recorded updated HbA1c and  at follow-up.There were 83,116 T2D patients from a general population of ~ 1,380,000 inhabitants. Among 6167 cases of GLP-1RA initiation, 5408 were analyzed after excluding intra-class switchers. Prescription of GLP-1RA increased exponentially, and the change in the type of GLP-1RA reflected waves of their entering the market. From 2010 to 2018, there were significant increases in baseline age, diabetes duration and prevalence of male sex, of cardiovascular disease and of insulin users. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels decreased concomitantly with increasing use of medications for the control of cardiovascular risk. Baseline average HbA1c (8.3% [67 mmol/mol]) and BMI (34 kg/m) and their improvement after GLP-1RA initiation did not change over time.Despite the early positioning of GLP-1RA in T2D treatment algorithms, GLP-1RA have been prescribed in patients with progressively more advanced disease stage and especially in the presence of cardiovascular disease. Optimization of GLP-1RA use in routine clinical practice is still needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673474>The predictive value of  gain and waist circumference for gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The first objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational  gain (WG), waist circumference (WC), prepregnancy, and gestational  mass index (BMI). The second aim of our study was to assess the ability of WG, WC, prepregnancy, and gestational BMI with special reference to their cut-off points on predicting the risk of GDM in pregnant women in Turkey.A total of 261 women who underwent screening for GDM with the 75-g glucose tolerance test (GTT) between 24 and 28 gestational weeks were included. According to the 75-g oral GTT results, women were classified into two groups: the GDM group and non-GDM group. The data collected included age, parity, plasma glucose level for fasting, 1- and -h tests, WC, prepregnancy and gestational BMI, prepregnancy , WG during pregnancy, gestational age at birth, and birth .WC at 20-24 weeks of gestation, prepregnancy BMI, and gestational BMI had a predictive capacity for GDM. According to our results, optimal cut-off points for the best predictive value of GDM were WC of 100 cm with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 70%, prepregnancy BMI of 25 kg/m with a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 76%, and gestational BMI of 28.3 kg/m with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 77.4%.The measurement of prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC may be useful in predicting the risk of GDM. Pregnant women with increased prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC measurements may be susceptible to the development of GDM.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677835>Effects of feeding live yeast at  dosages on performance and feeding behavior of dairy cows under heat stress.</a></h2><p>The objectives were to evaluate the effects of feeding different amounts of supplemental live yeast (LY) on performance and digestion of cows under heat stress. Sixty Holstein cows, 27 multiparous and 33 primiparous, were blocked by parity and milk yield in the first 20 d in milk (DIM) and randomly assigned to receive 0, 0.5, or 1.0 g/d of LY, resulting in daily intakes of 0, 14., and 37.6 billion cells, respectively, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CNCM I-1077 from 30 to 107 DIM. Cows were milked twice daily, dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were measured daily, and milk components, , and  condition were measured weekly. Blood was sampled weekly and plasma analyzed for concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, urea N, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and acid-soluble protein. Digestibility of nutrients was measured in the last  wk of the experiment. Ruminal fluid was collected on  consecutive days 6 h after the morning feeding for measurements of pH, concentrations of short chain fatty acids, and NH-N. Feeding behavior was observed for 48 h on experiment d 21 and 63. The mean ambient temperature was 26.8°C, humidity was 83.%, and the temperature and humidity index ranged from 73 to 81. Treatment did not affect rectal temperature (38.9 ± 0.04°C) or DMI but increased yield of energy-corrected milk (ECM; 35. vs. 36.1 vs. 37. kg/d for 0, 0.5, and 1.0 g/d, respectively) and efficiency of conversion of DM into ECM (1.70, 1.79, and 1.83 for 0, 0.5, and 1 g/d, respectively). Feeding LY increased digestibility of crude protein (65.1 vs. 68.8 vs. 70.4%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 47.5 vs. 49. vs. 55.%), and concentration of acetate (64.7 vs. 69.1 vs. 72. mM), which resulted in increased concentration of total short chain fatty acids in ruminal fluid (110.3 vs. 117.7 vs. 121.4 mM). Mean ruminal pH increased (5.99 vs. 6.03 vs. 6.26), and proportion of cows with pH <5.8 decreased linearly (42.9 vs. 34.9 vs. 7.7%) with increasing inclusion of LY. Concentrations of acute-phase proteins decreased with increasing amount of LY. Some aspects of feeding behavior were altered by LY, and meal size reduced quadratically (3., 3.5, and .9 kg of DM, respectively), whereas interval between rumination bouts tended to reduce linearly (122, 96.5, and 90.7 min, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. Chewing time per kilogram of NDF tended to increase linearly (71.6, 71.3, and 81.6 min/kg, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. The estimated net energy for lactation of the diet increased 5.%, from 1.72 Mcal/kg of DM for 0 g of LY to 1.81 Mcal/kg for 1 g of LY. Feeding 1 g of LY/d to cows under heat stress increased yield of ECM and efficiency of feed conversion into ECM, improved diet digestibility, and increased ruminal fluid pH; these responses might be related either to direct effects of LY on ruminal microbial activity or to changes in feeding behavior that improved digestion of cows in heat stress.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Even without chemical supplementation, mechanical stimulation by shear stress may help to induce the desired differentiation. The cell format, such as three-dimensional (3D) microtissues (MTs), MT-derived cells or single cells (SCs), may have a pivotal impact as well. Here, we studied modulation of gene expression in human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exposed to shear stress and/or after MT formation.Electrospun meshes of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles (PLGA/aCaP) at a  ratio of 60:40 were seeded with human ASCs as MTs or as SCs and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without chemical supplementation. After  weeks of static culture, the scaffolds were cultured statically for another  weeks or placed in a Bose® bioreactor with a flow rate per area of 0.16 mL cm min. Stiffness of the scaffolds was assessed as a function of time. After 4 weeks, minimum stem cell criteria markers and selected markers of osteogenesis, endothelial cell differentiation, adipogenesis and chondrogenesis were analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, cell distribution within the scaffolds and the allocation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) in the cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry.MTs decayed completely within  weeks after seeding on PLGA/aCaP. The osteogenic marker gene alkaline phosphatase and the endothelial cell marker gene CD31 were upregulated in MT-derived ASCs compared with SCs. Shear stress realised by fluid flow perfusion upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma  expression in MT-derived ASCs and in SCs. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of YAP expression was doubled under perfusion compared with that under static culture for MT-derived ASCs and SCs.Osteogenic and angiogenic commitments were more pronounced in MT-derived ASCs seeded on bone biomimetic electrospun nanocomposite PLGA/aCaP than in SCs seeded without induction medium. Furthermore, the static culture was superior to the perfusion regimen used here, as shear stress resulted in adipogenic commitment for MT-derived ASCs and SCs, although the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio indicated higher cell tensions under perfusion, usually associated with preferred osteogenic differentiation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Muscle force imbalance is the primary cause of such deformity. Many diseases can lead to muscle force imbalance, such as tethered cord syndrome, cerebral palsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and trauma. At present, many surgical treatments are available for cavovarus foot. For older children, priority should be given to midfoot osteotomy and fusion. Since complications such as abnormal foot length, foot stiffness, and abnormal gait tend to develop postoperatively, it is important to preserve the joints and correct the deformity as much as possible. Adequate soft tissue release and muscle balance are the keys to correcting the deformity and avoiding its postoperative recurrence.To assess the efficacy of soft tissue release combined with joint-sparing osteotomy in the treatment of cavovarus foot deformity in older children.The clinical data of 21 older children with cavovarus foot deformity (28 feet) who were treated surgically at the Ninth Department of Orthopedics of Jizhong Energy Xingtai Mining Group General Hospital from November 2014 to July 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 14 years old, with an average age of 12.46 ± 1.20 years. Their main clinical manifestations were deformity, pain, and gait abnormality. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine, electromyographic examination, -bearing anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of the feet, and the Coleman block test. Surgical procedures including metatarsal fascia release, Achilles tendon or medial gastrocnemius lengthening, "V"-shaped osteotomy on the dorsal side of the metatarsal base, opening medial cuneiform wedge osteotomy, closing cuboid osteotomy, anterior transfer of the posterior tibial tendon, peroneus longus-to-brevis transfer, and calcaneal sliding osteotomy to correct hindfoot varus deformity were performed. After surgery, long leg plaster casts were applied, the plaster casts were removed 6 wk later, Kirschner wires were removed, and functional exercise was initiated. The patients began -bearing walk 3 mo after surgery. Therapeutic effects were evaluated using the Wicart grading system, and Meary's angles and Hibbs' angles were measured based on X-ray images obtained preoperatively and at last follow-up to assess their changes.The patients were followed for 6 to 32 mo, with an average follow-up period of 17.68 ± 6.290 mo. Bone healing at the osteotomy site was achieved at 3 mo in all cases. According to the Wicart grading system, very good results were achieved in 18 feet, good in 7, and fair in 3, with a very good/good rate of 89.3%. At last follow-up, mean Meary's angle was 6.36° ± 1.810°, and mean Hibbs' angle was 160.21° ± 4.167°, both of which were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (24.11° ± .948° and 135.86° ± 5.345°, respectively;  < 0.001 for both). No complications such as infection, skin necrosis, or bone nonunion occurred.Soft tissue release combined with joint-sparing osteotomy has appreciated efficacy in the treatment of cavovarus foot deformity in older children.©The Author(s) 2019.

Depressive symptoms and perceived stress have been identified as possible risk factors for beta cell dysfunction and diabetes. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between depression symptoms and perceived stress with beta cell function between African and Haitian Americans with and without type  diabetes.Informed consent and data were available for 462 participants (231 African Americans and 231 Haitian Americans) for this cross-sectional study. A demographic questionnaire developed by the Primary Investigator was used to collect information regarding age, gender, smoking, and ethnicity. Diabetes status was determined by self-report and confirmed by fasting blood glucose. Anthropometrics (, and height and waist circumference) and vital signs (blood pressure) were taken. Blood samples were drawn after 8 - 10 hours over-night fasting to measure lipid panel, fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations. The homeostatic model assessment, version  (HOMA2) computer model was used to calculate beta cell function. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and stress levels were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).Moderate to severe depressive symptoms were more likely for persons with diabetes (p = 0.030). There were no differences in perceived stress between ethnicity and diabetes status (p = 0.283). General linear models for participants with and without type  diabetes using beta cell function as the dependent variable showed no association with depressive symptoms and perceived stress; however, Haitian Americans had significantly lower beta cell function than African Americans both with and without diabetes and adjusting for age, gender, waist circumference and smoking. Further research is needed to compare these risk factors in other race/ethnic groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678694>Functional resistance training during walking: Mode of application differentially affects gait biomechanics and muscle activation patterns.</a></h2><p>Task-specific loading of the limbs-termed as functional resistance training-is commonly used in gait rehabilitation; however, the biomechanical and neuromuscular effects of various forms of functional resistance training have not been studied systematically. This information is crucial for correctly selecting the appropriate mode of functional resistance training when treating individuals with gait disorders.To comprehensively evaluate the biomechanical (i.e., joint moment and power) and muscle activation changes with different forms of functional resistance training that are commonly used in clinics and research using biomechanical simulation-based analyses.We developed simulations of functional resistance training during walking using OpenSim (Gait2354, 23 degrees of freedom and 54 muscles) and custom MATLAB scripts. We investigated five modes of functional resistance training that have been commonly used in clinics or in research: (1) a  attached at the ankle, () an elastic band attached at the ankle, (3) a viscous device attached to the hip and knee, (4) a  attached at the pelvis, and (5) a constant backwards pulling force at the pelvis. Lower-extremity joint moments and powers were computed using inverse dynamics and muscle activations were estimated using computed muscle control while walking with each device under multiple resistance levels: normal walking with no resistance, and walking with 30, 60, and 90 Newtons of resistance.The results indicate that the way in which resistance is applied during gait training differentially affects the internal joint moments, powers, and muscle activations as well as the joints and phase of the gait cycle where the resistance was experienced.The results highlight the importance of understanding the joints and muscles that are targeted by various modes of functional resistance training and carefully choosing the best mode of training that meets the specific therapeutic needs of the patient.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated effects and underlying mechanisms of LiCl on lipid accumulation. LiCl induced dose-dependent lipid accumulation in HepG2 and RAW264.7 cells under normal as well as high glucose conditions. LiCl exposure additionally promoted lipid accumulation in livers of zebrafish. SB216763, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, did not affect lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Expression of key lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and aP2, as well as SR-B1 were increased in RAW264.7 cells. LiCl enhanced FAS, ACC and SCD-1 mRNA levels while suppressing CPT-1 in HepG2 cells. LiCl stimulated DNA binding activities of SREBP-1c and ChREBP. LiCl activated AMPK phosphorylation but the AMPK inhibitor, AICAR, did not suppress LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7. LiCl, but not SB216763, induced a significant increase in ROS in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells. NOX activity was dose-dependently enhanced by LiCl. Furthermore, NOX-1, NOX- and DUOX-1 mRNA levels were upregulated at an early stage of LiCl stimulation. LiCl-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by the antioxidant, NAC, and inhibitors of NOX, DPI and APO. Phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of CREB were enhanced by LiCl. The cell-permeable cAMP analog, di-butyryl cAMP, not only promoted lipid accumulation itself but also LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 cells. H-89, a PKA inhibitor, suppressed CREB activation, lipid accumulation and NOX activity in RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicate that LiCl stimulates lipid accumulation in hepatocyte and macrophage cells potentially through increased PKA-dependent ROS production.Copyright © 2019.

BMI z scores were calculated, student obesity or obesity/overweight was determined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts, and these data were combined with the locations of four food outlet types (fast-food restaurants, wait-service restaurants, corner stores, and supermarkets) to calculate distance to the nearest outlet. Associations between  status outcomes and distance to these food outlet types were examined using neighborhood (census tract) fixed effects.Living farther than 0.025 mile (about half of a city block) from the nearest fast-food restaurant was associated with lower obesity and obesity/overweight risk and lower BMI z scores. Results ranged from .5% to 4.4% decreased obesity. Beyond this distance, there were generally no impacts of the food environment and little to no impact of other food outlet types.Proximity to fast-food restaurants was inversely related to childhood obesity, but no relationships beyond that were seen. These findings can help better inform policies focused on food access, which could, in turn, reduce childhood obesity.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668653>The Long Term Effects of Intrascrotal Low Dose and High Dose N-Acetylcysteine on Testis Damage in Rat Model of Testicular Torsion.</a></h2><p>During testicular torsion, the testes face oxidative damage owing to ischemia/reperfusion. We studied the long term effects of the intrascrotal administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during detorsion procedure in a rat model of testicular torsion.Twenty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) Control group: No procedure was done (): Torsion-detorsion group: Testis torsion applied for 3 h (3): Low Dose Group: After testis torsion-detorsion (for 3 h) 10 mg/kg NAC was given into tunica vaginalis (4): High Dose Group: After testis torsion-detorsion (for 3 h) 100 mg/kg NAC was given into tunica vaginalis. We measured dimensions of the testes and examined pathological findings and Johnsen and Cosantino Scores.For testes height and volume, high dose NAC group had better results than the torsion-detorsion group (p = 0.019, p = 0.049). Testes  showed no difference (p = 0.204). Sertoli cell number per tubule in the high dose NAC group was statistically different than the torsion-detorsion group (p = 0.017).When NAC was given intrascrotally at a dose of 100 mg/kg, it decreased the loss of testis volume and height, and Sertoli cell number per tubule was similar to the control group. These results suggest that the higher dose intrascrotal NAC administered during detorsion may have a protective effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, zebrafish were firstly exposed to ACT (0.18-0.36 ng/mL) from  hpf (hours post fertilization) to 30 dpf (days post fertilization), and a series of developmental toxicological endpoints and thyroid hormones were measured. Result showed that no developmental toxicity to zebrafish was found in 0.18 and 0.24 ng/mL groups except decreased  (30 dpf, 0.24 ng/mL). However, exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT led to reductions in heartbeat (48 hpf), hatching rate (72 hpf) and bodyweight (30 dpf). General tendencies of decreases in free T3 but increases in free T4 and reductions in ratio of free T3/T4 were also found, inferring that type II deiodinase (Dio2) was repressed. This inference was confirmed by Western analysis that Dio2 expression reduced by 42.7% after 0.36 ng/mL ACT treatment. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis implied that exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT altered the genome-wide gene expression profiles of zebrafish. Totally 5660 genes (involving 3154 down-regulated and 2596 up-regulated genes) were differentially expressed, and 13 deferentially expressed genes including down-regulated dio2 were significantly enriched in thyroid hormone signaling pathway. Subsequently, an in vitro thyroid receptor-reporter gene assay using GH3 cells was performed to further explore the potential disrupting mechanism. Result showed that luciferase activity slightly increased after exposure to ACT alone or ACT combined with low level T3, but was suppressed when combined with high level T3. It indicted there probably existed a competitive relationship in some extent between ACT and T3 in vivo. Overall, the present study provided preliminary evidences that long-term exposure to trace ACT repressed Dio2 expression, declined T3 and then activated thyroid receptor-mediated signaling, thereby leading to integrated thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish larvae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Routine pregnancy care based on maternal abdominal palpation fails to detect the majority of non-cephalic presentations.To report the incidence of non-cephalic presentation at a routine scan at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation and subsequent management of such pregnancies.This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in 45,847 singleton pregnancies that had undergone routine ultrasound examination at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation. Patients with breech or transverse / oblique presentation were divided into two groups, first those that would have elective cesarean section for fetal or maternal indications other than the abnormal presentation, and second, those that would potentially require ECV. The latter group was reassessed in 1- weeks and if there was persistence of the abnormal presentation the parents were offered the options of ECV versus elective cesarean section at 38-40 weeks' gestation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine which of the factors from maternal and pregnancy characteristics provided a significant contribution in the prediction of first, non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan, second, successful ECV from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation, and third, spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation.First, at 35 - 36 weeks the fetal presentation was cephalic in 43,416 (94.7%) pregnancies, breech in 1,987 (4.3%) and transverse or oblique in 444 (1.0%). Second, multivariable analysis demonstrated that the chance of non-cephalic presentation increased with increasing maternal age and , decreasing height, earlier gestational age at scan, and it was higher in the presence of placenta previa, oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios, in nulliparous than parous women and lower in women of South Asian and mixed racial origin than in White women. Third, 22% of cases of non-cephalic presentation were not eligible for ECV because of planned cesarean section for indications other than the malpresentation. Fourth, of those eligible for ECV only 48.5% (646/1,332) accepted the procedure and this was successful in 39.0% (252/646) of cases. Fifth, the chance of successful ECV increased with increasing maternal age and was lower in nulliparous than parous women. Sixth, in 33.9% (738/,179) of pregnancies with non-cephalic presentation where successful ECV was not carried out there was a subsequent spontaneous rotation to cephalic presentation. Seventh, the chance of spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation increased with increasing interval between the scan and delivery and decreased with increasing birth , it was higher in women of Black than White racial origin, if the presentation was transverse or oblique than breech and if there was polyhydramnios and lower in nulliparous than parous women and in the presence of placenta previa. Eighth, in 109 (0.3%) of cephalic presentations there was subsequent rotation to non-cephalic presentation and in 41% of these the diagnosis was made during labor. Ninth, in the total of ,431 cases of non-cephalic presentation at the time of the scan the presentation at birth was cephalic in 985 (40.5%); in 738 (74.9%) this was due to spontaneous rotation and in 247 (25.1%) due to successful ECV. Tenth, prediction of non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan and successful ECV from maternal and pregnancy factors was poor, but prediction of spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation was moderately good and this could be incorporated in the counselling of women prior to undertaking ECV.The problem of unexpected non-cephalic presentation in labor can to a great extent be overcome by a routine ultrasound examination at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation. The incidence of non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan was about 5%, but, in about 40% of these cases the presentation at birth was cephalic, mainly due to subsequent spontaneous rotation and to a lesser extent as a consequence of successful ECV.

The mean age of those children was 6.9±0.7 years, ranging from 6 to 8 years, and 217 (42.7%) were boys. AL was measured with an ocular biometry system. Refractive error was measured using an auto-refractor without cycloplegia.The mean changes of ALs were 0.27±0.28 mm, 0.52±0.40 mm and 0.89±0.51 mm over 1,  and 3 years, respectively. The mean changes of SEs were -0.27±0.80 D, -0.56±1.00 D and -0.95±1.41 D over 1,  and 3 years, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that mean change of AL was associated with mean change of SE at all points (all p0.001).

Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and  years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro--pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and -isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total energy and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth  compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), .13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or  years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study sought to utilize the MBASQIP® Data Registry to analyze the impact of age at time of surgery on outcomes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures.The MBSAQIP® Data Registry for patients undergoing SG or RYGB procedures between 2015 and 2016 was reviewed. Patients were divided into 4 age groups [18-44; 45-54; 55-64; > 65 years]. Minimal exclusions for revisional and/or emergency surgery were selected and combination variables created to classify complications as major or minor. A comorbidity index was constructed to include diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prior cardiac surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare age stratifications to the young adult (18-45 years) cohort.Of 301,605 cases, 279,419 cases (71.% SG) remained after applying exclusion criteria (79.% female, mean BMI 45.5 ± 8.1 kg/m, 8.9% insulin-dependent diabetics). Mean age was 44.7 ± 12.0 years (51.3% 18-44 years; 26.9% 45-54 years; 16.3% 55-64 years; 5.5% > 65 years). A univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative differences of lower BMI with increasing age concomitant with increasing frequency of RYGB and a higher comorbidity index (p < 0.0001 vs. 18-45 years). At age > 45 years, major complications and 30-day mortality increased independent of procedure type (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis controlling for comorbidity indices demonstrated increasing age (> 45 years) increased risk for major complications and mortality.Overall, bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) remains a low mortality risk procedure for all age groups. However, all age group classifications > 45 years had higher incidence of major complications and mortality compared to patients 18-45 years (despite older individuals having lower preoperative BMI) indicating delaying surgery is detrimental.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676651>Can the Healthy Primary School of the Future offer perspective in the ongoing obesity epidemic in young children?

However, data on the development of milk yield, IgG concentration, and their distribution per quarter within cows during the first milkings after calving are scarce. We analyzed milk production and IgG concentration at the individual quarter level in 29 multiparous Holstein cows during the first 5 milkings after calving. Cow- and calf-related factors (time interval between calving and first milking, parity number, previous lactation yield, gestation length, dry period length, sex, and birth  of the calf) potentially affecting first colostrum quality and quantity were assessed. Milking of first colostrum was carried out between 30 and 180 min after parturition. Further milkings were performed twice daily. Quarter milk yield varied between 0.1 and 5.5 kg at the first milking and between 1.4 and 5.1 kg at the fifth milking relative to parturition. Quarter IgG concentration ranged between 18.8 and 106.0 mg/mL at the first milking and between 0.8 and 46.1 mg/mL at the fifth milking. Distribution of milk yield and IgG concentration among quarters was not entirely repeatable during the first 5 successive milkings after parturition; that is, the ranking of quarters changed (intraclass correlation coefficients for quarter milk yield and IgG concentration: 0.64 and 0.79, respectively). The average hourly milk production increased in all quarters, ranging from 0.02 to 0.26 kg/h between the first  milkings up to 0.11 to 0.45 kg/h between the fourth and fifth milkings. First colostrum yield was not affected by any of the evaluated cow- and calf-related factors. Quarter colostrum IgG concentration was higher in cows with a higher previous lactation yield, whereas a lower colostrum IgG content was observed in cows with a longer gestation period and consequently heavier calves. In conclusion, milk yield and IgG concentration of individual quarters varied considerably, and their distribution among quarters within cows was moderately repeatable in consecutive milkings and changed partially over time. The decline of IgG concentration was independent of the concomitant increase in milk secretion, with changes occurring at different rates in individual quarters. Our results confirm the independence of the single mammary quarters at the onset of lactation despite an identical exposure to endocrine stimuli.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

We built a separate logistic regression model for each marker to model the composite outcome as function of the specific marker, planned delivery mode, and marker-by-planned-delivery-mode-interaction, and furthermore performed multivariable logistic regression with backward variable elimination separately in each trial arm. Markers considered were maternal age, parity, history of previous CD, use of antenatal corticosteroids, estimated fetal  (EFW) of twin A, EFW of twin B, >25% difference in EFW of the twins, presentation of twin B, chorionicity on ultrasound, method of conception, complications of pregnancy, ruptured membranes at randomization and GA at randomization. The main outcome measure was a composite adverse perinatal outcome (perinatal death or serious neonatal morbidity).None of the studied baseline markers was associated with differential benefit from planned CD. GA at delivery was differentially associated with the outcome in the treatment arms (p for interaction 0.001). GA at delivery was differentially associated with the outcome in the treatment arms (p for interaction 0.001). For GA 32+0- 36+6 weeks, VD was associated with fewer adverse outcomes compared to CD (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.37-1.03). At ≥ 37+0 weeks, 10 (1%) newborns suffered the composite perinatal outcome after planned CD versus 23 (%) after planned VD (OR .25; 95% CI 1.06-4.77).Neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies with the first twin in cephalic position may differ depending on GA and planned mode of delivery. From 32-37 weeks a planned VD seems favorable, while from around 37 weeks on, a CD might be safer. The absolute risks at term are low and must be weighed against the increased maternal risks associated with planned CD.

The development of a clinically relevant definition of  regain requires a better understanding of its clinical significance.To assess rates of  regain 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), applying six definitions and investigating their association with clinical outcomes.Patients were followed up until 5 years after surgery and  regain was calculated. Regression techniques were used to assess the association of  regain with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the presence of comorbidities.A total of 868 patients participated in the study, with a mean age of 46.6 (± 10.4) years, of which 79% were female. The average preoperative BMI was 44.8 (± 5.9) kg/m and the total maximum  loss was 32% (± 8%). Eighty-seven percent experienced any regain. Significant  regain rates ranged from 16 to 37% depending on the definition. Three  regain definitions were associated with deterioration in physical HRQoL (p < 0.05), while associations between definitions of  regain and the presence of comorbidities 5 years after surgery were not significant.These results indicate that identifying one single categorical definition of clinically significant  regain is difficult. Additional research into the clinical significance of  regain is needed to inform the development of a standardized definition that includes all dimensions of surgery success: , HRQoL, and comorbidity remission.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type  diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type  diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type  diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for  loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially -loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type  diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Ultrasound estimates of fetal  (EFW ) is the ultimate tool for this identification. It can be conducted as a "universal screening", ie all pregnant women at a specific gestational age. However, in Denmark it is conducted as "selective screening", ie only on clinical indication. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Danish national SGA screening program and the consequences of false positive and false negative SGA cases.In this retrospective cohort study, we included 2928 women with singleton pregnancies with due date in 2015. We defined "risk of SGA" by an EFW ≤ -15% of expected for the gestational age and "SGA" as birthweight ≤ -22% of expected for gestational age.At birth, the prevalence of SGA was 3.3%. The overall sensitivity of the Danish screening program was 62% at a false-positive rate of 5.6%. Within the entire cohort, 63% had an EFW as compared to 79% of the SGA-cases. The sensitivity was 79% for those born before 37 weeks' gestation but only 40% for those born after 40 weeks' gestation. The sensitivity was also associated to birthweight deviation; 73% among extreme SGA cases (birthweight deviation ≤ -33%) and 55% among mild SGA (birthweight deviation between -22% and 27%). False diagnosis of SGA was associated with an increased rate of induction of labor (OR = .51, 95% CI; 1.70 to 3.71) and cesarean section (OR = 1.44, 95% CI; 0.96 to .18).The performance of the Danish national screening program for SGA based on selective EFW on clinical indication have improved considerably over the last 20 years. Limitations of the program are the large proportion of women referred to ultrasound scan and the low performance post-term.© 2019 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677412>Non-proteinogenic amino acid based supramolecular hydrogel material for enhanced cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>Supramolecular gel material built from low-molecular- (LMW) gelators finds potential applications in various fields, especially in drug delivery, cell encapsulation and delivery, and tissue engineering. The majority of the LMW gelators in these applications are based on functionalized peptides/amino acids consisting of proteinogenic amino acids which are proteolytically unstable. Herein, we have developed a new LMW gelator containing non-proteinogenic amino acid namely ,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dap), a key precursor in the synthesis of many antibiotics namely viomycin and capreomycin, by functionalizing with fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl at both amino terminals of Dap [Fm-Dap(Fm)]. Hydrogelation test at different pH indicates that Fm-Dap(Fm) can form a hydrogel in a wide range of pH (4.9 to 9.1) with minimum hydrogelation concentration depends on the pH. The mechanical strength and thermal stability of the Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogel material are found to decrease with increasing pH (acidic > neural/physiological > basic). The thermal stability of Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogels is pH-dependent and elicits high stability at acidic pH. Also, Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogels exhibit strong thixotropic property where regelation (self-healing) occurs upon release of stress. Morphological analysis indicates the formation of fibrils, which are entangled to form three dimensional network structures. Several spectroscopic measurements provided evidence for the self-assembly of Fm-Dap(Fm) molecules through intermolecular aromatic π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions during hydrogelation. Interestingly, Fm-Dap(Fm) not only exhibits hydrogel formation but also shows cell viability and enhanced cell proliferation at physiological pH (7.4). Further, Fm-Dap(Fm) forms a hydrogel upon co-incubation with vitamin B and also exhibits release of vitamin B over a period. The current study thus demonstrates the development of a new hydrogel material, based on LMW gelator containing the non-proteinogenic amino acid, which can elicit cell viability, enhanced cell proliferation, drug encapsulation, and drug release properties. Hence, Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogel could be an ideal material for biomedical applications, especially in tissue engineering and drug delivery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Symptoms of LS include proximal tubule (PT) dysfunction typically characterized by low molecular  proteinuria, renal tubular acidosis (RTA), aminoaciduria, and hypercalciuria. How mutant  causes these symptoms isn't clear.We examined the effect of deleting OCRL on endocytic traffic and cell division in newly created human PT CRISPR/Cas9  knockout cells, multiple PT cell lines treated with -targeting siRNA, and in -mutant zebrafish.OCRL-depleted human cells proliferated more slowly and about 10% of them were multinucleated compared with fewer than % of matched control cells. Heterologous expression of wild-type, but not phosphatase-deficient, OCRL prevented the accumulation of multinucleated cells after acute knockdown of OCRL but could not rescue the phenotype in stably edited knockout cell lines. Mathematic modeling confirmed that reduced PT length can account for the urinary excretion profile in LS. Both  mutant zebrafish and zebrafish injected with  morpholino showed truncated expression of megalin along the pronephric kidney, consistent with a shortened S1 segment.Our data suggest a unifying model to explain how loss of OCRL results in tubular proteinuria as well as the other commonly observed renal manifestations of LS. We hypothesize that defective cell division during kidney development and/or repair compromises PT length and impairs kidney function in LS patients.Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676254>Impact of postoperative  gain on complications after liver surgery.</a></h2><p>Recent data has suggested that excessive perioperative  gain may be associated with adverse outcomes after abdominal surgery, but this observation remains unexplored following liver surgery. The present study aimed to investigate the predictive value of perioperative  fluctuation in predicting complications after liver surgery.Retrospective monocentric analysis of consecutive patients undergoing liver surgery between 2010 and 2016. Patients without available perioperative  were excluded. Test variable was postoperative  change (Δ) measured on day  (POD2). Primary outcome was postoperative major morbidity according to Clavien classification (grades III-IV). Secondary outcomes were overall complications, Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) and length of hospital stay (LoS). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and logistic regression with multivariable analysis were performed.A total of 181 patients met the inclusion criteria. Major and overall postoperative complications were reported in 25 (14%) and 87 (48%) patients, respectively. On POD2, median Δ was .6 Kg (IQR: 1.1-4.0). Patients with major complications showed increased Δ of 4. Kg (IQR: .7-5.7), compared to .3 Kg (IQR: 0.9-3.7) in patients without major complications (p < 0.001). AUROC of Δ for major complications was 0.74, determining an optimal cut-off of 3.5 Kg, which yielded a negative predictive value of 94%. Multivariable analysis identified Δ ≥3.5 Kg as independent predictor of major complications (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.51-14.80; p = 0.008).Δ ≥3.5 Kg was independently associated with major complications after liver surgery. Perioperative fluctuation of  appears as an important predictor of adverse outcomes after liver surgery.Copyright © 2019 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.
