Herein we explore the association between choline metabolites and inflammation in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.Thirty-eight patients with PsA, all of whom satisfied the CASPAR classification criteria for PsA, were studied. Outcomes reflecting the activity of peripheral arthritis as well as skin , Disease Activity Score (DAS)28, Clinical Disease Index (CDAI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) were assessed. Serum concentration of choline metabolites (choline, TMA, TMAO, betaine and carnitine) were determined by LC-MS, and metabolite levels associated with disease scores.Among the 38 PsA patients included, the mean DAS28PCR was 2.74±1.29. Twenty-seven patients had active skin disease, with an average BSA of 7.2±16.22. TMAO, but not TMA or choline, significantly correlated with measures of disease activity for both skin and peripheral joints.In our cohort, only TMAO, but not TMA, choline, betaine or carnitine, was associated with inflammation in PsA patients, establishing a mechanistic link between TMAO and PsA phenotypes. Future studies will explore the modulation of TMAO and disease severity in PsA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733990>Dimethyl fumarate modulates neutrophil extracellular trap formation in a glutathione- and superoxide-dependent manner.</a></h1><p>Neutrophil (polymorphonuclear) granulocytes (PMN) have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of  by releasing interleukin-17 and LL37-DNA complexes via neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), webs of chromatin strands decorated with antimicrobial peptides, in psoriatic skin. Fumaderm , a fumaric acid ester (FAE) formulation consisting of different FAE salts, has been successfully used to treat  for decades. Most recently, FAE treatment was reported to inhibit NET formation in murine epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.To elucidate the effect of FAE treatment on human  and healthy donor NET formation.Among the compounds present in the FAE formulation, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) pretreatment of human  and healthy donor PMN resulted in a consistent inhibitory effect on NET formation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not to platelet activating factor and ionomycin. This effect was l-glutathione (GSH) dependent and involved a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, a key event in NET formation. In contrast, G-protein-coupled signalling and protein synthesis were not involved. Monomethyl fumarate (MMF) was found to slightly reduce ROS production without affecting NET formation.We report DMF as a potent, stimulus-specific, GSH- and ROS-dependent modulator of NET formation. Our results support the notion that modulation of NET formation contributes to the beneficial effects of FAEs in a variety of inflammatory conditions.© 2017 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564527>Exploration of candidate biomarkers for human  based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry serum metabolomics.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have shown that dysregulated metabolic pathways are linked to  pathogenesis. However, an extensive, unbiased metabolic analysis in patients with  has not been completely explored. The metabolome represents the end products of proteomics or cellular processes that may be closely associated with the pathogenesis of .To determine the differences in serum metabolomic profiles among patients with  and healthy controls with the goal of identifying potential biomarkers in patients with .Serum metabolomic profiles from 29 subjects (14 patients with  and 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls). The serum metabolites were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based on a combined full scan and selected-ion monitoring mode.Multivariate statistical analysis of metabolomics data revealed altered serum metabolites between the patients with  and healthy individuals. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with  had higher levels of amino acids including asparagine, aspartic acid, isoleucine, phenylalanine, ornithine and proline; higher levels of lactic acid and urea; and lower levels of crotonic acid, azelaic acid,  and cholesterol.It appears that the glycolysis pathway and amino acid metabolic activity are increased in patients with . These metabolic perturbations may stem from increased demand for protein biosynthesis and keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Our findings may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of  and provide insights into early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.© 2016 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26438362>The role of group IIF-secreted phospholipase A2 in epidermal homeostasis and hyperplasia.</a></h1><p>Epidermal lipids are important for skin homeostasis. However, the entire picture of the roles of lipids, particularly nonceramide lipid species, in epidermal biology still remains obscure. Here, we report that PLA2G2F, a functionally orphan-secreted phospholipase A2 expressed in the suprabasal epidermis, regulates skin homeostasis and hyperplasic disorders. Pla2g2f(-/-) mice had a fragile stratum corneum and were strikingly protected from , contact dermatitis, and skin cancer. Conversely, Pla2g2f-overexpressing transgenic mice displayed -like epidermal hyperplasia. Primary keratinocytes from Pla2g2f(-) (/-) mice showed defective differentiation and activation. PLA2G2F was induced by calcium or IL-22 in keratinocytes and preferentially hydrolyzed  plasmalogen-bearing docosahexaenoic acid secreted from keratinocytes to give rise to unique bioactive lipids (i.e., protectin D1 and 9S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid) that were distinct from canonical arachidonate metabolites (prostaglandins and leukotrienes).  lysoplasmalogen, a PLA2G2F-derived marker product, rescued defective activation of Pla2g2f(-/-) keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlight PLA2G2F as a previously unrecognized regulator of skin pathophysiology and point to this enzyme as a novel drug target for epidermal-hyperplasic diseases.© 2015 Yamamoto et al.</p></html>
