The thermal degradation kinetics of mangiferin at pH3, 4, , 6 and 7 were each modeled at five temperatures ranging between 60 and 140°C. First-order reaction models were fitted to the data using non-linear regression to determine the reaction rate constant at each pH-temperature combination. The reaction rate constant increased with increasing temperature and pH. Comparison of the reaction rate constants at 100°C revealed an exponential relationship between the reaction rate constant and pH. The data for each pH were also modeled with the Arrhenius equation using non-linear and linear regression to determine the activation  and pre-exponential factor. Activation energies decreased slightly with increasing pH. Finally, a multi-linear model taking into account both temperature and pH was developed for mangiferin degradation. Sterilization (121°C for 4min) of honeybush extracts dissolved at pH4,  and 7 did not cause noticeable degradation of mangiferin, although the multi-linear model predicted 34% degradation at pH7. The extract matrix is postulated to exert a protective effect as changes in potential precursor content could not fully explain the stability of mangiferin.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, to date, only phosphorescent materials have been implemented to  triplet excitons in QD-LEDs. In this work, we introduced a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter, 4,-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phthalonitrile (2CzPN), doped into poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) as an exciton harvester in red QD-LEDs by solution processing. As a result, electrons leaking to the PVK layer will be trapped by 2CzPN to form long-lifetime TADF excitons in the 2CzPN:PVK layer, and then this harvested exciton  can be effectively transferred to the adjacent QDs by the Förster resonance -transfer process. The fabricated red CdSe/CdS core/shell QD-LEDs show a maximum luminescence efficiency of 17.33 cd/A and longer lifetime. Our results demonstrate that the TADF sensitizer would be a promising candidate to develop highly efficient QD-LEDs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450636>A High-Voltage -Harvesting Interface for Irregular Kinetic  Harvesting in IoT Systems with 1365% Improvement Using All-NMOS Power Switches and Ultra-low Quiescent Current Controller.</a></h1><p>An -harvesting interface for kinetic  harvesting from high-voltage piezoelectric and triboelectric generators is proposed in this paper. Unlike the conventional kinetic -harvesting interfaces optimized for continuous sinusoidal input, the proposed harvesting interface can efficiently handle irregular and random high voltage  inputs. An N-type mosfet (NMOS)-only power stage design is introduced to simplify power switch drivers and minimize conduction loss. Controller active mode power is also reduced by introducing a new voltage peak detector. For efficient operation with potentially long intervals between random kinetic  inputs, standby power consumption is minimized by monitoring the input with a 43 pW wake-up controller and power-gating all other circuits during the standby intervals. The proposed harvesting interface can   from a wide range of  inputs, 10 s of nJ to 10 s of µJ /pulse, with an input voltage range of -200 V and an output range of 2.4-4 V under discontinuous as well as continuous excitation. The proposed interface is examined in two scenarios, with integrated power stage devices (maximum input 45 V) and with discrete power stage devices (maximum input 200 V), and the harvesting efficiency is improved by up to 600% and 1350%, respectively, compared to the case when harvesting is performed with a full bridge rectifier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28103663>Biological Photothermal Nanodots Based on Self-Assembly of Peptide-Porphyrin Conjugates for Antitumor Therapy.</a></h1><p>Photothermal agents can  light  and convert it into heat, offering a targeted and remote-controlled way to destroy carcinomatous cells and tissues. Inspired by the biological organization of polypeptides and porphyrins in living systems, here we have developed a supramolecular strategy to fabricate photothermal nanodots through peptide-modulated self-assembly of photoactive porphyrins. The self-assembling nature of porphyrins induces the formation of J-aggregates as substructures of the nanodots, and thus enables the fabrication of nanodots with totally inhibited fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen production, leading to a high light-to-heat conversion efficiency of the nanodots. The peptide moieties not only provide aqueous stability for the nanodots through hydrophilic interactions, but also provide a spatial barrier between porphyrin groups to inhibit the further growth of nanodots through the strong π-stacking interactions. Thermographic imaging reveals that the conversion of light to heat based on the nanodots is efficient in vitro and in vivo, enabling the nanodots to be applied for photothermal acoustic imaging and antitumor therapy. Antitumor therapy results show that these nanodots are highly biocompatible photothermal agents for tumor ablation, demonstrating the feasibility of using bioinspired nanostructures of self-assembling biomaterials for biomedical photoactive applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984885>Comparative field performances between conventional combine and mid-size combine in wetland rice cultivation.</a></h1><p>In paddy cultivation, harvesting is the most important operation, which needs suitable machinery. Thus, this study was carried out to compare field performances and  and environmental effect between the conventional  m cutting width NEW HOLLAND CLAYSON 8080, 82 kW@2500 rpm combine harvester running on a total net area of 42.78 ha of plots for two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation seasons and the new mid-size 2.7 m cutting width WORLD STAR WS7.0, 76 kW@2600 rpm combine harvester running on a total net area of 16.95 ha of plots for two rice cultivation seasons. The conventional combine as compared to mid-size combine showed 14.4% greater mean fuel consumptions (21.13 versus 18.46 l/ha), 31.1% greater mean effective field capacity (0.69 versus 0.53 ha/h), .23% greater cornering time (turning time) percentage of total time (8.28% versus 3.05%) and 1.41% greater reversing time percentage of total time (7.2% versus .79%) but 20.90% lesser mean operational speed (3.24 versus 4.10 km/h), 11.69% lesser effective time percentage of total time (60.0%versus 71.69%h/ha), 10.8% lesser mean field efficiency (64.3% versus 72.1%). In terms of total  use the conventional combine showed 24.64% greater mean total  use in the harvesting operation (1445.81 versus 1160.00 MJ/ha), 14.46% greater mean fuel  (1010.014 versus 882.39 MJ/ha), 56.47% greater mean machinery  (431.32 versus 275.65 MJ/ha) and 59.25% greater mean human  (3.48 and 2.18 MJ/ha), this cause 26.12% greater mean total Green House Gas emission (GHG) than the mid-size combine. The results revealed that the mid-size combine is more suitable in conducting the  operation in rice field in Malaysia than the conventional combine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28180999>Biotic conversion of sulphate to sulphide and abiotic conversion of sulphide to sulphur in a microbial fuel cell using cobalt oxide octahedrons as cathode catalyst.</a></h1><p>Varying chemical oxygen demand (COD) and sulphate concentrations in substrate were used to determine reaction kinetics and mass balance of organic matter and sulphate transformation in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). MFC with anodic chamber volume of 1 L, fed with wastewater having COD of 500 mg/L and sulphate of 200 mg/L, could  power of 54.4 mW/m, at a Coulombic efficiency of 14%, with respective COD and sulphate removals of 90 and 95%. Sulphide concentration, even up to 1500 mg/L, did not inhibit anodic biochemical reactions, due to instantaneous abiotic oxidation to sulphur, at high inlet sulphate. Experiments on abiotic oxidation of sulphide to sulphur revealed maximum oxidation taking place at an anodic potential of -200 mV. More than 99% sulphate removal could be achieved in a MFC with inlet COD/sulphate of 0.75, giving around 1.33 kg/m day COD removal.

However, ZnO only absorbs the UV light, which accounts for less than % of total solar irradiation, significantly limiting its applications. In this article, we report a facile and efficient approach to overcome the poor wettability between ZnO and Au by carefully modulating the surface charge density on Au nanoparticles (NPs), enabling rapid synthesis of Au@ZnO core-shell NPs at room temperature. The resulting Au@ZnO core-shell NPs exhibit a significantly enhanced plasmonic absorption in the visible range due to the Au NP cores. They also show a significantly improved photocatalytic performance in comparison with their single-component counterparts, i.e., the Au NPs and ZnO NPs. Moreover, the high catalytic activity of the as-synthesized Au@ZnO core-shell NPs can be maintained even after many cycles of photocatalytic reaction. Our results shed light on the fact that the Au@ZnO core-shell NPs represent a promising class of candidates for applications in plasmonics, surface-enhanced spectroscopy, light  devices, solar  conversion, and degradation of organic pollutants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617034>Biomass traits and candidate genes for bioenergy revealed through association genetics in coppiced European Populus nigra (L.).</a></h1><p>Second generation (2G) bioenergy from lignocellulosic feedstocks has the potential to develop as a sustainable source of renewable ; however, significant hurdles still remain for large-scale commercialisation. Populus is considered as a promising 2G feedstock and understanding the genetic basis of biomass yield and feedstock quality are a research priority in this model tree species.We report the first coppiced biomass study for 714 members of a wide population of European black poplar (Populus nigra L.), a native European tree, selected from 20 river populations ranging in latitude and longitude between 40. and 52.1°N and 1.0 and 16.4°E, respectively. When grown at a single site in southern UK, significant Site of Origin (SO) effects were seen for 14 of the 15 directly measured or derived traits including biomass yield, leaf area and stomatal index. There was significant correlation (p < 0.001) between biomass yield traits over 3 years of  which identified leaf size and cell production as strong predictors of biomass yield. A 12 K Illumina genotyping array (constructed from 10,331 SNPs in 14 QTL regions and 4648 genes) highlighted significant population genetic structure with pairwise FST showing strong differentiation (p < 0.001) between the Spanish and Italian subpopulations. Robust associations reaching genome-wide significance are reported for main stem height and cell number per leaf; two traits tightly linked to biomass yield. These genotyping and phenotypic data were also used to show the presence of significant isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by adaption (IBA) within this population.The three associations identified reaching genome-wide significance at p < 0.05 include a transcription factor; a putative stress response gene and a gene of unknown function. None of them have been previously linked to bioenergy yield; were shown to be differentially expressed in a panel of three selected genotypes from the collection and represent exciting, novel candidates for further study in a bioenergy tree native to Europe and Euro-Asia. A further 26 markers (22 genes) were found to reach putative significance and are also of interest for biomass yield, leaf area, epidermal cell expansion and stomatal patterning.

Power sources with these characteristics are difficult and challenging to achieve. The use of liquid metals as electrodes may provide a viable strategy to produce such power sources. In this work, we propose a liquid-metal-based triboelectric nanogenerator (LM-TENG) by employing Galinstan as the electrode and silicone rubber as the triboelectric and encapsulation layer. The small Young's modulus of the liquid metal ensures the electrode remains continuously conductive under deformations, stretching to a strain as large as ∼300%. The surface oxide layer of Galinstan effectively prevents the liquid Galinstan electrode from further oxidization and permeation into silicone rubber, yielding outstanding device stability. Operating in the single-electrode mode at 3 Hz, the LM-TENG with an area of 6 × 3 cm produces an open-circuit voltage of 354. V, transferred short-circuit charge of 123.2 nC, short-circuit current of 15.6 μA, and average power density of 8.43 mW/m, which represent outstanding performance values for TENGs. Further, the LM-TENG maintains stable performance under various deformations, such as stretching, folding, and twisting. LM-TENGs in different forms, such as bulk-shaped, bracelet-like, and textile-like, are all able to  mechanical  from human walking, arm shaking, or hand patting to sustainably drive wearable electronic devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30424328>Development of a Thermoelectric and Electromagnetic Hybrid  Harvester from Water Flow in an Irrigation System.</a></h1><p>A hybrid  harvester is presented in this paper to   from water flow motion and temperature difference in an irrigating pipe at the same time. The harvester is based on the integration of thermoelectric and electromagnetic mechanisms. To  the water flow motion, a turbine fan with magnets that are attached on the blades is placed inside of the water pipe. Multiple coils turn the water flow  into electricity with the rotation of the turbine. The thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are attached around the pipe, so as to   due to temperature difference. For a maximum temperature difference of 55 °C (hot side 80 °C and room temperature 25 °C), twelve serial-connected TEGs can generate voltage up to 0.346 V.

For a maximum water flow rate of 49.9 L/min, the electromagnetic generator (EMG) can produce an open circuit voltage of 0.911 V. The EMG can be potentially used as a water flow meter due to the linear relationship between water flow rate and output voltage. Under the joint action of TEG and EMG, the maximum terminal voltage for TEG is 66 mV and for EMG is 241 mV at load resistances of 10 and 100 Ώ, respectively, resulting in a corresponding power output of 0.435 and 0.584 mW.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28464234>Periodic harvesting of microalgae from calcium alginate hydrogels for sustained high-density production.</a></h1><p>High-density biomass production is currently only realized in biofilm-based photobioreactors.  yields of whole biofilms are self-limited by daughter-upon-parent cell growth that hinders light and leads to respiratory biomass losses. In this work, we demonstrate a sustainable multi- approach for prolonged generation of high-density biomass. Calcium-alginate hydrogel cultures loaded with Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 achieved production densities comparable to that of biofilms (10  cells/mL) and optimal total productivity in  periods of 2 or 3 days that allowed high-density surface growth without self-limiting cell buildup or surface death. Cross-linking calcium concentration had a strong influence on surface growth and  yields, especially in the first harvests. Subsequent harvests achieved more uniform biomass yields and distributions, unaffected by bulk respiration or light penetration. Collectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of sustained, high-density biomass production by periodic harvesting within microalgal hydrogel cultures. Biotechnol.

The Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership was established with the goal of investigating open pond algae cultivation across different geographic, climatic, seasonal, and operational conditions while setting the benchmark for quality data collection, analysis, and dissemination. Identical algae cultivation systems and data analysis methodologies were established at testbed sites across the continental United States and Hawaii.

Loading cocatalysts for the modification of semiconductors could increase the separation efficiency of the photogenerated hole-electron pairs, enhance the light absorption ability of semiconductors, and thus obtain new composite photocatalysts with high activities.

Evidence from Swedish lakes.</a></h1><p>A number of studies have evaluated the effects of forest  on mercury (Hg) concentrations and exports in surface waters, but few studies have tested the effect from forest  on the change in fish Hg concentrations over the course of several years after . To address this question, mercury (Hg) concentrations in perch (Perca fluviatilis) muscle tissue from five lakes were analyzed for two years before (2010-2011) and three years after (2013-2015) forest  conducted in 2012. Fish Hg concentrations in the clear-cut catchments (n=1373 fish specimens) were related to temporal changes of fish Hg in reference lakes (n=1099 fish specimen) from 19 lakes in the Swedish National Environmental Monitoring Programme. Small (length<100mm) and large perch (length≥100mm) were analyzed separately, due to changing feeding habitats of fish over growing size. There was considerable year-to-year and lake-to-lake variation in fish Hg concentrations (-14%-121%) after forest  in the clearcut lakes, according to our first statistical model that count for fish Hg changes. While the effect ascribed to forest  varied between years, after three years (in 2015), a significant increase of 26% (p<0.0001) in Hg concentrations of large fish was identified in our second statistical model that pooled all  clearcut lakes. The large fish Hg concentrations in the 19 reference lakes also varied, and in 2015 had decreased by 7% (p=0.03) relative to the concentrations in 2010-2011. The majority of the annual changes in fish Hg concentrations in the clearcut lakes after  were in the lower range of earlier predictions for high-latitude lakes extrapolated primarily from the effects of forest  operations on Hg concentrations in water. Since the risk of forest  impacts on Hg extends to fish and not just surface water concentrations, there is even more reason to consider Hg effects in forestry planning, alongside other ecosystem effects.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The need to reduce emissions from this sector has stimulated efforts to speed up the application of electric vehicles (EVs). A subset of EVs, called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), backup batteries with combustion engine, which makes PHEVs have a comparable driving range to conventional vehicles. However, this hybridization comes at a cost of higher emissions than all-electric vehicles. This paper studies the routing problem for PHEVs to minimize emissions. The existing shortest-path based algorithms cannot be applied to solving this problem, because of the several new challenges: (1) an optimal route may contain circles caused by detour for recharging; (2) emissions of PHEVs not only depend on the driving distance, but also depend on the terrain and the state of charge (SOC) of batteries; (3) batteries can   by regenerative braking, which makes some road segments have negative  consumption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a green navigation algorithm (GNA) which finds the optimal strategies: where to go and where to recharge. GNA discretizes the SOC, then makes the PHEV routing problem to satisfy the principle of optimality. Finally, GNA adopts dynamic programming to solve the problem. We evaluate GNA using synthetic maps generated by the delaunay triangulation. The results show that GNA can save more than 10 %  and reduce 10 % emissions when compared to the shortest path algorithm. We also observe that PHEVs with the battery capacity of 10-15 KWh detour most and nearly no detour when larger than 30 KWh.

Harvesting vibration  is a promising route to sustainably drive small electronics. This work introduces an approach to scavenge vibrational  over a wide frequency range as an exclusive power source for continuous operation of electronics. An elastic multiunit triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is rationally designed to efficiently  low-frequency vibration , which can provide a maximum instantaneous output power density of 102 W·m at as low as 7 Hz and maintain its stable current outputs from  to 25 Hz. A self-charging power unit (SCPU) combining the TENG and a 10 mF supercapacitor gives a continuous direct current (DC) power delivery of 1.14 mW at a power management efficiency of 45.6% at 20 Hz. The performance of the SCPU can be further enhanced by a specially designed power management circuit, with a continuous DC power of 2 mW and power management efficiency of 60% at 7 Hz. Electronics such as a thermometer, hygrometer, and speedometer can be sustainably powered solely by the harvested vibration  from a machine or riding bicycle.

All the silages were stored at 25 ºC. Parameters such as pH, microorganism and volatile fatty acid contents, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, net gas, metabolizable , organic matter digestibility, dry matter intake and relative feed value were measured to determine fermentation quality, chemical compositions and relative feed value of alfalfa silages.Significant differences were found among the control and treated groups in terms of pH and microorganism contents at all opening times and crude protein, net gas, metabolizable  and organic matter digestibility of final silage. The pH values ranged from 4.70 to .52 for all treatments and control silage had the highest value of overall treatments at T75d silages. Volatile fatty acid of silages was not influenced significantly by inoculations. However, lactic acid content of L. bifermentans (LS-65-2-1) was higher than the other treatments. The highest metabolizable  and organic matter digestibility were recorded from L. citerum (L-70-6-1) inoculation. In addition, no significant differences were found among treatments in terms of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, dry matter intake and relative feed value.Among the treated lactic acid bacteria isolates, Lactobacillus bifermentans came into prominence especially in terms of organic acid composition and quality characters of silages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252481>High-Efficiency Red and Near-Infrared Organic Light-Emitting Diodes Enabled by Pure Organic Fluorescent Emitters and an Exciplex-Forming Cohost.</a></h1><p>Three D-A-D-configured molecules DTPBT, DTPNT, and DTPNBT with high quantum yield of orange red (628 nm), red (659 nm), and deep-red/NIR (710 nm) fluorescence, respectively, were developed as emitting dopants in an exciplex-forming cohost (TCTA:3P-T2T) for high-efficiency fluorescence-based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The obtained physical properties together with theoretical calculations analyzed from these new molecules establish a clear structure-property relationship, in which the feature of central acceptor 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), naphtho[1,2-c:,6-c']bis[1,2,]thiadiazole (NT), and 2,1,3-naphthothiadiazole (NBT) plays the crucial role for governing the physical characteristics. The optimized device configured as ITO/HAT-CN/TAPC/TCTA/TCTA:3P-T2T:% emitter/3P-T2T/LiF/Al gave a record-high efficiency of orange red (591 nm, 15%), red (647 nm, 10%), and deep-red/NIR (689 nm, 9%) electroluminescent devices. The effective  of triplet excitons with an exciplex-forming system in conjunction with efficient  transfer between the exciplex and the dopant is beneficial for such high device efficiencies. More importantly, the stable exciplex-forming cohost and fast radiative decay rate of DTPNT render this particular device exhibiting high device stability as indicated by the low efficiency roll-off under high current densities (EQE (external quantum efficiency) values of 8.1% at 1000 cd m and 6.8% at 10,000 cd m). These results reveal the potential of employing an exciplex-forming system as cohost for fluorescent dopants to furnish high-efficiency OLEDs with an emission wavelength extending to the red or even the NIR range.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840230>From gut microbiota dysfunction to obesity: could short-chain fatty acids stop this dangerous course?</a></h1><p>Study of the interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-gut axis represents a very appealing approach to increasing our knowledge about the mechanisms leading to obesity and obesity-related diseases. The aim of this review is to focus on the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main products of gut microbial fermentation from non-digestible carbohydrates in the colon, on the gut-brain axis. Evidence is accumulating regarding the role of SCFAs in the fine-tuning of the gut-brain axis, a feedback system which is vital not only for the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal and metabolic functions, but also for the regulation of food intake and  expenditure. SCFAs are thought to play a key role in increasing the host capacity to  excess  from the diet. SCFAs, however, can exert their effects on the host metabolism via multiple complementary pathways. Metabolic, inflammatory, and neural pathways can be regulated by SCFAs, which can act by sensing nutritional status, thereby maintaining body  homeostasis. SCFA production from prebiotic consumption is the rationale for targeting intestinal mechanisms to increase  expenditure and thereby reduce obesity risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29492105>Direct and highly productive conversion of cyanobacteria  to ethanol with CaCl addition.</a></h1><p>The cyanobacterium  shows promise as a carbohydrate feedstock for biofuel production. The glycogen accumulated in  can be extracted by lysozyme-degrading the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell walls. The extracted glycogen can be converted to ethanol through hydrolysis by amylolytic enzymes and fermentation by the yeast . Thus, in the presence of lysozyme, a recombinant yeast expressing α-amylase and glucoamylase can convert  directly to ethanol, which would simplify the procedure for ethanol production. However, the ethanol titer and productivity in this process are lower than in ethanol production from cyanobacteria and green algae in previous reports.To increase the ethanol titer, a high concentration of  biomass was employed as the carbon source for the ethanol production using a recombinant amylase-expressing yeast. The addition of lysozyme to the fermentation medium increased the ethanol titer, but not the ethanol productivity. The addition of CaCl increased both the ethanol titer and productivity by causing the delamination of polysaccharide layer on the cell surface of . In the presence of lysozyme and CaCl, ethanol titer, yield, and productivity improved to 48 g L, 93% of theoretical yield, and 1.0 g L h from , corresponding to 90 g L of glycogen.We developed an ethanol conversion process using a recombinant amylase-expressing yeast from  with a high titer, yield, and productivity by adding both lysozyme and CaCl.

In this work, a prolific approach to design a wind/solar-powered rechargeable high- density pouch-type hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is proposed. The pouch-type HSC is fabricated by engineering nature-inspired nanosliver (nano-Ag) decorated Ni Co S forest-like nanostructures on Ni foam (nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam) as a battery-type electrode and porous activated carbon as a capacitive-type electrode. Initially, the core-shell-like NCS FNs/Ni foam is prepared via a single-step wet-chemical method, followed by a light-induced growth of nano-Ag onto it for enhancing the conductivity of the composite. Utilizing the synergistic effects of forest-like nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam as a composite electrode, the fabricated device shows a maximum capacitance of 1104.14 mF cm at a current density of  mA cm and it stores superior  and power densities of 0.36 mWh cm and 27.22 mW cm , respectively along with good cycling stability, which are higher than most of previous reports. The high- storage capability of HSCs is further connected to wind fans and solar cells to  renewable . The wind/solar charged HSCs can effectively operate various electronic devices for a long time, enlightening its potency for the development of sustainable  systems.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The great challenge is to optimize trade-offs between carbon  and water use by choosing cultivars that combine low water use with high productivity.Regional scenarios were simulated over a range of willow genotype × environment interactions for the major UK soil × climate variations with the process-based model LUCASS. Soil available water capacity (SAWC) ranged from 51 to 251 mm and weather represented the north-west (wet, cool), north-east (dry, cool), south-west (wet, warm) and south-east (dry, warm) of the UK. Scenario simulations were evaluated for small/open narrow-leaf (NL) versus large/closed broad-leaf (BL) willow canopy phenotypes using baseline (1965-89) and warmer recent (1990-2014) weather data.The low productivity under baseline climate in the north could be compensated by choosing BL cultivars (e.g. 'Endurance'). Recent warmer climate increased average productivity by 0.-2. t ha-1, especially in the north. The modern NL cultivar 'Resolution' had the smallest and most efficient water use. On marginal soils (SAWC <100 mm), yields remained below an economic threshold of 9 t ha-1 more frequently under baseline than recent climate. In the drought-prone south-east, 'Endurance' yielded less than 'Resolution', which consumed on average 17 mm year-1 less water. Assuming a planting area of 10 000 ha, in droughty years between 1.3 and 4. × 106 m3 of water could be saved, with a small yield penalty, for 'Resolution'.With an increase in air temperature and occasional water scarcities expected with climate change, high-yielding NL cultivars should be the preferred choice for sustainable use of marginal lands and reduced competition with agricultural food crops.© The Author(s) 2019.

Gut microbiota play a role in   and inflammation and can influence the change from lean to obese phenotypes. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a brain target for gastrointestinal signals modulating satiety and alterations in gut-brain vagal pathway may promote overeating and obesity. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that high-fat diet‑induced changes in gut microbiota alter vagal gut-brain communication associated with increased body fat accumulation. Sprague-Dawley rats consumed a low ‑dense rodent diet (LFD; 3.1 kcal/g) or high ‑dense diet (HFD, .24 kcal/g). Minocycline was used to manipulate gut microbiota composition. 16S Sequencing was used to determine microbiota composition. Immunofluorescence against IB4 and Iba1 was used to determine NTS reorganization and microglia activation. Nodose ganglia from LFD rats were isolated and co-cultured with different bacteria strains to determine neurotoxicity. HFD altered gut microbiota with increases in Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio and in pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria proliferation. HFD triggered reorganization of vagal afferents and microglia activation in the NTS, associated with weight gain. Minocycline-treated HFD rats exhibited microbiota profile comparable to LFD animals. Minocycline suppressed HFD‑induced reorganization of vagal afferents and microglia activation in the NTS, and reduced body fat accumulation. Proteobacteria isolated from cecum of HFD rats were toxic to vagal afferent neurons in culture. Our findings show that diet‑induced shift in gut microbiome may disrupt vagal gut‑brain communication resulting in microglia activation and increased body fat accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29022347> Efficiency and Performance Limiting Effects in Thermo-Osmotic  Conversion from Low-Grade Heat.</a></h1><p>Low-grade heat  from sources below 100 °C is available in massive quantities around the world, but cannot be converted to electricity effectively using existing technologies due to variability in the heat output and the small temperature difference between the source and environment. The recently developed thermo-osmotic  conversion (TOEC) process has the potential to   from low-grade heat sources by using a temperature difference to create a pressurized liquid flux across a membrane, which can be converted to mechanical work via a turbine. In this study, we perform the first analysis of  efficiency and the expected performance of the TOEC technology, focusing on systems utilizing hydrophobic porous vapor-gap membranes and water as a working fluid. We begin by developing a framework to analyze realistic mass and heat transport in the process, probing the impact of various membrane parameters and system operating conditions. Our analysis reveals that an optimized system can achieve heat-to-electricity  conversion efficiencies up to 4.1% (34% of the Carnot efficiency) with hot and cold working temperatures of 60 and 20 °C, respectively, and an operating pressure of  MPa (50 bar). Lower  efficiencies, however, will occur in systems operating with high power densities (> W/m) and with finite-sized heat exchangers. We identify that the most important membrane properties for achieving high performance are an asymmetric pore structure, high pressure resistance, a high porosity, and a thickness of 30 to 100 μm. We also quantify the benefits in performance from utilizing deaerated water streams, strong hydrodynamic mixing in the membrane module, and high heat exchanger efficiencies. Overall, our study demonstrates the promise of full-scale TOEC systems to extract  from low-grade heat and identifies key factors for performance optimization moving forward.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788095>Effects of maturity at  on the nutritive value and ruminal digestion of Eragrostis tef (cv. Moxie) when fed to beef cattle.</a></h1><p>Teff (Eragrostis tef cv. Moxie), a warm-season annual grass, could be an excellent forage for beef cattle. However, there is limited information on its nutritive value to cattle when harvested at different stages of maturity. Thus, the objective of this research was to determine the effect of feeding teff hay harvested at the boot (BT), early-heading (EH), or late-heading (LH) stages of maturity on nutrient intake, ruminal fermentation characteristics, omasal nutrient flow, and N utilization in beef cattle. Six ruminally cannulated beef heifers (mean initial BW ± SD, 476 ± 32.6) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 28-d periods (18 d for adaptation and 10 d for measurements). Dry matter intake was measured daily. Indwelling pH loggers were used to measure ruminal pH from days 21 to 28. Ruminal fluid and omasal digesta were collected from days 26 to 28 to determine fermentation characteristics and omasal nutrient flow. Fecal and urine samples to quantify N excretion were also collected (days 26 to 28). Blood samples for plasma urea-N (PUN) determination were collected 3 h post-feeding on day 28. There were no changes (P > 0.28) in the ADF or NDF content of teff with advancing maturity, but indigestible NDF increased (P < 0.01) with increasing maturity. Maturity had no effect (P ≥ 0.14) on DMI, and ruminal total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration, pH, digestibility, and outflow of DM, OM, NDF, ADF, and CP. However, the CP content of BT hay was greater (P < 0.01) than for EH and LH hay (18.1, 14.1, and 11.%, respectively, DM basis), and this resulted in the higher CP intake (P < 0.01) for heifers fed the BT than the EH and LH hay. Consequently, ruminal ammonia-N (NH3-N) concentration was greater (P < 0.01) for heifers fed BT than EH and LH hay, thereby possibly explaining the tendency for a decrease (P = 0.08) in PUN concentration, and a decrease (P < 0.01) in the excretion of total N, urine N, and urea-N (UUN) with advancing maturity. However, fecal N excretion (g/d) did not differ (P = 0.76). In conclusion, despite a decrease in CP intake and ruminal NH3-N concentration, feeding beef heifers EH and LH compared to BT teff hay did not compromise ruminal digestion and outflow of DM, OM, NDF, ADF, and CP, and microbial protein synthesis. Advancing maturity in teff hay also resulted in a decrease in the excretion of total N and urine N and UUN when fed to cattle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837484>Identification of the laccase-like multicopper oxidase gene family of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) and expression analysis in six ancient Tuscan varieties.</a></h1><p>Laccase-like multicopper oxidases (LMCOs) are versatile enzymes used as biocatalysts performing the oxidation of different substrates of industrial relevance, with or without the intervention of a mediator. They have attracted a lot of interest for biotechnological applications in light of their eco-friendliness: they indeed oxidize the substrate(s) by coupling the four electron reduction of the final acceptor, molecular oxygen (O), to water. Plant LMCOs represent a still poorly studied, important class of oxidoreductases controlling e.g. the post- quality of fruits and enabling the tailoring of designer  crops. We here sought to identify the LMCOs in Prunus avium L., whose fruits are rich in bioactive molecules, but are also highly perishable. The goal was to analyze them using bioinformatics (phylogenetic and in silico structural analyses) and to perform a targeted expression study on a subset of genes in six ancient varieties from Tuscany, all threatened by genetic erosion. These sweet cherry varieties contain higher amount of bioactive molecules, as compared to commercial counterparts. The results shown demonstrate strikingly different gene expression patterns in the six ancient varieties ('Benedetta', 'Carlotta', 'Crognola', 'Maggiola', 'Morellona', 'Moscatella') belonging to the Tuscan Regional Bank of Germplasm, as compared to a widely used commercial one ('Durone'). The motivation of this study is the economic importance of P. avium and the involvement of LMCOs in post- fruit parameters, like color. The results presented pave the way to follow-up researches on LMCOs of sweet cherry exploring post- fruit parameters (e.g. anthocyanin stability responsible for pericarp browning and the preservation of the appealing red color), as well as developmental processes, like stony pit formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29988300>Microalgae  biomass harvesting by natural flocculant: effects on biomass sedimentation, spent medium recycling and lipid extraction.</a></h1><p>Microalgal biomass harvesting using traditional chemicals is costly for the production of biofuels, hindering the scale-up process of the technology. Thus, the search for a cost-effective microalgal harvesting method is extremely important. Using chitosan as a natural flocculant to  microalgal biomass seems to be an efficient and convenient solution. Although microalgal biomass flocculation by chitosan has been reported in some previous studies, literature on the harvesting of microalgae  biomass using such polymer is scanty. In addition, there is limited information available on whether the usage of chitosan during the harvesting will affect downstream lipid extraction. Still, whether microalgae can be re-grown with the spent medium after chitosan flocculation is still unknown.In this study, microalgal biomass harvesting using chitosan as a natural flocculant and aluminum sulfate as a traditional flocculant was compared and evaluated. Optimal doses and effects on biomass sedimentation, spent medium recycling and lipid extraction were investigated. The results showed that the optimal doses for chitosan and aluminum sulfate to achieve more than 90% biomass recovery were 0.25 and 2. g/L, respectively. The sedimentation time of 10 min was found to be the most appropriate to remove over 90% biomass from culture. The spent medium after chitosan flocculation could be potentially recycled for the re-cultivation of microalgae, which demonstrated robust growth in comparison with those grown in the recycled medium from aluminum sulfate flocculation. The lipid content of microalgae harvested by chitosan reached 32.9, 4.6% higher than that of those harvested by aluminum sulfate, indicating that the application of the natural flocculant would not impact the downstream extraction of microalgal lipids.The results herein presented, demonstrated that chitosan is applicable for microalgal harvesting during the upscaling process. Flocculation method developed by using chitosan as a natural flocculant is a worthy microalgal harvesting method for microalgae-based biofuel production. There is hope that chitosan can be reasonably and technically realistically applied in a full-scale process for the harvesting of microalgal biomass.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28539928> Time Optimization for Combustion Quality of Different Miscanthus Genotypes across Europe.</a></h1><p>Delayed  can improve the quality of miscanthus biomass for combustion and enhance the long-term sustainability of the crop, despite accompanying yield losses. The aim of this study is to identify the optimal harvesting time, which can deliver improved biomass quality for combustion of novel miscanthus genotypes at various sites across Europe, without high yield losses and without compromising their environmental performance. The relevant field trials were established as part of the European project OPTIMISC with 15 genotypes at six sites across Europe. For this study, the five highest yielding genotypes from each germplasm group and three sites with contrasting climatic conditions (Stuttgart, Germany; Adana, Turkey; and Moscow, Russia) were selected for assessment. The biomass samples were collected between August and March (depending on site) and subjected to mineral and ash content analysis. At Stuttgart, the delay in harvesting time led to a significant variation in combustion quality characteristics, such as N content (0.64-0.21%), ash content (.15-2.60%), and ash sintering index (1.30-0.20). At Adana, the delay in harvesting time decreased the N content from 0.62 to 0.23%, ash content from 10.63 to 3.84%, and sintering index from 0.54 to 0.07. At Moscow, the impact of delay in harvesting was not significant, except for N, Mg, and ash sintering index. Overall, a delay in harvesting time improved the combustion quality characteristics of each genotype, but at the expense of yield. Yield losses of up to 49% in Stuttgart and Adana and 21% for Moscow were recorded, with variations between genotypes and sites. The harvesting time also affected nutrient offtake, which in turn influences the long-term environmental performance of the crop. The highest N, P, and K offtakes were recorded at Stuttgart for each harvesting time except for final  (March), where Moscow had the highest N offtake. This study describes the three criteria (biomass quality, yield losses, nutrient offtake) for determining the ideal harvesting time, which gives the best compromise between dry matter yields and biomass quality characteristics without negatively affecting the environmental performance of the crop.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611477>Umami taste and its association with  status in harvested Pleurotus geesteranus stored at different temperatures.</a></h1><p>Pleurotus geesteranus has recently been gaining popularity due to its strong umami taste. In the present study, umami taste,  level, and  metabolism-related enzymes activity in harvested P. geesteranus, stored at 20, 10, , and 0 °C, were investigated to evaluate the relationship between umami taste and  status. Results showed that the mushroom at  °C exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.05) equivalent umami concentration (EUC), higher content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and higher activity of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in late storage. AMP, associating umami taste with , presented a significantly positive correlation with EUC and umami determined by electronic tongue at  °C. Furthermore, there were better correlations between umami taste and  status of mushroom at  °C. The results suggest that higher  status of post- P. geesteranus contributes to better umami taste.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, an attempt was made to process potato chips through microwave processing without incorporation of any oil in potato chips. Microwave processing of potato chips was done using microwave power varying from 180 to 600 W using constant sample size. Among eleven different drying models, Parabolic model was found to be the best fit through non-linear regression analysis to illustrate drying kinetics of potato chips. The structural, textural and colour attributes of microwaved potato chips were similar to commercial fried potato chips. It was found that at 600 W after 2.-3.0 min of processing, potato chips gained the fracturability and crispiness index as that of commercial fried chips. Microwave processing was found suitable for processing of potato chips with low fat content (~3.09 vs 35. % in commercial preparation) and with acceptable sensory scores (≥7.6 on 9.0 point on hedonic scale vs 8.0 of control preparation).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702581>On the Nature of -Feasible Wireless Nanosensor Networks.</a></h1><p>Electromagnetic nanocommunications, understood as the communication between electronic nanoscale devices through electromagnetic waves in the terahertz band, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this regard, several solutions have already been proposed. However, many of them do not sufficiently capture the significance of the limitations in nanodevice -gathering and storing capacity.

Different mathematical expressions are derived to analyze the impact of these parameters on its performance. Based on these expressions, the functionality of a nanogenerator is evaluated to gain insight into the conditions under which a wireless nanosensor network (WNSN) is viable from the energetic point of view.

The main absorbers are carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls (BChls), which  different parts of the solar spectrum. The first two optical transitions in BChl produce the Q  and Q  absorption bands. The large size of BChl molecules has prevented accurate computational determination of the electronic structures for the relevant states, until we recently succeeded in obtaining the excitation energies and transition dipole moments of the first (Q ) transition for all BChls in LH2 and LH3 using multi-state multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory calculations. In this work, we go one step further, compute the corresponding values for the Q  transition, in line with previous work [ J. Am. Chem. Soc . 2017 , 139 , 7558 - 7567 ], and compare and assess our data against excitation energies obtained through time-dependent density functional theory methods. Interestingly, we find that the two transitions respond differently to BChls' geometrical factors, such as the macrocycle ring curvature and the dihedral torsion of the acetyl moiety. These findings will aid the unraveling of structure-function relationships for absorption and  transfer processes in purple bacteria, and once again this demonstrates the viability of multireference quantum chemical methods as computational tools for the photophysics of biomolecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744716>Effects of ruminal degradability of ensiled whole crop maize varieties on feed intake and milk production of dairy cows.</a></h1><p>The feed value of whole crop maize silage (WCMS) depends on nutrient composition, ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility. However, as the ruminal degradation rate is involved in physical regulation of feed intake, ruminal degradability of WCMS may also affect feed intake and milk production of dairy cows. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine relationships between nutrient composition, ruminal degradability, and whole tract digestibility of WCMS and feed intake and milk production of dairy cows. Nine varieties were tested in 3 consecutive years. Nutrient composition analyses included proximate analysis and determination of cell wall constituents. Whole tract digestibility was determined in vivo using wethers and ruminal degradability was examined in situ using four rumen-fistulated steers. Feed intake and milk production were measured using nine cows per variety. Cows were fed a ration consisting of 75.0% WCMS, 8.% hay and 16.% soya bean meal (dry matter basis) ad libitum. Variety did not influence nutrient composition, except for the concentration of ADF (ADFom), ADL and utilisable CP (uCP). In contrast, variety had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on ruminal degradability of NDF (aNDFom) and on whole tract digestibility of organic matter (OM) and non-fibre carbohydrates. Dry matter intake (DMI) of WCMS tended to be affected by variety (0.05<P < 0.10) whereas no effect on -corrected milk production (ECM) was observed. The year of  had an influence on net  for lactation and uCP concentration, ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility of nutrients, as well as on DMI and ECM of dairy cows. Whole tract aNDFom digestibility of WCMS was positively correlated with aNDFom concentration (R2 = 0.48) and whole tract OM digestibility (R2 = 0.58). Furthermore, ruminal OM degradability was positively correlated with DMI (R2 = 0.57) and ECM (R2 = 0.49) of dairy cows. The results indicate that ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility have a greater impact on the feed value of WCMS than nutrient composition and should be focused on to optimise feed intake and milk production of dairy cows. Thus, maize breeders should include ruminal degradability and whole tract digestibility parameters in variety testing programs to increase the informative value of variety descriptions for farmers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177293>Mapping quantitative trait loci for seed traits in Camelina sativa.</a></h1><p>Genetic dissection of oil content and seed size in Camelina sativa was conducted by QTL mapping using a SNP-based linkage map and a recombinant inbred population. Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is an oilseed crop that has great potential to provide sustainable feedstock for biofuel production and to improve dryland agriculture. A major breeding objective for camelina is to increase seed size and oil content. Understanding the genetics behind variations of seed size and associated traits such as oil content would help breeders develop varieties of increased oil yield that are more robust, easier to plant and , and better for oil processing. In this study, we developed a recombinant inbred population derived from the two camelina accessions, Suneson and Pryzeth, with contrasting traits, especially seed size and oil content. Using 189 lines, a genetic map was constructed containing 2376 single nucleotide polymorphism markers spanning 2034.6 cM of 20 linkage groups with an average density of 1. cM per locus. Field trials were conducted for 2 years (2017 and 2018) in two environments (dryland and irrigated) in Bozeman, Montana. The results revealed important correlations of seed size with other associated traits such as oil content, pod size and seed number per pod. Significant QTLs were also discovered for these traits. The results of this study are the first step to isolate genes controlling seed development and oil accumulation and to develop advanced varieties of camelina better adapted to modern agriculture by marker-assisted breeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29219747>Using magnetic materials to  microalgal biomass: evaluation of harvesting and detachment efficiency.</a></h1><p>Using naked iron oxide (FeO) and yttrium iron oxide (YFeO) nanoparticles as flocculants, the harvesting efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris biomass was investigated. The harvesting process includes two steps, which are the separation of microalgae from the culture solution with the magnetic nanoparticles and then the separation of the algae from the magnetic nanoparticles. The optimal dosages and pH values for the magnetic harvesting of microalgal biomass were determined. Results showed that YFeO nanoparticles were more efficient in microalgal biomass harvesting than FeO nanoparticles. In an effort to achieve more than 90% of harvesting efficiency, optimal dosages for FeO and YFeO to  microalgal biomass were 10 and 2. g/L, while the appropriate pH values were 6.2 and 7.3, respectively. The harvesting efficiency of FeO and YFeO nanoparticles increased as the pH value decreased. The experimental results also showed that under a higher pH value FeO nanoparticles were much easier to be separated from the flocs than YFeO. 62.9% of FeO nanoparticles could be de-attached from the aggregates, when the floc pH value reached 12.3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216503>The Dissipative Potential of Gamma Irradiation in Residues of Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam in the Postharvest of Common Beans.</a></h1><p>Gamma irradiation ( Co) in postharvest of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), has already proven beneficial, regarding the prolongation of shelf life and physical, chemical, and organoleptic aspects of grains. However, few prior studies have investigated the effect of gamma irradiation on the dissipation of pesticides in foods, especially insecticides in beans. This study aimed to evaluate the waste dissipation of two insecticides, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, used in the cultivation of common bean, a variety of Carioca, using gamma irradiation. Ground bean samples were spiked each insecticide in the laboratory at 3, 4, and  mg/kg, and were then irradiated at 0, 1, and 2 kGy per irradiator with a  Co source. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify the insecticides. The irradiation promoted dissipation of thiamethoxam at 1 and 2 kGy doses, with the highest dissipation verified at 2 kGy. In general, at this higher dose of irradiation the reduction dissipation of thiamethoxam was 66% of the mean value found in the treatment without irradiation and ∼44% relative to the 1 kGy dose. Conversely, imidacloprid showed no effect of irradiation on waste dissipation, except in the treatment of  mg/kg at 2 kGy dose. From the results, it was concluded that the gamma irradiation might have applicability in dissipating thiamethoxam in real bean samples.Pesticide residues remaining from bean cultivation, sensitive to optimal doses of gamma irradiation, can be transformed into other less harmful or nonharmful substances, increasing the quality of the beans before the food arrives at the consumer's table. Irradiation of the grains after  also eliminates the need for application of other pesticides to preserve the grains during storage, as the technique is capable of eradicating deteriorating agents, such as microorganisms and insects.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021599>Rational Design of Photosynthesis-Inspired Nanomedicines.</a></h1><p>The sun is the most abundant source of  on earth. Phototrophs have discovered clever strategies to  this light  and convert it to chemical  for biomass production. This is achieved in light-harvesting complexes, or antennas, that funnel the exciton  into the reaction centers. Antennas contain an array of chlorophylls, linear tetrapyrroles, and carotenoid pigments spatially controlled by neighboring proteins. This fine-tuned regulation of protein-pigment arrangements is crucial for survival in the conditions of both excess and extreme light deficit. Photomedicine and photodiagnosis have long been utilizing naturally derived and synthetic monomer dyes for imaging, photodynamic and photothermal therapy; however, the precise regulation of damage inflicted by these therapies requires more complex architectures. In this Account, we discuss how two mechanisms found in photosynthetic systems, photoprotection and light harvesting, have inspired scientists to create nanomedicines for more effective and precise phototherapies. Researchers have been recapitulating natural photoprotection mechanisms by utilizing carotenoids and other quencher molecules toward the design of photodynamic molecular beacons (PDT beacons) for disease-specific photoactivation. We highlight the seminal studies describing peptide-linked porphyrin-carotenoid PDT beacons, which are locally activated by a disease-specific enzyme. Examples of more advanced constructs include tumor-specific mRNA-activatable and polyionic cell-penetrating PDT beacons. An alternative approach toward harnessing photosynthetic processes for biomedical applications includes the design of various nanostructures. This Account will primarily focus on organic lipid-based micro- and nanoparticles. The phenomenon of nonphotochemical quenching, or excess  release in the form of heat, has been widely explored in the context of porphyrin-containing nanomedicines. These quenched nanostructures can be implemented toward photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. Upon nanostructure disruption, as a result of tissue accumulation and subsequent cell uptake, activatable fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy can be achieved. Alternatively, processes found in nature for light harvesting under dim conditions, such as in the deep sea, can be harnessed to maximize light absorption within the tissue. Specifically, high-ordered dye aggregation that results in a bathochromic shift and increased absorption has been exploited for the collection of more light with longer wavelengths, characterized by maximum tissue penetration. Overall, the profound understanding of photosynthetic systems combined with rapid development of nanotechnology has yielded a unique field of nature-inspired photomedicine, which holds promise toward more precise and effective phototherapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358960>Structural basis for  harvesting and dissipation in a diatom PSII-FCPII supercomplex.</a></h1><p>Light-harvesting antenna systems in photosynthetic organisms  solar  and transfer it to the photosynthetic reaction centres to initiate charge-separation and electron-transfer reactions. Diatoms are one of the important groups of oxyphototrophs and possess fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs) as light harvesters. The organization and association pattern of FCP with the photosystem II (PSII) core are unknown. Here we solved the structure of PSII-FCPII supercomplexes isolated from a diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis, by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy. The PSII-FCPII forms a homodimer. In each monomer, two FCP homotetramers and three FCP monomers are associated with one PSII core. The structure reveals a highly complicated protein-pigment network that is different from the green-type light-harvesting apparatus. Comparing these two systems allows the identification of  transfer and quenching pathways. These findings provide structural insights into not only excitation- transfer mechanisms in the diatom PSII-FCPII, but also changes of light harvesters between the red- and green-lineage oxyphototrophs during evolution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864653>Chemical Pretreatment-Independent Saccharifications of Xylan and Cellulose of Rice Straw by Bacterial Weak Lignin-Binding Xylanolytic and Cellulolytic Enzymes.</a></h1><p>Complete utilization of carbohydrate fractions is one of the prerequisites for obtaining economically favorable lignocellulosic biomass conversion. This study shows that xylan in untreated rice straw was saccharified to xylose in one step without chemical pretreatment, yielding 58.2% of the theoretically maximum value by  B-6 PcAxy43A, a weak lignin-binding trifunctional xylanolytic enzyme, endoxylanase/β-xylosidase/arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase. Moreover, xylose yield from untreated rice straw was enhanced to 78.9% by adding endoxylanases PcXyn10C and PcXyn11A from the same bacterium, resulting in improvement of cellulose accessibility to cellulolytic enzyme. After autoclaving the xylanolytic enzyme-treated rice straw, it was subjected to subsequent saccharification by a combination of the  endoglucanase CtCel9R and  β-glucosidase TbCglT, yielding 88.% of the maximum glucose yield, which was higher than the glucose yield obtained from ammonia-treated rice straw saccharification (59.6%). Moreover, this work presents a new environment-friendly xylanolytic enzyme pretreatment for beneficial hydrolysis of xylan in various agricultural residues, such as rice straw and corn hull. It not only could improve cellulose saccharification but also produced xylose, leading to an improvement of the overall fermentable sugar yields without chemical pretreatment. Ongoing research is focused on improving "green" pretreatment technologies in order to reduce  demands and environmental impact and to develop an economically feasible biorefinery. The present study showed that PcAxy43A, a weak lignin-binding trifunctional xylanolytic enzyme, endoxylanase/β-xylosidase/arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase from  B-6, was capable of conversion of xylan in lignocellulosic biomass such as untreated rice straw to xylose in one step without chemical pretreatment. It demonstrates efficient synergism with endoxylanases PcXyn10C and PcXyn11A to depolymerize xylan in untreated rice straw and enhanced the xylose production and improved cellulose hydrolysis. Therefore, it can be considered an enzymatic pretreatment. Furthermore, the studies here show that glucose yield released from steam- and xylanolytic enzyme-treated rice straw by the combination of CtCel9R and TbCglT was higher than the glucose yield obtained from ammonia-treated rice straw saccharification. This work presents a novel environment-friendly xylanolytic enzyme pretreatment not only as a green pretreatment but also as an economically feasible biorefinery method.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29346109>Endocardial  Harvesting by Electromagnetic Induction.</a></h1><p>cardiac pacemakers require regular medical follow-ups to ensure proper functioning.

To study such effects, C3A liver cells exposed to palmitate were used as a model of hepatic insulin resistance. These hepatocytes displayed impaired substrate metabolism, including reduced glucose transport and free fatty acid uptake. These defects included impaired insulin signaling, evident through reduced phosphatidylinositol-4,-bisphosphate 3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) protein expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction, depicted by a lower mitochondrial respiration rate. Aspalathin was able to ameliorate these defects by correcting altered substrate metabolism, improving insulin signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Activation of '-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be a plausible mechanism by which aspalathin increases hepatic  expenditure. Overall, these results encourage further studies assessing the potential use of aspalathin as a nutraceutical to improve hepatocellular  expenditure, and reverse metabolic disease-associated complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27232668>Rotating-Disk-Based Hybridized Electromagnetic-Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Sustainably Powering Wireless Traffic Volume Sensors.</a></h1><p>Wireless traffic volume detectors play a critical role for measuring the traffic-flow in a real-time for current Intelligent Traffic System. However, as a battery-operated electronic device, regularly replacing battery remains a great challenge, especially in the remote area and wide distribution.

To address this limitation, different EDs and electron acceptors (EAs) were combined to compare their CE performances, and to investigate whether the combination of ethanol and lactate could further enhance the MCFA production based on the complementary characteristics of ethanol and lactate. The results verified, for the first time, ethanol and lactate as the co-EDs formed a cooperative relationship to largely promote the conversion of substrates into MCFA. The co-EDs of ethanol and lactate stimulated the transformation of dispersive lactate-carbon flux from the competing acrylate pathway into n-heptylate. Additionally, the coexisting by-products (H and CO) from ethanol and lactate also contributed to the supererogatory MCFA generation. The key microbial taxa that distinguished the co-EDs from their single action were the preponderant species from class Negativicutes and family Ruminococcaceae. In addition, the co-EAs of acetate, n-butyrate, and n-caproate also promoted MCFA generation. Low concentration of n-caproate could be directly elongated into n-caprylate, while n-caproate concentration exceeding the toxic limit was unsuitable as an EA. This research provided a guide for substrate selection and collocation for CE technology. Chinese liquor-making wastewater (CLMW) was subsequently used as a substrate for MCFA production since it contains abundant lactate, ethanol, and short-chain fatty acids. In this study, a MCFA selectivity of 80.34 ± .26%, a slightly higher selectivity which is in the range of previously reported ones, was obtained. This study paves a way for the sustainable development of Chinese liquor industry by recycling the high-output CLMW into MCFA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In developed countries and urban communities, photothermal membrane water treatment can improve the  efficiency during water purification. In these water purification processes, the light absorption and light-to-heat conversion of photothermal materials are important factors in determining the membrane efficacy. Nanomaterials with well-controlled structure and optical properties can increase the light absorption and photothermal conversion of newly developed membranes. This Account introduces our recent work on developing scalable, cost-effective, and highly efficient photothermal membranes for four water purification applications: reverse osmosis (RO), ultrafiltration (UF), solar steam generation (SSG), and photothermal membrane distillation (PMD). By utilizing photothermal materials, first, we have demonstrated how sunlight can be used to improve the membrane's resistance to biofouling in RO and UF processes by photothermally induced inactivation of microorganisms. Second, we have developed novel SSG membranes (i.e., interfacial evaporators) that can  solar , convert it to localized heat, and generate clean water by evaporation. This desalination approach is particularly useful and promising for treatment of highly saline water. These new interfacial evaporators utilized graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), molybdenum disulfide (MoS), and polydopamine (PDA). The solar conversion efficiency and environmental sustainability of the interfacial evaporators were optimized via (i) novel and versatile bottom-up biofabrication (e.g., incorporation of photothermal materials during bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) growth) and (ii) easy and cost-effective top-down preparation (e.g., modification of natural wood with photothermal materials). Third, we have developed membranes for PMD that incorporate photothermal materials to generate heat under solar irradiation, thus providing a higher transmembrane temperature difference and higher driving force for effective vapor transport, making the membrane distillation process more -efficient. Lastly, this Account compares the photothermal membrane applications, summarizes current challenges for photothermal membrane applications, and offers future directions to facilitate the translation of photothermal membranes from the laboratory to large engineered systems by improving their scalability, stability, and sustainability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28772856>Photoactive Nanomaterials Inspired by Nature: LTL Zeolite Doped with Laser Dyes as Artificial Light Harvesting Systems.</a></h1><p>The herein reported work describes the development of hierarchically-organized fluorescent nanomaterials inspired by plant antenna systems.

Yet in India, there is widespread prevalence of undernourishment among children below  years of age. Within the Indian context, small millets have great potential as a healthy food to address this challenge by the virtue of their nutritional qualities. However, there are many problems with the current processing technology for small millets, whereas the use of value-added products was minimal. To address this, an assessment of existing small millet processing machinery was undertaken, and a double chamber centrifugal dehuller was developed, which had higher recovery of dehulled unpolished millets and met requirements at the village and enterprise levels. To demonstrate the health benefits of consuming value-added small millets, a study of supplementation of multi-millet health mix on the nutritional status of primary schoolchildren was conducted in Thondamuthur Block of Coimbatore District, India. Multi-millet health mix was formulated from kodo millet, little millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, and wheat with the inclusion of pulses. It contained 65.45-g carbohydrate, 11.46-g protein, 4.94-g fat, 4.94-g fibre, 4.07-mg iron, 112-mg calcium, 268.52-mg phosphorus, and 349 calories of  per 100 g.

To better understand the relation between HZE ion exposure and somatic mutation, we examined cell survival fraction, Aprt mutant frequencies, and the types of mutations detected for mouse splenic T cells exposed in vivo to graded doses of densely ionizing (48)Ti ions (1GeV/amu, LET=107 keV/μm), (56)Fe ions (1GeV/amu, LET=151 keV/μm) ions, or sparsely ionizing protons (1GeV, LET=0.24 keV/μm). The lowest doses for (48)Ti and (56)Fe ions were equivalent to a fluence of approximately 1 or 2 particle traversals per nucleus. In most cases, Aprt mutant frequencies in the irradiated mice were not significantly increased relative to the controls for any of the particles or doses tested at the pre-determined  time (3- months after irradiation). Despite the lack of increased Aprt mutant frequencies in the irradiated splenocytes, a molecular analysis centered on chromosome 8 revealed the induction of radiation signature mutations (large interstitial deletions and complex mutational patterns), with the highest levels of induction at 2 particles nucleus for the (48)Ti and (56)Fe ions. In total, the results show that densely ionizing HZE ions can induce characteristic mutations in splenic T cells at low fluence, and that at least a subset of radiation-induced mutant cells are stably retained despite the apparent lack of increased mutant frequencies at the time of .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Australian grain sorghum production will probably continue to generate a  in the order of 2. × 10 t of which some 7.9 × 10 t will be used as a feed grain for poultry and pigs. Feed grains are included primarily to provide  from starch, but  utilisation by broiler chickens offered sorghum-based diets is relatively inferior, because of incomplete starch digestion. Kafirin, the dominant protein fraction, 'non-tannin' phenolic compounds and phytate are 3 'starch extrinsic' factors in sorghum that compromise starch digestibility and  utilisation in broiler chickens offered sorghum-based diets. Kafirin concentrations in 6 sorghum varieties were negatively correlated with metabolizable  to gross  (ME:GE) ratios ( = -0.891;  < 0.02) or the efficiency of  utilisation in broiler chickens. Importantly, kafirin proportions of sorghum protein may be increasing with time in Australia. If so, this represents a fundamental challenge to sorghum breeders which presumably could be met by the development of sorghum varieties with different characteristics, especially in relation to the γ- and β-kafirin fractions. White sorghum varieties contain lower polyphenol concentrations which should be advantageous as concentrations of total phenolic compounds were negatively correlated to ME:GE ratios ( = -0.838;  < 0.04) in 6 sorghum varieties. It would be desirable if more white varieties were to become available. It is suggested that responses to exogenous phytase in birds offered sorghum-based diets would be more robust if sorghum were to contain lower concentrations of kafirin and phenolic compounds. Paradoxically, while better sorghum varieties almost certainly could be developed, it may not necessarily follow that they will command a price premium from poultry and pig producers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28432400>[The intestinal microbiome and metabolic diseases : From obesity to diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis].</a></h1><p>The intestinal microbiome consists of about 10 million genes, many of which encode digestive enzymes.

A key goal is the harvesting of photons from below the bandgap of crystalline silicon 1.12 eV (≈1100 nm) and their upconversion into the visible region. In practice, the systems demonstrated so far have been limited to harvesting photons with energies above 1.2 eV (≈1 μm), due to two reasons: firstly the need to use transmitter ligands which allow efficient  harvesting from the QD but introduce an  loss of larger than 200 meV in transmission from the QD to the annihilator, and secondly due to the use of molecules such as tetracene which cannot accept smaller  than 1.2 eV. Here, we introduce a new strategy to overcome these difficulties by using a low  triplet annihilator that also harvests excitations efficiently from QDs. Specifically, we show that ,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (TES-ADT, triplet  of 1.08 eV:  1150 nm) functions as a triplet annihilator (20% TTA efficiency) while also rapidly extracting triplet excitons from lead sulfide (PbS) QDs with a rate constant of  =  2 × 10 s with an excitation at 1064 nm. This rate is consistent with an orbital overlap between TES-ADT and PbS QDs, which we propose is due to the thiophene group of TES-ADT, which enables a close association with the PbS surface, allowing this system to function both as annihilator and transmitter. Our results pave the way for the design of triplet annihilators that can closely associate with the QD surface and  low  excitons with minute losses in  during the TET process, with the ultimate goal of efficiently utilizing photon  beyond the bandgap of crystalline silicon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569566>Experimental In-Field Transfer and Survival of  from Animal Feces to Romaine Lettuce in Salinas Valley, California.</a></h1><p>This randomized controlled trial characterized the transfer of  from animal feces and/or furrow water onto adjacent heads of lettuce during foliar irrigation, and the subsequent survival of bacteria on the adaxial surface of lettuce leaves.

Adequacy of the complementary foods in nutrients for complementary feeding purposes was assessed as a ratio between actual composition and recommended composition of complementary foods.Only 16.1% of the children get the minimum dietary diversity. The children were reported to be fed with cereals & grains (68.8%), discretionary calories (53.6%), protein-rich foods (44.6%), oils and fat (40.%), vegetables (38.%), dairy products (17.9%) and fruits (28.1%). The sampled foods contained 4.3-24.4%, 0.9-8.%, 8.2-11.9%, 27.9-162.6 Kcal/100 g, 168.4-250.4 mg/100 g, 1.8-4.1 mg/100 g and 22.-42.4 mg/100 g of total carbohydrate, crude fat, protein,  content, calcium, zinc and iron, respectively. All the complementary food samples predominantly fed to children were not composed of adequate protein, fat, carbohydrate,  and calcium as recommended for complementary feeding purposes. However, most of the complementary foods are composed of adequate iron and zinc.The nutrient density and diversity of complementary foods of 6-24-month-old children in the study area were found to be sub-optimal. Upgrading the nutritional composition of the starchy complementary foods should be of highest priority to improve nutrition of the infants and young children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29044893>Synthetic Klebsiella pneumoniae-Shewanella oneidensis Consortium Enables Glycerol-Fed High-Performance Microbial Fuel Cells.</a></h1><p>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an eco-friendly bio-electrochemical sys-tem that uses microorganism as biocatalyst to convert biomass into electricity. Glycerol, as a waste in the biodiesel refinery processes, is an appealing substrate for MFC. Nevertheless, glycerol cannot be utilized as carbon source by well-known exoelectrogens such as Shewanella oneidensis. Herein, to generate electricity by rapidly harnessing glycerol, the authors rationally constructed a Klebsiella pneumoniae-Shewanella oneidensis microbial consortium to efficiently  electricity from glyc-erol, in which K. pneumoniae converted glycerol into lactate, fed to S. oneidensis as carbon source and electron donor. To improve electricity output, the authors systematically engineered the consortium in terms of carbon flux distribution and efficiency of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To direct more carbon flux to lactate biosynthesis in K. pneumoniae, the authors eliminated the ethanol pathway by knocking out the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE), and enhanced lactate biosynthesis by heterologously expressing a lactate dehydrogen-ase gene (ldhD) from Lactobacillus bulgaricus and a lactate transporter gene (lldP) from Escherichia coli. To facilitate EET between S. oneidensis and anode surfaces, a biosynthetic flavins pathway from Bacillus subtilis is introduced into S. oneidensis. The author further optimized the glycerol concentration, thus S. oneidensis could be continuously fed with lactate synthesized from K. pneumoniae at a constant rate. Our glycerol-fed MFC generated a maximum power density of 19.9 mW/m , significantly higher than that of the wild-type consor-tium. This work suggested that engineering microbial consortia is an effi-cient strategy to expand the spectrum of usable carbon sources and promote electricity power production in MFCs.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

An experiment investigating the impact of variety,  date and year on the nutritive value of ensiled maize ears was carried out in three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2010). Nine different maize varieties were harvested at three different maturity stages (50, 55 and 60% dry matter (DM) content in the ears). After , ears and stover were ensiled separately and afterwards nutrient composition and ruminal nutrient degradability (organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and non-fibre carbohydrates (NFC)) were analysed. Variety had a significant influence on content of CP and effective ruminal degradability (ED) of OM at low passage rates, whereas ED of CP and NFC was not affected by variety. In contrast,  date and year significantly influenced nutrient composition and ruminal degradability of ensiled maize ears. The content of NFC increased and the content of fibre components as well as ED of OM, CP and NFC declined with processing maturity of the maize plants. At a passage rate of % h, ED of OM declined from 75.9% to 68.4%, ED of CP from 82.% to 73.8% and ED of NFC from 88.0% to 82.3% between the early and late  date. The results of this study indicate that the nutrient composition and ruminal degradability of ensiled maize ears are affected mainly by maturity stage at  and by year, whereas variety has only little influence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335181>Enhancing the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells by adding Rhodamine B laser dye as co-sensitizer.</a></h1><p>Ternary blend (TB) strategy has been considered as an effective method to enhance the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report on TB-based PSCs containing two donor materials; poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and Rhodamine B (RhB) laser organic dye, and [6,6]-phenyl C butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. The influence of RhB weight percentage and injection volume was extensively studied. To gain insight into the influences of RhB on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, physicochemical and optical properties of TBs were compared with those of BHJ binary blend as a standard. RhB broadened the light absorption properties of the active layer and played a bridging role between P3HT and PCBM. The PCE and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the optimized TB-based PSCs comprising of 0. wt% RhB reached % and 12.12 mA/cm, respectively. Compared to BHJ standard cell, the PCE and the generated current was improved by two orders of magnitude due to higher photon  of the active layer, cascade  level structure of TB components and a considerable decrease in the charge carrier recombination. The results suggest that RhB can be considered as an effective material for application in PSCs to attain high photovoltaic performance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In eukaryotic algae and higher plants, PSI consists of a core surrounded by variable species and numbers of light-harvesting complex (LHC)I proteins, forming a PSI-LHCI supercomplex. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of PSI-LHCR from the red alga  in two forms, one with three Lhcr subunits attached to the side, similar to that of higher plants, and the other with two additional Lhcr subunits attached to the opposite side, indicating an ancient form of PSI-LHCI. Furthermore, the red algal PSI core showed features of both cyanobacterial and higher plant PSI, suggesting an intermediate type during evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The structure of PsaO, existing in eukaryotic organisms, was identified in the PSI core and binds three chlorophylls  and may be important in harvesting  and in mediating  transfer from LHCII to the PSI core under state-2 conditions. Individual attaching sites of LHCRs with the core subunits were identified, and each Lhcr was found to contain 11 to 13 chlorophylls  and  zeaxanthins, which are apparently different from those of LHCs in plant PSI-LHCI. Together, our results reveal unique  transfer pathways different from those of higher plant PSI-LHCI, its adaptation to the changing environment, and the possible changes of PSI-LHCI during evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28321949>Synthesis and Characterization of a Soluble A-D-A Molecule Containing a 2D Conjugated Selenophene-Based Side Group for Organic Solar Cells.</a></h1><p>A new acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) small molecule based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is synthesized via a Stille cross-coupling reaction. A highly conjugated selenophene-based side group is incorporated into each BDT unit to generate a 2D soluble small molecule (SeBDT-DPP). SeBDT-DPP thin films produce two distinct absorption peaks. The shorter wavelength absorption (400 nm) is attributed to the BDT units containing conjugated selenophene-based side groups, and the longer wavelength band is due to the intramolecular charge transfer between the BDT donor and the DPP acceptor. SeBDT-DPP thin films can  a broad solar spectrum covering the range 350-750 nm and have a low bandgap  of 1.63 eV. Solution-processed field-effect transistors fabricated with this small molecule exhibit p-type organic thin film transistor characteristics, and the field-effect mobility of a SeBDT-DPP device is measured to be 2.3 × 10 cm V s .

Reverse electrodialysis is used to  salinity gradient ; a rather unknown renewable  source from controlled mixing of river water and seawater. Traditionally, both river water and seawater compartments have a fixed intermembrane distance. Especially the river water compartment thickness contributes to a large extent to the resistance of the stack due to its low conductivity. In our cyclic approach, two stages define the principle of the breathing concept; the initial stage, where both compartments (seawater and river water) have the same thickness and the compressed stage, where river water compartments are compressed by expanding the seawater compartments. This movement at a tunable frequency allows reducing stack resistance by decreasing the thickness of the river water compartment without increasing permanently the pumping losses. The breathing stacks clearly benefit from the lower resistance values and low pumping power required, obtaining high net power densities over a much broader flow rate range. The high frequency breathing stack (15 cycles/min) shows a maximum net power density of 1.3 W/m. Although the maximum gross and net power density ever registered (2.9 W/m and 1. W/m, respectively) is achieved for a fixed 120 μm intermembrane distance stack (without movement of the membranes), it is only obtained at a very narrow flow rate range due to the high pressure drops at small intermembrane distance. The breathing cell concept offers a unique feature, namely physical movement of the membranes, and thus the ability to adapt to the operational conditions and water quality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637919>The morphological heterogeneity of cricket flow-sensing hairs conveys the complex flow signature of predator attacks.</a></h1><p>Arthropod flow-sensing hair length ranges over more than an order of magnitude, from 0.1 to  mm. Previous studies repeatedly identified the longest hairs as the most sensitive, but recent studies identified the shortest hairs as the most responsive. We resolved this apparent conflict by proposing a new model, taking into account both the initial and long-term aspects of the flow pattern produced by a lunging predator. After the estimation of the mechanical parameters of hairs, we measured the flow produced by predator mimics and compared the predicted and observed values of hair displacements in this flow. Short and long hairs respond over different time scales during the course of an attack. By harbouring a canopy of hairs of different lengths, forming a continuum, the insect can fractionize these moments. Short hairs are more agile, but are less able to   from the air. This may result in longer hairs firing their neurons earlier, despite their slower deflection. The complex interplay between hair agility and sensitivity is also modulated by the predator distance and the attack speed, characteristics defining flow properties. We conclude that the morphological heterogeneity of the hair canopy mirrors the flow complexity of an entire attack, from launch to grasp.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866493>Coupling Plasmonic and Cocatalyst Nanoparticles on N⁻TiO₂ for Visible-Light-Driven Catalytic Organic Synthesis.</a></h1><p>The use of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of plasmonic metal nanocomposites to promote photocarrier generation is a strongly emerging field for improving the catalytic performance under visible-light irradiation.

Their atomic thickness and large-scale synthesis capability could enable the development of 'smart skin', which could transform ordinary objects into an intelligent distributed sensor network. However, although many important components of such a distributed electronic system have already been demonstrated (for example, transistors, sensors and memory devices based on two-dimensional materials), an efficient, flexible and always-on -harvesting solution, which is indispensable for self-powered systems, is still missing. Electromagnetic radiation from Wi-Fi systems operating at 2.4 and .9 gigahertz is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and would be ideal to  for powering future distributed electronics. However, the high frequencies used for Wi-Fi communications have remained elusive to radiofrequency harvesters (that is, rectennas) made of flexible semiconductors owing to their limited transport properties. Here we demonstrate an atomically thin and flexible rectenna based on a MoS semiconducting-metallic-phase heterojunction with a cutoff frequency of 10 gigahertz, which represents an improvement in speed of roughly one order of magnitude compared with current state-of-the-art flexible rectifiers. This flexible MoS-based rectifier operates up to the X-band (8 to 12 gigahertz) and covers most of the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical radio band, including the Wi-Fi channels. By integrating the ultrafast MoS rectifier with a flexible Wi-Fi-band antenna, we fabricate a fully flexible and integrated rectenna that achieves wireless  harvesting of electromagnetic radiation in the Wi-Fi band with zero external bias (battery-free). Moreover, our MoS rectifier acts as a flexible mixer, realizing frequency conversion beyond 10 gigahertz.

However, little information exists concerning how to reap the best quality seeds of Leymus chinensis, which is the dominant and most promising grass species in the Songnen Grassland of Northern China. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate possible quality indices of the seeds at different days after peak anthesis. Seed quality at different development stages was assessed by the colours of the seed and lemmas, seed weight, moisture content, electrical conductivity of seed leachate and germination indices. Two consecutive years of experimental results showed that the maximum seed quality was recorded at 39 days after peak anthesis. At this date, the colours of the seed and lemmas reached heavy brown and yellow, respectively. The seed weight was highest and the moisture content and the electrical conductivity of seed leachate were lowest. In addition, the seed also reached its maximum germination percentage and  at this stage, determined using a standard germination test (SGT) and accelerated ageing test (AAT). Thus, Leymus chinensis can be harvested at 39 days after peak anthesis based on the changes in parameters. Colour identification can be used as an additional indicator to provide a more rapid and reliable measure of optimum seed maturity; approximately 10 days after the colour of the lemmas reached yellow and the colour of the seed reached heavy brown, the seed of this species was suitable for .© 2016.

However, the lack of efficient equations for the quantitative estimation of the SiNW's PM properties limits the rational design of such devices. Herein, we establish comprehensive equations to evaluate several important performance features for the PM properties of SiNW, based on theoretical simulations. Firstly, the relationships between the resonant wavelengths (RW), where SiNW can  light most effectively, and the size of SiNW are formulized. Then, equations for the light-harvesting efficiency at RW, which determines the single-frequency performance limit of SiNW-based photonic devices, are established. Finally, equations for the light-harvesting efficiency of SiNW in full-spectrum, which are of great significance in photovoltaics, are established. Furthermore, using these equations, we have derived four extra formulas to estimate the optimal size of SiNW in light-harvesting. These equations can reproduce majority of the reported experimental and theoretical results with only ~% error deviations. Our study fills up a gap in quantitatively predicting the SiNW's PM properties, which will contribute significantly to its practical applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618233>Triboelectric Nanogenerator Driven Self-Charging and Self-Healing Flexible Asymmetric Supercapacitor Power Cell for Direct Power Generation.</a></h1><p>The expeditious growth of portable electronics has endorsed the researchers to develop self-powered devices that synchronically  and store .

Insights from rural Kenya.</a></h1><p>Various indicators and assessment tools exist to measure diets and nutrition. Most studies eventually rely on one approach. Relatively little is known about how closely results match when different tools are used in the same context. The present study compares and correlates different indicators for the same households and individuals to better understand which indicators can be used as proxies for others.A survey of households and individuals was carried out in Kenya in 2015. Seven-day food consumption and 24 h dietary recalls were administered at household and individual level, respectively. Individual height and weight measures were taken. Different indicators of food access ( consumption, household dietary diversity scores), dietary quality (individual dietary diversity scores, micronutrient intakes) and nutrition (anthropometric indicators) were calculated and correlated to evaluate associations.Rural farm households in western Kenya.ParticipantsData collected from 809 households and 1556 individuals living in these households (782 female adults, 479 male adults, 295 children aged 6-59 months).All measures of food access and dietary quality were positively correlated at individual level. Household-level and individual-level dietary indicators were also positively correlated. Correlations between dietary indicators and anthropometric measures were small and mostly statistically insignificant.Dietary indicators from 7d food consumption recalls at the household level can be used as proxies of individual dietary quality of children and male and female adults. Individual dietary diversity scores are good proxies of micronutrient intakes. However, neither household-level nor individual-level dietary indicators are good proxies of individual nutritional status in this setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29064413>Enhanced Efficiency in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells by Electron Transport and Light Scattering on Freestanding TiO₂ Nanotube Arrays.</a></h1><p>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated with closed- or open-ended freestanding TiO₂ nanotube arrays as photoelectrodes that were decorated with carbon materials and large TiO₂ nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance  conversion efficiency.

This study evaluated the role of magnesium sulphate as an adjuvant with levobupivacaine and ropivacaine used in combined femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) blocks in burn patients with relative sparing of thigh portion.This prospective, randomised, double-blind study included 54 adult patients of 18-65 years age, undergoing split-thickness skin graft  from the thigh, allotted to three equal groups of 18 each. Group L patients received femoral nerve (FN) block with 15 mL of 0.% levobupivacaine and 8 mL for LFCN block; Group LM patients received 14 mL of 0.% levobupivacaine along with 1.0 mL of 15% magnesium sulphate for FN block, 7. mL of 0.% levobupivacaine with 0. mL of 15% of magnesium sulphate to LFCN block and Group R patients received 15 mL of 0.% ropivacaine for FN block and 8 mL of 0.% ropivacaine for LFCN block. Time to block onset and complete surgical block, duration of analgesia, total analgesic dose and the overall analgesia satisfaction score were measured in the first 24 h post-operatively. Quantitative data were analysed with ANOVA and qualitative data subjected to Chi-square tests. Intergroup comparison was performed with independent t-test.The duration of post-operative analgesia did not differ with the addition of magnesium (P = 0.610). Time to onset of the block was significantly decreased with the addition of magnesium (P = 0.0341), but time to complete surgical block onset was similar across the groups.Both ropivacaine and levobupivacaine have good perioperative analgesic efficacy.

Residual feed intake (RFI) and residual BW gain (RG) of heifers that subsequently became dams were determined based on ADG and DMI from 240 d of age to first calving. Various measures of cow efficiency were calculated on either a life cycle or actual lifetime basis using ratios of progeny and dam weight outputs to progeny and dam feed inputs. The correlation between RFI and DMI was large and positive (r = 0.67; P < 0.0001), and RG was highly correlated with ADG (r = 0.75; P < 0.0001). Correlations of RFI with cow efficiency ratios that included  weight, carcass weight, or weight of trimmed wholesale cuts as measures of output ranged from -0.05 (P > 0.10) to -0.17 (P < 0.10), indicating that heifers with better (i.e., more negative) RFI values tended to become slightly more efficient cows. Correlations of RG with life cycle and actual lifetime cow efficiency ratios ranged from 0.08 (P > 0.10) to 0.23 (P < 0.05), demonstrating that heifers with better (i.e., more positive) values for RG were somewhat more efficient as cows. The correlations were stronger when cow salvage value was included in the measures of cow efficiency. Correlations of DMI and mid-test metabolic BW (MMW) with life cycle cow efficiency ratios that did not include cow salvage value as output ranged from -0.15 (P < 0.10) to -0.22 (P < 0.01). Correlations of DMI and MMW with actual lifetime cow efficiency ratios varied from -0.20 (P < 0.05) to -0.36 (P < 0.001). Therefore, smaller heifers that consumed less feed had superior cow efficiency ratios. Correlations of RFI with carcass grade, backfat thickness, marbling score, and kidney fat of progeny indicated that heifers with superior RFI would tend to produce leaner offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426316>Proteomic Insights into Phycobilisome Degradation, A Selective and Tightly Controlled Process in The Fast-Growing Cyanobacterium  UTEX 2973.</a></h1><p>Phycobilisomes (PBSs) are large (3- megadalton) pigment-protein complexes in cyanobacteria that associate with thylakoid membranes and  light primarily for photosystem II. PBSs consist of highly ordered assemblies of pigmented phycobiliproteins (PBPs) and linker proteins that can account for up to half of the soluble protein in cells. Cyanobacteria adjust to changing environmental conditions by modulating PBS size and number. In response to nutrient depletion such as nitrogen (N) deprivation, PBSs are degraded in an extensive, tightly controlled, and reversible process. In  UTEX 2973, a fast-growing cyanobacterium with a doubling time of two hours, the process of PBS degradation is very rapid, with 80% of PBSs per cell degraded in six hours under optimal light and CO conditions. Proteomic analysis during PBS degradation and re-synthesis revealed multiple proteoforms of PBPs with partially degraded phycocyanobilin (PCB) pigments. NblA, a small proteolysis adaptor essential for PBS degradation, was characterized and validated with targeted mass spectrometry. NblA levels rose from essentially 0 to 25,000 copies per cell within 30 min of N depletion, and correlated with the rate of decrease in phycocyanin (PC). Implications of this correlation on the overall mechanism of PBS degradation during N deprivation are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789459>The Influence of Shape on the Output Potential of ZnO Nanostructures: Sensitivity to Parallel versus Perpendicular Forces.</a></h1><p>With the consistent shrinking of devices, micro-systems are, nowadays, widely used in areas such as biomedics, electronics, automobiles, and measurement devices. As devices shrunk, so too did their  consumptions, opening the way for the use of nanogenerators (NGs) as power sources. In particular, to   from an object's motion (mechanical vibrations, torsional forces, or pressure), present NGs are mainly composed of piezoelectric materials in which, upon an applied compressive or strain force, an electrical field is produced that can be used to power a device. The focus of this work is to simulate the piezoelectric effect in different ZnO nanostructures to optimize the output potential generated by a nanodevice. In these simulations, cylindrical nanowires, nanomushrooms, and nanotrees were created, and the influence of the nanostructures' shape on the output potential was studied as a function of applied parallel and perpendicular forces. The obtained results demonstrated that the output potential is linearly proportional to the applied force and that perpendicular forces are more efficient in all structures. However, nanotrees were found to have an increased sensitivity to parallel applied forces, which resulted in a large enhancement of the output efficiency. These results could then open a new path to increase the efficiency of piezoelectric nanogenerators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28094976>Breath Figure Micromolding Approach for Regulating the Microstructures of Polymeric Films for Triboelectric Nanogenerators.</a></h1><p>A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an innovative kind of  harvester recently developed on the basis of organic materials for converting mechanical  into electricity through the combined use of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction. Polymeric materials and their microstructures play key roles in the generation, accumulation, and retainment of triboelectric charges, which decisively determines the final electric performance of TENGs. Herein we report a simple and efficient breath figure (BF) micromolding approach to rapidly regulate the surface microstructures of polymeric films for the assembly of TENGs. Honeycomb porous films with adjustable pore size and dimensional architectures were first prepared by the BF technique through simply adjusting the concentration of the polymer solution. They were then used as negative molds for straightforward synthesis of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with different microlens arrays (MLAs) and lens sizes, which were further assembled for TENGs to investigate the influence of film microstructures. All MLA-based TENGs were found to have an obviously enhanced electric performance in comparison with a flat-PDMS-film-based TENG. Specifically, up to 3 times improvement in the electric performance can be achieved by the MLA-based TENG with optimal surface microstructures over flat-PDMS-film-based TENG under the same triggering conditions. A MLA-based TENG was further successfully used to  the waste mechanical  generated by different human body motions, including finger tapping, hand clapping, and walking with a frequency ranging from 0. to . Hz.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081607>Small-Sized, Lightweight, and Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enhanced by PTFE/PDMS Nanocomposite Electret.</a></h1><p>The rapid development of flexible and wearable electronics calls for a sustainable solution of the power supply. In recent years, the -harvesting triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has attracted increasing attentions due to its sustainability, flexibility, and versatility. However, achieving both high electric output and flexibility at the same time remains to be a challenge. In this work, we reported a corona charging enhanced flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (EF-TENG) to  mechanical  from human motions. The EF-TENG relied on the repeated contacts between a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanocomposite electret and a nanofibers/AgNWs electrode on arrayed silicone pyramids. When the EF-TENG (3. × 3. cm) was pressed, the open-circuit voltage ( V), the short-circuit current ( I), and the power density could reach 275 V, 9. μA, and 802.31 mW/m, respectively. The V of the EF-TENG was improved by 244% compared to the device of which the electret was not corona charged. Major factors that affected the electric output of the EF-TENG were discussed, including the height of the pyramids, the configuration of the pyramids array, and the properties of the electret nanocomposite. The EF-TENG only had an overall thickness of 1.3 mm and a weight of 1.7 g, making it especially suitable to be attached onto human body for harvesting mechanical  from biomechanical motions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28276340>Photophysics of thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules.</a></h1><p>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has recently emerged as one of the most attractive methods for harvesting triplet states in metal-free organic materials for application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). A large number of TADF molecules have been reported in the literature with the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of OLEDs by converting non-emissive triplet states into emissive singlet states. TADF emitters are able to  both singlets and triplet states through fluorescence (prompt and delayed), the latter due to the thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing mechanism that allows up-conversion of low  triplet states to the emissive singlet level. This allows otherwise pure fluorescent OLEDs to overcome their intrinsic limit of 25% internal quantum efficiency (IQE), which is imposed by the 1:3 singlet-triplet ratio arising from the recombination of charges (electrons and holes). TADF based OLEDS with IQEs close to 100% are now routinely fabricated in the green spectral region. There is also significant progress for blue emitters. However, red emitters still show relatively low efficiencies. Despite the significant progress that has been made in recent years, still significant challenges persist to achieve full understanding of the TADF mechanism and improve the stability of these materials. These questions need to be solved in order to fully implement TADF in OLEDs and expand their application to other areas. To date, TADF has been exploited mainly in the field of OLEDs, but applications in other areas, such as sensing and fluorescence microscopies, are envisaged. In this review, the photophysics of TADF molecules is discussed, summarising current methods to characterise these materials and the current understanding of the TADF mechanism in various molecular systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671778>Live Traps for Adult Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs.</a></h1><p>Surveillance for detection of the brown marmorated stink bug, , is reliant on sticky panels with aggregation pheromone, which are low cost, but very inefficient (est. 3%). Trapping for adults was conducted in Italy with novel live (or lethal) traps consisting of aggregation pheromone-baited cylinders with a wind vane, with the upwind end covered by mesh and the downwind end sealed by a removable entry-only mesh cone, admitting the attracted bugs. The novel traps caught up to 15-times more adult  than identically-baited sticky panels in two weeks of daily checking (n = 6 replicates) (the new live traps were, in Run 1, -, 9-, 15-, 13-, 4-, 12-, 2-fold; and in Run 2, 7-, 1-, 3-, 7-, 6-, 6-, and -fold better than sticky traps, daily). The maximum catch of the new traps was 96 live adults in one trap in 24 h and the average improvement was ~7-fold compared with sticky panels. The rotating live traps, which exploit a mesh funnel facing the plume downwind that proved useful for collecting adults, could also be used to kill bugs. We expect that commercially-available traps could replace the crude prototypes we constructed quickly from local materials, at low cost, as long as the principles of a suitable plume structure were observed, as we discuss. The traps could be useful for the sterile insect technique, supporting rearing colonies, or to kill bugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27411261>Do biomass harvesting guidelines influence herpetofauna following harvests of logging residues for renewable ?.</a></h1><p>Forests are a major supplier of renewable ; however, gleaning logging residues for use as woody biomass feedstock could negatively alter habitat for species dependent on downed wood. Biomass Harvesting Guidelines (BHGs) recommend retaining a portion of woody biomass on the forest floor following . Despite BHGs being developed to help ensure ecological sustainability, their contribution to biodiversity has not been evaluated experimentally at operational scales. We compared herpetofauanal evenness, diversity, and richness and abundance of Anaxyrus terrestris and Gastrophryne carolinensis among six treatments that varied in volume and spatial arrangement of woody biomass retained after clearcutting loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in North Carolina, USA (n = 4), 2011-2014 and Georgia (n = 4), USA 2011-2013. Treatments were: (1) biomass  with no BHGs, (2) 15% retention with biomass clustered, (3) 15% retention with biomass dispersed, (4) 30% retention with biomass clustered, () 30% retention with biomass dispersed, and (6) no biomass . We captured individuals with drift fence arrays and compared evenness, diversity, and richness metrics among treatments with repeated-measure, linear mixed-effects models. We determined predictors of A. terrestris and G. carolinensis abundances using a priori candidate N-mixture models with woody biomass volume, vegetation structure, and groundcover composition as covariates. We had 206 captures of 25 reptile species and 8710 captures of 17 amphibian species during 53690 trap nights. Herpetofauna diversity, evenness, and richness were similar among treatments. A. terrestris abundance was negatively related to volume of retained woody biomass in treatment units in North Carolina in 2013. G. carolinensis abundance was positively related with volume of retained woody debris in treatment units in Georgia in 2012. Other relationships between A. terrestris and G. carolinensis abundances and habitat metrics were weak or absent. The lack of consistent community or population responses suggests the addition of a woody biomass  to a clearcut in pine plantations does not impact herpetofauna use of Coastal Plain loblolly plantations in the southeastern United States. We recommend additional research to examine relationships between woody biomass harvesting and rarer species or amphibians with high desiccation risk, particularly in other regions and harvesting systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28804476>Wood Ash Induced pH Changes Strongly Affect Soil Bacterial Numbers and Community Composition.</a></h1><p>Recirculation of wood ash from  production to forest soil improves the sustainability of this  production form as recycled wood ash contains nutrients that otherwise would be lost at . In addition, wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent acid-neutralizing capabilities. However, wood ash has several ecosystem-perturbing effects like increased soil pH and pore water electrical conductivity both known to strongly impact soil bacterial numbers and community composition. Studies investigating soil bacterial community responses to wood ash application remain sparse and the available results are ambiguous and remain at a general taxonomic level. Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce forest soil to wood ash addition corresponding to 0, , 22, and 167 t wood ash ha. We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria,  and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to wood ash application. Results showed that wood ash addition strongly increased soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic through neutral at 22 t ha to alkaline at 167 t ha. Bacterial numbers significantly increased up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha followed by significant decrease at 167 t ha wood ash. The soil bacterial community composition changed after wood ash application with copiotrophic bacteria responding positively up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha while the adverse effect was seen for oligotrophic bacteria. Marked changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a wood ash dose of 167 t ha with a single alkaliphilic genus dominating. Additionally, spore-formers became abundant at an ash dose of 167 t ha whereas this was not the case at lower ash doses. Lastly, bacterial richness and diversity strongly decreased with increasing amount of wood ash applied. All of the observed bacterial responses can be directly explained by the wood ash induced changes in pH, electrical conductivity and the addition of wood ash inherent nutrients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30104532>Investigation of Position Sensing and  Harvesting of a Flexible Triboelectric Touch Pad.</a></h1><p>Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a promising technology because it can   from the environment to enable self-sustainable mobile and wearable electronic devices. In this work, we present a flexible touch pad capable of detecting the contact location of an object and generating substantial  simultaneously based on the coupling of triboelectric effects and electrostatic induction. The touch pad consists of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin film, multiple Aluminum (Al) electrodes and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers, which can be achieved through low cost, simplified and scalable fabrication process. Different from the conventional multi-pixel-based positioning sensor (i.e., large array of sensing elements and electrodes), the analogue method proposed here is used to implement the positioning function with only four electrodes. Position location can achieve a detecting resolution of as small as 1.3 mm (the size of locating layer is 7. cm × 7. cm). For the  harvesting part, a multilayer structure is designed to provide higher current output. The open circuit voltage of the device is around 420 V and the short circuit current can reach up to 6.26 µA with current density of 0.25 µA/cm². The maximum output power obtained is approximately 10 mW, which is 0.4 mW/cm². The flexibility and significantly reduced number of electrodes enable the proposed touch pad to be readily integrated into portable electronic devices, such as intelligent robots, laptops, healthcare devices, and environmental surveys, etc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829889>Stability of annual biomass  production of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) genotypes in the Northern region of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this study were to estimate the stability of dry biomass production of elephant grass genotypes under an annual  regime, in soil-climatic conditions of the Northern region of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, and to compare methodologies for stability analyses of Yates and Cochran (YC), Plaisted and Peterson (PP), Annicchiarico (ANN), Lin and Binns (LB), Huenh (HU), and Kang and Phan (KP). A randomized block design with 83 treatments and two replicates was adopted. Four annual harvests were performed (2012-2015) and dry matter yield (DMY, t.ha.year) was evaluated. Individual and combined analyses of variance for DMY revealed significant effects for genotypes, harvests, and for the genotype x  interaction at the probability levels of 1 and %. Genotypes indicated by the YC and PP methods are associated with higher stability and lower DMY. The weighting of KP with YC and PP was highly effective in associating stability with DMY. The LB and ANN methods showed strong agreement with each other and produced similar classifications as to phenotypic stability, and so we recommend using one or the other.

However, the status of PAHs in winter wheat grains from the areas influenced by coal combustion in China was still not clear. During  season, the winter wheat grains were collected from agricultural fields surrounding coal-fired power plants located in Shaanxi and Henan Provinces. This study found that the mean concentrations of 15 priority PAHs ranged from 69.58 to 557.0μgkg. Three-ring PAHs (acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene) were dominant in the grains, accounting for approximately 70-81% of the total PAHs. The bioaccessibility of low molecular weight (LMW, 2-3 ring) PAHs (51.1-52.8%), high molecular weight (HMW, 4-6 ring) PAHs (19.8-27.6%) and total PAHs (40.9-48.0%) in the intestinal condition was significantly (p<0.001) higher than that (37.4-38.6%; 15.6-22.%; 30.7-35.%) in the gastric condition, respectively. Based on total PAHs, the values of incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for children, adolescents, adults and seniors were all higher than the baseline value (10) and some even fell in the range of 10-10, which indicated that most grains from the areas affected by coal combustion possessed considerable cancer risk. The present study also indicated that the children were the age group most sensitive to PAHs contamination. The pilot research provided relevant information for the regulation of PAHs in the winter wheat grains and for the safety of the agro-products growing in the PAHs-contaminated areas.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since light incidence is limited to the surface, water depth can affect microalgal growth in HRAP. To investigate the effect of water depth on microalgal growth, a mixed microalgal culture constituting three major strains of microalgae including  sp.,  sp., and  sp. (CSS), was grown at different water depths (20, 30, and 40 cm) in the HRAP, respectively. The HRAP with 20cm of water depth had about 38% higher biomass productivity per unit area (6.16 ± 0.33 g·m⁻²·d⁻¹) and required lower nutrients and  consumption than the other water depths. Specifically, the algal biomass of HRAP under 20c m of water depth had higher settleability through larger floc size (83.6% settleability within  min). These results indicate that water depth can affect the harvesting process as well as cultivation of microalgae. Therefore, we conclude that water depth is an important parameter in HRAP design for mass cultivation of microalgae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480316>Identification and Toxigenic Potential of Fungi Isolated from  Peppers.</a></h1><p> peppers are among the most popular horticultural crops produced and consumed worldwide.

The uniform incorporation of Bi₂O₃ contributes to largely enhancing the solar light absorption and photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO₂ nanotubes. Due to the  level difference between Bi₂O₃ and TiO₂, the built-in electric field is suggested to be formed in the Bi₂O₃ sensitized TiO₂ hybrid, which effectively separates the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and hence improves the photocatalytic activity. It is also found that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of Bi₂O₃ sensitized TiO₂ nanotubes is not in direct proportion with the content of the sensitizer, Bi₂O₃, which should be carefully controlled to realize excellent photoelectrical properties. With a narrower  band gap relative to TiO₂, the sensitizer Bi₂O₃ can efficiently  the solar  to generate electrons and holes, while TiO₂ collects and transports the charge carriers.

Knowledge of the impact of altitude on the gut microbiota of European mouflon () and blue sheep () is currently limited. In this study, we compared the characteristics of gut microbiota in  mouflon at low altitude (K group), 4 mouflon at high altitude (L group), 4 blue sheep at low altitude (M group), and 4 blue sheep at high altitude (N group). The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. Analyses based on the operational taxonomic units showed significant changes in the gut microbial communities between groups at different altitudes. At the phylum level, groups at the high altitudes had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and a lower relative abundance of Bacteroidetes than those at the low altitudes. A higher Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio is beneficial to animals in terms of the gut microbiota-mediated  . The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the gut microbiota of mouflon sheep at high altitudes. At the genus level, the  ratio was significantly higher in the low-altitude group (than the high-altitude group) of mouflon sheep and the ratio was significantly higher in the high-altitude group (than the low-altitude group) in blue sheep. In addition, the  related to cellulose and starch digestion was the predominant genus in blue sheep and the relative abundance of the genus was significant higher in the high-altitude group than the low-altitude group of blue sheep ( < 0.01). In conclusion, our results suggested that the gut microbiota of high-altitude groups of sheep had stronger abilities related to  metabolism and the decomposition of substances, e.g., fiber and cellulose, and that such abilities are associated with high-altitude adaptation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098054>Bile salt hydrolases: Structure and function, substrate preference, and inhibitor development.</a></h1><p>The worldwide trend of limiting the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in animal production creates challenges for the animal feed industry, thus necessitating the development of effective non-antibiotic alternatives to improve animal performance.

Mechanical  harvesting through piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators (PENG and TENG) is a promising approach due to their light weight, low cost, and high-power density in comparison to other technologies. Both types of generators are capable of charging portable and smart devices on their own by converting mechanical  into electricity. However, most previous methods have excessive input conditions, such as high rpm and input frequency, that can be only applied with other actuators. Here, a hand-held gyroscopic generator is presented that uses the gyroscopic principle to reach a rotation rate above 8000 rpm with only hand input. The generator comprises a rotating flywheel inside a casing.

Recent work has shown that spatial heterogeneity in resource phenology can buffer mobile consumers from this constraint by allowing them to track changes in resource availability across space. For example, salmon populations spawn asynchronously across watersheds, causing high-quality foraging opportunities to propagate across the landscape, prolonging the availability of salmon at the regional scale. However, we know little about how individual consumers integrate across phenological variation or the benefits they receive by doing so. Here, we present direct evidence that individual brown bears track spatial variation in salmon phenology. Data from 40 GPS collared brown bears show that bears visited multiple spawning sites in synchrony with the order of spawning phenology. The number of sites used was correlated with the number of days a bear exploited salmon, suggesting the phenological variation in the study area influenced bear access to salmon, a resource which strongly influences bear fitness. Fisheries managers attempting to maximize  while maintaining ecosystem function should strive to protect the population diversity that underlies the phenological variation used by wildlife consumers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27525474>Rapid water disinfection using vertically aligned MoS nanofilms and visible light.</a></h1><p>Solar  is readily available in most climates and can be used for water purification. However, solar disinfection of drinking water mostly relies on ultraviolet light, which represents only 4% of the total solar , and this leads to a slow treatment speed. Therefore, the development of new materials that can  visible light for water disinfection, and so speed up solar water purification, is highly desirable. Here we show that few-layered vertically aligned MoS (FLV-MoS) films can be used to  the whole spectrum of visible light (∼50% of solar ) and achieve highly efficient water disinfection. The bandgap of MoS was increased from 1.3 to 1.55 eV by decreasing the domain size, which allowed the FLV-MoS to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for bacterial inactivation in the water. The FLV-MoS showed a ∼15 times better log inactivation efficiency of the indicator bacteria compared with that of bulk MoS, and a much faster inactivation of bacteria under both visible light and sunlight illumination compared with the widely used TiO. Moreover, by using a  nm copper film on top of the FLV-MoS as a catalyst to facilitate electron-hole pair separation and promote the generation of ROS, the disinfection rate was increased a further sixfold. With our approach, we achieved water disinfection of >99.999% inactivation of bacteria in 20 min with a small amount of material (1.6 mg l) under simulated visible light.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28769057>Enhancing Modulation of Thermal Conduction in Vanadium Dioxide Thin Film by Nanostructured Nanogaps.</a></h1><p>Efficient thermal management at the nanoscale is important for reducing  consumption and dissipation in electronic devices, lab-on-a-chip platforms and  /conversion systems. For many of these applications, it is much desired to have a solid-state structure that reversibly switches thermal conduction with high ON/OFF ratios and at high speed.

The common management practice for the region is to  the first growth of hay by cutting at 2.-7. cm height in May or June. We hypothesize that high temperature and low cutting height interact to limit the regrowth rate. To test this, orchardgrass plants were cut to either 2. or 7. cm and then placed into environmentally controlled chambers with a constant temperature of 20 or 35°C. Stubble was harvested on days 0, 1, 3, and 11 following cutting and subjected to metabolite analysis. Photosynthetic parameters were measured in the regrown leaves on days 3 and 11, and regrowth biomass was recorded on day 11. Under optimal growth temperature (20°C), vegetative regrowth upon defoliation was significantly enhanced when more stubble tissue remained. However, this advantage was not observed under heat stress. Defoliation generally decreases the abundance of carbohydrate reserves in stubble. Interestingly, high temperature stimulated the accumulation of starch and ethanol-soluble carbohydrates in plants cut to 7. cm. The similar trends were also observed in protein, amino acids, nitrate, and ammonium. These responses were not pronounced in plants cut to 2. cm, presumably due to inhibited photosynthesis and photosystem II photochemistry. Overall, we anticipated that heat-activated metabolite accumulation is part of adaptive response to the stress. However, modified allocation of carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves leads to reduced vegetative regrowth upon defoliation. These data suggest that cutting height management for orchardgrass may be more effective for its regrowth vigor and productivity in cool seasons or when cool weather follows hay .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30015628>Self-powered wearable sensing-textiles for real-time detecting environmental atmosphere and body motion based on surface-triboelectric coupling effect.</a></h1><p>Self-powered wearable sensing-textiles for real-time detecting environmental atmosphere and body motion have been presented. The textile is based on highly-stretchable conductive ecoflex fiber modified with multiwall carbon nanotube and polyaniline (PANI) derivatives (acting as one electrode). The surface of the fiber is twined with varnished wire (acting as the other electrode). Upon applied deformation of stretching or bending, the sensing-textile can  the mechanical  and output electric signals through the triboelectrification effect between PANI and varnished wire. After being attached on the human body, the triboelectric output of the sensing-textile can be used to monitor body motion, including finger bending and body stretching. Interestingly, the triboelectric output of the sensing-textile is significantly dependent on the atmosphere, which can actively distinguish different gas species in the environment. The sensitivity, stability and selectivity against ethanol, ammonia, acetone and formaldehyde are high. The response against 400 ppm ethanol vapor at room temperature is up to 54.73%. The current density is 2.1 × 10 A m, and the power density is 4.2 × 10 W m. During both the motion detecting and gas sensing processes, no external electricity power is needed. The triboelectric signal can be treated as not only the sensing signal but also the power source for driving the device. The working mechanism is based on surface-triboelectric coupling effect. The present results can promote the development of self-powered wearable electronics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29588448>Increasing biomass demand enlarges negative forest nutrient budget areas in wood export regions.</a></h1><p> production from biomass is one of the adopted strategies in different European countries to limit global warming to within the 1.-2° targets after the 2015 UN climate agreement. This will motivate enhanced forest  rates and whole tree  to supply the increasing biomass demand. Negative nutrient budgets for certain timberland areas where geogenic nutrient supply cannot cope with harvesting rates will be one consequence. A spatially explicit analysis for a U.S. timberland area of 33,570 km reveals that for a minimum nutrient loss and supply scenario, negative nutrient budgets occur in 17, 20, 16, and almost 94% of the studied areas for Ca, K, Mg, and P, respectively. For a maximum nutrient loss (considering intensive harvesting) and supply assumptions, the affected areas increase to 50, 57, 45 and 96% for Ca, K, Mg, and P, respectively. In general, atmospheric nutrient deposition is of minor importance for the high weathering supply cases. Increasing global woody biomass demand may cause additional pressure on forested ecosystems, enlarging negative nutrient budget areas. If woody biomass demand rises, strategies to counterbalance nutrient gaps might be needed, for example, by preparing harvested areas with rock products, designed to replenish growth limiting nutrients, and/or implementing forest management strategies to minimize nutrient export.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28390422>High-fat feeding rather than obesity drives taxonomical and functional changes in the gut microbiota in mice.</a></h1><p>It is well known that the microbiota of high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice differs from that of lean mice, but to what extent, this difference reflects the obese state or the diet is unclear. To dissociate changes in the gut microbiota associated with high HF feeding from those associated with obesity, we took advantage of the different susceptibility of C57BL/6JBomTac (BL6) and 129S6/SvEvTac (Sv129) mice to diet-induced obesity and of their different responses to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, where inhibition of COX activity in BL6 mice prevents HF diet-induced obesity, but in Sv129 mice accentuates obesity.Using HiSeq-based whole genome sequencing, we identified taxonomic and functional differences in the gut microbiota of the two mouse strains fed regular low-fat or HF diets with or without supplementation with the COX-inhibitor, indomethacin. HF feeding rather than obesity development led to distinct changes in the gut microbiota. We observed a robust increase in alpha diversity, gene count, abundance of genera known to be butyrate producers, and abundance of genes involved in butyrate production in Sv129 mice compared to BL6 mice fed either a LF or a HF diet. Conversely, the abundance of genes involved in propionate metabolism, associated with increased  , was higher in BL6 mice than Sv129 mice.The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota were predominantly driven by high-fat feeding rather than reflecting the obese state of the mice. Differences in the abundance of butyrate and propionate producing bacteria in the gut may at least in part contribute to the observed differences in obesity propensity in Sv129 and BL6 mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586231>Silicon Nanowire/Polymer Hybrid Solar Cell-Supercapacitor: A Self-Charging Power Unit with a Total Efficiency of 10..</a></h1><p>An integrated self-charging power unit, combining a hybrid silicon nanowire/polymer heterojunction solar cell with a polypyrrole-based supercapacitor, has been demonstrated to simultaneously  solar  and store it.

Magneto-photoluminescence studies reveal that the triplet-to-singlet conversion in exciplexes involves an artificially generated spin-orbital coupling (SOC). The photoinduced electron parametric resonance measurements indicate that the intermolecular charge-transfer occurs with forming electric dipoles (D →A ), providing the ionic polarization to generate SOC in exciplexes. By having different singlet-triplet  differences (ΔE ) in 9,9'-diphenyl-9H,9'H-3,3'-bicarbazole (BCzPh):3',3'″,3'″″-(1,3,-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(([1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carbonitrile)) (CN-T2T) (ΔE = 30 meV) and BCzPh:bis-4,6-(3,-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methyl-pyrimidine (B3PYMPM) (ΔE = 130 meV) exciplexes, the SOC generated by the intermolecular charge-transfer states shows large and small values (reflected by different internal magnetic parameters: 274 vs 17 mT) with high and low external quantum efficiency maximum, EQE (21.05% vs 4.89%), respectively. To further explore the cooperative relationship of spin, , and polarization parameters, different photoluminescence wavelengths are selected to concurrently change SOC, ΔE , and polarization while monitoring delayed fluorescence. When the electron clouds become more deformed at a longer emitting wavelength due to reduced dipole (D →A ) size, enhanced SOC, increased orbital polarization, and decreased ΔE can simultaneously occur to cooperatively operate the triplet-to-singlet conversion.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This paper innovatively proposes a stretchable nanocomposite nanogenerator with good transparency that can be conformally attached to the human body to  biomechanical  and monitor physiological signals. The work reports an innovative device that uses sprayed silver nanowires as transparent electrodes and sandwiches a nanocomposite of piezoelectric BaTiO and polydimethylsiloxane as the sensing layer, which exhibits good transparency and mechanical transformability with stretchable, foldable, and twistable properties. The highly flexible nanogenerator affords a good input-output linearity under the vertical force and the sensing ability to detect lateral stretching deformation up to 60% strain under piezoelectric mechanisms. Furthermore, the proposed device can effectively  touch energies from the human body as a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator. Under periodic contact and separation, a maximum output voltage of 105 V, a current density of 6. μA/cm, and a power density of 102 μW/cm can be achieved, exhibiting a good power generation performance. Owing to the high conformability and excellent sensitivity of the nanogenerator, it can also act as a self-powered wearable sensor attached to different parts of the human body for real-time monitoring of the human physiological signals such as eye blinking, pronunciation, arm movement, and radial artery pulse.

Moench] is a viable alternative to corn silage (Zea mays L.) in double cropping rotations with forage winter cereals in New York due to a later planting date and potentially earlier  date of forage sorghum than is typical for corn silage. Our objective was to determine whether  of brachytic dwarf brown midrib forage sorghum can take place before the currently recommended soft dough  time while maintaining dry matter (DM) yield, forage nutritive value, and total mixed ration performance. Seven trials were conducted on 2 research farms in central New York from 2014 to 2017. Forage sorghum received 1 of 2 fertilizer N rates at planting (112 and 224 kg of N/ha). Stands were harvested at boot, flower, milk, and soft dough stages. Forage samples were analyzed for nutritive value and substituted for corn silage in a typical dairy total mixed ration at varying amounts using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. Timing of  affected yield and forage nutritive value for each individual trial and across trials, and the effects were independent of N fertilizer application rate. Averaged across trials, yield ranged from 10.7 Mg of DM/ha for the boot stage to 13., 15.2, and 15.8 Mg of DM/ha for the flower, milk, and soft dough stages, respectively. For individual trials, yield either remained constant with  beyond the flower stage (4 trials), or beyond the milk stage (1 trial), whereas for 2 trials yield increased up to the soft dough stage. At the later  stages, DM, starch, and nonfiber carbohydrates were increased, whereas crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and 30-h neutral detergent fiber digestibility were decreased. Without adjusting for DM intake, substitution of corn silage by forage sorghum harvested at the soft dough stage resulted in stable predicted metabolizable  allowable milk, whereas the reduced starch content of earlier harvested sorghum resulted in less metabolizable  allowable milk with greater substitution of corn silage for sorghum. Forage sorghum can be harvested as early as the flower or milk stage without losing DM yield, allowing for timely planting of forage winter cereal in a double cropping rotation. However,  supplementation in the diet is needed to make up for reduced starch concentrations with  of sorghum at flower and milk growth stages.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of feeding minimally refined cottonseed oil or crude glycerol on growth performance, carcass composition, and fat quality of growing-finishing pigs. Mixed sex pigs ( = 216; 24 ± 4 kg initial BW) were blocked by BW and allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments: 1) a basal corn-soybean meal diet with 40% DDGS (CON), 2) CON diet plus % minimally refined cottonseed oil added throughout the experiment (COT), or 3) CON fed during the first 8 wk and CON + 8% crude glycerol fed during the last 6 wk of the experiment (GLY). Although diets were not isocaloric, total AA-to-ME ratios were calculated to be equal among diets. Carcass composition was estimated using real-time ultrasound 2 d before . Gilts (16/treatment) closest to the mean BW of each pen were harvested (115 ± 8 kg BW), and bellies were retrieved for in-depth analysis of fat quality. Belly fat was sampled and analyzed for fatty acid composition. Overall, ADFI of pigs fed COT (2.30 kg/d) was less ( < 0.01) than that of pigs fed CON or GLY (2.47 and 2.49 kg/d, respectively). Pigs fed COT (0.93 kg/d) had greater ( < 0.01) ADG compared with pigs fed CON or GLY (0.88 and 0.87 kg/d, respectively). Greater ( < 0.01) G:F was observed for pigs fed COT (0.41) than for pigs fed CON or GLY diets (0.36 and 0.35, respectively). Final BW of pigs fed COT (124.3 kg) was greater ( < 0.01) than that of pigs fed CON or GLY (118.9 and 118.6 kg, respectively). Pigs fed COT had greater ( < 0.01) HCW (94.9 kg) compared with pigs fed CON or GLY (89.9 and 89.2 kg, respectively). No differences were observed for dressing percentage (75.7, 76.3, and 75.3%), fat-free carcass lean percentage (50., 49.7, and 50.0%), and belly flop angle (6.21, 8.57, and 6.06°) for CON, COT, and GLY, respectively. Pigs assigned to COT had higher ( < 0.01) melting point of belly fat compared with pigs assigned to CON or GLY (30.4 vs. 26.3 and 25.3°C, respectively). Pigs fed COT had increased ( < 0.05) SFA, PUFA, and iodine value (IV) compared with CON-fed pigs. Glycerol supplementation had no influence on SFA, MUFA, and PUFA concentrations or IV of belly, jowl, and back fat compared with CON. In conclusion, COT diets improved growth performance due to greater  density, but carcass composition was not affected by treatments. In this experiment, feeding neither COT nor GLY improved fat firmness of pigs fed diets containing 40% DDGS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727080>Management of native warm-season grasses for beef cattle and biomass production in the Mid-South USA.</a></h1><p>Native grasses, such as switchgrass (SG; L.), big bluestem (BB; Vitman), indiangrass (IG; Nash), and eastern gamagrass (EG; [L.] L.) may be capable of providing desirable summer forage for cattle as well as a source of biomass for renewable . To evaluate that potential, experiments were conducted at 2 locations in Tennessee comparing weaned beef () steers (268 ± 25 kg initial BW) during early-season grazing (Early; 30 d, typically corresponding to May, followed by postdormancy biomass ) and full-season grazing (Full, mean duration = 98 d). For Exp. 1, which compared SG, a blend of BB and IG (BBIG), and EG, ADG was greater ( < 0.05) for BBIG (1.02 kg/d) than SG (0.85 kg/d), and both were greater ( < 0.05) than EG (0.66 kg/d). Grazing days for SG and EG were similar (389 and 423 animal unit days [AUD]/ha, respectively) and exceeded ( < 0.05) that of BBIG (233 AUD/ha) during Full. In Exp. 2 (SG and BBIG only), rates of gain were comparable to that of Exp. 1, but AUD were 425 (SG) and 299 (BBIG) AUD/ha. Such rates of gain and grazing days indicate that these grasses can provide desirable summer forage for growing cattle. Early produced 211 to 324 kg BW gain/ha, depending on experiment and forage, followed by dormant-season harvests of 7. to 10. Mg/ha of biomass, indicating a potential for beef cattle forage and biomass production on the same land resource. Native grasses provided productive summer pasture and good rates of gain on growing cattle and could contribute to forage programs, especially where cool-season grasses currently predominate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26910954>Impact of forestry practices at a landscape scale on the dynamics of amphibian populations.</a></h1><p>Forest loss is a primary cause of worldwide amphibian decline. Timber harvesting in the United States has caused dramatic changes in quality and extent of forest ecosystems, and intensive forest management still occurs. Although numerous studies have documented substantial reductions in amphibian densities related to timber , subsequent extinctions are rare. To better understand the population dynamics that have allowed so many amphibian species to persist in the face of widespread forest disturbance, we developed spatially explicit metapopulation models for four forest-dependent amphibian species (Lithobates sylvaticus, Ambystoma opacum, A. talpoideum, and A. maculatum) that incorporated demographic and habitat selection data derived from experiments conducted as part of the Land Use Effects on Amphibian Populations Project (LEAP). We projected local and landscape-scale population persistence under 108 different forestry practice scenarios, varying treatment (partial cut, clear-cut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, and clearcut with CWD retained), cut patch size (1, 10, or 50 ha), total area cut (10, 20, or 30%), and initial amphibian population size (, 50, or 500 adult females per local breeding population). Under these scenarios, landscape-scale extinction was highly unlikely, occurring in < 1% of model runs and for only 2 of the 4 species, because landscape-scale populations were able to persist via dispersal even despite frequent local extinctions. Yet for all species, population sizes were reduced to -50% in all clear-cut scenarios, regardless of the size of harvested patches. These findings suggest that debate over timber harvesting on pool-breeding amphibian populations in the United States should focus not on questions of landscape-scale extinction but on the ecological consequences of dramatic reductions in amphibian biomass, including changes in trophic interactions, nutrient cycling, and  transfer. Additionally, we conclude that amphibian declines and extinctions are far more likely to occur as a result of permanent habitat loss resulting from development than from the temporary degradation of habitat caused by current forestry practices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30701595>Metal-Organic Frameworks Based Nano/Micro/Millimeter-Sized Self-Propelled Autonomous Machines.</a></h1><p>Synthetic nano/micro/millimeter-sized machines that   from the surrounding environment and then convert it to motion have had a significant impact on many research areas such as biology (sensing, imaging, and therapy) and environmental applications.

While these effects can have serious consequences for the viability of fish populations, there are also a range of traits not directly related to body size which could also affect susceptibility to capture by fishing gears-and therefore fisheries-induced evolution (FIE)-but which have to date been ignored. For example, overlooked within the context of FIE is the likelihood that variation in physiological traits could make some individuals within species more vulnerable to capture. Specifically, traits related to  balance (e.g., metabolic rate), swimming performance (e.g., aerobic scope), neuroendocrinology (e.g., stress responsiveness) and sensory physiology (e.g., visual acuity) are especially likely to influence vulnerability to capture through a variety of mechanisms. Selection on these traits could produce major shifts in the physiological traits within populations in response to fishing pressure that are yet to be considered but which could influence population resource requirements, resilience, species' distributions and responses to environmental change.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511853>Bitter Taste Impact and Thermal Conversion of a Naringenin Glycoside from Cyclopia genistoides.</a></h1><p>A naringenin derivative, isolated from Cyclopia genistoides, a bitter tasting herbal tea, especially when in green (unoxidized) form, was identified as (2 S)--[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy]naringenin (1). The compound partially epimerizes to (2 R)--[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy]naringenin (2) when heated at different temperatures (80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 °C) for a prolonged period in a phosphate buffer at pH . The fractional conversion model predicted the decrease in the concentration of compound 1 the best. The activation  of the conversion reaction was calculated as 99.16 kJ mol. Prolonged heating resulted not only in formation of compound 2 but eventually a decrease in its concentration and the formation of another conversion product, ( E)-2'-[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy]-4',6',4-trihydroxychalcone (3). In contrast, naringin, glycosylated at C-7, remained stable when heated under the same conditions (100 °C for 6 h at pH ). The bitter intensity of compound 1 was substantially less than that of naringin, both tested at 0.04 mM, a concentration typical of compound 1 in an herbal tea infusion of green C. genistoides. This comparison indicates that the position of the sugar moiety plays an important role in determining both bitter intensity and heat stability of naringenin glycosides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866505>Spatiotemporal Rule of Heat Transfer on a Soil/Finned Tube Interface.</a></h1><p>To efficiently  environmental micro- from shallow soil, simulated analysis, theoretical arithmetic and experimental verification are performed to explore the spatiotemporal rules of heat transfer on a soil/finned tube interface. Simulations are carried out for 36 types of different working conditions, and the empirical formulas for temperature and heat flux are obtained. The temperature and heat flux can be calculated using the formulas if the soil temperature, soil moisture content and finned tube initial temperature are known. The simulations also show that the highest heat flux can reach approximately 0.30 mW/mm², and approximately 1507.96 mW of  can be harvested through the finned tube. Theoretical arithmetic indicates that the heat transfer rate of the copper finned tube is 76.77% higher than that of the bare tube, the highest rate obtained in any study to date. Results also show that the finned tube should be placed where the soil moisture is greater than 30% to get more heat from the soil. A field experiment is carried out in the city of Harbin in Northeast China, where a thermoelectric power generation device has been installed and temperature data have been monitored for a certain time. The results are in good agreement with those obtained from the simulation analysis. The heat transfer processes and heat transfer steady state on the soil/finned tube interface are revealed in this work and are of great importance for the use of geothermal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31457093>Microbial rhodopsins are major contributors to the solar  captured in the sea.</a></h1><p>All known phototrophic metabolisms on Earth rely on one of three categories of -converting pigments: chlorophyll- (rarely -), bacteriochlorophyll- (rarely -), and retinal, which is the chromophore in rhodopsins. While the significance of chlorophylls in solar  capture has been studied for decades, the contribution of retinal-based phototrophy to this process remains largely unexplored. We report the first vertical distributions of the three -converting pigments measured along a contrasting nutrient gradient through the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The highest rhodopsin concentrations were observed above the deep chlorophyll- maxima, and their geographical distribution tended to be inversely related to that of chlorophyll-. We further show that proton-pumping proteorhodopsins potentially absorb as much light  as chlorophyll--based phototrophy and that this  is sufficient to sustain bacterial basal metabolism. This suggests that proteorhodopsins are a major -transducing mechanism to  solar  in the surface ocean.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189962>A Multi-Frequencies Micro-Electromagnetic Vibration  Harvester with Nonlinearity for Expanding the Frequency Band.</a></h1><p>In this paper, we proposed a multi-frequencies electromagnetic vibration  harvester (EVEH) with a wider operating frequency band. The EVEH contains three different vibration picking-up systems with different natural frequencies. A broadened bandwidth was obtained by combining the structural nonlinearity of the vibration picking-up systems with the multi-frequencies, while the vibration   was increased by adopting two induction coils in the EVEH system. At an acceleration of 1.5g and frequencies of 45.6, 75 and 146. Hz, the peak-peak voltages of the prototype were 336, 270 and 39.8 mV, respectively.

Cultivated in Outdoor Photobioreactors.</a></h1><p>Microalgae-derived oils have potential as a biofuel feedstock. To produce microalgal oils at a large scale, large amounts of nutrients and  are needed to grow the algae. In this study, we evaluated three types of agricultural fertilizer (AF)-based culture media (AF1, AF2, and AF3) based on a previously published enriched seawater (ES) medium to produce biomass and oils from Thalassiosira sp. Under laboratory conditions, the highest cell productivity of Thalassiosira sp. was obtained with the AF3 medium. Thalassiosira sp. cultured in the AF3 medium produced 10.4 ± 0.9 mg L dayoils, which is significantly higher than the .8 ± 0.7 mg L dayproduced in the ES medium. The higher production was due to the presence of nitrate and trace elements, both of which played roles in enhancing biomass and oil content, respectively. During cell growth, resting spores appeared inside the cells and were a marker to  the cells. Because of the abundant availability of sunlight in the tropics during the year, the oil production of Thalassiosira sp. in the AF3 medium was scaled up using outdoor photobioreactors under different weather conditions (rainy and dry seasons). Thalassiosira sp. produced more unsaturated fatty acids during the rainy season and produced more saturated fatty acids during the dry season. This study also demonstrated that it was possible to culture Thalassiosira sp. under outdoor conditions using a low-cost agricultural fertilizer-based culture medium (AF3 medium) to produce biodiesel feedstock with an annual production of 8.1 ± 0.4 t ha during the dry season and of 23.9 ± 6.8 t ha during the rainy season.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214696>Unraveling the influence of the COD/sulfate ratio on organic matter removal and methane production from the biodigestion of sugarcane vinasse.</a></h1><p>Throughout the sugarcane , it is common for sulfate to accumulate in the vinasse of sugar and ethanol plants. However, little is known regarding the influence of sulfate on the anaerobic digestion (AD) of vinasse, which may lead to severe performance losses. This study assessed the influence of various COD/sulfate ratios (12.0, 10.0 and 7.) on both COD removal and methane (CH) production from sugarcane vinasse AD. Batch assays were conducted in thermophilic conditions. At a COD/sulfate ratio of 7., CH production was 35% lower compared with a ratio of 12.0, considering a diversion of approximately 13.6% of the electron flow to sulfidogenesis. The diversion of electrons to sulfidogenesis was negligible at COD/sulfate ratios higher than 25, considering the exponential increase in CH production. Organic matter degradation was not greatly affected by sulfidogenesis, with COD removal levels higher than 80%, regardless of the initial COD/sulfate ratio.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the infrared (IR) regime, 2D BP materials can  electromagnetic  due to losses derived from its surface conductivity. In this paper, we propose an IR absorber design comprising 2D BP metamaterials sandwiched between dielectric layers. The multilayered sandwich-like absorber structure is mounted on a full reflective gold mirror, which forms a Fabry-Perot resonator to strengthen light-matter interactions. Harvested surface plasmons are excited around the 2D BP metamaterial edges, and the incident IR light can be efficiently dissipated by increasing the number of layers of the sandwich-like structure (NLSS). The physical absorption mechanism can be attributed to the destructive interference from the metamaterials, which can be enhanced with increasing NLSS. Here, a phase difference of about 180° is obtained between the directly reflected wave from the first interface and the emergent wave derived from the superposition of the multiple reflections among the resonator, and the amplitude of the emergent wave is steadily reduced to a value close to that of the directly reflected wave with increasing NLSS for incident transverse-magnetic polarized IR illumination.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28295389>Proximate, amino acid and lipid compositions in Sinonovacula constricta (Lamarck) reared at different salinities.</a></h1><p>Sinonovacula constricta is an economically and nutritionally important bivalve native to the estuaries and mudflats of China, Japan and Korea. In the present study, S. constricta, cultured either under experimental conditions or collected directly from natural coastal areas with different seawater salinities, was investigated for changes in proximates, amino acids and lipids.When culture salinity was increased, levels of moisture, carbohydrate, crude protein and crude lipid were significantly decreased, whereas the level of ash was significantly increased. The level of Ala was increased by 1.- to 2-fold, whereas the contents of most lipids were significantly decreased, and the proportion of phosphatidylethanolamine was significantly increased. Notably, a high proportion of ceramide aminoethylphosphonates was detected in S. constricta reared at all salinities. The  content appears to be higher in S. constricta reared at higher salinity. In experimental S. constricta, when the salinity was enhanced, the changes of compositions were very close to those reared at constant high salinity.Sinonovacula constricta reared at higher salinities possesses a superior quality. A short period of exposure to a higher salinity for farmed S. constricta reared at a lower salinity before  would be useful with respect to improving its nutritive value. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007724>Characterization of  cell wall polymers.</a></h1><p>Efficient utilization of lignocellulosic  biomass for the production of biochemicals, such as ethanol, is challenging due to its recalcitrance, which is influenced by the individual plant cell wall polymers and their interactions. Lignocellulosic biomass composition differs depending on several factors, such as plant age,  date, organ type, and genotype. Here, four selected  genotypes (, ,  × ,  ×  hybrid) were grown and harvested, separated into stems and leaves, and characterized for their non-starch polysaccharide composition and structures, lignin contents and structures, and hydroxycinnamate profiles (monomers and ferulic acid dehydrodimers). Polysaccharides of all genotypes are mainly composed of cellulose and low-substituted arabinoxylans. Ratios of hemicelluloses to cellulose were comparable, with the exception of  that showed a higher hemicellulose/cellulose ratio. Lignin contents of  stems were higher than those of  leaves. Considering the same organs, the four genotypes did not differ in their Klason lignin contents, but  ×  showed the highest acetylbromide soluble lignin content. Lignin polymers isolated from stems varied in their S/G ratios and linkage type distributions across genotypes. -Coumaric acid was the most abundant ester-bound hydroxycinnamte monomer in all samples. Ferulic acid dehydrodimers were analyzed as cell wall cross-links, with 8--coupled diferulic acid being the main dimer, followed by 8-O-4-, and --diferulic acid. Contents of -coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and ferulic acid dimers varied depending on genotype and organ type.

More interestingly, the water droplets can be reversibly dried nonthermally with the pad at ambient temperature in humid air (∼85% RH) by applying a positive electric bias of +1. to +15 V. The harvesting and drying rates on the glass are 2.7 and 1. μm/s under biases of -15 and +15 V, respectively, but no apparent harvesting or drying activities are observed without the bias. The  consumption is minimal as there is no Joule current due to the insulative substrate. It is shown that substrate wettability and ions play an important role in enabling the fast water harvesting and nonthermal drying. Molecular modeling is developed to understand the harvesting and drying mechanisms at the atomic scale. The water harvesting/drying approach may be useful for many technological applications such as micro/nanolithography, 3D printing, MEMS, and biochemical and microfluid devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031578>Effects of growth stage and growing degree day accumulations on triticale forages: 1. Dry matter yield, nutritive value, and in vitro dry matter disappearance.</a></h1><p>The use of triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) in dairy-cropping systems has expanded greatly in recent years, partly to improve land stewardship by providing winter ground cover. Our objective was to establish relationships relating indices of nutritive value with growth stage or accumulated growing degree days >°C for triticale forages grown in central Wisconsin. Replicated 3.7-m × 9.1-m plots were established following removal of corn for silage (fall 2015) and soybeans (fall 2016) and then harvested at various growth stages the following spring. Plants were assigned a numerical growth stage based on a linear staging system suitable for use as an independent regression variable. Response variables [e.g., dry matter (DM) yield, indices of nutritive value, and parameters from in vitro DM disappearance kinetics] were regressed on growth stage and growing degree days using linear, quadratic, cubic, or quartic models. For spring 2016, the mean DM yield at the boot stage (3,804 kg of DM/ha) was only 30% of that observed at the soft dough stage of growth (12,642 kg of DM/ha). Although yields were reduced during spring 2017, primarily due to spring flooding, the relationship between respective yields at these growth stages was similar (1,453 vs. ,399 kg of DM/ha). Regressions of DM yield (kg/ha) on growth stage for 2016 were explained by a cubic model (Y = 0.0663x - 9.44x + 595x - 9,810) compared with a simple linear response for 2017 (Y = 103x - 3,024); in both cases, coefficients of determination were very high (R ≥ 0.934). Many nutritional and in vitro DM disappearance characteristics were affected by the juxtaposition and balance of 2 generally competing factors: (1) increased concentrations of structural plant fiber coupled with concurrent lignification as plants matured and (2) the accumulation of highly digestible carbohydrate during seed head development. A comparison of respective  yields between the boot and soft dough stages of growth for 2016 (2,488 vs. 8,141 kg of total digestible nutrients/ha) and 2017 (1,033 vs. 3,520 kg of total digestible nutrients/ha) suggests that yields of  are greater at soft dough stage and are mostly driven by DM yield. An informed  management decision for lactating cows may still favor a boot-stage  because of superior nutritional characteristics, a need to plant double-cropped corn expeditiously, or both.  timing of triticale forages for other livestock classes would appear to be more flexible, but prioritizing a subsequent double crop may reduce the effects on DM yield to a secondary consideration.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Probiotics and/or prebiotics could be a promising approach to improve insulin sensitivity by favourably modifying the composition of the gut microbial community, reducing intestinal endotoxin concentrations and decreasing  . The aim of the present review was to investigate the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics) on insulin resistance in human clinical trials and to discuss the potential mechanisms whereby probiotics and prebiotics improve glucose metabolism. The anti-diabetic effects of probiotics include reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines via a NF-κB pathway, reduced intestinal permeability, and lowered oxidative stress. SCFA play a key role in glucose homeostasis through multiple potential mechanisms of action. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors on L-cells by SCFA promotes the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY resulting in increased insulin and decreased glucagon secretion, and suppressed appetite. SCFA can decrease intestinal permeability and decrease circulating endotoxins, lowering inflammation and oxidative stress. SCFA may also have anti-lipolytic activities in adipocytes and improve insulin sensitivity via GLUT4 through the up-regulation of '-AMP-activated protein kinase signalling in muscle and liver tissues. Resistant starch and synbiotics appear to have favourable anti-diabetic effects. However, there are few human interventions. Further well-designed human clinical studies are required to develop recommendations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes with pro- and prebiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309158>Leaf-inspired multiresponsive MXene-based actuator for programmable smart devices.</a></h1><p>Natural leaves, with elaborate architectures and functional components,  and convert solar  into chemical fuels that can be converted into  based on photosynthesis.

However, the UC efficiency of solid materials is largely limited by low fluorescence quantum yields that originate from the aggregation of TTA-UC chromophores and also by severe back  transfer from the acceptor singlet state to the singlet state of the triplet donor in the condensed state. In this work, to overcome these issues, we introduce a highly fluorescent singlet  collector as the third component of donor-doped acceptor crystalline films, in which dual  migration, i.e., triplet  migration for TTA-UC and succeeding singlet  migration for transferring  to a collector, takes place. To demonstrate this scheme, a highly fluorescent singlet  collector was added as the third component of donor-doped acceptor crystalline films. An anthracene-based acceptor containing alkyl chains and a carboxylic moiety is mixed with the triplet donor Pt(II) octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) and the  collector 2,,8,11-tetra- tert-butylperylene (TTBP) in solution, and simple spin-coating of the mixed solution gives acceptor films of nanofibrous crystals homogeneously doped with PtOEP and TTBP. Interestingly, delocalized singlet excitons in acceptor crystals are found to diffuse effectively over the distance of ∼37 nm. Thanks to this high diffusivity, only 0. mol % of doped TTBP can  most of the singlet excitons, which successfully doubles the solid-state fluorescent quantum yield of acceptor/TTBP blend films to 76%. Furthermore, since the donor PtOEP and the collector TTBP are separately isolated in the nanofibrous acceptor crystals, the singlet back  transfer from the collector to the donor is effectively avoided. Such efficient singlet  collection and inhibited back  transfer processes result in a large increase of UC efficiency up to 9.0%, offering rational design principles toward ultimately efficient solid-state upconverters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053265>Step-Economical Photoassisted Diversity-Oriented Synthesis: Sustaining Cascade Photoreactions in Oxalyl Anilides to Access Complex Polyheterocyclic Molecular Architectures.</a></h1><p>Atom- and step-economy in photoassisted diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) is achieved with a versatile oxalyl linker offering rapid access to complex alkaloid mimics in very few experimentally simple steps: (i) it allows for fast tethering of the photoactive core to the unsaturated pendants, especially important in the case of (hetero)aromatic amines-essentially a one-pot reaction with no isolation of intermediates; (ii) the α-dicarbonyl tether acts as a chromophore enhancer, extending the conjugation chain and facilitating the "" of the lower  photons for the primary and secondary photoreactions; (iii) it enhances the quantum yield of intersystem crossing (ISC), i.e., it is capable of sensitizing secondary photochemical processes in the cascade; and (iv) the tether forms an additional heterocyclic moiety, imidazolidine-4,-dione, a known pharmacophore.

Light-absorbing nanoparticular and nanotubular TiO2 are hybridized with electron-storing WO3 at different weight ratios of TiO2 to WO3 (e.g., TW25 represents a composite of 25 wt% TiO2 and 75 wt% WO3). The ability of the TW composite to utilize the stored electrons is examined for the reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(vi)). In the photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests, irradiation using simulated sunlight (AM 1., 100 mW cm-2) leads to a rapid shift in the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the TW electrodes to the negative potential region (photocharging process). The termination of irradiation causes a gradual shift of the OCP to the positive potential region over 20 h (discharging process). Spiked Cr(vi) added to the solution with pre-photocharged TW electrodes is efficiently removed; the kinetics of this process depends on the TW composition (25, 50, or 75 wt%), TiO2 morphology (particular or tubular), initial Cr(vi) concentration (0.125 or 0.25 ppm), and whether the conditions are aerated or non-aerated. Based on this knowledge, TW composite-embedded inorganic membranes are synthesized and charged using sunlight. For Cr(vi) removal, single-pass and continuous circulation filtration systems are employed. The fraction of Cr(vi) removed from the circulation system is ∼30% in 4 h, which is 1. times that removed using the single-pass filtration system (∼20%). An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the TW membranes used for Cr(vi) removal reveals that Cr is not sorbed in the membrane. The W(vi) in WO3 is partially reduced to W(6-x)+ upon photocharging and is oxidized during the reduction of Cr(vi), leading to the co-existence of W6+ and W(6-x)+.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28972688>Designing CdS Mesoporous Networks on Co-C@Co S Double-Shelled Nanocages as Redox-Mediator-Free Z-Scheme Photocatalyst.</a></h1><p>Designing porous nanostructures with unprecedented functionalities and an effective ability to  the maximum  region of the solar spectrum and suppress the charge-carrier recombination rate offers promising potential for sustainable  production.

Metal-organicframework-derived cobalt nanocrystal-embedded few-layered carbon@Co S double-shelled nanocages were used as a co-semiconductor to hamper the photo charge-carrier recombination by accelerating the photogenerated electrons and holes from the other semiconductor. The optimized catalyst shows a H evolution rate of 26.69 mmol g  h under simulated solar irradiation, which is 46 times higher than that of the as-synthesized CdS mesoporous nanostructures. The apparent quantum yield reached 7.82 % at λ=425 nm in  h.

Here, skin tissue quality characters were analyzed in peach fruit (cv. June Gold), harvested in 16 orchards located in low (71. m mean), or high (495 m mean) altitutes sites. Data indicated that soluble solids concentration and fruit firmness at commercial  stage were unaffected by alitute. Peach grown at high-altitude environment displayed higher levels of pigmentation and specific antioxidant-related activity in their skin at the commercial  stage. Skin extracts from distinct developmental stages and growing altitudes exhibited different antioxidant ability against DNA strand-scission. The effects of altitude on skin tissue were further studied using a proteomic approach. Protein expression analysis of the mature fruits depicted altered expression of 42 proteins that are mainly involved in the metabolic pathways of defense, primary metabolism, destination/storage and . The majority of these proteins were up-regulated at the low-altitude region. High-altitude environment increased the accumulation of several proteins, including chaperone ClpC, chaperone ClpB, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, TCP domain class transcription factor, and lipoxygenase. We also discuss the altitude-affected protein variations, taking into account their potential role in peach ripening process.

However, poor outdoor winter cultivation capacity currently limits deployment potential. In this study, 300 distinct algal strains were screened in saline medium to determine their cultivation suitability during winter conditions in Mesa, Arizona. Three strains, from the genera , and , were chosen following laboratory evaluations and grown outdoors in 1000 L raceway ponds during the winter. Strains were down-selected based on doubling time, lipid and carbohydrate amount, final biomass accumulation capacity, cell size and phylogenetic diversity. Algal biomass productivity and compositional analysis for lipids and carbohydrates show successful outdoor deployment and cultivation under winter conditions for these strains. Outdoor -yield biomass productivities ranged from 2.9 to 4.0 g/m/day over an 18 days winter cultivation trial, with maximum productivities ranging from 4.0 to 6. g/m/day, the highest productivities reported to date for algal winter strains grown in saline media in open raceway ponds. Peak fatty acid levels ranged from 9 to 26% percent of biomass, and peak carbohydrate levels ranged from 13 to 34% depending on the strain. Changes in the lipid and carbohydrate profile throughout outdoor growth are reported. This study demonstrates that algal strain screening under simulated outdoor environmental conditions in the laboratory enables identification of strains with robust biomass productivity and biofuel precursor composition.

Despite the immediate survival benefits, catch-and-release results in capture stress, particularly at high water temperatures, and this can result in delayed post-release mortality minutes to days later. The objective of this study was to evaluate how different water temperatures influenced heart rate disturbance and recovery of wild sockeye salmon () following fisheries interactions (i.e. exhaustive exercise). Heart rate loggers were implanted into Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to simulated catch-and-release events conducted at three water temperatures (16°C, 19°C and 21°C). The fisheries simulation involved chasing logger-implanted fish in tanks for 3 min, followed by a 1 min air exposure. Neither resting nor routine heart rate differed among temperature treatments. In response to the fisheries simulation, peak heart rate increased with temperature (16°C = 91.3 ± 1.3 beats min; 19°C = 104.9 ± 2.0 beats min and 21°C = 117 ± 1.3 beats min). Factorial heart rate and scope for heart rate were highest at 21°C and lowest at 16°C, but did not differ between 19°C and 21°C. Temperature affected the initial rate of cardiac recovery but not the overall duration (~10 h) such that the rate of  expenditure during recovery increased with temperature. These findings support the notion that in the face of climate change, efforts to reduce stress at warmer temperatures will be necessary if catch-and-release practices are to be an effective conservation strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31459496>Pure Piezoelectricity Generation by a Flexible Nanogenerator Based on Lead Zirconate Titanate Nanofibers.</a></h1><p>Lead zirconate titanate (PbZrTiO, PZT) alloys have been extensively studied to be used for piezoelectric nanogenerators to   from mechanical motions. In this study, PZT nanofiber-based nanogenerators were fabricated to test their true piezoelectric performance without the triboelectric effect. Aligned PZT nanofibers were fabricated by a sol-gel electrospinning process. The thickness, area, and orientation of the PZT textile made by electrospinning a PZT solution onto multipair metal wires or metal mesh were controlled to form a composite textile. After the calcination, the PZT textile mixed with polydimethylsiloxane was placed between two flexible indium-doped tin oxide-polyethylene naphthalate substrates. The performance parameters of the nanogenerators were investigated under the bending motion, which excludes the triboelectric effect. An assembled nanogenerator of an area of 8 cm and a thickness of 80 μm could generate an electrical output voltage of 1.1 V and a current of 1.4 μA under the bending strain. The piezoelectric voltage depended on the thickness of the PZT textile, whereas the piezoelectric current depended on both the thickness and the area of the PZT textile. The electrical performance of the device was significantly affected by the orientation of the PZT fiber and the bending direction. The output voltage and the output current were strain-dependent, whereas the total integrated charge was independent of the strain rate. The properties of the flexible nanogenerator could be quantified to verify the pure piezoelectric performance of the device.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29662157>Pyroelectric  conversion with large  and power density in relaxor ferroelectric thin films.</a></h1><p>The need for efficient  utilization is driving research into ways to  ubiquitous waste heat. Here, we explore pyroelectric  conversion from low-grade thermal sources that exploits strong field- and temperature-induced polarization susceptibilities in the relaxor ferroelectric 0.68Pb(MgNb)O-0.32PbTiO. Electric-field-driven enhancement of the pyroelectric response (as large as -550 μC m K) and suppression of the dielectric response (by 72%) yield substantial figures of merit for pyroelectric  conversion. Field- and temperature-dependent pyroelectric measurements highlight the role of polarization rotation and field-induced polarization in mediating these effects. Solid-state, thin-film devices that convert low-grade heat into electrical  are demonstrated using pyroelectric Ericsson cycles, and optimized to yield maximum  density, power density and efficiency of 1.06 J cm, 526 W cm and 19% of Carnot, respectively; the highest values reported to date and equivalent to the performance of a thermoelectric with an effective ZT ≈ 1.16 for a temperature change of 10 K. Our findings suggest that pyroelectric devices may be competitive with thermoelectric devices for low-grade thermal harvesting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563971>Lipid productivity in limnetic  is doubled by seawater added with anaerobically digested effluent from kitchen waste.</a></h1><p>An economical strategy for producing microalgae as biofuel feedstock is driven by the freshwater and nutrients input. In this study, seawater was applied to limnetic algal cultivation and the behavior of algae in seawater media was observed including growth, lipid synthesis, and ultrastructure. To make seawater cater algae, a kind of wastewater, anaerobically digested effluent from kitchen waste (ADE-KW), was used as nutrient sources.Pure seawater cannot support the growth demand of freshwater microalga, due to high salinity and lack of nutrients. However, it is the conditions triggered the algae to synthesize lipids of 60%, double of lipid content in standard medium BG11. Introducing 3 or % ADE-KW (volume percentage) into seawater made algal growth reach the level attained in BG11, while lipid content compared favourably with the level (60%) in pure seawater. This method achieved the goal of fast growth and lipid accumulation simultaneously with the highest lipid productivity (19 mg/L  day) at the exponential stage, while BG11 obtained 10.55 mg/L  day at the stationary stage as the highest lipid productivity, almost half of that in seawater media. Moreover, the condition for highest lipid productivity enlarged algal cells compared to BG11. Under the condition for highest lipid productivity,  SDEC-18 had enlarged cells and increased settling efficiency compared to BG11, which facilitated  in an  saving way.The results suggested that combining seawater with ADE-KW to cultivate microalgae had a double function: nutrients and water for algal growth, and high salinity for stimulating lipid accumulation. If this technology was operated in practice, freshwater and non-waste nutrient consumption would be completely obviated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982122>Quantifying Ecological Integrity of Terrestrial Systems to Inform Management of Multiple-Use Public Lands in the United States.</a></h1><p>The concept of ecological integrity has been applied widely to management of aquatic systems, but still is considered by many to be too vague and difficult to quantify to be useful for managing terrestrial systems, particularly across broad areas. Extensive public lands in the western United States are managed for diverse uses such as timber , livestock grazing,  development, and wildlife conservation, some of which may degrade ecological integrity. We propose a method for assessing ecological integrity on multiple-use lands that identifies the components of integrity and levels in the ecological hierarchy where the assessment will focus, and considers existing policies and management objectives. Both natural reference and societally desired environmental conditions are relevant comparison points. We applied the method to evaluate the ecological integrity of shrublands in Nevada, yielding an assessment based on six indicators of ecosystem structure, function, and composition, including resource- and stressor-based indicators measured at multiple scales. Results varied spatially and among indicators. Invasive plant cover and surface development were highest in shrublands in northwest and southeast Nevada. Departure from reference conditions of shrubland area, composition, patch size, and connectivity was highest in central and northern Nevada. Results may inform efforts to control invasive species and restore shrublands on federal lands in Nevada. We suggest that ecological integrity assessments for multiple-use lands be grounded in existing policies and monitoring programs, incorporate resource- and stressor-based metrics, rely on publicly available data collected at multiple spatial scales, and quantify both natural reference and societally desired resource conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617722>Dietary effects of commercial probiotics on growth performance, digestibility, and intestinal morphometry of broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>This study compared five commercially available probiotics vis-à-vis antibiotic growth promotant (AGP) supplementation and absence of feed additive based on efficiency, intestinal morphometry, and  digestibility in improving broiler chicken production. A total of 630 straight run (Cobb) day-old broiler chicks were distributed to seven treatments following a completely randomized design, with ten replicates per treatment and nine birds per replicate per cage. Dietary treatments consisted of basal diet in combination with the following: without probiotics and AGP supplementation (treatment 1); 75 ppm each of chlorotetracycline (CTC) and Zn bacitracin (treatment 2); probiotic A, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 3); probiotic B, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 4); probiotic C, Enterococcus faecium (treatment ); and probiotic D, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 6); probiotic E, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium spp., Pediococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. (treatment 7). At day 42,  digestibility was determined by fasting three randomly selected birds from each treatment for 12 h and then subjecting them to their corresponding dietary treatments. Excreta were collected and pooled after 24 h of feeding. Pooled excreta were weighed, oven-dried, and subjected to  analyses after 3-day collection. Apparent total tract metabolizable  was then computed. At day 47, three birds were randomly selected per treatment for intestinal morphometry (villi height and crypt depth) of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Dietary supplementation using probiotics showed no significant effect on overall body weight, weight gain, feed consumption, feed efficiency, dressing percentage, mortality,  recovery, carcass quality parameters (e.g., meat to bone ratio and abdominal fat content), intestinal morphometry, and  digestibility. Birds under treatment 7 (basal feed + probiotic E) generated the highest income over feed and chick cost.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29515039>Physiological mechanisms of sustained fumagillin-induced weight loss.</a></h1><p>Current obesity interventions suffer from lack of durable effects and undesirable complications. Fumagillin, an inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidase-2, causes weight loss by reducing food intake, but with effects on weight that are superior to pair-feeding. Here, we show that feeding of rats on a high-fat diet supplemented with fumagillin (HF/FG) suppresses the aggressive feeding observed in pair-fed controls (HF/PF) and alters expression of circadian genes relative to the HF/PF group. Multiple indices of reduced  expenditure are observed in HF/FG but not HF/PF rats. HF/FG rats also exhibit changes in gut hormones linked to food intake, increased   by gut microbiota, and caloric spilling in the urine. Studies in gnotobiotic mice reveal that effects of fumagillin on  expenditure but not feeding behavior may be mediated by the gut microbiota. In sum, fumagillin engages weight loss-inducing behavioral and physiologic circuits distinct from those activated by simple caloric restriction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941343>Rational Design of Low-Band Gap Star-Shaped Molecules With 2,4,6-Triphenyl-1,3,-triazine as Core and Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives as Arms for Organic Solar Cells Applications.</a></h1><p>A series of D-A novel star-shaped molecules with 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,-triazine (TPTA) as core, diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives as arms, and triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives as end groups have been systematically investigated for organic solar cells (OSCs) applications. The electronic, optical, and charge transport properties were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approaches. The parameters such as energetic driving force Δ , adiabatic ionization potential , and adiabatic electron affinity  were also calculated at the same level. The calculated results show that the introduction of different groups to the side of DPP backbones in the star-shaped molecules can tune the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs)  of the designed molecules. The designed molecules can provide match well with those of typical acceptors PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester). Additionally, the absorption wavelengths of the designed molecules show bathochromic shifts compared with that of the original molecule, respectively. The introduction of different groups can extend the absorption spectrum toward longer wavelengths, which is beneficial to  more sunlight. The calculated reorganization energies suggest that the designed molecules are expected to be the promising candidates for ambipolar charge transport materials except molecule with benzo[c]isothiazole group can be used as hole and electron transport material. Moreover, the different substituent groups do not significantly affect the stability of the designed molecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30204408>Greener Luminescent Solar Concentrators with High Loading Contents Based on in Situ Cross-Linked Carbon Nanodots for Enhancing Solar  Harvesting and Resisting Concentration-Induced Quenching.</a></h1><p>A luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) is composed of loaded luminophores and a waveguide that can be employed to  and concentrate both direct and diffused sunlight for promising applications in solar windows. Thus far, most of efficient LSCs still relied on the heavy-metal-containing colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) dispersed into a polymer matrix with a very low loading (typically <1 wt %). Such low-loading constraint is required to mitigate the concentration-induced quenching (CIQ) and maintain high optical quality and film uniformity, but this would strongly reduce the light-absorbing efficiency. To address all issues, greener LSCs with high loading concentration were prepared by in situ cross-linking organosilane-functionalized carbon nanodots (Si-CNDs), and their photophysical properties relevant to LSC operation were studied. The PL emission is stable and does not suffer from the severe CIQ effect for cross-linked Si-CNDs even with 25 wt % loadings, thus exhibiting high solid-state quantum yields (QYs) up to 45 ± % after the calibration of the reabsorption losses. Furthermore, such LSCs can still hold high optical quality and film uniformity, leading to low scattering losses and high internal quantum efficiency of ∼22%. However, the reabsorption losses need to be further addressed to realize large-area LSCs based on earth-abundant, cost-effective CNDs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30251409>Can Polymer Solar Cells Open the Path to Sustainable and Efficient Photovoltaic Windows Fabrication?</a></h1><p>Sunlight is among the most abundant  sources available on our planet.

Polymer solar cells have been introduced in the late 20 century as low-cost and easily processed alternative to the state-of-the-art silicon photovoltaics. Their power conversion efficiencies, which were initially rather low, are constantly improving and now reach values close to 15 %.

A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is considered as a potential solution via building self-powered systems. Based on the triboelectrification effect and electrostatic induction, a conventional TENG with pulsed AC output characteristics always needs rectification and  storage units to obtain a constant DC output to drive electronic devices. Here, we report a next-generation TENG, which realizes constant current (crest factor, ~1) output by coupling the triboelectrification effect and electrostatic breakdown. Meanwhile, a triboelectric charge density of 430 mC m is attained, which is much higher than that of a conventional TENG limited by electrostatic breakdown. The novel DC-TENG is demonstrated to power electronics directly.

In this work, fresh corn silage after the  was used as a substrate in solid-state fermentations with T. versicolor with the aim of phenolic acid recovery and enzyme (laccase and manganese peroxidase) production. During 20 days of fermentation, 10.4-, 3.4-, 3.0-, and 1.8-fold increments in extraction yield of syringic acid, vanillic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and caffeic acid, respectively, were reached when compared to biologically untreated corn silage. Maximal laccase activity was gained on the 4th day of fermentation (V.A. = 180.2 U/dm), and manganese peroxidase activity was obtained after the 3rd day of fermentation (V.A. = 30.1 U/dm). The addition of copper(II) sulfate as inducer during solid state fermentation resulted in 8.- and 7-fold enhancement of laccase and manganese peroxidase activities, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of pH and temperature on enzyme activities was investigated.

The effect of flocculant dosage, the order of flocculant addition, mixing speed, and growth stage on the harvesting efficiency was evaluated. Results showed that the flocculation using combined flocculants significantly decreases the flocculant dosage and settling time compared with control. It was also found that CaO and γ-PGA influenced microalgal flocculation by changing the zeta potential of cells and pH of microalgal suspension. The most suitable order of flocculant addition was CaO first and then γ-PGA. The optimal mixing speed was 200 rpm for 0. min, followed by 50 rpm for another 4. min for CaO and γ-PGA with the highest flocculation efficiency of 95 % and a concentration factor of 35.. The biomass concentration and lipid yield of the culture reusing the flocculated medium were similar to those when a fresh medium was used. Overall, the proposed method requires low  input, alleviates biomass and water contamination, and reduces utilization of water resources and is feasible for harvesting C. vulgaris for biofuel and other bio-based chemical production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738259>Corn stover  N and  budgets in central Iowa.</a></h1><p>Harvesting corn stover removes N from the fields, but its effect on subsurface drainage and other N losses is uncertain. We used the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to examine N losses with 0 (NRR) or 50% (RR) corn residue removal within a corn and soybean rotation over a 10-yr period. In general, all simulations used the same pre-plant or post-emergence N fertilizer rate (200 kg ha yr). Simulated annual corn yields averaged 10.7 Mg ha for the post emergence applications (NRRpost and RRpost), and 9. and 9.4 Mg ha yr for NRRpre and RRpre. Average total N input during corn years was 19.3 kg N ha greater for NRRpre compared to RRpre due to additional N in surface residues, but drainage N loss was only 1.1 kg N ha yr greater for NRRpre. Post-emergence N application with no residue removal (NRRpost) reduced average drainage N loss by 16. kg ha yr compared to pre-plant N fertilization (NRRpre). The farm-gate net  ratio was greatest for RRpost and lowest for NRRpre (14.1 and 10.4 MJ output per MJ input) while greenhouse gas intensity was lowest for RRpost and highest for NRRpre (11.7 and 17.3 g CO-eq. MJ output). Similar to published studies, the simulations showed little difference in NO emissions between scenarios, decreased microbial immobilization for RR compared to NRR, and small soil carbon changes over the 10-yr simulation. In contrast to several previous modeling studies, the crop yield and N lost to drain flow were nearly the same between NRR and RR without supplemental N applied to replace N removed with corn stover. These results are important to optimizing the  and nitrogen budgets associated with corn stover  and for developing a sustainable bioenergy industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Achievement of this goal may be made more difficult in some settings by climate change through adverse impact on agricultural productivity. However, there is only limited quantitative evidence on the link between household crop harvests and child nutrition. We examined this link in a largely subsistence farming population in rural Burkina Faso.Data on the middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of 975 children ≤ years of age, household crop yields, and other parameters were obtained from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Multilevel modelling was used to assess the relationship between MUAC and the household crop  in the year 2009 estimated in terms of kilocalories per adult equivalent per day (kcal/ae/d).Fourteen percent of children had a MUAC <125 mm (a value indicative of acute undernutrition). The relationship between MUAC and annual household food  production adjusted for age, sex, month of MUAC measurement, household wealth, whether a household member had a non-agricultural occupation, garden produce, village infrastructure and market presence, suggested a decline in MUAC below around 3000 kcal/ae/d. The mean MUAC was 2.49 (95% CI 0.45, 4.52) mm less at 1000 than at 3000 kcal/ae/d.Low per capita household crop production is associated with poorer nutritional status of children in a rural farming population in Burkina Faso.

Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm has a larger transmission rate than other benchmark algorithms when ensuring each relay has no additional  supply. Specifically, the proposed algorithm improves the information transmission rate by 2.8%, 3.4% and 43% compared with other algorithms in the case of five relays when the source's power is equal to 0.

Biophotovoltaics seek to mimic photosynthesis to  solar  and to take advantage of the low material costs, negative carbon footprint, and material abundance. In the current study, we report on a combination of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires with monolayers of photosynthetic reaction centers which are self-assembled, via a cytochrome c linker, as photoactive electrode. In a three-probe biophotovoltaics cell, a photocurrent density of . μA cm and photovoltage of 36 mV was achieved, using methyl viologen as a redox mediator in the electrolyte. Using ferrocene as a redox mediator a transient photocurrent density of 8.0 μA cm was obtained, which stabilized at 6.4 μA cm after 20 s. In-depth electronic structure characterization using photoemission spectroscopy in conjunction with electrochemical analysis suggests that the fabricated photoactive electrode can provide a proper electronic path for electron transport all the way from the conduction band of the ZnO nanowires, through the protein linker to the RC, and ultimately via redox mediator to the counter electrode.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28553490>Visible light-induced water splitting in an aqueous suspension of a plasmonic Au/TiO photocatalyst with metal co-catalysts.</a></h1><p>We found that plasmonic Au particles on titanium(iv) oxide (TiO) act as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for overall water splitting free from any additives.

Particularly, (6-4) photolyase ((6-4)PHR) plays an important role in maintaining genetic integrity by repairing thymine(6-4)thymine (T(6-4)T) and thymine(6-4)cytosine (T(6-4)C) photolesions. The majority of (6-4)PHR studies have been performed on the basis of the former's activity and assuming the equivalence of the two repair mechanisms, although the latter's activity remains poorly studied. Here, we describe investigations of the repair process of the T(6-4)C dimer using several computational methods from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to large quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approaches. Two possible mechanisms, the historically proposed azetidine four-member ring intermediate and the free NH formation pathways, were considered. The MD results predicted that important active site histidine residues employed for the repair of the T(6-4)C dimer have protonation states similar to those seen in the (6-4)PHR/T(6-4)T complex. More importantly, despite chemical differences between the two substrates, a similar repair mechanism was identified: His365 protonates NH, resulting in formation/activation mechanism of a free NH, inducing NH transfer to the ' base, and ultimately leading to pyrimidine restoration. This reaction is thermodynamically favorable with a rate-limiting barrier of 20.4 kcal mol. In contrast, the azetidine intermediate is unfeasible, possessing an  barrier of 60 kcal mol; this barrier is similar to that predicted for the oxetane intermediate in T(6-4)T repair. Although both substrates are repaired with comparable quantum yields, the reactive complex in T(6-4)C was shown to be a 3' base radical with a lower driving force for back electron transfer combined with higher  barrier for catalysis. These results showed the similarity in the general repair mechanisms between the two substrates while emphasizing differences in the electron dynamics in the repair cycle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669313>Biofortified Maize Can Improve Quality Protein Intakes among Young Children in Southern Ethiopia.</a></h1><p>Quality protein maize (QPM) varieties are biofortified, or nutritionally improved, to have higher lysine and tryptophan levels to increase quality protein intakes particularly among young children. This study assesses adequacy of children's protein intakes in Ethiopia, where QPM is being promoted, accounting for protein quality and seasonal dietary changes, and estimates potential increases in intakes if QPM replaced conventional maize in diets. Diets of randomly sampled children aged 12⁻36 months in rural southern Ethiopia ( = 218) were assessed after  during relative food security and 3⁻4 months later during relative food insecurity using 24-h weighed food records. Diets were analyzed for protein adequacy, accounting for protein quality using the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) method, and potential improvements from QPM substitution were estimated. Stunting was prevalent (38%) at the first assessment. Across seasons, 95⁻96% of children consumed maize, which provided 59⁻61% of  and 51⁻55% of total protein in 24 h. Dietary intakes decreased in the food insecure season, though children were older. Among children no longer breastfeeding, QPM was estimated to reduce inadequacy of utilizable protein intakes from 17% to 13% in the food secure season and from 34% to 19% in the food insecure season. However, breastfed children had only 4⁻6% inadequate intakes of utilizable protein, limiting QPM's potential impact. Due to small farm sizes, maize stores from home production lasted a median of three months. Young Ethiopian children are at risk of inadequate quality protein intakes, particularly after breastfeeding has ceased and during food insecurity. QPM could reduce this risk; however, reliance on access through home production may result in only short-term benefits given the limited quantities of maize produced and stored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26178774>Developments and challenges in biodiesel production from microalgae: A review.</a></h1><p>The imminent depletion of fossil fuels and the surging global demand for renewable  have led to the search for nonconventional  sources. After a few decades of trial and error, the world is now testing the sources of the third generation of fossil fuels, which contain for most parts microalgae. With more than 80% oil content, being adaptable in growth parameters and highly versatile, microalgae are highly promising sources of biofuels in the present time. The present article makes a sweeping attempt to highlight the various methods employed for cultivation of microalgae, techniques to  and extract biomass from huge algal cultures, as well as their downstream production and processing procedures. The advantages, limitations, and challenges faced by each of them have been described to some extent. Major concerns pertaining to biofuels are supposed to be their environmental sustainability and economic viability along with their cost effectiveness. This would require a great deal of empirical data on existing systems and a great deal of optimization to generate a more robust one. We have concluded our article with a SWOT analysis of using algae for biodiesel production in a tabulated form.© 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524042>Probing static discharge of polymer surfaces with nanoscale resolution.</a></h1><p>Triboelectric charging strongly affects the operation cycle and handling of materials and can be used to  mechanical  through triboelectric nanogenerator set-up. Despite ubiquity of triboelectric effects, a lot of mechanisms surrounding the relevant phenomena remain to be understood. Continued progress will rely on the development of rapid and reliable methods to probe accumulation and dynamics of static charges. Here, we demonstrate in-situ quantification of tribological charging with nanoscale resolution, that is applicable to a wide range of dielectric systems. We apply this method to differentiate between strongly and weakly charging compositions of industrial grade polymers. The method highlights the complex phenomena of electrostatic discharge upon contact formation to pre-charged surfaces, and directly reveals the mobility of surface charges. Systematic characterization of commercial polyethylene terephthalate samples revealed the compositions with the best antistatic properties and provided an estimate of characteristic charge density up to ×10&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Extensive OCB is detected during  seasons in most regions of China. Emissions from OCB have been widely investigated in China, but few studies have focused on regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations with a long timescale. In this study, emissions from OCB in three typical regions of China, including Northeast China, Chengdu-Chongqing and Guangdong, from 2003 to 2016, were estimated using a combination of statistical data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, and regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations and driving forces were analyzed in detail. The results showed that OCB emissions of CO and PM in 2016 were 3.63 × 10 and 6.96 × 10 tons in Northeast China, 9.77 × 10 and 1.36 × 10 tons in Chengdu-Chongqing, and 1.24 × 10 and 1.19 × 10 tons in Guangdong, respectively. The OCB emissions in Northeast China maintained an overall increasing trend, which were mainly dominated by rural economic development and agricultural modernization, with great potential for reduction. In Chengdu-Chongqing, emissions increased until 2013 and then decreased, due to the impact of policies prohibiting OCB. In Guangdong, emissions showed annual fluctuations with a slightly decreasing trend influenced by metrological conditions and related policies. The analysis of the driving forces behind the regional discrepancies among these typical regions indicated that OCB emissions in China were characterized by uneven rural economic development, control policies, and natural conditions, suggesting that region-dependent control measures are needed for reducing OCB emissions. This study provided a better understanding of OCB emission characteristics in the three typical regions and revealed the diversity of OCB emission characteristics in China.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Beef steers ( = 20; 463 ± 14 kg) blocked ( = ) by weight and source were individually fed and adapted to maintenance  intake for 21 d before allotment to ZH (90 mg/steer∙d) or no β-adrenergic agonist treatment (control [CONT]) for 20 d (455 ± 14 kg at the start of treatment). Respiration chambers = 4 were used to quantify heat production (HP) during maintenance (d 12 to 16 of the ZH period) and fasting heat production (FHP; d 19 to 20 of ZH period; total 4 d of fast). Steers were harvested after a 6-d ZH withdrawal and carcasses were graded 24 h after . Control cattle lost more BW ( < 0.01; 9 kg for CONT and 2 kg for ZH-treated) during maintenance whereas the BW loss of ZH-treated steers was greater ( < 0.01; 9 kg for ZH-treated and vs. 4 kg, for CONT) during FHP; no differences ( ≥ 0.76) were detected for G:F, ADG, and end BW. No differences in DMI, apparent nutrient digestibility, O consumption, or CH production ( ≥ 0.12) were detected; however, ZH-treated cattle had greater CO production during maintenance ( = 0.04; 23.6 L/kgBW for ZH-treated and 22.4 L/kg BW for CONT). Digestible  and ME did not differ ( ≥ 0.19); however, urinary  was greater ( = 0.05; 0.091 Mcal for CONT and 0.074 Mcal for ZH-treated) in CONT cattle. Steers treated with ZH tended to have greater HP ( = 0.09; 12.44 Mcal for ZH-treated and 11.69 Mcal for CONT), but the effect was reduced on a BW basis ( = 0.12; 0.126 Mcal/kg BW0.75 for ZH-treated and 0.120 Mcal/kg BW0.75 for CONT vs. 0.120 Mcal/kg BW). No treatment difference in FHP was observed ( ≥ 0.32) although CO production (L/steer) increased with ZH treatment ( = 0.04; 1,423 L/steer for ZH-treated and 1,338 L/steer for CONT). Control cattle excreted more ( = 0.05) N in urine (39.8 g/d for CONT and 32.4 g/d for ZH-treated); therefore, NR ( = 0.07; 22.14 g/d for ZH-treated and 14.12 g/d for CONT steers) tended to be greater for ZH-fed steers. Steers treated with ZH lost more C via CO ( = 0.04; 1,036.9 g/d for ZH-treated and 974.3 g/d for CONT) although total CR did not differ ( ≥ 0.23). Empty BW, HCW, and  yields (g/kg empty BW) were not different ( ≥ 0.13), whereas ZH increased dressed yield ( = 0.02; 62.12 % for ZH-treated and 60.65% for CONT) and LM area ( = 0.02; 77.81 cm for ZH-treated and vs. 70.90 cm for CONT). Separable carcass lean and actual skeletal muscle protein (SMP) were increased with ZH ( ≤ 0.04; 201.6 and 41.2 kg, respectively for ZH-treated and 196.0 and 38.4 kg, respectively for CONT).

The copolymer is mainly composed of α phases with enhanced dipole moments due to the π-bonding and polar characteristics of the ester functional groups in the PtBA, resulting in the increase of dielectric constant values by approximately twice, supported by Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements. This increase in the dielectric constant significantly increased the density of the charges that can be accumulated on the copolymer during physical contact. The nanogenerator generates output signals of 105 V and 25 μA/cm, a 20-fold enhancement in output power, compared to pristine PVDF-based nanogenerator after tuning the surface potential using a poling method. The markedly enhanced output performance is quite stable and reliable in harsh mechanical environments due to the high flexibility of the films. On the basis of these results, a much faster charging characteristic is demonstrated in this study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186832>Insights Into the Sunlight-Driven Water Oxidation by Ce and Er-Doped ZrO .</a></h1><p>In the present work, the activity of Ce and Er-doped ZrO nanopowders for sun-driven photocatalytic water oxidation has been investigated. ZrO powders with tunable amounts of tetragonal, monoclinic and cubic polymorphs have been synthesized by introducing Ce and Er (from 0. to 10 mol % on an oxide basis) through hydrothermal method. The aim of this work is to investigate the role of rare earth (RE) ions rich of electrons (Er) and with entirely empty levels (Ce) in the ZrO matrix for the sun-driven photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. The samples have been characterized by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), N adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometry (XPS) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) with  dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). With respect to the bare ZrO mainly containing monoclinic (m-) phase, an increasing amount of rare-earth (RE) dopant was found to improve the specific BET surface area and to stabilize the tetragonal (t-) or cubic (c-) polymorphs of ZrO at room temperature. XRD data confirmed that dopants were mainly inserted in the t-ZrO phase. The photocatalytic O evolution from water under AM 1. G simulated sunlight illumination of the prepared samples have been correlated with their optical, structural and chemical properties. The effect of the dopant concentration on the chemical-physical and photocatalytic properties of the Er- and Ce-doped ZrO materials was elucidated. The samples with % of RE oxide were the most active, i.e., three times more than pure zirconia. Their superior photocatalytic activity was found to be mainly correlated to two factors: (i) an optimal surface concentration of RE ions of about 3.7%, which increased charge carriers separation in the photocatalysts surface due more superficial defects of the t-ZrO and a higher surface area, thus enhancing the reaction kinetics, (ii) a controlled amount of monoclinic vs. tetragonal (or cubic) polymorphs of zirconia with an optimum ratio of about 70/30 of t-ZrO/m-ZrO. Instead, the increased ability of the RE-doped ZrO to  visible light was found to have a secondary role on the photocatalytic activity of the Ce-doped ZrO material.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29533662>Macroporous Double-Network Hydrogel for High-Efficiency Solar Steam Generation Under 1 sun Illumination.</a></h1><p>Solar steam generation is one of the most promising solar--harvesting technologies to address the issue of water shortage. Despite intensive efforts to develop high-efficiency solar steam generation devices, challenges remain in terms of the relatively low solar thermal efficiency, complicated fabrications, high cost, and difficulty in scaling up. Herein, a double-network hydrogel with a porous structure (p-PEGDA-PANi) is demonstrated for the first time as a flexible, recyclable, and efficient photothermal platform for low-cost and scalable solar steam generation. As a novel photothermal platform, the p-PEGDA-PANi involves all necessary properties of efficient broadband solar absorption, exceptional hydrophilicity, low heat conductivity, and porous structure for high-efficiency solar steam generation. As a result, the hydrogel-based solar steam generator exhibits a maximum solar thermal efficiency of 91.% with an evaporation rate of 1.40 kg m h under 1 sun illumination, which is comparable to state-of-the-art solar steam generation devices. Furthermore, the good durability and environmental stability of the p-PEGDA-PANi hydrogel enables a convenient recycling and reusing process toward real-life applications. The present research not only provides a novel photothermal platform for solar   but also opens a new avenue for the application of the hydrogel materials in solar steam generation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524961>Rheological characteristics and genotype correlation of cassava root for very high gravity ethanol production: The influence of cassava varieties and  times.</a></h1><p>In very high gravity (VHG) ethanol fermentation, the rheological properties of native cassava significantly influence heat and mass transfer, mixing , and, thus, the yield of all steps. This study investigated the effect of cassava varieties and their  times on starch liquefaction, saccharification, and fermentation. The genotype correlation of the starch properties was revealed for the most suitable cassava varieties. First, the starch content, amylose content, total reducing sugar from liquefaction and saccharification, pasting properties, and ethanol yields of six cassava varieties (Huay Bong 60, Hanatee, Kasetsart 50, Pirun 1, Pirun 2, and Rayong 11) at 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-month  times were evaluated. The amylose content increased significantly from the 6th to the 12th month but slightly decreased at the 15th month. It was observed that the starch content contributed to a more substantial influence on the change in peak viscosity than on the amylose content. Ethanol fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR5606 showed that the Rayong 11 variety at the 15-month  time provided the highest ethanol concentration of 104.7 ± 4.1 g L and an ethanol yield of 0.4 ± 0.1 g ethanol g reducing sugar, which corresponded to 74.% of the theoretical yield.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481850>Sorrel Extract Reduces Oxidant Production in Airway Epithelial Cells Exposed to Swine Barn Dust Extract In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Exposure to hog barn organic dust contributes to occupational lung diseases, which are mediated by inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Isoprostanes-a family of eicosanoids produced by oxidation of phospholipids by oxygen radicals-are biomarkers of pulmonary oxidative stress. Importantly, 8-isoprostane has been implicated as a key biomarker and mediator of oxidative stress because it is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor. Antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables hold promise for preventing or reducing effects of oxidative stress-related diseases including chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we investigated 8-isoP and oxidant production by organic dust-exposed airway epithelial cells and the inhibitory effects of an extract from calyces of the sorrel plant, , on oxidant-producing pathways. Confluent cultures of normal human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were pretreated or not with 1% sorrel extract prior to % dust extract (DE) exposure. Following DE treatments, live cells, cell-free supernatants, or cell extracts were evaluated for the presence of 8-isoprostane, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, hydroxyl radical, peroxynitrite, and catalase activity to evaluate sorrel's inhibitory effect on oxidative stress. The well-known radical scavenging antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), was used for comparisons with sorrel. DE exposure augmented the production of all radicals measured including 8-isoprostane ( value < 0.001), which could be inhibited by NAC or sorrel. Among reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated in response to DE exposure, sorrel had no effect on HO production and NAC had no significant effect on NO production. The observations reported here suggest a possible role for sorrel in preventing 8-isoprostane and oxidant-mediated stress responses in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to hog barn dust. These findings suggest a potential role for oxidative stress pathways in mediating occupational lung diseases and antioxidants within sorrel and NAC in reducing dust-mediated oxidative stress within the airways of exposed workers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30958488>Ultrathin MoS nanosheets for high-performance photoelectrochemical applications via plasmonic coupling with Au nanocrystals.</a></h1><p>In this work, we prepared ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with exposed active edge sites and high electric conductivity that can sufficiently absorb light in the visible region to enable solar  conversion. The gold nanocrystal-decorated MoS2 nanosheets facilitate sufficiently enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting in the UV-visible region. Different Au nanostructures, such as Au nanoparticles and nanorods, were modified on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets to promote photoelectrochemical water decomposition. By spin-coating a synthetic gold-modified MoS2 hybrid photoanode on a FTO substrate, the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water oxidation was significantly enhanced, by 2 times (nanorods) and 3. times (nanoparticles) in the visible-infrared region; furthermore, the average optical resistance was reduced by a factor of two compared to the MoS2 photoanode without Au, and the photocurrent increases exponentially when the system bias was greater than 0.7 volts. The Au-MoS2 metal-semiconductor interface plays an important role in studying the surface plasmon interactions, charge transfer mechanism, and electric field amplification. This rational design for such a unique hybrid nanostructure explains the plasmon-enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting. This current contribution provides a new path for using the plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructure to effectively  UV-visible light for solar fuel generation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194502>Lightweight, Superelastic Yet Thermoconductive Boron Nitride Nanocomposite Aerogel for Thermal  Regulation.</a></h1><p>Conventional three-dimensional (3D) thermal conductors or heat sinks are normally bulky solids with high density, which is cumbersome and not portable to satisfy current demands for soft and flexible electronic devices. To address this issue, here, a lightweight, superelastic yet thermally conductive boron nitride (BN) nanocomposite aerogel is designed by a facile freeze-drying method. The attained aerogel constituting of tailored interconnected binary inorganic-organic network structure exhibits low bulk density (6. mg cm) and outstanding mechanical performances for compression, clotting, and stretching. Meanwhile, the aerogel has promising thermal stability and high thermal conductivity over wide temperature ranges (30-300 °C), validating the application even in extremely hot environments. Moreover, the aerogel can serve as a lightweight and elastic heat conductor for the enhancement of thermal  . Interestingly, during alternate strain loading/unloading under heating, the superelasticity and the anisotropy of thermal conductive transduction make the aerogel enable the elastic thermal  capture and dynamic regulation. Therefore, our findings provide a potential use for the thermally conductive aerogel in future green  applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378499>Ensiled pulp from biorefining increased milk production in dairy cows compared with grass-clover silage.</a></h1><p>The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of fibrous pulp and partial substitution of soybean meal with green protein concentrate from biorefining of grass-clover on dry matter intake, milk production, digestibility, and eating behavior in dairy cows compared with untreated grass-clover silage and soybean meal. Biorefining of grass-clover occurred right after  in a production-scale twin-screw press. The twin-screw pressing separated the grass-clover into a pulp and a green juice. The green juice was fermented using lactic acid bacteria for protein precipitation and then decanted, and the precipitate was heat dried to constitute the green protein concentrate. From the same field, grass-clover was harvested 6 d later due to rainy weather and was prewilted before ensiling. The pulp and the grass-clover were ensiled in bales without additives. The production trial consisted of an incomplete 6 × 4 Latin square trial (3-wk periods; 12 wk total) including 36 lactating Holstein cows. The trial had 6 treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial design with 2 forage types (grass-clover silage and pulp silage) and 3 protein treatments (low protein, high protein with soybean meal, and high protein with a mixture of soybean meal and green protein). The trial was designed to test silage type, protein type, protein level, and the interaction between protein level and silage type. The forage:concentrate ratio was 55:45 in low protein total mixed rations (TMR) and 51:49 in high protein TMR. Low protein and high protein TMR were composed of 372 and 342 g/kg of DM of experimental silages, respectively, and green protein supplemented TMR was composed of 28. g/kg of DM of green protein. Silage type did not affect dry matter intake of cows. The average -corrected milk yield was 37.0 and 33.4 kg/d for cows fed pulp silage and grass-clover silage, respectively, resulting in an improved feed efficiency in the cows receiving pulp silage. Milk fat concentration was greater in milk from cows fed pulp silage, and milk protein concentration was lower compared with milk from cows fed grass-clover silage. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber was greater for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. Eating rate was greater, whereas daily eating duration was lower, for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. The partial substitution of soybean meal with green protein did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, or eating behavior. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein in green protein supplemented diets was lower compared with soybean meal diets. The results imply that extraction of protein from grassland plants can increase the value of the fiber part of grassland plants.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively  bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH .The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately  times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH  was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH ) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29762535>Leveraging  Harvesting and Wake-Up Receivers for Long-Term Wireless Sensor Networks.</a></h1><p>Wireless sensor nodes are traditionally powered by individual batteries, and a significant effort has been devoted to maximizing the lifetime of these devices.

Changes in the environment, behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes. A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of metabolic diseases.We will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal microbiota on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.Altered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing   through specialized gut microbes. In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into metabolic active tissues. Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals. Finally, bacterial metabolic products, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and metabolic signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large. The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.Interventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin resistance and the related metabolic abnormalities in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

Traditional fabrication techniques used to realize TENGs involve plasma etching, soft lithography and nanoparticle deposition for higher performance.

In study 2, 75 similar mice were fed the LF diet (LF) or the HF diet alone (HF) or in combination with up to 0.2% MGO in water (HFM) and 0.067% (HFM-GL) or 0.2% (HFM-GH) dietary genistein for 18 wk. Anthropometric and metabolic data were obtained in both studies to determine the effects of MGO and genistein on variables indicative of MetS.Body weight gain, fat deposits, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and fatty liver were ameliorated by dietary genistein in both studies. The plasma MGO concentration in VHF-G mice was 52% lower than that in VHF mice. Moreover, the AGE concentrations in plasma, liver, and kidney of VHF-G mice were 73%, 52%, and 49%, respectively, lower than in the VHF group (study 1). Similarly, the concentrations of plasma MGO and AGE in plasma, liver, and kidney of HFM-GH mice were 33.%, 49%, 69%, and 54% lower than in HFM mice (study 2). Genistein inhibited AGE formation by trapping MGO to form adducts and upregulating the expressions of glyoxalase I and II and aldose reductase in liver and kidney to detoxify MGO in both studies.Our data demonstrate for the first time that genistein significantly lowers MGO and AGE concentrations in 2 mouse MetS models via multiple pathways.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751662>Data Gathering and  Transfer Dilemma in UAV-Assisted Flying Access Network for IoT.</a></h1><p>Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an alternative solution to assist wireless networks, thanks to numerous advantages they offer in comparison to terrestrial fixed base stations. For instance, a UAV can be used to embed a flying base station providing an on-demand nomadic access to network services. A UAV can also be used to wirelessly recharge out-of-battery ground devices. In this paper, we aim to deal with both data collection and recharging depleted ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices through a UAV station used as a flying base station. To extend the network lifetime, we present a novel use of UAV with  harvesting module and wireless recharging capabilities. However, the UAV is used as an  source to empower depleted IoT devices. On one hand, the UAV charges depleted ground IoT devices under three policies: (1) low-battery first scheme; (2) high-battery first scheme; and (3) random scheme. On the other hand, the UAV station collects data from IoT devices that have sufficient  to transmit their packets, and in the same phase, the UAV exploits the Radio Frequency (RF) signals transmitted by IoT devices to extract and  . Furthermore, and as the UAV station has a limited coverage time due to its  constraints, we propose and investigate an efficient trade-off between ground users recharging time and data gathering time. Furthermore, we suggest to control and optimize the UAV trajectory in order to complete its travel within a minimum time, while minimizing the  spent and/or enhancing the network lifetime. Extensive numerical results and simulations show how the system behaves under different scenarios and using various metrics in which we examine the added value of UAV with  harvesting module.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120934>Opening the tap: Increased riverine connectivity strengthens marine food web pathways.</a></h1><p>Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on  have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast US large marine ecosystem (LME), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in  flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884860>Implementation and Validation of a Two-Stage  Extraction Circuit for a Self Sustained Asset-Tracking System.</a></h1><p>We present a two-stage  extraction circuit for a piezoelectric  harvester, powering an asset-tracking system. Exploiting accelerations generated by many logistic transport devices, e.g., pushcarts, forklifts, assembly belts or cars, we are able to  sufficient electrical  to transmit radio signals, which will allow to track an object when it is moving. Accelerations in logistic applications are non-sinusoidal and lead to high open-circuit voltages, which demand a special adaption of the  extraction network. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art  extraction networks and compare those to the performance of our two-stage approach under various excitation conditions. By using the proposed  extraction circuit, the transmission rate could be increased from four to six transmissions per second for sinusoidal excitations with an open-circuit-voltage of 60 V . In the practical use-case, the two-stage  extraction network performs more than two times better compared to the one-stage and synchronized switching harvesting with inductor approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28097597>Self-Powered Active Sensor with Concentric Topography of Piezoelectric Fibers.</a></h1><p>In this study, we demonstrated a flexible and self-powered sensor based on piezoelectric fibers in the diameter range of nano- and micro-scales. Our work is distinctively different from previous electrospinning research; we fabricated this apparatus precisely via near-field electrospinning which has a spectacular performance to  mechanical deformation in arbitrary direction and a novel concentrically circular topography. There are many piezoelectric devices based on electrospinning polymeric fibers. However, the fibers were mostly patterned in parallel lines and they could be actuated in limited direction only. To overcome this predicament, we re-arranged the parallel alignment into concentric circle pattern which made it possible to collect the mechanical  whenever the deformation is along same axis or not. Despite the change of topography, the output voltage and current could still reach to  V and 400 nA, respectively, despite the mechanical deformation was from different direction. This new arbitrarily directional piezoelectric generator with concentrically circular topography (PGCT) allowed the piezoelectric device to  more mechanical  than the one-directional alignment fiber-based devices, and this PGCT could perform even better output which promised more versatile and efficient using as a wearable electronics or sensor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137520>Nanogenerators as a Sustainable Power Source: State of Art, Applications, and Challenges.</a></h1><p>A sustainable power source to meet the needs of  requirement is very much essential in modern society as the conventional sources are depleting. Bioenergy, hydropower, solar, and wind are some of the well-established renewable  sources that help to attain the need for  at mega to gigawatts power scale. Nanogenerators based on nano  are the growing technology that facilitate self-powered systems, sensors, and flexible and portable electronics in the booming era of IoT (Internet of Things).

Production of HupA by endophytes offers an alternative challenge to reduce the massive plant  needed to meet the increasing demand of HupA. In the current study, some endophytic fungal and actinobacterial isolates from the Chinese herb, Huperzia serrata, underwent liquid fermentation, alkaloid extraction, and screening for AChE inhibition and HupA production. Among these isolates, Alternaria brassicae AGF041 strain was the only positive strain for HupA production with the maximum AChE inhibition of 75.%. Chromatographic analyses verified the identity of the produced HupA. The HupA production was efficiently maximized up to 42.89 μg/g of dry mycelia, after optimization of thirteen process parameters using multifactorial statistical approaches, Plackett-Burman and central composite designs. The statistical optimization resulted in a 40.8% increase in HupA production. This is the first report to isolate endophytic actinobacteria with anti-AChE activity from H. serrata, and to identify an endophytic fungus A. brassicae as a new promising start strain for a higher HupA yield.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030071>Microalgae  influences the  recovery: A case study on chemical flocculation of Scenedesmus obliquus for biodiesel and crude bio-oil production.</a></h1><p>In the present study, centrifugation was used as a standard  method, while chemical flocculation was comparatively used as a cost-effective  method for microalgae. Lipid recovery from the centrifuged cells was 17.4%, which significantly increased by flocculation to 20.7%. Although both  methods showed similar thermal decomposition patterns, flocculated biomass showed 15.7% higher bio-char formation than the centrifuged cells, which resulted in significant reduction in the bio-oil yield by 18.%. The estimated  output of bio-oil using centrifugation and flocculation were 0.87 and 0.68 GJ per ton, respectively. For biodiesel production, the  output using centrifugation and flocculation were 0.177 and 0.211 GJ per ton, respectively. Due to the higher biodiesel yield, better bio-oil quality and lower  consumption, flocculation was suggested by the present study as a superior method over centrifugation for microalgae  from the economic point of view.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Single-sired, beef steers (n = 56; start of trial BW 590 ± 36 kg) blocked (n = 2) by weight and terminal implant were sorted into pairs (n = 14 per block) by weight. Pairs of steers were initially assigned to 0, 28, or 56 d of feeding. Within 28 or 56 d, pairs were assigned to M or A intake. Steers within a pair assigned to 56 d of feeding were randomly assigned to either 20 d of Z supplementation (90 mg/d per steer) with a 4 d withdrawal period prior to slaughter or to no ZH supplementation (C). Steers were housed and fed in individual pens. Weights of all non-carcass and carcass components were recorded at slaughter; carcasses were graded 24-h postmortem. Data were analyzed via a mixed model; the fixed effect was treatment combination with random effects of block and pair. Live growth data used  day as the repeated measure and animal as the subject. Single df contrasts were constructed for day 0 vs. day 28, day 0 vs. day 56, day 28 vs. day 56, M vs. A, and C vs. Z. Treatment impacted (P ≤ 0.05) live ADG; contrasts indicated A (1.33) was greater than M (0.14 kg), and Z (1.12) was greater than C (0.82 kg). Similarly, carcass ADG differences (P < 0.01) indicated A (1.04) was greater than M (0.36 kg), and Z (1.35) was greater than C (0.71 kg). Intake level altered BW and empty body weight (EBW); M cattle had reduced BW and EBW (P < 0.01, 585 and 540 kg) than A cattle (647 and 597 kg). Cattle fed at M had less carcass and internal cavity mass (P < 0.01, 359 and 79.4 kg) than A cattle (394 and 93. kg). Liver mass was reduced by M feeding (P < 0.01; M-.03, A-6.69 kg) and Z treatment (P < 0.01; Z-.64, C-6.06 kg). Moreover, mass of total splanchnic tissue was less (P < 0.01) for M cattle than A cattle (59.8 vs. 72. kg). Dressed carcass yield was greater (P < 0.01) for Z than C cattle (63. vs. 61.6%). Cattle fed at M had less 12th rib s.c. fat, lower numerical U.S. yield grades (P < 0.01; M-1.71 cm and 3.3, A-2.46 cm and 4.3) and lower numerical Canadian yield grades (P < 0.01; 51.9 vs. 53.9% for M and A, respectively) than A cattle.

Photothermal agents play a crucial role in PTT, and they are required to possess the ability to  NIR light and transform the photon  into heat . This work reports a facile method to synthesize a new PTT agent, which is based on the electrostatic binding of the Au nanospheres (Au NSs, ∼15 nm) to the surface of a nanometer-sized mineral, attapulgite, to form tubelike Au-attapulgite nanocomposites. These nanocomposites consist of numerous Au NSs, which are linked to each other along the attapulgite surface. The nanocomposites exhibit similar localized surface plasmon resonance absorption characteristics to those of Au nanorods with a longitudinal absorption mode that shifts to the NIR region (∼670 nm). Moreover, the nanocomposites have a high Cabs/Csca ratio (cross section of absorption to scattering) and photothermal conversion efficiency of 25.6%. Their photothermal therapy effect is studied using A549 cells and A549 cell-bearing nude mice as examples. The results indicate that the nanocomposites can be effectively taken up by the cells, and the nanocomposites show good biocompatibility. The A549 cells almost died after they were incubated with the nanocomposites (at 100 μg mL(-1)) for 12 h and irradiated by an 808 nm laser with a power density of 0. W cm(-2) for 15 min. The tumors of nude mice can also be effectively ablated without regrowth during the period of observation (at least 10 d) after photothermal therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337149>Label-Free Proteomic Analysis of Molecular Effects of 2-Methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone on .</a></h1><p> is the principal pathogen causing blue mold of citrus. Searching for novel antifungal agents is an important aspect of the post- citrus industry because of the lack of higher effective and low toxic antifungal agents. Herein, the effects of 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (MNQ) on  and its mechanism were carried out by a series of methods. MNQ had a significant anti- effect with an MIC value of .0 µg/mL. The label-free protein profiling under different MNQ conditions identified a total of 3037 proteins in the control group and the treatment group. Among them, there were 129 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs, up-regulated > 2.0-fold or down-regulated < 0.-fold,  < 0.05), 19 up-regulated proteins, 26 down-regulated proteins, and 67 proteins that were specific for the treatment group and another 17 proteins that were specific for the control group. Of these, 83 proteins were sub-categorized into 23 hierarchically-structured GO classifications. Most of the identified DEPs were involved in molecular function (47%), meanwhile 27% DEPs were involved in the cellular component and 26% DEPs were involved in the biological process. Twenty-eight proteins identified for differential metabolic pathways by KEGG were sub-categorized into 60 classifications. Functional characterization by GO and KEGG enrichment results suggests that the DEPs are mainly related to  generation (mitochondrial carrier protein, glycoside hydrolase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase), NADPH supply (enolase, pyruvate carboxylase), oxidative stress (catalase, glutathione synthetase), and pentose phosphate pathway (ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase and xylulose -phosphate). Three of the down-regulated proteins selected randomly the nitro-reductase family protein, mono-oxygenase, and cytochrome P450 were verified using parallel reaction monitoring. These findings illustrated that MNQ may inhibit  by disrupting the metabolic processes, especially in  metabolism and stimulus response that are both critical for the growth of the fungus. In conclusion, based on the molecular mechanisms, MNQ can be developed as a potential anti-fungi agent against .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28464416>Trade-offs for food production, nature conservation and climate limit the terrestrial carbon dioxide removal potential.</a></h1><p>Large-scale biomass plantations (BPs) are a common factor in climate mitigation scenarios as they promise double benefits: extracting carbon from the atmosphere and providing a renewable  source. However, their terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) potentials depend on important factors such as land availability, efficiency of capturing biomass-derived carbon and the timing of operation. Land availability is restricted by the demands of future food production depending on yield increases and population growth, by requirements for nature conservation and, with respect to climate mitigation, avoiding unfavourable albedo changes. We integrate these factors in one spatially explicit biogeochemical simulation framework to explore the tCDR opportunity space on land available after these constraints are taken into account, starting either in 2020 or 2050, and lasting until 2100. We find that assumed future needs for nature protection and food production strongly limit tCDR potentials. BPs on abandoned crop and pasture areas (~1,300 Mha in scenarios of either 8.0 billion people and yield gap reductions of 25% until 2020 or 9. billion people and yield gap reductions of 50% until 2050) could, theoretically, sequester ~100 GtC in land carbon stocks and biomass  by 2100. However, this potential would be ~80% lower if only cropland was available or ~50% lower if albedo decreases were considered as a factor restricting land availability. Converting instead natural forest, shrubland or grassland into BPs could result in much larger tCDR potentials ̶ but at high environmental costs (e.g. biodiversity loss). The most promising avenue for effective tCDR seems to be improvement of efficient carbon utilization pathways, changes in dietary trends or the restoration of marginal lands for the implementation of tCDR.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28537072>Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities of g-CN via Hybridization with a Bi-Fe-Nb-Containing Ferroelectric Pyrochlore.</a></h1><p>Ferroelectricity may promote photocatalytic performance because the carrier-separation efficiency can be effectively improved by the internal electrostatic field caused by spontaneous polarization. Heterostructures that combine ferroelectric materials with other semiconductor materials can be further advantageous to the photocatalysis process. In this work, BiFeNbO was hybridized with g-CN via a facile low-temperature method. The results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that a tight interface was formed between g-CN and BiFeNbO, which gave the (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) heterojunction a more superior visible light photocatalytic performance. The degradation of rhodamine B by optimized (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) under visible light was almost 3.3 times higher than that by monomer BiFeNbO and 7.4 times higher than that by g-CN. The (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) sample also showed the highest photocurrent in the photoelectrochemical tests. To further verify the benefit of the built-in electric field in terms of the photocatalytic performance, BiFeNbO, with a higher spontaneous polarization, was also synthesized and hybridized with g-CN. Both BiFeNbO and (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) exhibited better photocatalytic activities than those of BiFeNbO and (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO), although the latter ones had a stronger visible-light absorbance.

Stand-alone and self-sustained paper-based systems are essential to providing effective and lifesaving treatments in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, a realistic and accessible power source is required for actual paper-based POC systems as their diagnostic performance and portability rely significantly on power availability.

It is associated with damage to plants during feeding and subsequent virus transmission. Yet, global phylogenetic relationships, population structure, and estimation of the rates of gene flow within this whitefly species remain largely unexplored.

We further amplified and sequenced a ~750 bp fragment of mtCOI from an additional 31 samples collected from Kenya in 2014. Based on a total of 248 mtCOI sequences, we identified 16 haplotypes, with extensive overlap across all countries. Population structure analysis did not suggest population differentiation. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the 2014 Kenyan collection of samples clustered with a single sequence from the Netherlands to form a well-supported clade (denoted clade 1a) nested within the total set of sequences (denoted clade 1). Pairwise distances between sequences show greater sequence divergence between clades than within clades. In addition, analysis using migrate-n gave evidence for recent gene flow between the two groups.

When cells undergo cellular respiration, they require a pathway to keep and transfer electrons (i.e., the electron transport chain). Due to oxidation-reduction reactions, the electron transport chain produces a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient.

In the electron transport chain process, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is one of the most vital molecules for carrying and transferring electrons. Therefore, predicting FAD binding sites in the electron transport chain is vital for helping biologists understand the electron transport chain process and  production in cells.We used an independent data set to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which had an accuracy of 69.84 %. We compared the performance of the proposed method in analyzing two newly discovered electron transport protein sequences with that of the general FAD binding predictor presented by Mishra and Raghava and determined that the accuracy of the proposed method improved by 9-45 % and its Matthew's correlation coefficient was 0.14-0.. Furthermore, the proposed method enabled reducing the number of false positives significantly and can provide useful information for biologists.We developed a method that is based on PSSM profiles and SAAPs for identifying FAD binding sites in newly discovered electron transport protein sequences. This approach achieved a significant improvement after we added SAAPs to PSSM features to analyze FAD binding proteins in the electron transport chain. The proposed method can serve as an effective tool for predicting FAD binding sites in electron transport proteins and can help biologists understand the functions of the electron transport chain, particularly those of FAD binding sites.

The proposed design exhibits an improved RF-DC conversion efficiency over a wide frequency range from 1.2 to  GHz. This frequency band is associated with several wireless communication services, for instance, ISM, WLAN, 5G, LTE, and GPS applications. The receiving planar ASDA exhibits circular polarization and has an average measured gain of 4. dBi from 1.2 to  GHz. To enable a wide operating bandwidth, the rectifier circuit is constituted by two architectures, designated A and B. Each scheme is designed to  power efficiently across a specific bandwidth. The optimal performance of both rectifiers are obtained using the nonlinear harmonic-balance simulations. The antenna⁻rectifier integration yields a compact rectenna with a high-efficiency performance over the intended bandwidth from 1.2 to  GHz for an input power of 9 dBm and terminal load resistance of 1 k Ω . The total measured RF-DC conversion efficiency is maintained above 30% across the entire frequency range with a peak value of 61% achieved at 1.2 GHz.
