Insect-specific growth regulators represent attractive control agents because of their safety to the environment and humans. We identified plant compounds that serve as juvenile hormone antagonists (PJHANs). Using the yeast two-hybrid system transformed with the mosquito JH receptor as a reporter system, we demonstrate that PJHANs affect the JH receptor, -tolerant (Met), by disrupting its complex with CYCLE or FISC, formation of which is required for mediating JH action. We isolated five diterpene secondary metabolites with JH antagonist activity from two plants: Lindera erythrocarpa and Solidago serotina. They are effective in causing mortality of mosquito larvae at relatively low LD50 values. Topical application of two diterpenes caused reduction in the expression of Met target genes and retardation of follicle development in mosquito ovaries. Hence, the newly discovered PJHANs may lead to development of a new class of safe and effective pesticides.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30764548>Efficacy of Combinations of  and Deltamethrin as Long-Term Commodity Protectants.</a></h2><p>Wheat, corn, and brown rice were treated with different combinations of a deltamethrin suspension concentrate (SC) formulation and a new emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation, at rates of either 0.5 or 1.0 ppm alone or in combination with 1.25 and 2.5 ppm  (10 treatments in all, including an untreated control). Treated commodities were stored at ambient conditions on the floor of an empty grain bin in Manhattan, KS, USA, in 5-kg lots for individual replicates. The commodities were sampled and bio-assayed every three months for 15 months by exposing 10 mixed-sex parental adults of selected adult stored product insects on 70⁻80 g of the commodity. For all treatments, there was no regression of declining efficacy with respect to the month. Therefore, the data were combined for analysis. On wheat and brown rice, there was no reproduction of  (Fabricius) in any of the treatments, and there was no  loss in either commodity that was caused by feeding of the parental adults or developing progeny. There was reproduction of  (L.) on wheat but, for several combinations, the EC formulation gave better suppression of progeny compared to the standard SC.

Here we report that genetic ablation of the corpus allatum cells of the Drosophila ring gland (the JH source) resulted in JH deficiency, pupal lethality and precocious and enhanced programmed cell death (PCD) of the larval  body. In the  body of the JH-deficient animals, Dronc and Drice, two caspase genes that are crucial for PCD induced by the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), were significantly upregulated. These results demonstrated that JH antagonizes 20E-induced PCD by restricting the mRNA levels of Dronc and Drice. The antagonizing effect of JH on 20E-induced PCD in the  body was further confirmed in the JH-deficient animals by 20E treatment and RNA interference of the 20E receptor EcR. Moreover, MET and GCE, the bHLH-PAS transcription factors involved in JH action, were shown to induce PCD by upregulating Dronc and Drice. In the Met- and gce-deficient animals, Dronc and Drice were downregulated, whereas in the Met-overexpression  body, Dronc and Drice were significantly upregulated leading to precocious and enhanced PCD, and this upregulation could be suppressed by application of the JH agonist .

The ability of this insect to adapt to its chemical environment might be explained by the action of major detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (or CYP). Forty-two sequences coding for P450s were identified and most of the transcripts were found to be expressed in the midgut, Malpighian tubules and fat body of S. frugiperda larvae. Relatively few P450s were expressed in the established cell line Sf9. In order to gain information on how these genes respond to different chemical compounds, larvae and Sf9 cells were exposed to plant secondary metabolites (indole, indole-3-carbinol, quercetin, 2-tridecanone and xanthotoxin), insecticides (deltamethrin, fipronil, , methoxyfenozide) or model inducers (clofibrate and phenobarbital). Several genes were induced by plant chemicals such as P450s from the 6B, 321A and 9A subfamilies. Only a few genes responded to insecticides, belonging principally to the CYP9A family. There was little overlap between the response in vivo measured in the midgut and the response in vitro in Sf9 cells. In addition, regulatory elements were detected in the promoter region of these genes. In conclusion, several P450s were identified that could potentially be involved in the adaptation of S. frugiperda to its chemical environment.© 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23295246>Identification and characterization of two peptidoglycan recognition proteins with zinc-dependent antibacterial activity from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.</a></h2><p>Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) specifically bind to peptidoglycan and play an important role in the innate immune responses as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Here we identified and characterized two PGRPs (HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C) from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The comparative analysis indicated that five amino acids which are required for T7 lysozyme Zn(2+) binding and amidase activity are conserved in HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C, suggesting that the two PGRPs are members of the amidase-type PGRPs. HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C mRNA increased in both the  bodies and the hemocytes after an injection of Gram-negative Escherichia coli or Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Recombinant HaPGRP-B and HaPGRP-C could agglutinate E. coli and S. aureus in a zinc-dependent manner. More importantly, both rHaPGRP-B and rHaPGRP strongly inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus in the presence of Zn(2+). Moreover, the HaPGRP-B mRNA showed up-regulation post hormones (20E and ) injection.

However, the role of Tai isoforms in transducing vitellogenic signal of JH has not been determined. In this study, we show that the migratory locust Locusta migratoria has two Tai isoforms, which differ in an INDEL-1 domain with the PRD-repeat motif rich in histidine and proline at the C-terminus. Tai-A with the INDEL-1 is expressed at levels about 50-fold higher than Tai-B without the INDEL-1 in the fat body of vitellogenic adult females. Knockdown of Tai-A but not Tai-B results in a substantial reduction of vitellogenin expression in the fat body accompanied by the arrest of ovarian development and oocyte maturation, similar to that caused by depletion of both Tai isoforms. Either Tai-A or Tai-B combined with Met can induce target gene transcription in response to JH, but Tai-A appears to mediate a significantly higher transactivation. Our data suggest that the INDEL-1 domain plays a critical role in Tai function during reproduction as Tai-A appears be more active than Tai-B in transducing the vitellogenic JH signal in L. migratoria.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the intracellular JH receptor -tolerant protein (MET) functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional activator for specific JH-regulated genes, some JH responses are mediated by signaling  that are initiated by proteins associated with plasma membrane. It is unknown whether the JH-regulated gene expression depends on the membrane-mediated signal transduction. In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, we found that JH activated the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway and quickly increased the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and intracellular calcium, leading to activation and autophosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). When abdomens from newly emerged mosquitoes were cultured in vitro, the JH-activated gene expression was repressed substantially if specific inhibitors of PLC or CaMKII were added to the medium together with JH. In newly emerged female mosquitoes, RNAi-mediated depletion of PLC or CaMKII considerably reduced the expression of JH-responsive genes, including the Krüppel homolog 1 gene (AaKr-h1) and the early trypsin gene (AaET). JH-induced loading of MET to the promoters of AaKr-h1 and AaET was weakened drastically when either PLC or CaMKII was inactivated in the cultured tissues. Therefore, the results suggest that the membrane-initiated signaling pathway modifies the DNA-binding activity of MET via phosphorylation and thus facilitates the genomic responses to JH. In summary, this study reveals an interplay of genomic and nongenomic signaling mechanisms of JH.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122282>Efficacy of a spot-on combination of fluralaner plus moxidectin (Bravecto Plus) in cats following repeated experimental challenge with a field isolate of Ctenocephalides felis.</a></h2><p>A spot-on formulation of fluralaner plus moxidectin has been designed to provide long-term protection against fleas and ticks, prevent heartworm disease and treat gastrointestinal nematode infections in cats.

In Locusta migratoria, the partially palindromic 15-nt sequence, GAGGTTCGAG(A)/(T)CCT(T)/(C), found upstream of a JH-induced gene, jhp21, was designated as a putative juvenile hormone response element (JHRE). When JH-deprived adult female locusts were treated with the active JH analog, , a  body nuclear factor that bound specifically to JHRE appeared after 24 h. Binding exhibited a preference for an inverted repeat with GAGGTTC in the left half-site, a single nucleotide spacer, and a right half-site in which some variation is acceptable. Binding to JHRE was abolished by phosphorylation catalyzed by a C-type protein kinase present in the nuclear extracts.

In Drosophila, a courting male rejected by a mated female subsequently courts less avidly when paired with a virgin female, a behavioral modification attributed to "courtship memory." Here we show the critical role of hormonal state for maintenance of courtship memory. Ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) is essential for courtship memory through regulation of juvenile hormone (JH) levels in adult males. Reduction of JH levels via silencing of ETH signaling genes impairs short-term courtship memory, a phenotype rescuable by the JH analog . JH-deficit-induced memory impairment involves rapid decay rather than failure of memory acquisition. A critical period governs memory performance during the first 3 days of adulthood. Using sex-peptide-expressing "pseudo-mated" trainers, we find that robust courtship memory elicited in the absence of aversive chemical mating cues also is dependent on ETH-JH signaling. Finally, we find that JH acts through dopaminergic neurons and conclude that an ETH-JH-dopamine signaling cascade is required during a critical period for promotion of social-context-dependent memory.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nuclear localization of Met is crucial for its transcriptional activity. Our previous studies have shown that the chaperone protein Hsp83 facilitates JH-induced Met nuclear import in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of Met nuclear transport are not fully elucidated. Using DNA affinity chromatography, we have previously detected binding of the nucleoporin Nup358, in the presence of JH, to the JH response region (JHRR) sequences isolated from the Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1) promoter. Here, we have demonstrated that Nup358 regulates JH-Hsp83-induced Met nuclear localization. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Nup358 expression in Drosophila fat body perturbs Met nuclear transport during the 3 h after initiation of wandering, when the JH titer is high.

Furthermore, a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain at the N-terminal end of Nup358 interacts with Hsp83 and is indispensable for Met nuclear localization. Overexpression of the TPR domain in Drosophila fat body prevents Met nuclear localization resulting in a decrease in JHRR-driven reporter activity and Kr-h1 expression.

In higher flies like Drosophila, the ancestral receptor germ cell-expressed (gce) gene has duplicated to yield the paralog -tolerant (Met). These paralogous receptors share redundant function during development but play unique roles in adults. Some aspects of JH function apparently require one receptor or the other. To provide a foundation for studying JH receptor function, we have recapitulated endogenous JH receptor expression with single cell resolution. Using Bacteria Artificial Chromosome (BAC) recombineering and a transgenic knock-in, we have generated a spatiotemporal expressional atlas of Met and gce throughout development. We demonstrate JH receptor expression in known JH target tissues, in which temporal expression corresponds with periods of hormone sensitivity. Larval expression largely supports the notion of functional redundancy. Furthermore, we provide the neuroanatomical distribution of JH receptors in both the larval and adult central nervous system, which will serve as a platform for future studies regarding JH action on insect behavior.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8742824>Sex-specific and hormone-controlled expression of a vitellogenin-encoding gene in the gypsy moth.</a></h2><p>Microvitellogenin and vitellogenin cDNA from Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) were tested for use as molecular probes to investigate the expression of genes coding for vitellogenins in Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth).

Both proteins potentially mediate the effect of juvenile hormone (JH) as candidate JH receptors. Here we report that Met and Gce are partially redundant in transducing JH action. Both Met and gce null single mutants are fully viable, but the Met gce double mutant, Met(27) gce(2.5k), dies during the larval-pupal transition. Precocious and enhanced caspase-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) appears in  body cells of Met(27) gce(2.5k) during the early larval stages. Expression of Kr-h1, a JH response gene that inhibits 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)-induced broad (br) expression, is abolished in Met(27) gce(2.5k) during larval molts. Consequently, expression of br occurs precociously in Met(27) gce(2.5k), which may cause precocious caspase-dependent PCD during the early larval stages. Defective phenotypes and gene expression changes in Met(27) gce(2.5k) double mutants are similar to those found in JH-deficient animals. Importantly, exogenous application of JH agonists rescued the JH-deficient animals but not the Met(27) gce(2.5k) mutants. Our data suggest a model in which Drosophila Met and Gce redundantly transduce JH action to prevent 20E-induced caspase-dependent PCD during larval molts by induction of Kr-h1 expression and inhibition of br expression.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Knockdown of the Met gene caused precocious metamorphosis and suppression of ovarian development. However, the function of Met in caste development of social insects is unclear. In termites, JH acts as a central factor for caste development, especially for soldier differentiation, which involves two molts from workers via a presoldier stage. Increased JH titer in workers is needed for the presoldier molt, and the high JH titer is maintained throughout the presoldier period. Although presoldiers have the fundamental morphological features of soldiers, the nature of the cuticle is completely different from that of soldiers. We expected that JH signals via Met are involved in soldier-specific morphogenesis of the head and mandibles during soldier differentiation, especially in the presoldier period, in natural conditions. To test this hypothesis, we focused on soldier differentiation in an incipient colony of the damp-wood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis. Met homolog (ZnMet) expression in heads increased just after the presoldier molt. This high expression was reduced by ZnMet double stranded (dsRNA) injection before the presoldier molt. Although this treatment did not cause any morphological changes in presoldiers, it caused strong effects on soldiers, their mandibles being significantly shorter and head capsules smaller than those of control soldiers. Injection of ZnMet dsRNA throughout the presoldier stage did not affect the formation of soldier morphology, including cuticle formation. These results suggested that the rapid increase in ZnMet expression and subsequent activation of JH signaling just after the presoldier molt are needed for the formation of soldier-specific weapons. Therefore, besides its established role in insect metamorphosis, the JH receptor signaling also underlies soldier development in termites.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

RA activates transcription of ucp-1 and the RA receptor (RAR) is known to be involved in this effect.

The RXR-mediated action of 9-cis RA requires the upstream enhancer region at -2469/-2318 in ucp-1. During brown-adipocyte differentiation RXRalpha and RXRgamma mRNA expression is induced in parallel with UCP-1 mRNA, whereas the mRNA for the three RAR subtypes, alpha, beta and gamma, decreases. Co-transfection of murine expression vectors for the different RAR and RXR subtypes indicates that RARalpha and RARbeta as well as RXRalpha are the major retinoid-receptor subtypes capable of mediating the responsiveness of ucp-1 to retinoids. It is concluded that the effects of retinoids on ucp-1 transcription involve both RAR- and RXR-dependent signalling pathways.

The -tolerant (MET) protein, an intracellular JH receptor, acts as a transcriptional regulator and binds to the promoters of tissue- and stage-specific JH target genes when JH is present. Our recent study has demonstrated that the transcriptional activation by MET is modulated by a membrane-initiated JH signaling pathway, involving phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Here we report that protein kinase C (PKC) is another essential intermediate of this pathway. PKC was activated by JH and this action was PLC-dependent. Inhibition of the PKC activity substantially weakened the JH-induced gene expression in mosquito cells. RNAi experiments indicated that several PKC isoforms were involved in the JH action during the post-emergence development of adult female mosquitoes. JH treatment considerably increased the binding of MET to the promoters of JH response genes in cultured mosquito abdomens that were collected from newly emerged female adults. The JH-induced DNA binding of MET was hindered when the abdomens were treated with a PKC inhibitor and JH. Therefore, the results suggest that PKC modulates the transactivation activity of MET by enhancing the binding of MET to JH response elements in the JH target genes. This mechanism may allow for variable and stage- and tissue-specific genomic responses to JH.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Knockdown of Cdc6 inhibits polyploidization of fat body and follicle cells, resulting in the substantial reduction of Vg expression in the fat body as well as severely impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth.

We have noticed no significant difference of the responses in , the juvenile hormone resistant mutant, suggesting that this action of juvenile hormone may be mediated via a mechanism different from that using nuclear transcription factors. The "uncoupling" effect is caused also by juvenile hormone analogues which are considered inactive in producing morphogenetic effects in Drosophila. Mitochondrial response is independent of transcription and translation, as revealed by the use of RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors.

The adult diapause of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, involves a reproductive arrest accompanied by  storage, reduction of metabolic needs, and preparation to withstand low temperatures. By contrast, nondiapause animals direct nutrient  to muscle activity and reproduction. The photoperiod-dependent switch from diapause to reproduction is systemically transmitted throughout the organism by juvenile hormone (JH).

High concentrations of , in the range of 40-100 nmol/mg of protein could decrease the transmembrane electric potential (Delta Psi) developed by mitochondria and, at the highest concentration,  prevented complete Delta Psi repolarization after ADP addition. The effect was more evident using succinate than with ascorbate+TMPD as substrate. State 3 respiration was approximately 60% inhibited by 80 nmol of /mg of protein, while state 4 respiration, within the same range of  concentrations, showed a slight increase, when both glutamate-malate and succinate were used as substrates. Additionally, FCCP-stimulated respiration was inhibited to an extent comparable to the effect on state 3, which suggests an interaction of  with the respiratory chain, more evident with glutamate/malate as substrate. The activity of complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidorreductase) and that of the segment comprehending complexes II and III (succinate-cytochrome c reductase) were decreased in the presence of  (approximately 60% and 85% of inhibition, respectively, with 300 nmol of /mg of protein), while the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and ATPase do not seem to be affected. Furthermore, the action of  on the mitochondrial permeability transition was also studied, showing that the insecticide (in the range of 30-80 nmol mg(-1) of protein) decreases the susceptibility of liver mitochondria to the opening of the transition pore, even in non-energized mitochondria. These results lead to the conclusion that  interference with hepatic mitochondrial function occurs only for high concentrations, which implies that the noxious effects of the insecticide reported for a number of non-target organisms are not fully attributable to mitochondrial effects. Therefore, it seems that mitochondrial activity does not represent the primary target for  toxic action.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22626792>The fate of follicles after a blood meal is dependent on previtellogenic nutrition and juvenile hormone in Aedes aegypti.</a></h2><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) mediates the relationship between fecundity and nutrition during the gonotrophic cycle of the mosquito in three ways: (1) by regulating initial previtellogenic development, (2) by mediating previtellogenic resorption of follicles and (3) by altering intrinsic previtellogenic follicle "quality", physiology, and competitiveness thereby predetermining the fate of follicles after a blood meal. To support a role for JH in mediating the response of ovarian follicles after a blood meal, we explored three main questions: (1) Do changes in nutrition during the previtellogenic resting stage lead to relevant biochemical and molecular changes in the previtellogenic ovary? (2) Do hormonal manipulations during the previtellogenic resting stage lead to the same biochemical and molecular changes? (3) Does nutrition and hormones during the previtellogenic resting stage affect vitellogenic resorption and reproductive output? We examined the accumulation of neutral lipids in the previtellogenic ovary as well as the previtellogenic expression of genes integral to endocytosis and oocyte development such as the: vitellogenin receptor (AaVgR), lipophorin receptor (AaLpRov), heavy-chain clathrin (AaCHC), and ribosomal protein L32 (rpL32) under various previtellogenic nutritional and hormonal conditions. mRNA abundance and neutral  content increased within the previtellogenic ovary as previtellogenic mosquitoes were offered increasing sucrose concentrations.  application mimicked the effect of offering the highest sucrose concentrations on mRNA abundance and  accumulation in the previtellogenic ovary. These same nutritional and hormonal manipulations altered the extent of vitellogenic resorption. Mosquitoes offered 20% sucrose during the previtellogenic resting stage had nearly 3 times less vitellogenic resorption than mosquitoes offered 3% sucrose despite taking smaller blood meals and developed ∼10% more eggs during the first gonotrophic cycle. Mosquitoes treated with JH III during the previtellogenic resting stage and then offered a blood meal had a ∼40% reduction in the amount of vitellogenic resorption and developed ∼12% more eggs. Taken together, these results suggest that previtellogenic nutrition alters the extent and pattern of resorption after a blood meal through the effect of JH on mRNA abundance and  accumulation in previtellogenic follicles.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254816>RXR Ligands Negatively Regulate Thrombosis and Hemostasis.</a></h2><p>Platelets have been found to express intracellular nuclear receptors including the retinoid X receptors (RXRα and RXRβ). Treatment of platelets with ligands of RXR has been shown to inhibit platelet responses to ADP and thromboxane A2; however, the effects on responses to other platelet agonists and the underlying mechanism have not been fully characterized.The effect of 9--retinoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and  acid on collagen receptor (glycoprotein VI [GPVI]) agonists and thrombin-stimulated platelet function; including aggregation, granule secretion, integrin activation, calcium mobilization, integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling and thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo were determined. Treatment of platelets with RXR ligands resulted in attenuation of platelet functional responses after stimulation by GPVI agonists or thrombin and inhibition of integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Treatment with 9--retinoic acid caused inhibition of thrombus formation in vitro and an impairment of thrombosis and hemostasis in vivo. Both RXR ligands stimulated protein kinase A activation, measured by VASP S157 phosphorylation, that was found to be dependent on both cAMP and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell activity.This study identifies a widespread, negative regulatory role for RXR in the regulation of platelet functional responses and thrombus formation and describes novel events that lead to the upregulation of protein kinase A, a known negative regulator of many aspects of platelet function.

In each study, cats were assigned randomly to blocks of two animals each, based on decreasing pre-treatment  and were randomly allocated to one of two groups of six to 12 cats: untreated (control) or treated with topical fipronil (8.3%, w/v), (S)- (10%, w/v), eprinomectin (0.4%, w/v) and praziquantel (8.3%, w/v) (BROADLINE(®), Merial) at 0.12 mL/kg  (providing a minimum of 10mg fipronil+12 mg S-+0.5mg eprinomectin+10mg praziquantel per kg ). The topical treatment was administered directly on the skin in the midline of the neck in a single spot once on Day 0. For parasite recovery and count, cats were euthanized humanely and necropsied seven or ten days after treatment. A single treatment with the novel topical combination product provided 91% efficacy against Ancylostoma braziliense, ≥ 99% efficacy against Ancylostoma tubaeforme, and >97% efficacy against Toxocara cati. Similarly, excellent efficacy was established against Taenia taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum and Diplopylidium spp. as demonstrated by >97% and up to 100% reductions of cestode counts in the treated cats when compared to the untreated controls (P<0.01). All cats accepted the treatment well based on health observations post-treatment and daily health observations. No adverse experiences or other health problems were observed throughout the studies.

Diapause in this species is initiated in November, undergoes 2 months of a pre-wintering period that is terminated at the end of January, after 1 month of maintenance. In this study, factors that affect the termination of adult diapause in the female of this species were investigated. The experimental material consisted of bees that were brought from nests kept in natural conditions 1 month prior to natural termination of diapause. Three different experimental treatments were planned to evaluate the potential effect of  and temperature on diapause termination. During the 5 day experimental period the first group of females was kept at 4°C, the second group at 15°C and the last group of females was kept at 20°C. All groups of females were treated with  topically at a dose of 200 μg. After  application a significant increase (p<0.001) in the size of terminal oocytes was recorded in the three experimental groups. However, no changes in the size of terminal oocytes between acetone treated and untreated control groups were observed. The number of oocytes progressively increased following topical application of  compared to non-treated or acetone treated females. In successive applications of 200 μg  gradual changes in ovary and  body protein concentration were observed. As compared to controls, protein content in ovaries isolated from -treated females increased, whereas it decreased in  body. The least differences in oocyte size and protein concentration in ovary and  body between control groups and with  application occurred at 4°C. Differences increased and were higher in females kept at 20°C and increased rapidly after  application. Exposure to increasing temperature regimes accelerated the juvenile hormone (JH) induced termination of diapause. Taken together, our results indicate that temperature may play an important role in termination of diapause in O. rufa, but its role is secondary to that played by JH.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously identified two other genes, Apis mellifera buffy (Ambuffy) and Apis mellifera matrix metalloproteinase 1 (AmMMP1), with enriched expression in nurse bee and forager HPGs, respectively. In the present study, to clarify the molecular mechanisms that coordinate HPG physiology with worker behavior, we first analyzed whether Ambuffy, AmMMP1, mrjp2 (a gene encoding one of major royal jelly protein isoforms), and Hbg3 (a gene encoding α-glucosidase III) expression, is associated with worker behavior in 'single-cohort colonies' where workers of almost the same age perform different tasks. Expression of these genes correlated with the worker's role, while controlling for age, indicating their regulation associated with the worker's behavior. Associated gene expression suggested the possible involvement of some hormonal factors in its regulation. We therefore examined the relationship between ecdysone- and juvenile hormone (JH)-signaling, and the expression profiles of these 'indicator' genes (nurse bee HPG-selective genes: mrjp2 and Ambuffy, and forager HPG-selective genes: Hbg3 and AmMMP1). Expression of both ecdysone-regulated genes (ecdysone receptor, mushroom body large type Kenyon cell specific protein-1, and E74) and JH-regulated genes ( tolerant and Krüppel homolog 1) was higher in the forager HPGs than in the nurse bee HPGs, suggesting the possible roles of ecdysone- and JH-regulated genes in worker HPGs. Furthermore, 20-hydroxyecdysone-treatment repressed both nurse bee- and forager-selective gene expression, whereas -treatment enhanced the expression of forager-selective genes and repressed nurse bee-selective genes in the HPGs. Our findings suggest that both ecdysone- and JH-signaling cooperatively regulate the physiological state of the HPGs in association with the worker's behavior.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19563903>Characterization of hexamerin proteins and their mRNAs in the adult lubber grasshopper: The effects of nutrition and juvenile hormone on their levels.</a></h2><p>The lubber grasshopper (Romalea microptera) has three major hemolymph proteins with apparent sizes on native PAGE of 90, 270, and 500kDa and subunit sizes (79, 81 and 82kDa respectively) determined by SDS-PAGE .

Animals fed a restricted diet had their highest hexamerin levels on day 30 which then fell as oocytes reached their maximum length on day 36. Hexamerin mRNA levels were only modestly different for animals on the two diets, indicating that nutrition affected translation of the hexamerin mRNA.

The complete cDNA (2121bp) encodes a 706-amino acid protein with a molecular mass ~82kDa. Expression of RbHex 82 was predominant in fat body among larval tissues. Further, it is prominently expressed during the last instar larval development. Homology modeling and docking studies predicted riboflavin binding site of the hexamerin. Spectrofluorimetric analysis further confirmed riboflavin release from the hexamerin fraction. Quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated hormonal regulation of RbHex 82. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20HE) had a stimulatory effect on its transcription whereas JH alone did not show any effect.

The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78) is a heat shock protein 70-kDa family member and one of the most abundant chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it helps fold newly synthesized peptides. Because of its prominent role in protein folding, and also ER stress, we hypothesized that  might be involved in fat body cell homeostasis and vitellogenesis and a regulatory target of JH. We report here that the migratory locust  possesses two  genes that are differentially regulated by JH. We found that  is regulated by JH through Mcm4/7-dependent DNA replication and polyploidization, whereas  expression is directly activated by the JH-receptor complex comprising -tolerant and Taiman proteins.

Depletion of both  and  resulted in ER stress and apoptosis in the fat body and in severely defective Vg synthesis and oocyte maturation.

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are important enzymes for biotransformations of various endogenous and xenobiotic substances. These enzymes play a major role in developing insecticide resistance in many insect species. In this study, we heterologously co-expressed a CYP enzyme (CYP6FD1) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from L. migartoria in Sf9 insect cells. The recombinant enzymes were assayed for  activity towards six selected model substrates (luciferin-H, luciferin-Me, luciferin-Be, luciferin-PFBE, luciferin-CEE and 7-ethoxycoumarin), and four selected insecticides (deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and ). Recombinant CYP6FD1 showed activity towards 7-ethoxycoumarin and luciferin-Me, but no detectable activity towards the other luciferin derivatives. Furthermore, the enzyme efficiently oxidized deltamethrin to hydroxydeltamethrin through an aromatic hydroxylation in a time-dependent manner. However, the enzyme did not show any detectable activity towards the other three insecticides. Our results provide direct evidence that CYP6FD1 is capable of metabolizing deltamethrin.

The underlying regulatory mechanisms of these compensatory responses remain largely elusive. In the current study, we investigated the initiation of this adaptive response in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, via microarray analysis of gut tissues. Four hours after dietary uptake of PIs, 114 and 150 transcripts were respectively found up- or downregulated. The results suggest a quick trade-off between compensating for potential loss of digestive activity on the one hand, and stress tolerance, defense, and structural integrity of the gut on the other hand. We additionally addressed the role of a group of related upregulated hexamerin-like proteins in the PI-induced response. Simultaneous knockdown of corresponding transcripts by means of RNA interference resulted in a reduced capacity of the locust nymphs to cope with the effects of PI. Moreover, since insect hexamerins have been shown to bind Juvenile Hormone (JH), we also investigated the effect of JH on the proteolytic digestion in L. migratoria.

This dimorphism is established during the post-embryonic development; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms have not yet been examined. We herein assessed the role of juvenile hormone (JH) on the diverging developmental pathways occurring in the male and female Japanese mealybug Planococcus kraunhiae (Kuwana). We provide, for the first time, detailed gene expression profiles related to JH signaling in scale insects. Prior to adult emergence, the transcript levels of JH acid O-methyltransferase, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme in JH biosynthesis, were higher in males than in females, suggesting that JH levels are higher in males. Furthermore, male quiescent pupal-like stages were associated with higher transcript levels of the JH receptor gene, -tolerant and its co-activator taiman, as well as the JH early-response genes, Krüppel homolog 1 and broad. The exposure of male juveniles to an ectopic JH mimic prolonged the expression of Krüppel homolog 1 and broad, and delayed adult emergence by producing a supernumeral pupal stage. We propose that male wing development is first induced by up-regulated JH signaling compared to female expression pattern, but a decrease at the end of the prepupal stage is necessary for adult emergence, as evidenced by the JH mimic treatments. Furthermore, wing development seems linked to JH titers as JHM treatments on the pupal stage led to wing deformation. The female pedomorphic appearance was not reflected by the maintenance of high levels of JH. The results in this study suggest that differential variations in JH signaling may be responsible for sex-specific and radically different modes of metamorphosis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6832479>Juvenile hormone-dependent vitellogenin synthesis in Locusta migratoria  body: inducibility related to sex and stage.</a></h2><p>Juvenile hormone (JH)-dependent vitellogenin (Vg) synthesis in the  body of Locusta migratoria is normally limited to sexually mature adult females. As a step toward examining the basis of this limitation, we have tested female and male locusts in a series of stages after the third larval molt for inducibility of Vg synthesis by the synthetic JH analog, . We find that in the fourth and fifth larval instars  body of both sexes can be induced to produce Vg, but in the adult stage females respond strongly while no more than trace amounts can be induced in males. Quantitative assays show relative responsiveness in the order: adult female greater than fifth instar female greater than fifth instar male much greater than adult male. During the fifth instar of both sexes, maximal vitellogenic response was obtained in midinstar. After the larval-adult ecdysis, female  body was unresponsive during the first 4 days, then responsiveness increased and by Day 8 after ecdysis  bodies were fully as competent to produce Vg as at Day 14, the usual maximum of the first vitellogenic cycle due to endogenous JH. Larval and adult female  bodies implanted into male larvae are competent for Vg synthesis after metamorphosis, so that the differences between adult male and female cannot be imposed by the male milieu intérieur during the larval-adult molt. In male and female precocious adults, produced by treatment of fourth instars with precocene,  body responded to  as in normal adults. We conclude that factors intrinsic to the  body cells, determined early in development, are responsible for differential gene programing in males and females, which is partially expressed by the fifth instar but fully manifest only after a molt in the absence of JH.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754907>Induction of lysosomal phospholipase A2 through the retinoid X receptor in THP-1 cells.</a></h2><p>An acidic phospholipase A(2) (LPLA(2)) was recently purified and cloned.

Whether the same JH signaling pathway regulates both processes is presently unknown. Here, we employ the robust JH response during reproduction and development of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, to compare the function of key JH-signaling genes encoding the JH receptor, -tolerant (Met), its binding partner Taiman (Tai), and a JH-inducible protein, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1). RNA interference (RNAi) with Met or Tai, but not Kr-h1, blocked ovarian development and suppressed vitellogenin gene expression in the  body of females raised under reproduction-inducing conditions. Loss of Met and Tai matched the effects of CA ablation or the natural absence of JH during reproductive diapause. Stimulation of vitellogenesis by treatment of diapausing females with a JH mimic  also required both Met and Tai in the  body, whereas Kr-h1 RNAi had no effect. Therefore, the Met-Tai complex likely functions as a JH receptor during vitellogenesis. In contrast to Met and Kr-h1 that are both required for JH to prevent precocious metamorphosis in P. apterus larvae, removal of Tai disrupted larval ecdysis without causing premature adult development. Our results show that while Met operates during metamorphosis in larvae and reproduction in adult females, its partner Tai is only required for the latter. The diverse functions of JH thus likely rely on a common receptor whose actions are modulated by distinct components.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequent histolysis of developed flight muscles coincided with increased total protein content in some reproductive organs. Initiation of intensive food intake after starvation or application of higher dose of  on macropterous adults changed the resource allocation in favour of growth of reproductive organs and induced precocious histolysis of flight muscles. It indicates an involvement of juvenile hormone in wing morph-related differential allocation of resources in the bug. Increased total protein contents in the ovaries and accessory glands of starved macropterous females and males treated with , respectively, indicate that proteins derived from the -induced histolysis of the flight muscles are re-utilized for the growth of the reproductive organs. It is the first report of persistence of differential resource allocation to flight muscles and reproductive organs in the wing-polymorphic insects with non-functional macropterism.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28369111>Larval diapause termination in the bamboo borer, Omphisa fuscidentalis.</a></h2><p>In insects, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulate larval growth and molting. However, little is known about how this cooperative control is terminating larval diapause especially in the bamboo borer, Omphisa fuscidentalis. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we here measured the expression levels of genes which were affected by juvenile hormone analogue (JHA: S-) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in diapausing O. fuscidentalis larvae. Corresponding mRNA expression changes in the subesophageal ganglion (SG) and prothoracic gland (PG) were evaluated using qRT-PCR. The data showed similar response patterns of JH receptor gene (OfMet), diapause hormone gene (OfDH-PBAN), ecdysone receptor genes (OfEcR-A and OfEcR-B1) and ecdysone inducible genes (OfBr-C, OfE75A, OfE75B, OfE75C and OfHR3). JHA induced the expressions of OfMet and OfDH-PBAN in both SG and PG, whereas ecdysone receptor genes and ecdysone inducible genes were induced by JHA only in PG. For 20E treatment group, expressions of ecdysone receptor genes and ecdysone inducible genes in both SG and PG were increased by 20E injection. In addition, the in vitro experiments showed that OfMet and OfDH-PBAN were up-regulated by JHA alone, but ecdysone receptor genes and ecdysone inducible genes were up-regulated by JHA and 20E. However, OfMet and OfDH-PBAN in the SG was expressed faster than OfMet and OfDH-PBAN in the PG and the expression of ecdysone receptor genes and ecdysone inducible genes induced by JHA was much later than observed for 20E. These results indicate that JHA might stimulate the PG indirectly via factors (OfMet and OfDH-PBAN) in the SG, which might be a regulatory mechanism for larval diapause termination in O. fuscidentalis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28843894>Modulation of gene expression by nutritional state and hormones in Bombyx larvae in relation to its growth period.</a></h2><p>Insect growth and development are mainly regulated via synchronization of many extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as nutrition and hormones. Previously we have demonstrated that larval growth period influences the effect of insulin on the accumulation of glycogen in the fat body of Bombyx larvae. In the present study we demonstrate that Bombyx larvae at the terminal growth period (TGP, after critical weight) had a significantly greater increase in the expression level of Akt in the fat body than at the active growth period (AGP, before critical weight). The larvae at TGP also showed an increase in the expression level of ecdysone receptors (EcRB1 and USP1) and ecdysone-induced early genes (E75A and broad). The treatment of bovine insulin and  to larvae at AGP induced the transcript levels of Akt, irrespective of the nutritional status of the larvae. However, in larvae at TGP, insulin repressed the transcript level of Akt. On contrary, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induced the expression level of Akt in TGP larvae, but at feeding only. Insulin and 20E thus showed an antagonistic action on the Akt expression level in TGP larvae under feeding. The studies thus showed that larval growth period influences the expression level of Akt and ecdysone receptors in Bombyx. Further, the growth period and nutrition modulate the effect of exogenous hormones on Akt expression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about how polyphenisms evolve in natural populations, the developmental mechanisms that may mediate such evolution, and the consequences of such modification for patterns of morphological variation. Here we examine the developmental mechanisms of polyphenism evolution in highly divergent natural populations of the dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. Males of this species express two alternative morphologies in response to larval feeding conditions. Favorable conditions cause males to grow larger than a threshold body size and to develop a pair of horns on their heads. Males that encounter relatively poor conditions during larval life do not reach this threshold size and remain hornless. Exotic populations of O. taurus have diverged dramatically in body size thresholds in less than 40 years since introduction to new habitats, resulting in the expression of highly divergent and novel horn length-body size scaling relationships in these populations. Here we show that larvae of populations that have evolved a larger threshold body size (1) have to accumulate greater mass to become competent to express the horned morph, (2) require more time to complete the final instar, (3) are less sensitive to the juvenile hormone (JH) analogue , and (4) exhibit a delay in the sensitive period for  relative to other developmental events. JH has been shown previously to control horn expression in this species. Our results show that threshold evolution may be mediated via changes in the degree and timing of sensitivity to JH and may result in correlated changes in the dynamics and duration of larval development. Strain-specific differences in JH sensitivity have previously been demonstrated in other insects. However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration that changes in the timing of the sensitive period for JH may play an equally important role in the evolution of novel thresholds.

Synthetic JH-mimicking compounds such as  are employed as potent insecticides against significant agricultural, household and disease vector pests. However, a receptor mediating effects of JH and its insecticidal mimics has long been the subject of controversy. The bHLH-PAS protein -tolerant (Met), along with its Drosophila melanogaster paralog germ cell-expressed (Gce), has emerged as a prime JH receptor candidate, but critical evidence that this protein must bind JH to fulfill its role in normal insect development has been missing. Here, we show that Gce binds a native D. melanogaster JH, its precursor methyl farnesoate, and some synthetic JH mimics. Conditional on this ligand binding, Gce mediates JH-dependent gene expression and the hormone's vital role during development of the fly. Any one of three different single amino acid mutations in the ligand-binding pocket that prevent binding of JH to the protein block these functions. Only transgenic Gce capable of binding JH can restore sensitivity to JH mimics in D. melanogaster Met-null mutants and rescue viability in flies lacking both Gce and Met that would otherwise die at pupation. Similarly, the absence of Gce and Met can be compensated by expression of wild-type but not mutated transgenic D. melanogaster Met protein.

Our goal was to provide mechanistic insights as to how neurosecretory signals mediate division of labor in the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Worker division of labor is based on a process of behavioral maturation by individual bees, which involves performing in-hive tasks early in adulthood, then transitioning to foraging for food outside the hive. Social and nutritional cues converge on endocrine factors to regulate behavioral maturation, but whether neurosecretory systems are central to this process is not known. To explore this, we performed transcriptomic profiling of a neurosecretory region of the brain, the pars intercerebralis (PI). We first compared PI transcriptional profiles for bees performing in-hive tasks and bees engaged in foraging. Using these results as a baseline, we then performed manipulative experiments to test whether the PI is responsive to dietary changes and/or changes in juvenile hormone (JH) levels. Results reveal a robust molecular signature of behavioral maturation in the PI, with a subset of gene expression changes consistent with changes elicited by JH treatment. In contrast, dietary changes did not induce transcriptomic changes in the PI consistent with behavioral maturation or JH treatment. Based on these results, we propose a new verbal model of the regulation of division of labor in honey bees in which the relationship between diet and nutritional physiology is attenuated, and in its place is a relationship between social signals and nutritional physiology that is mediated by JH.© 2015.

It plays a critical role in controlling the gonadotrophic cycles of female mosquitoes by preparing tissues for blood digestion and egg development. Here, we show that in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes JH III control of gene expression is mediated by a heterodimer of two bHLH-PAS proteins-the JH receptor -tolerant (MET) and Cycle (CYC, AAEL002049). We identified Aedes CYC as a MET-interacting protein using yeast two-hybrid screening. Binding of CYC and MET required the presence of JH III. In newly eclosed female mosquitoes, the expression of two JH-responsive genes, Kr-h1 and Hairy, was dependent on both the ratio of light to dark periods and JH III. Their expression was compromised by in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) depletions of CYC, MET, and the steroid receptor coactivator SRC/FISC. Moreover, JH III was not effective in induction of Kr-h1 and Hairy gene expression in vitro in  bodies of female mosquitoes with RNAi-depleted CYC, MET or SRC/FISC. A sequence containing an E-box-like motif from the Aedes Kr-h1 gene promoter specifically interacted with a protein complex, which included MET and CYC from the female mosquito  body nuclear extract. These results indicate that a MET/CYC heterodimer mediates JH III activation of Kr-h1 and Hairy genes in the context of light-dependent circadian regulation in female mosquitoes during posteclosion development.

Using this approach, we identified the Drosophila melanogaster gene takeout. takeout is upregulated in a variety of long-lived flies, and extends life span when overexpressed. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of takeout-dependent longevity. takeout overexpression specifically in the  body is sufficient to increase fly longevity and is additive to the longevity effects of Dietary Restriction. takeout long-lived flies do not show phenotypes often associated with increased longevity, such as enhanced stress resistance or major metabolic abnormalities. However, males exhibit greatly diminished courtship behavior, leading to a reduction in fertility. Interestingly, takeout contains a binding domain for Juvenile Hormone, a fly hormone that plays a role in the regulation of developmental transitions. Importantly, the longevity and courtship phenotypes of takeout overexpressing flies are reversed by treatment with the Juvenile Hormone analog . These data suggest that takeout is a key player in the tradeoff-switch between fertility and longevity. takeout may control fertility via modulation of courtship behavior. This regulation may occur through Juvenile Hormone binding to takeout and a subsequent reduction in Juvenile Hormone signaling activity.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here we combine treatment with the juvenile hormone analog (JHa)  and experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster to study the potential role of juvenile hormone (JH) in mediating such trade-offs at both the physiological and evolutionary level. Exposure to JHa in the larval medium (and up to 24 h posteclosion) increased early life fecundity but reduced life span of normal (unselected) flies, supporting the physiological role of JH in mediating the trade-off. This effect was much smaller for life span, and not detectable for fecundity, in fly lines previously bred for 19 generations on a medium containing JHa. Furthermore, these selection lines lived longer than unselected controls even in the absence of JHa treatment, without a detectable reduction in early life fecundity. Thus, selection for resistance to JHa apparently induced some evolutionary changes in JH metabolism or signaling, which led to longer life span as a correlated response. This supports the hypothesis that JH may mediate evolution of longer life span, but--contrary to our expectation-this apparently does not need to trade--off with fecundity.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20688076>Total body nitrogen and total body carbon as indicators of body protein and body lipids in the melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae: effects of , a juvenile hormone analogue, and of diet supplementation with hydrolyzed yeast.</a></h2><p>The application of , and providing access to diet including hydrolyzed yeast, are treatments known to enhance mating success in the male melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae Coquillett (Diptera: Tephritidae), supporting their use in mass rearing protocols for sterile males in the context of sterile insect technique (SIT) programmes.

Total body carbon (TBC) and total body nitrogen (TBN) of flies were measured at regular intervals from emergence to 35 days of age for each of the different treatments. Nitrogen assimilation and turnover in the flies were measured using stable isotope ((15)N) dilution techniques. Hydrolyzed yeast incorporation into the diet significantly increased male body weight, TBC and TBN as compared to sugar-fed males. Females had significantly higher body weight, TBC and TBN as compared to all males. TBC and TBN showed age-dependent changes, increasing until the age of sexual maturity and decreasing afterwards in both sexes.  treatment did not significantly affect TBC or TBN. The progressive increase with age of TBC suggests that lipogenesis occurs in adult male B. cucurbitae, as is the case in other tephritids. Stable isotope dilution was shown to be an effective method for determining N uptake in B. cucurbitae. This technique was used to show that sugar-fed males rely solely on larval N reserves and that the N uptake rate in males with access to diet including hydrolyzed yeast was higher shortly after emergence and then stabilized.

Nicrophorus orbicollis adult females fed a less preferred mealworm larvae diet gained less  mass, had smaller ovaries and had lower titers of JH in their hemolymph than females fed a preferred blowfly diet. When presented a carcass for breeding, females on a less preferred diet oviposited 33% fewer eggs, and eggs were of 18% less mass. Females on the less preferred diet also took longer to begin oviposition as indicated indirectly by the time when their eggs hatched.

Here, we report that the takeout gene is an essential component of nutritional homeostasis in Drosophila. takeout encodes a putative juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein and has been described as a link between circadian rhythm and feeding behaviour. However, the physiological role of takeout and its putative link to JH remain unknown. In this study, we show that takeout (to(1)) flies failed to adapt their food intake according to food availability and that most defects could be genetically rescued. When food is abundant, to(1) are hyperphagic, yielding to hypertrophy of the  body. When food reappears after a starvation period, to(1) flies do not increase their food intake as much as wild-type flies. This defect in food intake regulation is partly based on the action of Takeout on taste neurons, because the sensitivity of to(1) gustatory neurons to sugars does not increase after starvation, as in wild-type neurons. This lack of regulation is also evident at the locomotor activity, which normally increases during starvation, a behaviour related to food foraging. In addition, to(1) flies lack sexual dimorphism of locomotor activity, which has previously been linked to the JH circulating level. Moreover, application of the JH analog  rescues the phenotype.

This method represents an effective assay for determination of JH titers. The 2.1-kb 5' promoter region of the Early Trypsin (ET) gene, which is specifically expressed in the female midgut under the control of JH during the PE phase, was utilized to genetically engineer the Ae. aegypti mosquito line with the ET-Gal4 activator. We then established the ET-GAL4>UAS-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) system in Ae. aegypti. In ET-Gal4>UAS-EGFP female mosquitoes, the intensity of the midgut-specific EGFP signal was observed to correspond to the ET gene transcript level and follow the JH titer during the PE phase. The EGFP signal and the EGFP transcript level were significantly diminished in midguts of transgenic female mosquitoes after RNA interference depletion of the JH receptor -tolerant (Met), providing evidence of the control of ET gene expression by Met. Topical JH application caused premature enhancement of the EGFP signal and the EGFP transcript level in midguts of newly eclosed ET-Gal4>UAS-EGFP female mosquitoes, in which endogenous JH titer is still low.

Amino acid mutations in Met may have affected changes in ligand selectivity intermittently over the course of the evolution of the JH-signaling pathway. These findings are useful to improve the existing (developing) cultured cell-based assay system and may shed light on the relationship between functional diversification in hormonal signaling and the molecular evolution of hormone receptors.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29934338>A Crucial Caste Regulation Gene Detected by Comparing Termites and Sister Group Cockroaches.</a></h2><p>Sterile castes are a defining criterion of eusociality; investigating their evolutionary origins can critically advance theory. In termites, the soldier caste is regarded as the first acquired permanently sterile caste. Previous studies showed that juvenile hormone (JH) is the primary factor inducing soldier differentiation, and treatment of workers with artificial JH can generate presoldier differentiation. It follows that a shift from a typical hemimetabolous JH response might be required for soldier formation during the course of termite evolution within the cockroach clade. To address this possibility, analysis of the role of JH and its signaling pathway was performed in the termite  and compared with the wood roach , a member of the sister group of termites.

To partially fill this gap, we have studied the role of Smad factors in the metamorphosis of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica. In D. melanogaster, Mad is the canonical R-Smad of the BMP branch of the TGF-β signaling pathway, Smox is the canonical R-Smad of the TGF-β/Activin branch and Medea participates in both branches. In insects, metamorphosis is regulated by the MEKRE93 pathway, which starts with juvenile hormone (JH), whose signal is transduced by -tolerant (Met), which stimulates the expression of Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) that acts to repress E93, the metamorphosis trigger. In B. germanica, metamorphosis is determined at the beginning of the sixth (final) nymphal instar (N6), when JH production ceases, the expression of Kr-h1 declines, and the transcription of E93 begins to increase. The RNAi of Mad, Smox and Medea in N6 of B. germanica reveals that the BMP branch of the TGF-β signaling pathway regulates adult ecdysis and wing extension, mainly through regulating the expression of bursicon, whereas the TGF-β/Activin branch contributes to increasing E93 and decreasing Kr-h1 at the beginning of N6, crucial for triggering adult morphogenesis, as well as to regulating the imaginal molt timing.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-four dogs of various age, sex, weight and coat length were divided into two homogeneous groups, treated (T) and control (C), and housed into twin outdoor kennels. Trial baseline was designed as day 0, when dogs from group T were treated with a commercial spot-on formulation of fipronil 10%+(S)- 9%, while subjects from group C were left untreated and served as control. After treatment, tick load for each included dog was estimated, for both adult and immature ticks, using the localization and count over the entire body surface at the following time-points: day 2, to evaluate the speed of kill and at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 to assess the persistence of efficacy. The effect of water exposure on the product efficacy was tested at day 14 of the study, when six dogs, homogenously selected from group T, were soaked through with plain water. The overall tick load in dogs from group C was high throughout the entire study period, ranging from 103.2 (day 28) to 161.3 (day 0), and confirmed the high tick pressure. Speed of kill calculated at 48 h post-treatment was slightly higher for adult ticks (96.2%) than for immature stages (91.6%). Compared to the control, dogs treated with the fipronil+(S)- maintained a significantly lower mean tick load for both adult and immature stages in the four weeks of observation. Persistence of efficacy against immature stages ranged from 97.1% the first week, 99.6% second week, 99.7 third week and 93.1% in the last week. In the same way, efficacy against adult ticks was constantly high, shifting from 94.5% to 92.5%. Overall efficacy (adults+immatures) was the strongest in the first two weeks (i.e., 96.1% and 96.6%) and lowered in the two remaining weeks (i.e., 94.2% and 93.4%).

The early JH-inducible gene Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) plays a key role in the repression of metamorphosis as a mediator of JH action. Previous studies demonstrated that Kr-h1 inhibits precocious larval-pupal transition in immature larva via direct transcriptional repression of the pupal specifier Broad-Complex (BR-C). JH was recently reported to repress the adult specifier gene Ecdysone-induced protein 93F (E93); however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we found that JH suppressed ecdysone-inducible E93 expression in the epidermis of the silkworm Bombyx mori and in a B. mori cell line. Reporter assays in the cell line revealed that the JH-dependent suppression was mediated by Kr-h1. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis identified a consensus Kr-h1 binding site (KBS, 14 bp) located in the E93 promoter region, and EMSA confirmed that Kr-h1 directly binds to the KBS. Moreover, we identified a C-terminal conserved domain in Kr-h1 essential for the transcriptional repression of E93 Based on these results, we propose a mechanism in which JH-inducible Kr-h1 directly binds to the KBS site upstream of the E93 locus to repress its transcription in a cell-autonomous manner, thereby preventing larva from bypassing the pupal stage and progressing to precocious adult development. These findings help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating the metamorphic genetic network, including the functional significance of Kr-h1, BR-C, and E93 in holometabolous insect metamorphosis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28544235>Absence of juvenile hormone signalling regulates the dynamic expression profiles of nutritional metabolism genes during diapause preparation in the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi.</a></h2><p>Temperate insects have evolved diapause, a period of programmed developmental arrest during specific life stages, to survive unfavourable conditions. During the diapause preparation phase (DPP), diapause-destined individuals generally store large amounts of fat by regulating nutrition distribution for the  requirement during diapause maintenance and postdiapause development. Although nutritional patterns during the DPP have been investigated at physiological and biochemical levels in many insects, it remains largely unknown how nutritional metabolism is regulated during the DPP at molecular levels. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression profiles of adult female cabbage beetles Colaphellus bowringi during the preoviposition phase (POP) and the DPP. Most differentially expressed genes were involved in specific metabolic pathways during the DPP. Genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways were clearly highly expressed during the DPP, whereas genes related to protein metabolic pathways were highly expressed during the POP. Hormone challenge and RNA interference experiments revealed that juvenile hormone via its nuclear receptor -tolerant mediated the expression of genes associated with nutritional metabolism during the DPP.

Within the first, second, and third larval instars, the mRNA levels of LdChSAa, LdChSAb, and LdChSB coincide with the peaks of circulating 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). In vitro culture of midguts and an in vivo bioassay revealed that 20E and an ecdysteroid agonist halofenozide stimulated the expression of the three LdChSs. Conversely, a reduction of 20E by RNA interference (RNAi) of an ecdysteroidogenesis gene LdSHD repressed the expression of these LdChSs, and ingestion of halofenozide by LdSHD RNAi larvae rescued the repression. Moreover, disruption of 20E signaling by RNAi of LdEcR, LdE75, LdHR3, and LdFTZ-F1 reduced the expression levels of these genes. Similarly, in vitro culture and an in vivo bioassay showed that exogenous JH and a JH analog  activated the expression of the three LdChSs, whereas a decrease in JH by RNAi of a JH biosynthesis gene LdJHAMT downregulated these LdChSs.

In some processes, JH plays a critical role in defining the action of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). In  mosquitoes, JH prepares newly emerged female adults to become competent to synthesize vitellogenin in response to 20E after blood ingestion. The molecular basis of this competence is still not well understood. Here, we report that JH regulates pre-mRNA splicing of the  gene, which encodes a key transcriptional regulator required for both JH- and 20E-controlled gene expression. JH stimulated the production of the Taiman isoforms A/B, while reducing the levels of the isoforms C/D, in the fat body after adult eclosion. The appearance of the A/B isoforms in maturing mosquitoes was accompanied by acquisition of the competence to respond to 20E. Depletion of the A/B isoforms, by inhibiting the alternative splicing or by isoform-specific RNA interference, considerably diminished the 20E-induced gene expression after a blood meal and substantially impaired oocyte development. In accordance with this observation, further studies indicated that in the presence of 20E, the Taiman A/B isoforms showed much stronger interactions with the 20E receptor complex than the Taiman C/D isoforms. In contrast, all four isoforms displayed similar capabilities of forming active JH receptor complexes with the -tolerant protein (Met).

The gene expressed highly and periodically in the epidermis during each of molts, whereas no transcripts were detected in the midgut and fat body. 20-hydroxyecdysone and the ecdysone agonist RH5992 suppressed CfCHS1 expression, whereas the juvenile hormone analog  induced CfCHS1 expression. These results implicate that CfCHS1 is involved in the chitin synthase and new chitin formation during molting in the insect.© 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'gut epithelium']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17123540>Modulation of larval nutrition affects midgut neutral  storage and temporal pattern of transcription factor expression during mosquito metamorphosis.</a></h2><p>During holometabolous insect development the critical weight marks a physiological transition after which juvenile hormone (JH) concentration decreases to such a level that a subsequent increase in ecdysone titer will initiate metamorphosis. Starvation experiments indicate that the Aedes aegypti critical weight is achieved by 24 h after the last larval-larval molt. When grown at 24 degrees C with excess food, the time between the critical weight and maximum weight (interval to cessation of growth) is about 24 h and pupation occurs about 24 h after the maximum weight is achieved. Oil Red O staining of 3rd and early 4th instars indicates that the midgut is a neutral  storage organ during this period. Coincident with the attainment of the critical weight is the depletion of stored midgut neutral . Application of  to 24 h post-molt 4th instars results in renewed midgut storage of neutral  suggesting that midgut neutral  storage is a JH dependent process. Starvation of 4th instars during the 24 h post-molt period suspends development in a fraction of the larvae, and with the resumption of feeding, development resumes. A regimen of starvation and resumption of feeding of 4th instars suggests that JH concentration decreased over a 40 h period after the resumption of feeding and maximum weight is attained about 48 h after the resumption of feeding. We hypothesize that this results in a shortening of the interval to cessation of growth. Real-time PCR experiments indicate that shortening the interval to cessation of growth compresses the time period during which increases in AHR3, AaEcR-B and AaUSP-a expression occur.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29122840>Juvenile hormone signaling in short germ-band hemimetabolan embryos.</a></h2><p>The role of juvenile hormone (JH) in insect embryos is far from understood, especially in short germ-band hemimetabolan species. To shed light on this issue, we depleted the mRNA levels of Krüppel homolog 1, -tolerant and JH acid -methyltransferase, key elements of JH signaling, in embryos of the short germ-band hemimetabolan species  This precluded the formation of the germ-band anlage in a group of embryos. Hatchability was also reduced, which might have been caused by premature upregulation of laccase 2, a promoter of cuticle tanning. In other cases, development was interrupted in mid embryogenesis, involving defects related to dorsal closure and appendage formation. These phenotypes possibly result from the low levels of Broad-complex (BR-C) produced under JH-depleted conditions. This contrasts with holometabolan species, in which JH does not promote  expression, which remains low during embryo development. Possibly, the stimulatory role of JH on  expression and the morphogenetic functions of BR-C in hemimetabolan embryos were lost in holometabolan species. If so, this might have been a key driver for the evolution of holometabolan metamorphosis.© 2017.

In the  mosquito, a vector of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses, the  tissue (the fat body, which is an analogue of the vertebrate liver) produces yolk proteins for developing oocytes. JH is important for the fat body to acquire competence for yolk protein production. However, the molecular mechanisms of how JH promotes mosquito reproduction are not completely understood. In this study we show that stimulation of the JH receptor -tolerant (Met) activates expression of genes encoding the regulator of ribosome synthesis 1 (RRS1) and six ribosomal proteins (two ribosomal large subunit proteins, two ribosomal small subunit proteins, and two mitochondrial ribosomal proteins). Moreover, RNAi-mediated depletion of  decreased biosynthesis of the ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32). Depletion of , , or  led to retardation of ovarian growth and reduced mosquito fecundity, which may at least in part have resulted from decreased vitellogenin protein production in the fat body. In summary, our results indicate that JH is critical for inducing the expression of ribosomal protein genes and demonstrate that RRS1 mediates the JH signal to enhance both ribosomal biogenesis and vitellogenesis.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16983666>Effect of juvenile hormone on vitellogenin gene expression in the  body of burying beetles, Nicrophorus orbicollis.</a></h2><p>In the burying beetles, Nicrophorus orbicollis, it is not clear the extent to which synthesis of Vitellogenin (Vg) is under hormonal control.

JH esterases (JHEs) can control JH titer by regulating JH degradation. Although the biochemistry and structure of JHEs have been well studied, regulation of their expression remains unclear. We identified three putative JHEs (JHE1, JHE2, JHE3) in the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi, and investigated the regulation of their expression by JH signaling in non-diapause-destined (NDD, reproductive) and diapause-destined (DD) female adults. Sequence and phylogenetic tree analyses indicate that the three putative JHEs shared conserved motifs with the JHEs of other insects and one crustacean, and were similar to Coleopteran, Dipteran, Orthopteran, Hymenopteran, and Decapodan JHEs. They were, however, less closely related to Hemipteran and Lepidopteran JHEs. JHEs were more highly expressed in NDD female adults than in DD female adults. JH analog induction in DD female adults significantly upregulated the expression of JHE1 and JHE2, but had no effect on the expression of JHE3. Knockdown of the JH candidate receptor -tolerant (Met) in NDD female adults downregulated the expression of all three JHEs. These results suggest that JHE expression is positively correlated with JH signaling, and that Met may be involved in the JH-mediated differential expression of JHE in DD and NDD adult female C. bowringi.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In some plant species, such activity has been attributed to diterpene secondary metabolites. Plant JHD diterpenes disrupt insect development by interfering with the juvenile hormone (JH)-mediated formation of JH receptor complexes.

In addition to the in vitro JHD activity, the diterpene and the plant extract from L. erythrocarpa also disrupt the development of larvae and pupae in Drosophila melanogaster. Comparing the transcriptomes of juvenile hormone analog (JHA, )- and JHD (methyl lucidone)-fed wandering third-instar larvae revealed a large number of genes that were coregulated by JHA and JHD. Moreover, most (83%) of the genes that were repressed by methyl lucidone were significantly activated by , indicating that JHDs and JHAs have opposing effects on the transcriptional regulation of many JH-dependent genes.

This activity reaches a peak at 24 h following eclosion, and then drops to lower levels by 48 h. This pattern is not observed in males, consistent with the hypothesis that polyamine synthesis is involved in ovarian maturation in Drosophila. Abdomens isolated within 2 h of adult eclosion do not display elevated ODC activity or ovarian maturation. However, a 250-ng dose of the juvenile hormone analog  (ZR-515) applied in acetone to these abdomens, recovers ovarian maturation and causes a 5-10 fold increase in enzyme activity over controls treated with acetone alone.

In the present study, the biosynthesis of Vg precursors in the  bodies of females and males was examined using a short radiopulse with 35S-methionine/cysteine and 32P-orthophosphate. The glycosylation of the Vg precursors was examined by digestion with endoglycosidase H and by the inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin. The data showed that in both females and males, the synthesis of the vitellogenin precursor occurred in a stepwise fashion: (1) the co-translational glycosylation of Vg203; (2) the post-translational phosphorylation of Vg203 to form Vg220; (3) the proteolytic processing of Vg220 to form the constituent Vg polypeptides. The 203 and 220 kDa Vg precursors of females and males appeared to be similarly glycosylated and phosphorylated. The additional processing of Vg112 to Vg85 was more pronounced in the  bodies of males than in females, and appears to account for the quantitative difference in the distribution of these polypeptides in VgF and VgM. Finally, the major oligosaccharides of VgF and VgM appear to be those of N-linked mannose residues.

Disease-transmitting female mosquitoes have adapted uniquely for ingestion and utilization of the huge blood meal required for swift reproductive events to complete egg development within a 72-h period. We investigated the network of regulatory factors mediating sequential gene expression in the fat body, a multifunctional organ analogous to the vertebrate liver and adipose tissue, of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses revealed that ~7500 transcripts are differentially expressed in four sequential waves during the 72-h reproductive period. A combination of RNA-interference gene-silencing and in-vitro organ culture identified the major regulators for each of these waves. Amino acids (AAs) regulate the first wave of gene activation between 3 h and 12 h post-blood meal (PBM). During the second wave, between 12 h and 36 h, most genes are highly upregulated by a synergistic action of AAs, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the Ecdysone-Receptor (EcR).

After completing metamorphosis, young workers have low titers of juvenile hormone and spend the first several weeks of their adult lives performing tasks within the hive. Older workers, approximately 3 weeks of age, have high titers of juvenile hormone and forage outside the hive for nectar and pollen. We have previously reported that changes in the volume of the mushroom bodies of the honey bee brain are temporally associated with the performance of foraging. The neuropil of the mushroom bodies is increased in volume, whereas the volume occupied by the somata of the Kenyon cells is significantly decreased in foragers relative to younger workers. To study the effect of flight experience and juvenile hormone on these changes within the mushroom bodies, young worker bees were treated with the juvenile hormone analog  but a subset was prevented from foraging (big back bees). Stereological volume estimates revealed that, regardless of foraging experience, bees treated with  had a significantly larger volume of neuropil in the mushroom bodies and a significantly smaller Kenyon cell somal region volume than did 1-day-old bees. The bees treated with  did not differ on these volume estimates from untreated foragers (presumed to have high endogenous levels of juvenile hormone) of the same age sampled from the same colony. Bees prevented from flying and foraging nonetheless received visual stimulation as they gathered at the hive entrance. These results, coupled with a subregional analysis of the neuropil, suggest a potentially important role of visual stimulation, possibly interacting with juvenile hormone, as an organizer of the mushroom bodies. In an independent study, the brains of worker bees in which the transition to foraging was delayed (overaged nurse bees) were also studied. The mushroom bodies of overaged nurse bees had a Kenyon cell somal region volume typical of normal aged nurse bees. However, they displayed a significantly expanded neuropil relative to normal aged nurse bees. Analysis of the big back bees demonstrates that certain aspects of adult brain plasticity associated with foraging can be displayed by worker bees treated with  independent of foraging experience. Analysis of the overaged nurse bees suggests that the post-metamorphic expansion of the neuropil of the mushroom bodies of worker honey bees is not a result of foraging experience.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455350>Exquisite ligand stereoselectivity of a  juvenile hormone receptor contrasts with its broad agonist repertoire.</a></h2><p>The sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH) is vital to insect development and reproduction. Intracellular JH receptors have recently been established as basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLH)/PAS proteins in  known as germ cell-expressed (Gce) and its duplicate paralog, -tolerant (Met). Upon binding JH, Gce/Met activates its target genes. Insects possess multiple native JH homologs whose molecular activities remain unexplored, and diverse synthetic compounds including insecticides exert JH-like effects. How the JH receptor recognizes its ligands is unknown. To determine which structural features define an active JH receptor agonist, we tested several native JHs and their nonnative geometric and optical isomers for the ability to bind the  JH receptor Gce, to induce Gce-dependent transcription, and to affect the development of the fly. Our results revealed high ligand stereoselectivity of the receptor. The geometry of the JH skeleton, dictated by two stereogenic double bonds, was the most critical feature followed by the presence of an epoxide moiety at a terminal position. The optical isomerism at carbon C11 proved less important even though Gce preferentially bound a natural JH enantiomer. The results of receptor-ligand-binding and cell-based gene activation assays tightly correlated with the ability of different geometric JH isomers to induce gene expression and morphogenetic effects in the developing insects. Molecular modeling supported the requirement for the proper double-bond geometry of JH, which appears to be its major selective mechanism. The strict stereoselectivity of Gce toward the natural hormone contrasts with the high potency of synthetic Gce agonists of disparate chemistries.© 2019 Bittova et al.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106118>Leptin receptor overlapping transcript (LepROT) gene participates in insulin pathway through FoxO.</a></h2><p>Leptin receptor overlapping transcript (LepROT) is co-transcribed with the leptin receptor (LepR). However, the function and mechanism of LepROT in insulin pathway is unclear. In this study, we report the function of LepROT in maintaining consistent FoxO transcription. LepROT is constitutively expressed during larval development. 20-Hydroxyecdysone, , and insulin have no effect on the transcription of LepROT. However, the knockdown of LepROT by dsRNA injection in larvae causes delay of the development of Helicoverpa armigera. Knockdown of LepROT results in the upregulation of FoxO and downregulation of PI3K. The knockdown of LepROT also results in the subcellular translocation of FoxO from cytoplasm to nuclei. By contrast, overexpression of LepROT in the HaEpi cell line inhibits FoxO expression. Results suggest that LepROT participates in insulin signaling.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

GCE is a homolog of D. melanogaster  tolerant protein (MET), a key mediator of anti-metamorphic signaling in insects and the putative juvenile hormone receptor. Recently, it has been shown that the functions of MET and GCE are only partially redundant and tissue specific. The ability of bHLH-PAS proteins to fulfill their function depends on proper intracellular trafficking, determined by specific sequences, i.e. the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the nuclear export signal (NES). Nevertheless, until now no data has been published on the GCE intracellular shuttling and localization signals. We performed confocal microscopy analysis of the subcellular distribution of GCE fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and YFP-GCE derivatives which allowed us to characterize the details of the subcellular traffic of this protein. We demonstrate that GCE possess specific pattern of localization signals, only partially consistent with presented previously for MET. The presence of a strong NLS in the C-terminal part of GCE, seems to be unique and important feature of this protein. The intracellular localization of GCE appears to be determined by the NLSs localized in PAS-B domain and C-terminal fragment of GCE, and NESs localized in PAS-A, PAS-B domains and C-terminal fragment of GCE. NLSs activity can be modified by juvenile hormone (JH) and other partners, likely 14-3-3 proteins.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26284698>To be or not to be? Mating success and survival trade-offs when switching between alternative reproductive tactics.</a></h2><p>Hormones underlie the decision of assuming a territorial or a nonterritorial role, with territorial individuals usually having higher hormonal levels than nonterritorial individuals. As a territorial status is linked to higher mating opportunities, it is unclear why animals do not keep high hormonal levels and one explanation is that this would imply survival costs. We have tested this using males of the territorial damselfly Argia emma in the field. We increased juvenile hormone (JH) levels using  in both territorial and nonterritorial males and predicted that: (i) males will keep (the case of territorial males) or become (the case of nonterritorial males) territorial after hormonal increase, and (ii) there will be an increase in mating success for nonterritorial males only and an impaired survival for both male tactics. Hormonally treated males remained or became territorial but had their survival impaired compared with control groups. Also, hormonally treated, ex-nonterritorial males increased their mating success compared with the other control, nonterritorial males. The reduced survival can be explained proximally by the  devoted either to the enhanced aggression showed during territory defence or immune function (as detected previously in damselflies). Although nonterritorial males may increase their mating success by switching to a territorial tactic, they are possibly unable to do it naturally as JH is dietary dependent and usually nonterritorial animals are in poorer condition than territorial animals.© 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

In the present study, we identified the partial sequence of a putative S. littoralis insulin receptor (Spoli-InR) and investigated the stage (age)- and tissue-dependent expression profile of Spoli-InR in addition to Spoli-ILPs during the last larval development and larval-pupal metamorphosis. Spoli-ILP1 and Spoli-ILP2 were specifically expressed in the brain, and their gene expressions were gradually decreased in concert with larval-pupal development. On the other hand, Spoli-InR was expressed in all the selected tissues (brain, testis,  body, Malpighian tubules, prothoracic glands and midgut), though the gene expression pattern was different among the tissues. Interestingly, the transcript expression pattern of Spoli-InR in the  body seemed to relate with larval-pupal development. In a parallel experiment, the juvenile hormone mimetic  was able to prolong the larval period when applied before the commitment peak of ecdysteroids titer in the hemolymph, and in this case the expression of Spoli-ILPs and Spoli-InR was affected. These results demonstrated first a relationship between transcript expression of Spoli-ILPs and larval-pupal development, and second they suggested the effect of ILPs may be controlled by not only Spoli-ILPs expression but also Spoli-InR expression.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-two Beagle dogs were selected for this study and eight replicates of four animals were formed based on  within sex. One dog in each replicate was randomly allocated to treatment with: (1) untreated control; (2) fipronil 10% (w/v) solution, (3) (S)- 9% (w/v) solution, and (4) fipronil 10% (w/v) and (S)- 9% (w/v) combination solution. Treatments were applied once topically on Day 0 at the rate of 0.067 ml/kg. On Days -12, -1, 21, and weekly to Day 84 each dog was infested with approximately 200 fleas and comb counted approximately 24h later, or 2 days (our 48 h) after in the case of Day -1 infestation. On Days -11, 1, 22, and weekly to Day 85 each dog was again infested with approximately 200 fleas. Flea eggs were collected over approximately 24 h beginning 3 days after infestation. Fleas were combed off of the dogs and counted at the end of the egg collection period (approximately 96 h count). One aliquot of up to about 100 eggs, if available, from each animal at each infestation time was incubated for approximately 72 h to determine larval hatch and the other for 35 days to determine the number of adults that developed.

Similarly, the combination spot-on of 10% (w/v) fipronil and 9% (w/v) (S)- provided excellent control of adult fleas, i.e., >95% for 5 weeks. From week 6 post-treatment onward, the relatively low inhibition of adult flea emergence substantiated the lack of significant ovicidal/larvicidal activity in the fipronil (10%, w/v) treatment group. However, the combination product provided excellent (>90%) ovicidal activity for 8 weeks and high (91.4%) inhibition of adult flea emergence for 12 weeks. In addition, a synergistic effect of the two compounds in combination was demonstrated with fipronil enhancing the ovicidal and inhibition of adult flea emergence activity of (S)- against cat flea eggs.

An appropriate JH titer in hemolymph is essential for normal development in insects. Information concerning its carrier partner protein, juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP), provides an alternative approach to understanding how JH regulates metamorphosis. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the Omphisa juvenile hormone binding protein (OfJHBP). The full-length OfJHBP cDNA sequence is comprised of 849 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 726bp encoding 242 amino acids. The molecular mass of the protein was estimated to be 26.94kDa. The deduced protein sequence of OfJHBP showed moderate homology with the lepidopteran, Heliothis virescens JHBP (52% amino acid identity) and lower homology with the Bombyx mori JHBP (45%) and the Manduca sexta JHBP (44%). The OfJHBP was expressed mainly in the  body. OfJHBP transcripts in the  body was moderately high during 3rd, 4th and 5th instars, then rapidly increased, reaching a peak during early diapause. The expression remained high in mid-diapause, then decreased in late-diapause until the pupal stage. Both juvenile hormone analog (JHA), , 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) exhibited a similar stimulatory pattern in OfJHBP expression of diapausing larvae. OfJHBP mRNA levels gradually increased and showed a peak of gene expression on the penultimate, then declined to low levels in the pupal stage. For in vitro gene expression, both of JHA and 20E induced OfJHBP mRNA expression in  body.  body maintenance in vitro in the presence of 0.1μg/50μl JHA induced OfJHBP mRNA expression to high levels within the first 30min whereas 0.1μg/50μl 20E induced gene expression at 120min. To study the synergistic effect of these two hormones,  body was incubated in vitro with 0.1μg/50μl JHA or 0.1μg/50μl 20E or a combination of both hormone for 30min. Induction of OfJHBP expression by JHA and 20E was significantly greater than that of either hormone alone. These results should contribute to our understanding of how JHBP and JH regulate the termination of larval diapause in the bamboo borer.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared to ecdysone signaling, the molecular action of JH is less well established because -tolerant (Met) as the JH receptor has been identified until recently. In vitro studies have indicated that Met forms an active JH-dependent complex with one partner protein, Taiman (Tai). However, the related studies on Tai's role in insect metamorphosis are very limited. In this study, five Tai isoforms differing in C-terminal region are identified from the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis, an important worldwide pest infesting fruits and vegetables. The spatiotemporal expression pattern analysis indicates that BdTai-A and BdTai-B are highly expressed in early larvae while BdTai-D is more abundant in middle-late larvae. Meanwhile, in vivo  stress leads to dramatic expression pattern fluctuation of BdTai isoforms. The subsequent reverse genetic study reveal that all Tai isoforms (denoted as "Tai-core") depletion in larvae stage of B. dorsalis produce precocious larvae-pupae development, i.e. shortened pupation process and miniature pupae. Further knockdown of individual Tai isoform show that silence of BdTai-E causes the same phenotype as of BdTai-core RNAi. The current data suggest that BdTai-E is involved in transducing the JH signal that represses metamorphosis. Besides, isoforms should be considered when studying Tai functions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To better understand arthropod hormone evolution and regulation, here we describe the hormonal pathway genes (e.g. those involved in hormone biosynthesis, degradation, regulation and signal transduction) of a new decapod model, the shrimp Neocaridina denticulata. The majority of known insect sesquiterpenoid and ecdysteroid pathway genes and their regulators are contained in the N. denticulata genome. In the sesquiterpenoid pathway, these include biosynthetic pathway components: juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT); hormone binding protein: juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP); and degradation pathway components: juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), juvenile hormone esterase binding protein (JHEBP) and juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (JHEH), with the JHBP, JHEBP and JHEH genes being discovered in a crustacean for the first time here. Ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway genes identified include spook, phantom, disembodied, shadow and CYP18. Potential hormonal regulators and signal transducers such as allatostatins (ASTs), -tolerant (Met), Retinoid X receptor (RXR), Ecdysone receptor (EcR), calponin-like protein Chd64, FK509-binding protein (FKBP39), Broad-complex (Br-c), and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone/molt-inhibiting hormone/gonad-inhibiting hormone (CHH/MIH/GIH) genes are all present in the shrimp N. denticulata.

Its involvement in gene activation is known to be mediated by the transcription factor -tolerant (Met), which turns on JH-controlled genes by directly binding to E-box-like motifs in their regulatory regions. However, it remains unclear how JH represses genes. We used the Aedes aegypti female mosquito, in which JH is necessary for reproductive maturation, to show that a repressor, Hairy, is required for the gene-repressive action of JH and Met. The RNA interference (RNAi) screen for Met and Hairy in the Aedes female fat body revealed a large cohort of Met- and Hairy-corepressed genes. Analysis of selected genes from this cohort demonstrated that they are repressed by JH, but RNAi of either Met or Hairy renders JH ineffective in repressing these genes in an in vitro fat-body culture assay. Moreover, this JH action was prevented by the addition of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to the culture, indicating the existence of an indirect regulatory hierarchy. The lack of Hairy protein in the CHX-treated tissue was verified using immunoblot analysis, and the upstream regions of Met/Hairy-corepressed genes were shown to contain common binding motifs that interact with Hairy.

AAs induced the expression of TOR and S6K (S6 kinase), whereas RNAi-mediated silencing of these two TOR pathway genes and rapamycin application strongly inhibited the AAs-induced Vg synthesis.

Application of JH III on the RNAi (Rheb and TOR) and rapamycin-treated females partially rescued the Vg expression. Conversely, knockdown of either jmtN or met (-tolerant, JH receptor) and application of JH III had no effects on mRNA levels of Rheb, TOR and S6K and phosphorylation of S6K.

These signs of nucleolar activation correlate with the synthetic rate and accumulation of poly(A)- RNA (predominantly ribosomal RNA) in the  body cells. The amount of poly(A)- RNA in  body cells increases during the first 2 days after eclosion and then declines gradually. The rate of RNA synthesis exhibits similar kinetics, but both the rise and the decline are sharper than for the accumulation of RNA. All the characteristics of nucleolar activation, its enlargement, accumulation of poly(A)- RNA, and the increased rate of RNA synthesis, are blocked by removal of the corpora allata (CA) in newly eclosed adult females but could be restored by either implantation of CA or topical application of juvenile hormone III or its analog, 7-S-, to allatectomized females. Thus, previtellogenic activation of  body nucleoli for ribosomal RNA production is controlled by juvenile hormone from the corpora allata.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23866071>Juvenile hormone regulation of Drosophila aging.</a></h2><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) has been demonstrated to control adult lifespan in a number of non-model insects where surgical removal of the corpora allata eliminates the hormone's source. In contrast, little is known about how juvenile hormone affects adult Drosophila melanogaster. Previous work suggests that insulin signaling may modulate Drosophila aging in part through its impact on juvenile hormone titer, but no data yet address whether reduction of juvenile hormone is sufficient to control Drosophila life span. Here we adapt a genetic approach to knock out the corpora allata in adult Drosophila melanogaster and characterize adult life history phenotypes produced by reduction of juvenile hormone. With this system we test potential explanations for how juvenile hormone modulates aging.A tissue specific driver inducing an inhibitor of a protein phosphatase was used to ablate the corpora allata while permitting normal development of adult flies. Corpora allata knockout adults had greatly reduced fecundity, inhibited oogenesis, impaired adult  body development and extended lifespan. Treating these adults with the juvenile hormone analog  restored all traits toward wildtype. Knockout females remained relatively long-lived even when crossed into a genotype that blocked all egg production. Dietary restriction further extended the lifespan of knockout females. In an analysis of expression profiles of knockout females in fertile and sterile backgrounds, about 100 genes changed in response to loss of juvenile hormone independent of reproductive state.Reduced juvenile hormone alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. Reduced juvenile hormone limits reproduction by inhibiting the production of yolked eggs, and this may arise because juvenile hormone is required for the post-eclosion development of the vitellogenin-producing adult  body. Our data do not support a mechanism for juvenile hormone control of longevity simply based on reducing the physiological costs of egg production. Nor does the longevity benefit appear to function through mechanisms by which dietary restriction extends longevity. We identify transcripts that change in response to juvenile hormone independent of reproductive state and suggest these represent somatically expressed genes that could modulate how juvenile hormone controls persistence and longevity.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189269>Role of Kruppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) in methyl farnesoate-mediated vitellogenesis in the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus.</a></h2><p>Similar to the role of juvenile hormone (JH) in insects, methyl farnesoate (MF), the unepoxidized form of JH III, regulates many developmental processes in crustaceans, such as molting and reproduction. We have previously showed that the JH receptor, -tolerant (Met), which is also a candidate receptor for MF, might be involved in the MF-mediated vitellogenesis in the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. In this study, the role of Kruppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), a transcription factor downstream Met in JH signaling, was further investigated. The deduced protein of Pt-Kr-h1 contained seven repeats of zinc finger motifs, similar to Kr-h1s from other crustacean species, but differing from the eight zinc finger motifs found in insect Kr-h1s. MF treatment in vitro induced the expression of Pt-Kr-h1 in hepatopancreas but not ovary, which is similar to the MF-responsive pattern of Pt-Met as previously reported. Moreover, the expression of Pt-Kr-h1 decreased significantly after treating with Pt-Met dsRNA, strongly indicating that the Pt-Kr-h1 might be involved in the Met-mediated MF signaling pathway. RNAi of Pt-Met and Pt-Kr-h1 both led to a decrease in vitellogenin (Vg) expression, and the reduction cannot be rescued by adding MF, suggesting the regulation of vitellogenesis by MF may act through Met and Kr-h1. These results would help to enhance the current understanding of the regulatory mechanism of MF signaling, and provide a vital resource for further research into the evolution of hormonal  in arthropods.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In Lepidoptera which major agricultural pests belong to, JH signaling is critically controlled by a species-specific high-affinity, low molecular  JH-binding protein (JHBP) in hemolymph, which transports JH from the site of its synthesis to target tissues. Hence, JHBP is expected to be an excellent target for the development of novel specific insect growth regulators (IGRs) and insecticides. A better understanding of the structural biology of JHBP should pave the way for the structure-based drug design of such compounds. Here, we report the crystal structure of the silkworm Bombyx mori JHBP in complex with two molecules of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), one molecule (MPD1) bound in the JH-binding pocket while the other (MPD2) in a second cavity. Detailed comparison with the apo-JHBP and JHBP-JH II complex structures previously reported by us led to a number of intriguing findings. First, the JH-binding pocket changes its size in a ligand-dependent manner due to flexibility of the gate α1 helix. Second, MPD1 mimics interactions of the epoxide moiety of JH previously observed in the JHBP-JH complex, and MPD can compete with JH in binding to the JH-binding pocket. We also confirmed that , which has an MPD-like structure, inhibits the complex formation between JHBP and JH while the unepoxydated JH III (methyl farnesoate) does not. These findings may open the door to the development of novel IGRs targeted against JHBP. Third, binding of MPD to the second cavity of JHBP induces significant conformational changes accompanied with a cavity expansion. This finding, together with MPD2-JHBP interaction mechanism identified in the JHBP-MPD complex, should provide important guidance in the search for the natural ligand of the second cavity.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23523827>Nuclear receptors HR96 and ultraspiracle from the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), developmental expression and induction by xenobiotics.</a></h2><p>The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda is a major polyphagous pest in agriculture and little is known on how this insect can adapt to the diverse and potentially toxic plant allelochemicals that they ingest or to insecticides. To investigate the involvement of nuclear receptors in the response of S. frugiperda to its chemical environment, we cloned SfHR96, a nuclear receptor orthologous to the mammalian xenobiotic receptors, pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). We also cloned ultraspiracle (USP), the ortholog of retinoid X receptor (RXR) that serves as partner of dimerization of PXR and CAR. Cloning of SfUSP revealed the presence of two isoforms, SfUSP-1 and SfUSP-2 in this species, that differ in their N-terminal region. The expression of these receptors as well as the ecdysone receptor was studied during specific steps of development in different tissues. SfHR96 was constitutively expressed in larval midgut,  body and Malpighian tubules throughout the last two instars and pupal stage, as well as in Sf9 cells. EcR and SfUSP-2 showed peaks of expression before larval moults and during metamorphosis, whereas SfUSP-1 was mainly expressed in the pre-pupal stage. Receptor induction was followed after exposure of larvae or cells to 11 chemical compounds. SfHR96 was not inducible by the tested compounds. EcR was significantly induced by the 20-hydroxyecdysone agonist, methoxyfenozide, and SfUSP showed an increase expression when exposed to the juvenile hormone analog, .

Metabolism in female mosquitoes is tightly coupled with blood meal-mediated reproduction, which requires an extremely high level of  consumption. Functional analysis has shown that major genes encoding for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (LM) in the mosquito fat bodies are down-regulated at the end of the juvenile hormone (JH)-controlled posteclosion (PE) phase but exhibit significant elevation in their transcript levels during the post-blood meal phase (PBM), which is regulated mainly by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Reductions in the transcript levels of genes encoding triacylglycerol (TAG) catabolism and β-oxidation enzymes were observed to correlate with a dramatic accumulation of lipids in the PE phase; in contrast, these transcripts were elevated significantly and lipid stores were diminished during the PBM phase. The RNAi depletion of -tolerant (Met) and ecdysone receptor (EcR), receptors for JH and 20E, respectively, reversed the LM gene expression and the levels of lipid stores and metabolites, demonstrating the critical roles of these hormones in LM regulation. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) RNAi-silenced mosquitoes exhibited down-regulation of the gene transcripts encoding TAG catabolism and β-oxidation enzymes and an inability to use lipids effectively, as manifested by TAG accumulation.

While many field studies have demonstrated the negative impact of tributyltin (TBT) upon female gastropods, the mechanism(s) underlying imposex development has not yet been fully clarified. Over the years several hypotheses have been raised to determine the biochemical and molecular determinants of this process. Nevertheless, the interplay between the different suggested pathways (neuroendocrine, steroid and retinoid) is still unknown. Hence, through a combination of exposure experiments, we show that the 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cisRA), the proposed natural ligand of the retinoic X receptor (RXR), induces imposex in females of Nucella lapillus to the same degree as tributyltin, when administered at similar concentrations (1 microg/g ).  acid, a selective ligand for RXR, also induces imposex, albeit to a lower degree than that of the positive control. In contrast, testosterone significantly induced imposex, but had no effect on female penis induction, while the neuropeptide APGWamide had no effect on imposex development. These results clearly demonstrate that imposex induction in N. lapillus is mediated through the modulation of the RXR signalling pathways. In addition to the effects reported in female dogwhelks, both TBT and RA significantly increased male penis length, thus suggesting that TBT may also impact male secondary sex organs through the RXR signalling pathways. As a step for future studies, we have cloned the orthologue of N. lapillus RXR and provide experimental evidence that it binds 9cisRA. Finally, the basal expression level of RXR in several tissues of N. lapillus was determined through real-time PCR, thus showing that RXR is ubiquitously expressed in mollusc tissues, with the highest expression levels being recorded in female and male gonads.

Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that six genes were highly expressed in the head which contained the JH biosynthetic gland (corpora allata).

The reproductive castes in termites include primary and neotenic reproductives; primary reproductives found a new colony whereas neotenics succeed them in the reproductive role when the primary reproductives die or become senescent. Neotenics usually differentiate from nymphs or workers by developing functional gonads while retaining juvenile characteristics; however, the developmental mechanism during neotenic differentiation remains poorly understood. Juvenile hormone (JH) mediates a number of aspects of developmental regulation in caste differentiation in termites. In the present study we quantified JH titres in neotenic reproductives of Reticulitermes speratus, and compared these with other developmental stages. In addition, expression changes in JH signalling gene homologues (-tolerant [Met], Krüppel-homolog1, Broad-Complex) in the head, thorax and abdomen were investigated during neotenic differentiation. Finally, we examined the function of Met in reproduction of neotenics by RNA interference (RNAi). Our results showed that the JH titres of neotenics were significantly higher than those of nymphs and workers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of imidacloprid 10%/permethrin 50% and of fipronil 10%/S- 12% against ticks in naturally infected dogs and to assess methodological parameters to calculate drug efficacy on tick immature stages. From July to August 2004, 45 privately owned dogs of various sexes, ages, breeds, coat length and habits were enrolled in a trial carried out in an area (radius approximately 50km) in Southern Italy. Three homogeneous groups (both for dog population and tick population) were formed: 15 dogs treated with imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% spot-on (group A), 15 dogs treated with fipronil 10% and  12% spot-on (group B) and 15 untreated dogs (group C). The dogs in each group were then sub-grouped according to their age and . Two different treatments were administered (time 0 and +28 days) to groups A and B, and the dogs were checked weekly for tick infestation until day +56 post-treatment (p.t.). Twenty-four areas distributed on the whole  surface were examined for ticks at each follow-up, while only at time 0 and at day +56 p.t., ticks were collected from the dogs and identified. For the immature stages a semi-quantitative method was adopted and the load of immature stages was evaluated and grouped into four classes up to day +56 p.t. when the mean number of immature ticks (MIT) for each infection class was evaluated. All the adult ticks collected were identified as brown dog ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Immature stages were first compared at day +28 p.t.. The efficacy of both products used in groups A and B on adult ticks was high and generally very similar. Conversely, the efficacy of imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% against immatures was higher than that of fipronil 10% and  12% throughout the observation period with statistically significant differences (p<0.05) at day +28 p.t.

We studied the regulation of molting and metamorphosis in bed bugs with a goal to identify key players involved. qRT-PCR studies on the expression of genes known to be involved in molting and metamorphosis showed high levels of Krüppel homolog 1 [Kr-h1, a transcription factor that plays key roles in juvenile hormone (JH) action] mRNA in the penultimate nymphal stage (N4).

Although 20E has been well characterized as the molting hormone, its precursor ecdysone (E) has been considered to be a relatively inactive compound because it has little or no effect on classic EcR mediated responses. I found that feeding E to wild-type third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster accelerates the metamorphic timing, which results in elevation of lethality during metamorphosis and reduced body size, while 20E has only a minor effect. The addition of a juvenile hormone analog (JHA) to E impeded their precocious pupariation and thereby rescued the reduced body size. The ability of JHA impeding the effect of E was not observed in the -tolerant (Met) and germ-cell expressed (gce) double mutant animals lacking JH signaling, indicating that antagonistic action of JH against E is transduced via a primary JH receptor, Met, or a product of its homolog, Gce. I also found that L3 larvae are susceptible to E around the time when they reach their minimum viable weight. These results indicate that E, and not just 20E, is also essential for proper regulation of developmental timing and body size. Furthermore, the precocious pupariation triggered by E is impeded by the action of JH to ensure that animals attain body size to survive metamorphosis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The developing larva is nourished by the -rich, milk-like secretions from a modified female accessory gland (milk gland). An essential feature of the lactation process involves  mobilization for incorporation into the milk. In this study, we examined roles for juvenile hormone (JH) and insulin/IGF-like (IIS) signaling pathways during tsetse pregnancy. In particular, we examined the roles for these pathways in regulating  homeostasis during transitions between non-lactating (dry) and lactating periods. The dry period occurs over the course of oogenesis and embryogenesis, while the lactation period spans intrauterine larvigenesis. Genes involved in the JH and IIS pathways were upregulated during dry periods, correlating with  accumulation between bouts of lactation. RNAi suppression of Forkhead Box Sub Group O (FOXO) expression impaired lipolysis during tsetse lactation and reduced fecundity. Similar reduction of the JH receptor  tolerant (Met), but not its paralog germ cell expressed (gce), reduced  accumulation during dry periods, indicating functional divergence between Met and gce during tsetse reproduction. Reduced  levels following Met knockdown led to impaired fecundity due to inadequate  reserves at the initiation of milk production. Both the application of the JH analog (JHA)  and injection of insulin into lactating females increased stored lipids by suppressing lipolysis and reduced transcripts of lactation-specific genes, leading to elevated rates of larval abortion. To our knowledge, this study is the first to address the molecular physiology of JH and IIS in a viviparous insect, and specifically to provide a role for JH signaling through Met in the regulation of  during insect lactation.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

After receiving seminal products, which include the systemic regulator juvenile hormone (JH), females enter a post-mating period lasting several days during which they enhance their oviposition rate and lose interest in remating. To elucidate the regulation of these behavioral changes in L. hesperus, biogenic amines were quantified in the heads of females at 5 min, 1 h and 24 h after copulation and compared to levels in virgins using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection. Mating significantly increased dopamine (DA) after 1 and 24 h, and decreased octopamine (OA) after 5 min and 1 h. Serotonin did not change with mating, but tyramine was significantly reduced after 5 min. While injection of amines into virgin females did not influence sexual receptivity, OA caused a decrease in oviposition during the 24 h following injection. Topical application of the JH analog  to virgins caused an increase in DA, and a decline in mating propensity, but did not influence other amines or the oviposition rate. The results suggest the decline in OA observed immediately after mating may promote egg laying, and that male-derived JH may induce an increase in DA that could account for the post-mating loss of sexual receptivity.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27570150>Decrease in  tolerant and Taiman expression reduces juvenile hormone effects and enhances the levels of juvenile hormone circulating in males of the linden bug Pyrrhocoris apterus.</a></h2><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) produced by the corpus allatum (CA) stimulates vitellogenesis and reduces the synthesis of hexamerin proteins in adult females of Pyrrhocoris apterus. At present it is unknown whether the signaling pathway involving the JH receptor gene  tolerant (Met) and its binding partner Taiman (Tai), regulates the synthesis of accessory gland proteins (ACPs) and hexamerin proteins or effects male survival. Knockdown of genes by injecting Met dsRNA or Tai dsRNA, reduced the amount of ACPs whilst enhancing the amount of hexamerin mRNA in the fat body and the release of hexamerin proteins into haemolymph, as occurs after the ablation of CA. Lifespan was enhanced by injecting Met but not Tai dsRNA. Diapause associated with the natural absence of JH had a stronger effect on all these parameters than the ablation of CA or the knockdown of genes. This indicates there is an additional regulating agent. Both Met and Tai dsRNA induced a several fold increase in JH (JH III skiped bisepoxide) but a concurrent loss of Met or Tai disabled its function.

Here, using the transgene-based CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated and characterized mutants of the silkworm  FOXO () to elucidate its physiological functions during development of this lepidopteran insect. The  mutant (FOXO-M) exhibited growth delays from the first larval stage and showed precocious metamorphosis, pupating at the end of the fourth instar (trimolter) rather than at the end of the fifth instar as in the wild-type (WT) animals. However, different from previous reports on precocious metamorphosis caused by juvenile hormone (JH) deficiency in silkworm mutants, the total developmental time of the larval period in the FOXO-M was comparable with that of the WT. Exogenous application of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) or of the JH analog rescued the trimolter phenotype.

To examine a role for JH in male reproductive behavior we created males with reduced levels of Juvenile Hormone Acid O-Methyl Transferase (JHAMT) and tested them for courtship. JHAMT regulates the last step of JH biosynthesis in the Corpora Allata (CA), the organ of JH synthesis.

In agreement with this, reducing JHAMT conditionally in mature flies led to courtship defects that were rescuable by .

However, we still do not understand the mechanism by which JH regulates long-day (LD)-induced reproductive diapause. In this study, we use a cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi, which is a serious pest of cruciferous vegetables in Asia capable of entering reproductive diapause under LD conditions, as a model to test whether JH regulates female reproductive diapause similar to the mechanism of SD-induced diapause. Our results showed that the JH analog (JHA)  significantly induced ovarian development but inhibited lipid accumulation of diapause-destined adults. Meanwhile, the transcripts of the vitellogenin (Vg) genes were upregulated, whereas the expression of the fat synthesis and stress tolerance genes were downregulated. RNA interference of the JH candidate receptor gene -tolerant (Met) blocked JH-induced ovarian development and Vg transcription, suggesting a positive regulatory function for JH-Met signaling in reproduction. Furthermore, under reproduction-inducing conditions, Met depletion promoted a diapause-like phenotype, including arrested ovarian development and increased lipid storage, and stimulated the expression of diapause-related genes involved in lipid synthesis and stress tolerance, suggesting JH-Met signaling plays an important role in the inhibition of diapause. Accordingly, our data indicate that JH acts through Met to facilitate development of the reproductive system by upregulating Vg expression while inhibiting diapause by suppressing lipid synthesis and stress tolerance in the cabbage beetle. Combined with previous studies in SD-induced reproductive diapause, we conclude that JH may regulate female reproductive diapause using a conserved Met-dependent pathway, regardless of the length of the photoperiod inducing diapause in insects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Manduca sexta in particular has been an excellent model for identifying the myriad components of the phenoloxidase (PO) cascade and their activation through exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). However, in a process that is not well characterized or understood, some insect species rapidly melanize upon wounding in the absence of added PAMPs. We sought to better understand this process by measuring wound-induced melanization in four insect species. Of these, only plasma from late 5th instar M. sexta was unable to melanize, even though each contained millimolar levels of the putative melanization substrate tyrosine (Tyr). Analysis of Tyr  using substrate-free plasmas (SFPs) from late 5th instar larvae of each species showed that only M. sexta SFP failed to melanize with added Tyr. In contrast, early instar M. sexta larvae exhibited wound-induced melanization and Tyr , and SFPs prepared from these larvae melanized in the presence of Tyr. Early instar melanization in M. sexta was associated with the formation of a high mass protein complex that could be observed enzymatically in native gels or by PO-specific immunoblotting. Topical treatment of M. sexta larvae with the juvenile hormone (JH) analog  delayed pupation and increased melanizing ability late in the instar, thus linking development with immunity. Our results demonstrate that melanization rates are highly variable in Lepidoptera, and that developmental stage can be an important factor for melanization within a species. More specifically, we show that the physiological substrate for melanization in M. sexta is Tyr, and that melanization is associated with the formation of a PO-containing protein complex.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Queens are both long-lived and fertile, whereas workers, derived from the same genome, are both relatively short-lived and normally sterile. It has been suggested, on the basis of results from workers, that vitellogenin (Vg), best known as a yolk protein synthesized in the abdominal  body, acts as an antioxidant to promote longevity in queen bees. We explored this hypothesis, as well as related roles of insulin-IGF-1 signaling and juvenile hormone. Vg was expressed in thorax and head  body cells in an age-dependent manner, with old queens showing much higher expression than workers. In contrast, Vg expression in worker head was much lower. Queens also were more resistant to oxidative stress than workers. These results support the hypothesis that caste-specific differences in Vg expression are involved in queen longevity. Consistent with predictions from Drosophila, old queens had lower head expression of insulin-like peptide and its putative receptors than did old workers. Juvenile hormone affected the expression of Vg and insulin-IGF-1 signaling genes in opposite directions.

Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins -tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism. Our findings identify a metabolically significant paradigm of adult somatic organ remodelling linking hormonal signals, epithelial plasticity, and reproductive output.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25017142>Krüppel-homolog 1 mediates juvenile hormone action to promote vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation in the migratory locust.</a></h2><p>Juvenile hormone (JH) prevents insect larval metamorphosis and stimulates processes for adult reproduction. Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), a zinc finger transcription factor, is shown to mediate the anti-metamorphic effect of JH in both holometabolous and hemimetabolous insects. However, the role of Kr-h1 in JH-mediated reproduction has not been determined. Using the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, we showed here that Kr-h1 was expressed in response to JH in female adults, and Kr-h1 transcription was directly regulated by the JH-receptor complex comprised of -tolerant (Met) and steroid receptor co-activator. We demonstrated that Kr-h1 RNAi phenocopied Met RNAi and JH-deprived condition during post-eclosion development and vitellogenesis of female locusts. Knockdown of Kr-h1 resulted in substantial reduction of Vg expression in the  body and  accumulation in the primary oocytes, accompanied by blocked follicular epithelium development, oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Our data therefore reveal a crucial role of Kr-h1 in insect vitellogenesis and egg production. This study suggests that JH-Met-Kr-h1 signaling pathway is also functional in insect reproduction.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Hybridization to abdominal epidermal RNA from different stages showed that the genes for the 12.8 and 13.3 kDa proteins were expressed only during larval life. By contrast, the gene for the 14.6 kDa protein was expressed throughout the segment during the feeding, growing larval stages, then only in the flexible intersegmental regions during the deposition of endocuticle in the pharate pupa and adult. Quantitative RNA dot blot hybridizations showed that the RNA for each protein disappeared during the larval molt when the ecdysteroid titer was high, then reappeared during the preecdysial deposition of endocuticle. All disappeared when the epidermis became pupally committed at the onset of wandering. Exposure of the fourth instar epidermis to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE) in vitro under conditions that lead to the formation of a new larval cuticle by 48 hr caused the disappearance of these RNAs by 18 hr. Exposure of Day 2 fifth instar epidermis to 20HE in vitro caused a depression of these RNAs which in the case of the RNAs coding for the 12.8 and 13.3 kDa proteins was partially prevented by simultaneous exposure to , a juvenile hormone (JH) mimic. By contrast, the RNA for the 14.6 kDa protein was suppressed by exposure to  alone. Thus, each of these larval cuticular genes is turned off by high ecdysteroid; the presence or absence of JH determines whether or not this suppression is permanent in some or all cells.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12173294>Purification and characterization of biliverdin-binding vitellogenin from the hemolymph of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura.</a></h2><p>Biliverdin-binding vitellogenin (Vg) was purified from adult female hemolymph of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura, by using gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies. The molecular mass of the protein was 490 kDa and it was composed of two 188-kDa subunits. Three internal amino acid sequences obtained by digestion of the protein with lysylendopeptidase showed high similarity to those of Bombyx mori Vg, supporting the purified blue protein to be vitellogenin. latroscan analyses demonstrated the presence of biliverdin in Vg that occupied 2.4% of total  components. Among the lipids of Vg (9.5 micrograms total lipids per 100 micrograms protein), diacylglycerol was the most predominant, followed by phospholipid, hydrocarbons, and then triacylglycerol, while in biliverdin-binding proteins (BPs) purified from larval hemolymph (3.1 micrograms total lipids per 100 micrograms protein), phospholipid was the most abundant  followed by diacylglycerol; hydrocarbons and triacylglycerol were minor components. Vg was first detected in the hemolymph of female pupae one day before eclosion, but injection of 5 micrograms of  into a 3-day-old pupa induced Vg in the hemolymph 4 days earlier than in the control.  also induced a faster decline in BP-A and BP-B titers in the hemolymph with a corresponding increase of the Vg titer. These results suggest that juvenile hormone (JH) induces not only vitellogenesis but also the uptake of these proteins by stimulating the metamorphosis of  body during the pupal stage.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'weight']</p></html>
