Recent data also demonstrate efficacy in Crohn's  (CD); however, little is known about target drug levels to achieve endoscopic remission.We performed a retrospective analysis of IBD patients on maintenance golimumab. Median trough levels were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test, and logistic regression was used to construct a probabilistic model to determine sensitivity and specificity of levels predicting mucosal healing.Fifty-eight patients on maintenance golimumab were included (n = 39 CD, n = 19 UC/IBD-unclassified [IBDU]). Forty percent (n = 23) were cotreated with an immunomodulator, 95% (n = 55) of patients were anti-TNF experienced, and 15.5% (n = 9) had 3 or more prior biologic therapies. Forty-four percent of patients achieved mucosal healing with endoscopic response in a further 26% of patients. Clinical remission was recorded in 41% of patients, and 82% had clinical response. Patients were treated with doses generally higher than the approved maintenance dose. In CD patients, median golimumab trough levels were higher in patients with mucosal healing (8.8 μg/mL vs 5.08 μg/mL, P = 0.03). After calculation of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for mucosal healing vs nonresponse, a trough level >8 μg/mL was associated with mucosal healing, with 67% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 3:4.Treatment with golimumab was associated with mucosal healing in 44% of all IBD patients. Higher golimumab levels were associated with mucosal healing in CD. These findings support the need for prospective studies to determine target golimumab levels in IBD, which may impact current clinical practices in relation to selection of maintenance dosing.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of  cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced  in mice.</a></h2><p>IBD () is a chronic, non-specific,  gastrointestinal  that mainly consists of Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are still unclear. B10 (IL-10 producing regulatory B) cells, a subset of regulatory B cells, are known to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the aberrant frequency of B10 cells is associated with IBD. We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced IBD model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease colitis severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production by ManLAM-treated B cells contributes to keeping the balance between CD4 T cell subsets and protect mice from DSS-induced IBD.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656567>Recent advances in monoclonal antibody therapy in IBD: practical issues.</a></h2><p>The advent of monoclonal antibody therapies has revolutionised  (IBD) treatment and delivered great benefits to patients. The optimal use of this class of drugs requires careful management and a clear understanding of their properties. In this review article, we consider how to maximise the benefit of our most novel biological agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. For each agent, we consider practical aspects including dose flexibility, evidence for use in combination with a conventional immunomodulator and the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring. We also address positioning of the various mechanisms and agents in treatment algorithms as well as important aspects of managing patients receiving monoclonal antibodies, such as  reassessment. Finally, we look ahead to the future of monoclonal antibodies, where not only have biosimilars increased the number of agents available but there are also a range of novel mechanisms currently in late phase clinical trials.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Previous studies demonstrate differences in  severity and phenotype of Asian patients with Crohn's  (CD), including Bangladeshi Asians within the UK. No study has evaluated the impact of ethnicity on response to anti-TNFs.Our primary endpoint was a comparison of failure-free survival on first prescribed anti-TNF (anti-tumor necrosis factor) therapy in UK Bangladeshi and Caucasian patients with CD. Our secondary aims were to evaluate  phenotype, indication for anti-TNF prescription, and duration from diagnosis until first anti-TNF prescribed between groups.The records of consecutive outpatient appointments over a 12-month period were used to identify Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Information on patient demographics, ethnicity,  phenotype, immunomodulator use, outcome from first biologic, duration of therapy, and reason for cessation was recorded.In total, 224 Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients were prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Bangladeshi patients started an anti-TNF 4.3 years earlier after diagnosis than Caucasian patients (3.9 years vs. 8.2 years: p < 0.01). Bangladeshi patients experienced shorter failure-free survival than Caucasian patients (1.8 vs. 4.8 years p < 0.01). By 2 years, significantly more Bangladeshi patients had stopped anti-TNF due to loss of response (OR 6.35, p < 0.01).This is the first study to suggest that Bangladeshi patients resident in the UK with CD respond less well to treatment with TNF antagonists than Caucasian patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662575>Investigation of the efficacy of a dietetic food in the management of chronic enteropathies in dogs.</a></h2><p>Chronic enteropathies (CEs) are a common cause of morbidity in dogs. CEs are diagnosed in dogs with chronic gastrointestinal clinical signs (>3 weeks),  changes on intestinal biopsies and where no other underlying cause is determined based on a thorough, standardised diagnostic work-up. Based on response to therapy, CEs are subclassified into food-responsive, antibiotic-responsive or steroid-responsive enteropathies. A significant proportion of dogs with a CE are food-responsive; however, there are limited peer-reviewed publications describing the clinical efficacy of the commercially available diets used to treat CE.In this study, the authors evaluated the response of 15 dogs with a CE to a commercially available dietetic food (Hill's Prescription Diet i/d Sensitive Canine Dry). The dogs underwent a standard diagnostic evaluation and did not receive concurrent anthelmintic, antibiotic, glucocorticoid or gastroprotectant therapies. The clinical efficacy of the dietary treatment was assessed by comparing the Canine  Activity Index (CIBDAI) before and a median of 13 days after dietary therapy.The authors found that the CIBDAI significantly decreased following the introduction of the dietetic food (median CIBDAI score pretreatment 9, post-treatment 2; P<0.0005).This study demonstrates that this dietetic food can be used to successfully manage CE in dogs.© British Veterinary Association 2019.

Current guidelines recommend an intensified surveillance strategy in these patients, although the evidence for this recommendation is conflicting. The aim of our study was to assess whether IBD patients with PIPs are at increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.We established a retrospective cohort in a tertiary IBD center with IBD patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in the current era. We compared cumulative incidences of colorectal neoplasia since IBD diagnosis between patients with and without PIPs and corrected for confounders. Second, we compared the risk of receiving a colectomy.In our cohort with >22 years of median follow-up, 154 of 519 patients had PIPs. PIPs were associated with extensive  (odds ratio [OR], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-4.42; P < 0.001) and with more severe inflammation at colonoscopy (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.28-5.50; P < 0.001). After correction for confounders, the presence of PIPs was not associated with development of colorectal neoplasia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.85-1.93; P = 0.24) or with development of advanced neoplasia (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.52-3.68; P = 0.52). There was a higher risk of colectomy in patients with PIPs (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.55-7.54; P = 0.002).In this cohort, PIPs were associated with  extent, inflammation, and higher rates of colectomy. However, the presence of PIPs was not associated with the development of neoplasia. These findings suggest that patients with PIPs may not need an intensified surveillance strategy.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Benefiting from the hydrophobic interactions and π-π stacking interactions of ATK, prodrug B-ATK-T could self-assemble into nanoparticles (NP) in water containing lecithin and DSPE-PEG. The morphology of B-ATK-T NP (approximate 100-120 nm) was confirmed to be regular spherical by transmission electron microscope. B-ATK-T NP was endowed high drug loading content with 41.23% for Bud and 15.55% for Tem. The rapid drug release from B-ATK-T NP proceeded in an extensive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. More than 98% of Bud and Tem in B-ATK-T NP could release in the mimic inflammation microenvironment or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated macrophages within short time. The release of drugs in a simultaneous and proportional manner ensures that B-ATK-T NP can increase the combined efficacy of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. It is worth noting that B-ATK-T NP could be passively accumulated and dramatically increasing the maximum drugs concentration in the inflamed colon of mice with  (IBD) by oral route, and avoiding potential systemic side effects. B-ATK-T NP could not only relieve colitis via inhibiting the expression of oxidative and proinflammatory mediators more than combination of free drugs, but also significantly reduce colitis-caused death.

In recent years, the immunomodulating effects of vitamin D have gained a huge interest in its possible pathogenic influence on the pathophysiology of IBD. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent among patients with IBD. Several clinical studies have pointed to a critical role for vitamin D in ameliorating  outcomes. Although causation versus correlation unfortunately remains an overwhelming issue in the illusive chicken versus egg debate regarding vitamin D and IBD, here we summarise the latest knowledge of the immunological effects of vitamin D in IBD and recommend from available evidence that physicians regularly monitor serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with IBD. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for optimising vitamin D status in patients with IBD in clinical practice. Awaiting well-powered controlled clinical trials, we consider vitamin D supplementation to be an affordable and widely accessible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate IBD clinical outcomes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In this study, we assessed the impact of early IFX discontinuation on mother's  activity and on their at-risk babies.In a retrospective study of the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from 2011 to 2015, we compared IBD patients who discontinued IFX more than 90 days ("early IFX") with those who discontinue IFX 90 days or less ("late IFX) before delivery. We evaluated the risk of flaring, defined by new steroid prescriptions, visits to emergency room and/or hospital admissions, the pregnancy outcomes, and the at-risk babies.After IFX discontinuation, the early IFX group (68 deliveries) required significantly more steroid prescriptions than the late IFX group (318 deliveries) to control  activity (P < 001). There were more preterm babies in the early IFX group (P < 049), but no difference within the 2 groups was noticed in the rate of intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestation, and stillborn babies. Similarly, there was no increase in acute respiratory infections, development delays, and congenital malformations in babies of the mothers from the late IFX vs early IFX groups.Steroid-free remission IBD mothers are at risk for  flares and preterm babies when IFX is discontinued early in pregnancy.

NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in  (IBD). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0.5 h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner.

Tristetraprolin (TTP), an mRNA binding protein, plays a role in regulating the  factors, recognizing specific sequences on the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs. TTP activity depends on its phosphorylation state: the unphosphorylated TTP degrades pro- cytokine mRNAs; on the contrary, the phosphorylated TTP fails to destabilize mRNAs furthering their expression. The phospho-TTP forms a complex with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. This binding could be one of the factors that promote intestinal inflammation as a cause of  progression.To assess if TTP phosphorylation has a role in paediatric IBD.The study was carried out on a cohort of paediatric IBD patients. For each patient enrolled, a specimen of inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa was collected. Furthermore, the experiments were conducted on macrophages differentiated from blood samples of the same patients. Macrophages from healthy donors' blood were used as controls. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting analyses were performed to observe the formation of the phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex. In the same samples TNF-α expression was also evaluated as major factor of the pro- activity.In this work we studied indirectly the phosphorylation of TTP through the binding with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. In inflamed and non-inflamed colon mucosa of IBD paediatric patients immunoblot assay demonstrated a higher expression of the TTP in inflamed samples respect to the non-inflamed; the co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 protein showed the same trend of expression. In the  gene expression analysis higher levels of the cytokine in inflamed tissues compared to controls were evident. The same experiments were conducted on macrophages from IBD paediatric patients and healthy controls. The immunoblot results demonstrated a high expression of both TTP and co-immunoprecipitated 14-4-3 protein in IBD-derived macrophages in comparison to healthy donors. TNF-α protein levels from macrophages lysates showed the same trend of expression in favour of IBD paediatric patients compared to healthy controls.In this work, for the first time, we describe a relation between phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex and IBD. Indeed, a higher expression of TTP/14-3-3 was recorded in IBD samples in comparison to controls.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The global incidence of IBD is increasing, and more patients are exploring diet as a means to explain and treat their IBD. In fact, many patients strongly believe diet plays a fundamental role in the onset and management of their IBD. However, a significant proportion of patients report limited nutritional education from their provider, and providers report limited nutritional resources to aid in discussions with patients. This imbalance between supply and demand likely reflects the previous paucity of available literature characterizing the influence of diet in IBD.

However, neither the underlying mechanism(s) of action nor their molecular target(s) are well defined. The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2) is an essential transcription factor affecting the development and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In this study, using in vitro T cell differentiation models, we demonstrate that CQ activates T cell differentiation and induces Foxp3 gene expression in a Nurr1-dependent manner. Remarkably, CQ appears to induce Nurr1 function by two distinct mechanisms: firstly, by direct binding to Nurr1's ligand-binding domain and promoting its transcriptional activity and secondly by upregulation of Nurr1 expression through the CREB signaling pathway. In contrast, CQ suppressed gene expression and differentiation of pathogenic T17 cells. Importantly, using a valid animal model of  (IBD), we demonstrated that CQ promotes Foxp3 expression and differentiation of T cells in a Nurr1-dependent manner, leading to significant improvement of IBD-related symptoms. Taken together, these data suggest that CQ ameliorates autoimmune  via regulating Nurr1 function/expression and that Nurr1 is a promising target for developing effective therapeutics of human  autoimmune .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657252>[Systemic biological treatment in ophthalmology].</a></h2><p>We present herewith cases of non-infectious uveitis with biological treatment where the ocular complaints were the initial symptoms indicating a multi-organ autoimmune .

Clinicians must be able to identify those that will have worse prognosis and plan an aggressive therapy with an early/proactive adjustments in management if needed.: The aim of this review is to evaluate the most recent evidence on the assessment and management of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis. We searched the mainstream literature search engines for the most recent evidence on diagnosis and management of acute UC.: The approach to patients with severe UC includes clinical and endoscopic assessment of  severity and ruling out over-infections. While intravenous corticosteroids remain the first line therapy for acute severe colitis, many patients do not respond and require escalation to calcineurin inhibitors or infliximab, and may ultimately require colectomy. Even though several novel therapies are available or in development, their role in acute severe episodes of colitis is unknown.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647134>Systematic review with meta-analysis: association of vitamin D status with clinical outcomes in adult patients with .</a></h2><p>Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with IBD, however, data on its association with clinical outcomes are conflicting.To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the association of low vitamin D status with clinical outcomes in patients with IBD.We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to February 2018 for observational studies evaluating the association of low 25(OH)D status on IBD  activity, mucosal inflammation, clinical relapse and quality of life. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled and analysed using a random effects model.Twenty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion comprising 8316 IBD patients (3115 ulcerative colitis, 5201 Crohn's ). Among IBD patients, low 25(OH)D status was associated with increased odds of  activity (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.32-1.77, I  = 0%), mucosal inflammation (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06-1.47, I  = 0%), low quality of life (QOL) scores (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.60, I  = 0%) and future clinical relapse (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.47, I  = 0%).

Inhibition of TNF can decrease the  response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in  (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune  marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered “ modifying anti-rheumatic drugs” (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and . The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis B have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis B. However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the concordance regarding  type and phenotypic features in a large cohort of Korean patients with IBD.A total of 6647 patients with IBD who visited the Asan Medical Center between June 1989 and September 2016 were enrolled in the study. When at least two familial cases existed in our cohort, they were included in the concordance analysis (κ index). The concordance between younger and older members for IBD type [Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)] and phenotypic characteristics such as  extent and location,  behavior, the use of medication, and need for surgery were evaluated.A positive family history of IBD was noted in 216 patients with CD (7.0%) and in 238 patients with UC (6.7%). Of all patients, 167 consanguineous pairs in 146 families were identified. The crude concordance rate for IBD type was 82.6% with a κ index of 0.656 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.545-0.768, good concordance].

Usually, abdominal computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard in diagnosing the various forms of colitis. However, by the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), one may occasionally be able to discern wall thickening, pericolic fluid, and adjacent hyperechoic mesenteric fat. One may also see abscesses, fistulae, or ascites.This is a series of 6 patients who had findings consistent with colitis seen on POCUS performed by an emergency physician. These were confirmed by abdominal CT with contrast. Early detection by POCUS was able to lead to a rapid diagnosis and to expedite treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The ability to detect findings of colitis by POCUS can be quickly learned by the emergency physician with a strong background in basic ultrasound. For many of the different subtypes of colitis, the initial treatment in the emergency department is the same: i.v. antibiotics, i.v. fluids, and " rest" by maintaining the patient in nothing-by-mouth status. For the stable patient with high clinical suspicion of an infectious etiology of colitis, ultrasound can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other etiologies. This may be especially important in certain populations such as children and young women, where one can avoid a significant amount of radiation being directed toward the pelvic area.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Information about  control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's  (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the  Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by  activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and 5% for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe  activity compared to patients with mild or no  activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/2.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed IBD treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and 5-ASA compounds (77.5%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe IBD activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of IBD surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

Based on this, we examined the antioxidant molecular mechanisms involved in the intestinal anti- activity of the 4 ME. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of the 4 ME on the modulation of gene expression and antioxidant-related enzyme activities in TNBS model of intestinal inflammation as well as the molecular interaction between 4 ME and glutathione reductase. Our results showed that 4 ME modulated glutathione-related enzymes, mainly increasing glutathione reductase activity. These effects were related to upregulation of glutathione reductase and Nrf2 gene expression. Fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that interaction between 4 ME and glutathione reductase is collisional, hydrophobic and spontaneous, in which C4 methyl group is the second epitope most buried into glutathione reductase. Molecular modelling calculation showed Lys70-B, Arg81-A, Glu381-B, Asp443-A, Ser444-A, Glu447-B and Ser475-A participated in electrostatic interaction, Lys70-B, Glu381-B and Arg81-A acted in the hydrophobic interactions and Trp73, Phe377 and Ala446 are responsible for the hydrogen bonds. Based on this, our results showed 4 ME acted by different mechanisms to control oxidative stress induced by intestinal damage, controlling the imbalance between myeloperoxidase activity and glutathione production, upregulating the glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities, preventing the Nrf2 and glutathione gene expression downregulation with consequent glutathione maintenance. Finally, 4 ME interacted at molecular level with glutathione reductase, stabilizing its enzymatic activity and reducing oxidative stress to take place in intestinal  process.Copyright © 2019.

Phyto-ingredients have been evaluated for their ability to protect against IBD because of their anti- activities. In our previous study, we identified a novel derivative of chrysin (HE-chrysin) using irradiation technology, which exhibited stronger anti-cancer activity in human colorectal cancer cells than the original chrysin. Here, to determine whether HE-chrysin is a new therapeutic candidate for IBD, we investigated the anti- effects of HE-chrysin on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and dextran sodium salt (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. HE-chrysin more effectively inhibited BMDC maturation compared to chrysin, as demonstrated by the decreased levels of pro- cytokines, surface molecules, antigen-presenting ability, and T cell proliferation/activation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMDCs. These anti- effects of HE-chrysin were regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, oral administration of HE-chrysin attenuated DSS-induced colitis symptoms and clinical signs in the mouse model. The protective effects of HE-chrysin treatment against colitis were mediated by decreasing Th1- and Th17-type cytokine levels.

In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple . Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours-such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses-that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659447>Preoperative factors associated with prolonged postoperative in-hospital length of stay in patients with Crohn's  undergoing intestinal resection or strictureplasty.</a></h2><p>To investigate factors that influence postoperative in-hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with Crohn's  (CD) undergoing  surgery.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2  factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2  factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660629>: estimates from the global burden of  2017 study.</a></h2><p> (IBD) is a significant health problem in the industrialised world, currently increasing in developing countries. Understanding the global burden of IBD is important to tackle increasing  occurrence.To investigate the GBD (Global Burden of ) 2017 Study Database summarising and critically evaluating the global burden of IBD METHODS: We presented age-standardised prevalence estimates, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and its components: years lived with disability (YLDs) and years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality. We reported these measures from 1990 to 2017 and stratified by region, socio-demographic index (SDI), gender and age group.The latest IBD prevalence and burden estimates varied widely across regions, and were particularly elevated in high-SDI countries. Despite an increasing prevalence from 1990 to 2017 (+6%), the IBD burden decreased (DALYs -12%). This decrease was driven by IBD-associated premature mortality (YLLs -26%). This measure represented a high share of  burden in low-SDI countries (86% of DALYs), whereas disability constituted the predominant component in high-SDI countries (71%) in 2017.  burden decreased particularly in children (DALYs -39% and YLLs -52%). In the last 10 years, however, prevalence plateaued in middle- to high-SDI countries and steeply increased in low-SDI countries.These findings highlight significant improvements in IBD care in the last three decades, particularly in children. The global burden of IBD and premature mortality have progressively decreased. The increase in  frequency observed in developing countries is worrying, especially considering the high associated premature mortality in these areas.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666502>Gadd45β promotes regeneration after injury through TGFβ-dependent restitution in experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated immune responses and impaired function in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of  (IBD). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45β) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various  symptoms. However, the role of Gadd45β in IBD is completely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Gadd45β in IBD. Gadd45β-KO mice exhibited drastically greater susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and mortality than C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution. These results expand the current understanding of the function of Gadd45β and its therapeutic potential in ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670610>Patient Experiences and Outcomes of a Telehealth Clinical Care Pathway for Postoperative  Patients.</a></h2><p>       n    </p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646851>Evaluation of cytokines levels as putative biomarkers to predict the pharmacological response to biologic therapy in .</a></h2><p>Cytokines play a central role in the pathogenesis of .

PubMed was searched for original articles, published between 2007 and 2017, in Italian or English. The search string consisted of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part that focused on HADs and a -specific part. All identified papers were screened by two independent reviewers; exclusion criteria were the following: no details of algorithms reported, algorithm not developed in the Italian context, exclusive use of data from the death certificate register, or from general practitioner or pediatrician databases. Pertinent papers were classified according to the objective for which the algorithm had been used, and only articles that used algorithms for primary objectives (I  occurrence, II population/cohort selection, III outcome identification) were considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, followback periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded.the search string led to the identification of 98 articles for IBD, 42 articles for CD, and 390 for CKD. By screening the references, one paper for IBD was added. Finally, this led to 5, 9, and 8 pertinent papers respectively for IBD, CD, and CKD. Considering the papers on IBD and CD, specific age selections were applied to focus on children and young adult populations. When a selection on age was applied for CKD, instead, it mostly considered individuals aged more than 18 years. Three algorithms for IBD, 4 for CD, and 5 for CKD were extracted from papers and characterized. Drug prescription databases were used for both IBD and CKD algorithms, whereas the hospital discharge database and co-payment exemption database were used for IBD and CD. Pathology records and specialist visit databases were also used for CD and CKD, respectively. For each  only one algorithm applied criteria for the exclusion of prevalent cases. External validation was performed only for Crohn's  among IBDs, in one algorithm.the results of this review indicate that case identification for IBD and CD from routinely collected data can be considered feasible and can be used to perform different kinds of epidemiological studies.

However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients.To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist's interview on IBD patients' acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®.After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients' association (Association François Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars.93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02-0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01-1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07-2.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient's opinion on biosimilars.This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient's acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Key cost-drivers of IBD health care expenditures include pharmaceuticals and unplanned care, but evolving treatment approaches have shifted these factors. We aimed to assess changes in cost of care, determine shifts in IBD cost-drivers, and examine differences by socioeconomic and insurance status over time.The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative database that collects data on health care utilization and expenditures from a nationally representative sample since 1998, was utilized. Adult subjects with IBD were identified by ICD-9 codes. To determine changes in per-patient costs or cost-drivers unique to IBD, a control population of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects was generated and matched in 1:1 case to control. Total annual health care expenditures were obtained and categorized as outpatient, inpatient, emergency, or pharmacy related. Temporal cohorts from 1998 to 2015 were created to assess change over time. Per-patient expenditures were compared by  state and temporal cohort using weighted generalized linear models.A total of 641 IBD subjects were identified and matched to 641 RA individuals. From 1998 to 2015, median total annual health care expenditures nearly doubled (adjusted estimate 2.20; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0) and were 36% higher in IBD compared with RA. In IBD, pharmacy expenses increased 7% to become the largest cost-driver (44% total expenditures). Concurrently, inpatient spending in IBD decreased by 40%. There were no significant differences in the rate of change of cost-drivers in IBD compared with RA.Per-patient health care costs for chronic  conditions have nearly doubled over the last 20 years. Increases in pharmaceutical spending in IBD may be accompanied by reduction in inpatient care.

This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the risk of new onset IBD in patients with COPD and new onset COPD in IBD patients.We performed a systematic review of observational studies exploring the risk of both associations. Two independent reviewers explored the EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS and DOAJ databases, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBBINS-I tool. Data from included studies was pooled in a random effect meta-analysis following a DerSimonian-Laird method. The quality of the evidence was ranked using GRADE criteria.Four studies including a pooled population of 1355 new cases were included. We found association between new onset IBD in COPD population. The risk of bias was low in most of them. Only one study reported tobacco exposure as a potential confounding factor. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for a new diagnosis of IBD in COPD patients was 2.02 (CI, 1.56 to 2.63), I = 72% (GRADE: low). The subgroup analyses for Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis yielded RRs of 2.29 (CI, 1.51 to 3.48; I = 62%), and 1.79 (CI, 1.39 to 2.29; I = 19%.), respectively.According to our findings, the risk of new onset IBD was higher in populations with COPD compared to the general population without this condition. Based on our analysis, we suggest a potential association between IBD and COPD; however, further research exploring the potential effect of confounding variables, especially cigarette smoking, is still needed.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in IBD. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's  (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650411>Increased risk of herpes zoster infection in patients with : a meta-analysis of cohort studies.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in patients with  (IBD).

Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with IBD and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's  (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.88).

For example, these cation channels act as sensors in the detection and transduction of stimuli of temperature, small molecules, voltage, pH, and mechanical constrains. Over the past decades, different members of the TRP channels have been identified in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract playing multiple modulatory roles. Noteworthy, TRPs support critical functions related to the taste perception, mechanosensation, and pain. They also participate in the modulation of motility and secretions of the human gut. Last but not least, altered expression or activity and mutations in the TRP genes are often related to a wide range of disorders of the gut epithelium, including , fibrosis, visceral hyperalgesia, irritable  syndrome, and colorectal cancer. TRP channels could therefore be promising drug targets for the treatment of GI malignancies.

Forty patients were randomized in two study arms, in which  purgation was performed either before or after PET-MR enterography. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsies after PET-MR within 24 h. Diagnostic performance of MR morphological parameters (MRmorph), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET in detecting histological inflammation determined by the Nancy index was compared with each other and between study arms. Correlation between PET and histological  severity was calculated.In study arm without previous  purgation, SUV ratio of  segment (relative to SUV of the liver) facilitated the highest specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared with MRmorph and DWI.  cleansing led to markedly increased metabolic activity of  segments, resulting in significantly reduced specificity of PET compared with study arm without purgation (0.808 vs. 0.966, p = 0.007, respectively). Inter-observer concordance for assessing MRmorph was clearly increased after  cleansing (Cohen's κ, 0.847 vs. 0.665; p = 0.013, respectively), though diagnostic performance of MRmorph was not significantly improved. Our findings suggested that the change of metabolic status was mainly associated with the grade of neutrophil infiltrate and less dependent on chronic infiltrate.PET-MR enterography was an excellent non-invasive diagnostic method in the assessment of histological active inflammation in ulcerative colitis without the need of previous  purgation.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673357>Hidradenitis suppurativa and vasculitis: A case series and literature review of a rare association.</a></h2><p>Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic  skin  with dysregulation of the immune system.

Here, we focus on referral strategies for patients with chronic back pain (evidence-based strategy), large joint monoarthritis, oligo- or polyarticular arthritis or arthralgia (based on expert opinion). We also present management tools for IBD patients with acute back pain and small joint monoarthritis (Supplementary file).The reported algorithm for IBD patients with chronic back pain uses basic clinical criteria to identify which patients should be referred to the emergency room (spondylodiscitis), physical medicine and rehabilitation (mechanical back pain) or rheumatologist (spondyloarthritis). IBD patients with large joint monoarthritis should be referred to emergency room if septic arthritis is suspected; in other patients, blood analyses and referral to a rheumatologist for articular puncture with evacuation of synovial fluid are recommended.

A genome-wide examination of control, LPS-stimulated, and α-MG-pretreated cells was performed with the Illumina Hiseq sequencing platform, and gene expression was verified with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Among the 37,199 genes profiled, 2014 genes were regulated in the LPS group, and 475 genes were regulated in the α-MG group.

Based on the transcriptomic results, we constructed a rat model of  (IBD) with LPS and investigated the effects of α-MG on NLRP3 inflammasomes. After LPS stimulation, the rat intestinal villi were significantly detached, with congestion and hemorrhage; the intestinal epithelial cell nuclei were deformed; and the mitochondria were swollen. However, after pretreatment with α-MG, the intestinal villus congestion and hemorrhage were reduced, the epithelial nuclei were rounded, and the mitochondrial morphology was intact. qPCR and western blotting were used to detect NLRP3, caspase 1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β expression at the gene and protein levels. Their expression increased at both the transcript and protein levels after LPS stimulation, whereas it decreased after pretreatment with α-MG.

GCs are also widely used in anti-/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of , but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/ changes.

Recruitment to bacteria-containing endosomes and other intracellular membranes is required for NOD1/2 signaling, and NOD1/2 mutations that disrupt membrane localization are associated with  and other  conditions. However, little is known about this recruitment process. We found that NOD1/2 S-palmitoylation is required for membrane recruitment and immune signaling. ZDHHC5 was identified as the palmitoyltransferase responsible for this critical posttranslational modification, and several -associated mutations in NOD2 were found to be associated with defective S-palmitoylation. Thus, ZDHHC5-mediated S-palmitoylation of NOD1/2 is critical for their ability to respond to peptidoglycans and to mount an effective immune response.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Recently, it has been found that oral microbiota are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic  conditions (, spondyloarthritides, and psoriasis), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral  and intestinal  in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding  pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut microbiota seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA. However, specific microbial clusters and biomarkers belonging to oral and gut microbiota need to be further investigated to highlight the mechanisms related to alterations in bones and joints  pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644671>EFFECT OF COPAIBA OIL IN INTESTINAL MUCOSA OF RATS SUBMITTED TO HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK.</a></h2><p>Hypovolemic shock is a common  in polytrauma patients and may develop ischemia in various organs, increasing morbidity and mortality.

Growing evidences support the existence of exposure-response relationship with Vedolizumab, but the utility and the appropriate use of TDM in clinical practice is still under debate. In this review, we summarize all evidences supporting a TDM-guided approach for patients treated with Vedolizumab, suggesting three potential scenarios: 1) early prediction of long-term outcomes; 2) verifying the best strategy in case of loss of response, 3) maximizing therapeutic efficacy during maintenance treatment. Vedolizumab through concentrations < 20 μg/ml at week 6 and > 12 μg/ml seem to be associated with more favourable outcomes. No comparative studies have been conducted so far to demonstrate the advantage of adopting a TDM-guided versus an empirical approach for managing primary or secondary non responses.The frequency of antibodies to Vedolizumab detection is quite low (up to 4% in pivotal trials), suggesting, unlike of anti TNF-α agents, a low probability of experiencing an immune-mediated pharmacokinetic failure in clinical practice. Future prospective and controlled studies are warranted to establish the guidance on the use of a TDM-guided approach with Vedolizumab in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675916>Tracheobronchitis in ulcerative colitis: a case report of therapeutic response with infliximab and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>The extra-intestinal manifestation of tracheobronchitis is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis (UC).

Negative shifts in gut microbiota profiles, also known as dysbiosis, may be implicated in the development of chronic disorders such as  (IBD). Adhesion molecule-dependent recruitment of immune cells to the gut is an important step in IBD pathogenesis. The adhesion molecule β7 integrin contributes to the development of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), intestinal immune cell homing, and immune responses and is known to promote intestinal inflammation. Although many studies underlined the role of the gut microbiota in shaping the mucosal immune system, studies on the influence of the host immune system on the microbiota are rare, especially in homeostasis. We addressed this question via comparative 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of fecal microbial communities from wild-type and β7 integrin-deficient mice, the latter being characterized by a compromised GALT. Besides subtle changes in relative abundances of  spp. and unknown members of the families  and , there was altogether no major difference in microbiota profiles in β7 integrin-deficient mice vs. wild-type littermates. This indicates that, in conditions of homeostasis, there is only a minor influence of the host immune system on the fecal microbiota in our mouse model, stressing the potential importance of pathological factors for dysbiosis development.Copyright © 2019 Babbar, Hitch, Pabst, Clavel, Hübel, Eswaran, Wagner and Schippers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651863>Natural elimination of a video capsule after retention for 1 year in a patient with small  Crohn : A case report.</a></h2><p>Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a useful tool to differentiate small intestinal bleeding, , and other small  .

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus  (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated  and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650238>Pouch wall thickness and floppy pouch complex.</a></h2><p>Floppy pouch complex (FPC) consists of  phenotypes in patients with ileal pouches, including pouch prolapse, afferent limb syndrome, enterocele, redundant loop, and pouch folding.

This review highlights the role of biotin in the most common skin disorders such associated with biotin deficiency and an approach to their treatment. Biotin administration may improve the treatment of hair loss when deficiency is detected on the basis of a careful patient history, clinical examination and the determination of serum biotin levels. The use of biotin is rationale in seborrheic dermatitis as the vitamin intercepts the main metabolic pathways underlying the pathogenesis of the . Treatment with biotin could also be useful in comedonal acne characterized by a high rate of seborrhea, and may be helpful for acne treated with topical retinoids, contributing to the control of flaking and irritation. The tolerability of biotin is excellent and there is no risk of hypervitaminosis even in the case of high doses.

However, several NLR family members continue to defy our best attempts at characterization and routinely exhibit confounding data. This is particularly true for NLR family members that regulate signaling associated with the activation of other pattern recognition receptors. NLRX1 is a member of this NLR sub-group and acts as an enigmatic regulator of immune system function. NLRX1 has been shown to negatively regulate type-I interferon, attenuate pro- NF-κB signaling, promote reactive oxygen species production, and modulate autophagy, cell death, and proliferation. However, the mechanism/s associated with NLRX1 modulation of these pathways is not fully understood and there are inconsistencies within the field. Likewise, it is highly likely that the full repertoire of biological functions impacted by NLRX1 are yet to be defined.

Several systemic  conditions have been linked to an increased risk of ASCVD; however, this has not been well established in  (IBD). IBD is comprised of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's , both of which involve chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, often with evidence of systemic involvement. Several ASCVD risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, poor diet and the presence of obesity may increase the risk of ASCVD in patients suffering from IBD, despite a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Medications used to treat IBD and target inflammation, such as steroids, may also accelerate the risk of the risk for ASCVD heart failure while exacerbating ASCVD risk factors. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in these patients, most notably in women and in younger patients. Some cohort studies have also suggested a link between IBD and both atrial fibrillation and heart failure, particularly during periods of active flares. All IBD patients, particularly younger individuals, should be screened for ASCVD risk factors with aggressive risk factor modification to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are environmental factors that are associated by several pathways, including changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome, with the development and course of IBD. : This review explores the interaction of vitamin D, and UVR, with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune systems, and how they may influence the gut microbiome and the subsequent development, and progression, of IBD. : Vitamin D and UVR both regulate innate and adaptive immunity through a combination of common and independent mechanisms, with the overall effect being the promotion of immune tolerance. Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal microbiome either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal immunity, fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host immunity and the gut microbiome.

The options for managing anti-TNF treatment failures include switching to an alternative anti-TNF (cycling) or to another class of targeted drug with a different mechanism of action (swapping). The aim of this review is to evaluate the pros and cons of whether it is more appropriate to choose a second anti-TNF biological agents after the failure of the first or swap treatment early.Copyright © 2019.

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful,  preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± 2.88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486.5 μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653690>AP-1 activity induced by co-stimulation is required for chromatin opening during T cell activation.</a></h2><p>Activation of T cells is dependent on the organized and timely opening and closing of chromatin. Herein, we identify AP-1 as the transcription factor that directs most of this remodeling. Chromatin accessibility profiling showed quick opening of closed chromatin in naive T cells within 5 h of activation. These newly opened regions were strongly enriched for the AP-1 motif, and indeed, ChIP-seq demonstrated AP-1 binding at >70% of them. Broad inhibition of AP-1 activity prevented chromatin opening at AP-1 sites and reduced the expression of nearby genes. Similarly, induction of anergy in the absence of co-stimulation during activation was associated with reduced induction of AP-1 and a failure of proper chromatin remodeling. The translational relevance of these findings was highlighted by the substantial overlap of AP-1-dependent elements with risk loci for multiple immune , including multiple sclerosis, , and allergic . Our findings define AP-1 as the key link between T cell activation and chromatin remodeling.© 2019 Yukawa et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679284>Immunomodulating Effects Exerted by Glucans Extracted from the King Oyster Culinary-Medicinal Mushroom Pleurotus eryngii (Agaricomycetes) Grown in Substrates Containing Various Concentrations of Olive Mill Waste.</a></h2><p>We have recently demonstrated that we could enhance glucan content in Pleurotus eryngii following cultivation of the mushrooms on a substrate containing different concentrations of olive mill solid waste (OMSW). These changes are directly related to the content of OMSW in the growing substrate. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-in-flammatory   (IBD) mice model, we measured the colonic  response to the different glucan preparations. We found that the histology damaging score (HDS) resulting from DSS treatment reach a value of 11.8 ± 2.3 were efficiently downregulated by treatment with the fungal extracted glucans. Glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 20% OMSW downregulated to a HDS value of 6.4 ± 0.5 whereas those cultivated at 80% OMSW showed the strongest effects (5.5 ± 0.6). Similar downregulatory effects were obtained for expression of various intestinal cytokines. All tested glucans were equally effective in regulating the number of CD14/CD16 monocytes from 18.2 ± 2.7% for DSS to 6.4 ± 2.0 for DSS + glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 50% OMSW. We tested the effect of glucans on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-α, which demonstrated that stalk-derived glucans were more effective than caps-derived glucans. Isolated glucans competed with anti-Dectin-1 and anti-CR3 antibodies, indicating that they contain β-glucans recognized by these receptors. In conclusion, the most effective glucans in ameliorating IBD-associated symptoms induced by DSS treatment in mice were glucan extracts prepared from the stalk of P. eryngii grown at higher concentrations of OMSW. We conclude that these stress-induced growing conditions may be helpful in selecting more effective glucans derived from edible mushrooms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641874>Efficacy of enteral nutrition in patients with Crohn's  on maintenance anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in Crohn's  (CD) patients and has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on loss of response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antibody therapy; however, the current level of evidence is not sufficient. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether EN in combination anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy is useful in maintaining remission. PubMed was used to identify all relevant studies. A total of nine articles were identified including one randomized control trial, two prospective cohort studies, and six retrospective cohort studies. We performed a meta-analysis on all these articles to assess the remission maintenance effect of EN (n = 857). The remission or response maintenance effect in the EN group was 203/288 (70.5%), which was higher than 306/569 (53.8%) in the non-EN group. The odds ratio for long-term remission or response using fixed effects model and random effects model were 2.23 (95% CI 1.60-3.10) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.49-3.22), respectively. The usefulness of EN was unclear in two prospective studies that were conducted immediately after remission induction with anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy was detected. Differences in the definition of relapse and the observation period among articles were considered to be limitations. This analysis suggests that EN is effective for maintaining remission in patients already in remission or response as a result of anti-TNF-alpha antibody maintenance therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640767>Mesenchymal stem cells therapy in companion animals: useful for immune-mediated ?</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells, with capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into tissues of mesodermal origin. These cells are possible therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders, since they present remarkable immunomodulatory ability.The increase of immune-mediated  in veterinary medicine has led to a growing interest in the research of these disorders and their medical treatment. Conventional immunomodulatory drug therapy such as glucocorticoids or other novel therapies such as cyclosporine or monoclonal antibodies are associated with numerous side effects that limit its long-term use, leading to the need for developing new therapeutic strategies that can be more effective and safe.The aim of this review is to provide a critical overview about the therapeutic potential of these cells in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders (canine atopic dermatitis, feline chronic gingivostomatitis,  and feline asthma) compared with their conventional treatment.Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy in autoimmune  has been showing that this approach can ameliorate clinical signs or even cause remission in most animals, with the exception of canine atopic dermatitis in which little to no improvement was observed.Although mesenchymal stem cells present a promising future in the treatment of most of these disorders, the variability in the outcomes of some clinical trials has led to the current controversy among authors regarding their efficacy.

We aimed to describe the U.S. experience with vedolizumab in a commercially insured population.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Quintiles-IMS Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database from May 2014 to June 2016. We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: 5.10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and 5.9% of UC patients had an IBD-related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD. Rates of surgery and serious infections are low.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Parent-proxy report measures are standard for pediatric psychosocial assessment, and the IMPACT-III-P will provide a more comprehensive representation of HRQOL. Reliability and validity analyses were conducted.Parents (N = 50) of youth 8-17 years with IBD reported on their child's HRQOL (IMPACT-III-P and PedsQL-4.0) and depression (BASC-2); youth reported on their HRQOL (child IMPACT-III), pain interference (PROMIS Pain Interference), and  symptoms; and physicians completed measures of  activity.Criterion validity was established as the IMPACT-III-P was strongly, positively associated with the PedsQL (r = .59, p < .001). Convergent validity was supported as higher IMPACT-III-P scores were associated with less pain interference (r = -.41, p < .01) and lower depression (r = -.41, p < .01).

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's  (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti- abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti- capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti- cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro- cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

This study set out to systematically review the literature on anxiety and seven CMCs among youth (asthma, congenital heart , diabetes, epilepsy, , juvenile idiopathic arthritis and sickle cell ).A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches were conducted across PubMed, PsycNET, Embase, and reference lists of the included studies (1990-2018).

Across the CMCs, the prevalence of anxiety disorder was increased in youth with CMCs compared to the general population. Evidence for a relationship between anxiety and adverse -related outcomes was limited. For asthma,  and sickle cell , there was some evidence indicating that anxiety was associated with adverse outcomes; supported by two longitudinal studies, one in asthma and one in . For diabetes, results were inconsistent; with some studies indicating that anxiety was associated with worse and others with better treatment adherence.The prevalence of anxiety disorders in youth with CMCs is higher than that of the general population. Anxiety may also be associated with adverse -related outcomes for youth, but it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions. Longitudinal studies making use of parent/youth composite anxiety measures and a combination of parent/youth reported and objective measures of -related outcomes are needed.

For IFX therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), the most commonly used analysis is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) which do not allow results to be provided in real-time. The aim of this study was to compare the in-house ELISA (Promonitor IFX) with the much faster assay Quantum Blue® IFX (QB) for quantification of serum IFX concentration among IBD patients in maintenance IFX therapy.We studied 30 serum samples from outpatients in IFX maintenance therapy at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark. Samples were used to compare IFX measurements from Promonitor IFX with QB. Therapeutic intervals of <3 μg/mL, 3-7 μg/mL and >7 μg/mL were equally covered. Differences were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and Student t-test. Correlation was evaluated using x,y-plot and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The intermediate imprecision (CV%) of QB was measured at two levels (3 μg/mL and 7 μg/mL). For qualitative comparison, weighted kappa statistics (κ) were determined after stratification of results by therapeutic interval.Promonitor IFX and QB were strongly correlated (r = 0.92, p < 0.001). The mean difference between Promonitor IFX and QB was -0.57 μg/mL (p = 0.2). The CV% of QB was 16.3% at 3 μg/mL and 16.7% at 7 μg/mL. Classification of results according to therapeutic interval showed almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.81).QB is a suitable alternative to Promonitor IFX for TDM in patients treated with IFX for IBD. The results revealed a strong correlation between methods, in particular at lower IFX concentrations, representing the most interesting clinical range. When the samples were stratified according to the therapeutic interval, an almost perfect agreement between the methods was observed.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to  cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying ,  locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult IBD patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with IBD [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying  type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at 2 h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying  type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

Despite the rapid increase in the use of case-identification algorithms, information on their accuracy and misclassification rate is currently unavailable for most conditions.to define a protocol to systematically review algorithms used in Italy in the past 10 years for the identification of several chronic and acute , providing an accessible overview to future users in the Italian and international context.PubMed will be searched for original research articles, published between 2007 and 2017, in Italian or English. The search string consists of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part on HADs and a -specific part. All identified papers will be screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. All articles that used/defined an algorithm for the identification of each  of interest using Italian HADs will be included. Algorithms with exclusive use of death certificates, pathology register, general practitioner or pediatrician data will be excluded. Pertinent papers will be classified according to the objective for which the algorithm was used, and only articles that used algorithms with "primary objectives" (I  occurrence; II population/cohort selection; III outcome identification) will be considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, follow-back periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms will be collected. Further information on specific accuracy measures from external validations, sensitivity analyses, and the contribution of each source will be recorded. This protocol will be applied for 16 different systematic reviews concerning eighteen  (Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Diabetes mellitus, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Acute myocardial infarction, Ischemic heart , Stroke, Hypertension, Heart failure, Congenital heart anomalies, Parkinson's , Multiple sclerosis, Epilepsy, Chronic obstructive pulmonary , Asthma, , Celiac , Chronic kidney failure).this protocol defines a standardized approach to extensively examine and compare all experiences of case identification algorithms in Italy, on the 18 abovementioned . The methodology proposed may be applied to other systematic reviews concerning  not included in this project, as well as other settings, including international ones. Considering the increasing availability of healthcare data, developing standard criteria to describe and update characteristics of published algorithms would be of great use to enhance awareness in the choice of algorithms and provide a greater comparability of results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645201>Current standardized therapeutic approach for uveitis in Japan.</a></h2><p>Uveitis is an ocular  associated with systemic immune-mediated  such as rheumatoid arthritis,  and ankylosing spondylitis; and infectious . Infectious uveitis occasionally shows symptoms similar to those of non-infectious uveitis. Therefore, distinguishing between non-infectious and infectious uveitis is critical for definitive diagnosis and appropriate choice of treatment. Once the cause of infection is known, treatment can be promptly initiated. However, in contrast to infectious uveitis, non-infectious uveitis is more difficult to diagnose clinically. Eliminating the possibility of infectious uveitis is important because unlike the infectious type, non-infectious uveitis is treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids and biological agents. Compared to other countries, the drugs available in Japan are limited. Cyclosporin A is the only immunosuppressive drug available for treating uveitis in Japan, and infliximab and adalimumab are the only biological drugs that have been approved for use in the treatment of uveitis in Japan.

The conceptual framework used was the Functional Mastery of Health Ownership (FMHO) model.A predictive correlational study design using self-administered questionnaires was used. A convenience sample of 151 adults with a diagnosis of IBD for at least 1 year was recruited from the patient population of a gastroenterology medical practice.Data were analyzed using multiple regression with standard entry factor loading. Portions of the model were found to be significant and account for 44% of the variance ( < .001;   = .44, Adjusted   = .41). Significant relationships were found among mastery and IBD self-efficacy, perception of mastery, and current health status. Females had higher mastery scores than males.These findings support the use of a modified FMHO model to predict needs that enable individualized stewardship of health for patients with IBD.© Copyright 2019 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648296>Evaluating Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics After Switching From Infliximab Originator to Biosimilar CT-P13: Experience From a Large Tertiary Referral Center.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636774>Comparative Effectiveness of Ustekinumab Versus Adalimumab in Induction of Clinical Response and Remission in Crohn's : Experience of a Real-World Cohort at a Tertiary Care  Referral Center.</a></h2><p>There is paucity of head-to-head studies comparing the effectiveness of ustekinumab (UST) and adalimumab (ADA) in Crohn's  (CD). Here we provide a real-world comparison of these two agents.We conducted an ambidirectional cohort study. Each patient included had moderate to severe active CD. Clinical response and remission were assessed between 4 and 16 weeks after induction.Of a total of 163 patients, 97 were induced with ADA and 66 were induced with UST. Logistic regression model analysis adjusted based on effect size showed that ADA when compared to UST induced clinical response (73.2% vs. 50% (odds ratio (OR): 2.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14 - 5.07; P = 0.02)) and remission (44.3% vs. 27.7% (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.07 - 5.16; P = 0.034) in a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients.

Of note, however, despite the small sample sizes of TNF-experienced patients who received ADA and TNF-naive patients who received UST, the higher effectiveness of ADA in inducing clinical response and indeed remission among patients with CD with active  appears to primarily be driven by those who are TNF-naive. Among TNF-experienced patients, UST may be superior in inducing clinical response and equally effective in inducing clinical remission when compared to ADA. Based on this study, one may infer that among TNF-experienced patients with CD with active , one could consider switching to an agent such as UST instead of a second approved TNF blocker. However, larger studies comparing the two agents are required.Copyright 2019, Ahmed et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640184>Gut DNA Virome Diversity and Its Association with Host Bacteria Regulate  Phenotype and Neuronal Immunotoxicity in Experimental Gulf War Illness.</a></h2><p>Gulf War illness (GWI) is characterized by the persistence of , chronic fatigue, neuroinflammation, headache, cognitive impairment, and other medically unexplained conditions. Results using a murine model show that enteric viral populations especially bacteriophages were altered in GWI. The increased viral richness and alpha diversity correlated positively with gut bacterial dysbiosis and proinflammatory cytokines. Altered virome signature in GWI mice also had a concomitant weakening of intestinal epithelial tight junctions with a significant increase in Claudin-2 protein expression and decrease in ZO1 and Occludin mRNA expression. The altered virome signature in GWI, decreased tight junction protein level was followed by the presence an activation of innate immune responses such as increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. The altered virome diversity had a positive correlation with serum IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, intestinal inflammation (IFN-γ), and decreased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neurogenesis marker. The co-exposure of Gulf War chemical and antibiotic (for gut sterility) or Gulf War chemical and Ribavirin, an antiviral compound to suppress virus alteration in the gut showed significant improvement in epithelial tight junction protein, decreased intestinal-, systemic-, and neuroinflammation.

Intestinal microbiota residing in the GI tract engages in a mutualistic relationship with the host. Different sections of the GI tract contain distinct proportions of the intestinal microbiota, resulting in the presence of unique bacterial products in each GI section. The intestinal microbiota converts ingested nutrients into metabolites that target either the intestinal microbiota population or host cells. Metabolites act as messengers of information between the intestinal microbiota and host cells. The intestinal microbiota composition and resulting metabolites thus impact host development, health, and pathogenesis. Many recent studies have focused on modulation of the gut microbiota and their metabolites to improve host health and prevent or treat .

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy.

Often, this diagnosis is considered only after a prolonged workup, leading to frustration for families and unnecessary interventions for patients. Here we describe three cases of CRMO to increase awareness of how it may present. The first patient had a typical presentation of focal bone pain (knee), for which she underwent bone scan (hint of >1 lesion), had a bone biopsy to rule out malignancy, received empiric antibiotics for presumed infection, and finally had whole-body imaging confirming CRMO when symptoms persisted. The second patient had a similar workup, but initially presented with clavicular pain. This location should raise suspicion for CRMO, as it is an uncommon location for infectious osteomyelitis.

The capsule endoscopy Crohn's  activity index (CECDAI) was initially developed to measure mucosal  activity in the small , although in 2018, it was extended to the colon for standardization of  activity (CECDAIic). The aim of this study was to apply the CECDAIic in a cohort of CD patients that underwent Pan-CE to evaluate the inter-observer agreement and the correlation between this score and  parameters.  The videos were read and scored using the CECDAIic by three independent experienced operators, blinded to the results of the standard workup. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS, using Kendall's coefficient to evaluate the inter-observer agreement. Spearman correlation () was used to access the correlation between the score and  biomarkers.  Included 22 patients, 59.1% males with mean age of 30.7 ± 11.1 years. The median CECDAIic score was 9.17 (0-37). The overall CECDAIic score Kendall coefficient was 0.94, demonstrating a statistically significant ( < .001) and excellent agreement between the three observers. In addition, we found a very good correlation between CECDAIic and calprotectin ( = 0.82;  = .012) and a moderate correlation with C-reactive protein (CRP,  = 0.50;  = .019).  CECDAIic is a new score with excellent inter-observer agreement and strong correlation with calprotectin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664551>Longer small  segments are resected in emergency surgery for ileocaecal Crohn's  with a higher ileostomy and complication rate.</a></h2><p>Repeated intestinal resections may have disabling consequences in patients with Crohn's  even in the absence of short  syndrome.

The sulfonamides were the first effective antibiotics to be introduced into clinical medicine and have been in use continuously since the 1930’s. They are considered bacteriostatic and appear to act by inhibition of bacterial biosynthesis of folic acid, which is needed for cell growth, at least in those bacteria that are sensitive to sulfonamides. Because humans rely upon dietary folic acid, they are usually resistant to the adverse effects of inhibition of folate synthesis. Sulfonamides have a wide range of antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and -negative organisms. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to sulfonamides is now common, and their use has decreased with the introduction of more potent classes of antibiotics. However, sulfonamides are still widely used especially for urinary tract infections in combination with trimethoprim and for treatment or prevention of parasitic (toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis jiroveci) and malarial infections usually combined with trimethoprim or pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides with 5-aminosalicyclic acid are the structural components of sulfasalazine, which is widely used for long term management of . The combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is used as prophylaxis against chloroquine-resistant malaria. Dapsone is a sulfonamide related drug that is used for the therapy of leprosy and dermatitits herpetiformis. The sulfonamides are well known to cause idiosyncratic liver injury. Hepatotoxicity appears to be a class effect, in that virtually all sulfonamides used today have been linked to rare, but convincing cases of drug induced liver injury. The pattern of injury is variable, often mixed but it can be either hepatocellular or cholestatic. Most typically, the injury appears precipitously within one to three weeks of starting therapy, often preceded or accompanied by signs of hypersensitivity such as fever, rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytosis (or both). Hepatotoxicity from sulfonamides may represent a part of a spectrum of hypersensitivity due to sulfa-derived medications and have been linked to many cases of DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) as well as Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis. The severity of injury varies widely. Most instances of sulfonamide related liver injury are mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited in course. Cases with severe cholestasis may be prolonged and can lead to vanishing bile duct syndrome. Importantly, sulfonamides can cause acute liver failure, particularly in instances with a precipitious onset and hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Indeed, the sulfonamides remain one of the most common causes of drug induced acute liver failure and account for 5% to 10% of instances in many case series. Formulations of sulfonamides currently in general use in the United States include sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine, and sulfisoxazole as well as the combination formulations including sulfasalazine and trimethoprim-sulfamethazole (TMP-SMZ, also referred to as co-trimoxazole). The term sulfonamide applies to derivatives of para-aminobenzene sulfonamide (sulfanilamide), which is composed of a benzene ring with a sulfate and amide group at one end and an amide group at the other (para-position). These agents will be discussed as groups, rather than individual medications, and cases and references are combined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644050>Vedolizumab.</a></h2><p>Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to integrin α4β7 which is used in the treatment of .

Alogliptin is efficacious both as monotherapy and as add-on/combination therapy with other commonly prescribed T2DM treatments, such as metformin and pioglitazone. Overall, alogliptin is well-tolerated in patients with T2DM, including older patients, those with renal and/or hepatic impairment, and those at high risk of cardiovascular events. There is a low risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, acute pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal adverse events with alogliptin treatment, as demonstrated in long-term trials (lasting up to 4.5 years) and in a real-world setting. Additionally, alogliptin has a generally favorable or similar safety profile in comparison to other antidiabetic agents (metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin). However, further evaluation would be required to determine the mechanism and effect of alogliptin on heart failure, bullous pemphigoid, and . Of note, due to the ethnic diversity in the epidemiology of T2DM, alogliptin has been shown to be more efficacious in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients with T2DM, but with a similar tolerability profile. These data indicate that DPP-4is, including alogliptin, are important treatment options, especially for Asian patients with T2DM, for whom they have potential as a first-line therapy. This benefit-risk assessment aims to place alogliptin within the current armamentarium of T2DM and aid physicians when choosing optimal diabetes treatment for their patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665288>Safety of Combination Biologic and Antirejection Therapy Post-Liver Transplantation in Patients With .</a></h2><p>Patients with  (IBD) post-liver transplant (LT) may have  inflammation requiring biologic therapy. We aimed to evaluate the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients after LT from a tertiary center case series and an updated literature review. patients undergoing LT between 1985 and 2018 and requiring combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were identified from the London Health Sciences Transplant Registry (Ontario, Canada). Safety outcomes were extracted by medical chart review. For an updated literature review, EMBASE, Medline, and CENTRAL were searched to identify studies evaluating the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients.In the case series, 19 patients were identified. Most underwent LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; 14/19, 74%) treated with anti-integrins (8/19, 42%) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) antagonists (6/19, 32%). Infections occurred in 11/19 (58%) patients, most commonly Clostridium difficile (4/19, 21%). Two patients required colectomy, and 1 patient required re-transplantation. In the literature review, 13 case series and 8 case reports reporting outcomes for 122 IBD patients treated with biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were included. PSC was the indication for LT in 97/122 (80%) patients, and 91/122 (75%) patients were treated with TNF antagonists. Infections occurred in 32/122 (26%) patients, primarily Clostridium difficile (7/122, 6%). patients receiving combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT appeared to be at increased risk of Clostridium difficile. Compared with the general liver transplant population in the published literature, there was no increased risk of serious infection.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the microbiota to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's  patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative colitis patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's  patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal probiotics Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis.

Articles published in English during January 1998 - June 2018 that compared diagnostic FC testing in primary care and outpatient hospital settings with a reference test and employed the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent FC assay method with a cut-off of 50 or 100 μg/g faeces were included. Study quality was assessed with QUADAS-2, an evidence-based quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies.MEDLINE and EMBASE; reference lists of screened articles.Eighteen relevant studies were identified. For distinguishing patients with organic GID (including IBD) from those with functional GIDs (16 studies), the estimated sensitivity of FC testing was 81% (95% CI, 74-86%), the specificity 81% (95% CI, 71-88%); area under the curve (AUC) was 0.87. For distinguishing IBD from functional GIDs (ten studies), sensitivity was 88% (95% CI, 80-93%), specificity 72% (95% CI, 59-82%), and AUC 0.89. Assuming a population prevalence of organic GID of 1%, the positive predictive value was 4.2%, the negative predictive value 100%. The difference in sensitivity and specificity between FC testing cut-offs of 50 μg/g and 100 μg/g faeces was not statistically significant (P = 0.77).FC testing is clinically useful for distinguishing organic GID (including IBD) from functional GIDs, and its incorporation into clinical practice for evaluating patients with lower gastrointestinal symptoms could lead to fewer patients with functional GIDs undergoing colonoscopy, reducing costs for both patients and the health system.CRD4201810507.© 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676052>Elective Abdominal Surgery for .</a></h2><p>Elective abdominal surgery for  is common.

Almost 9 million persons are diagnosed with TB each year and around 2 million deaths are due to TB or TB complications. Abdominal TB has no specific clinical symptoms, no imagistic and no specific laboratory tests, all these making the diagnosis more difficult. Most often, clinical, radiographic, and histopathological (HP) aspects in TB enteritis are nonspecific and may suggest cancer or . We present the case of a 42-year-old male patient, with intestinal and lung TB presenting as intestinal obstruction to emphasize the importance of clinical suspicion and histopathology for final diagnosis. Chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) evidenced a few left-sided pulmonary nodules and wall thickening of some parts of the small and large . Also, CT evidenced nearby mesenteric lymphadenopathy. He was admitted in the Department of Surgery and later confirmed with intestinal TB. Because of modified chest radiography, further investigations identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum. Final diagnosis was concomitant lung and intestinal TB confirmed by sputum and histopathology. The patient received proper anti-tuberculous treatment and his condition improved after the first month. The physician treating the organ is the one that should establish the diagnosis of extra-respiratory TB; however, treatment and later follow-up are multidisciplinary.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of IBD are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal microbiota in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of IBD is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not "common" in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian IBD centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

CD4CD8αα IELs are one of the most important types of IELs, and they play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the balance of the intestinal immune system. CD4CD8αα IELs are often regarded as a special subtype of CD4 IELs that can express CD8αα on their cytomembrane. Hence, CD4CD8αα IELs not only have the ability to modulate the functions of immune cells but also are regarded as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Transcription factors, microbes, and dietary factors have a substantial effect on the development of CD4CD8αα IELs, which make them exert immunosuppression and cytotoxicity activities. In addition, there is an intimate relationship between CD4CD8αα IELs and  (IBD), whereas it is still unclear how CD4CD8αα IELs influence IBD.

Presently there is no cure, and many IBD treatments incur negative side effects. We previously discovered treatment with exogenous irisin resolved  changes in the colon, gut lymphatics, and bone in a mild IBD rodent model. Here we assess irisin treatment in severe IBD induced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Male Sprague Dawley rats (2-mo-old) were untreated (Con) or given 2% DSS in drinking water. In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro- factors.

Exclusive enteral nutrition might be inferior to corticosteroid treatment in adults with active Crohn's  (CD) but might even be superior considering the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment in children. Total parenteral nutrition has no advantage over enteral nutrition, which is considered a more physiologic modality in organ function. Current guidelines do not yet recommend ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for the prevention and maintenance of remission in IBD patients. Dietary fiber supplementation could be effective in the relief of symptoms and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). Although vitamin D may be favorable to clinical course of IBD and bone density. Probiotic supplementation has proven to be effective in preventing and treating pouchitis for UC but is less effective in treating CD.

We use fine-mapping to quantify the probability that each eSTR is causal and characterize the top 1,400 fine-mapped eSTRs. We identify hundreds of eSTRs linked with published genome-wide association study signals and implicate specific eSTRs in complex traits, including height, schizophrenia,  and intelligence.

To explore the anti- activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of  cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and  cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells.

Cumulative probabilities of perianal CD relapse were 50.8%, 72.6% and 78.0% at 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively. Younger age at diagnosis of CD [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; P = .04] was associated with a higher chance of perianal CD relapse. Among those with perianal CD relapse (n = 44), retreatment with anti-TNF induced remission in 24 of 29 patients (82.8%). Twelve (27.3%) patients required defunctioning surgery and one (2.3%) required proctectomy. Maintenance with thiopurine was not associated with a reduced likelihood of relapse [HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.58-2.12; P = .77]. Among the 17 patients who achieved radiological remission of perianal CD, five (35.3%) developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy after a median of 6 months.More than half of the perianal CD patients developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy. Most regained response after resuming anti-TNF. However, more than one-fourth of the perianal CD patients with relapse required defunctioning surgery. Radiological assessment before stopping anti-TNF is crucial in perianal CD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676053>Abdominal Emergencies in .</a></h2><p>Although improved medical therapies have been associated with decreased rates of emergent intestinal resection for , prompt diagnosis and management remain of utmost importance to ensure appropriate patient care with reduced morbidity and mortality. Emergent indications for surgery include toxic colitis, acute obstruction, perforation, acute abscess, or massive hemorrhage. Given this broad spectrum of emergent presentations, a multidisciplinary team including surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiologists, nutritional support services, and enterostomal therapists are required for optimal patient care and decision making.

Using smartphones to communicate symptoms and biomarkers is a potential alternative. We aimed to compare outpatient management using 2 smartphone apps (IBDsmart for symptoms and IBDoc for fecal calprotectin monitoring) vs standard face-to-face care. We hypothesized noninferiority of quality of life and symptoms at 12 months plus a reduction in face-to-face appointments in the smartphone app group. outpatients (previously seen more often than annually) were randomized to smartphone app or standard face-to-face care over 12 months. Quality of life and symptoms were measured quarterly for 12 months. Acceptability was measured for gastroenterologists and patients at 12 months.One hundred people (73 Crohn's , 49 male, average age 35 years) consented and completed baseline questionnaires (50 in each group). Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses revealed noninferiority of quality of life and symptom scores at 12 months. Outpatient appointment numbers were reduced in smartphone app care (P < 0.001). There was no difference in number of surgical outpatient appointments or number of -related hospitalizations between groups. Adherence to IBDsmart (50% perfect adherence) was slightly better than adherence to IBDoc (30% perfect adherence). Good acceptability was reported among most gastroenterologists and patients.Remote symptom and fecal calprotectin monitoring is effective and acceptable. It also reduces the need for face-to-face outpatient appointments. Patients with mild-to-moderate  who are not new diagnoses are ideal for this system.ACTRN12615000342516.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

In our study, rats were induced with complete freund's adjuvant (CFA) to be animal models for studying the RA pathogenesis. Microtubule-associated Serine/Threonine-protein kinase 3 (MAST3) has been documented to play a critical role in regulating the immune response of IBD () and involved in the process of cytoskeleton organization, intracellular signal transduction and peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, but its role in the progression of RA remains unknown and is warranted for investigation. So, we tried our best to investigate the mechanism and signaling pathway of MAST3 in RA progression. In the synovial tissue and FLSs of AA rats, we have found that MAST3 was significantly up-regulated than normal. Furthermore, MAST3 overexpression could promote proliferation and  response of FLSs. In the aspect of mechanism, we discovered that the expression of MAST3 might involve in NF-κB signaling pathway in RA. On the whole, our results suggested that MAST3 might promote the proliferation and inflammation of FLSs by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the aetiology and management of chronic pain is a poorly understood area of IBD research. This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of individuals with IBD and pain, the pain management strategies they use and any needs for future pain management interventions.In all, 14 individuals with IBD were purposively recruited and interviewed (face-to-face or telephone) using a topic guide. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.Themes identified were 'vicious cycles', 'findings solutions' and 'attitudes'. The experience and impact of pain were rarely viewed in isolation, but rather within the context of a cycle of IBD symptoms. Other 'vicious cycles' identified included anxiety, avoidance and inactivity, and poor understanding and communication. Pain management included short- and long-term strategies. Searching for a solution for pain had an emotional impact on individuals. There were contrasting attitudes from participants, including defeat, tolerance and acceptance.This study provides an understanding of the experience of pain in IBD. The interaction of pain with accompanying IBD symptoms has an emotional and physical impact on individuals, and creates a barrier to adequate assessment, understanding and treatment of pain. Patients rely on their own experiences, and a trial and error approach to apply helpful strategies.

This study aimed to characterise inflammation, predict prognosis, and understand the impact of drug therapy using Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).Patients with a stricture diagnosed on MRE over a 5-year period were reviewed for MRE  extent and inflammation, clinical course, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), response to anti-TNF therapy, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalization and surgery.136 patients had 235 (77 one and 59 ≥ two) strictures.46% of patients underwent surgery after a median 6 months; median follow-up for those not requiring surgery was 41 months. Predictors of surgery: Hospitalization due to obstruction predicted subsequent surgery (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.06-5.90) while anti-TNF therapy commenced at stricture diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05-0.99). MRE characteristics associated with surgery were proximal  dilatation ≥30mm diameter (OR, 2.98; 95% CI 1.36-6.55), stricture  wall thickness ≥10mm (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.11-5.27), and stricture length >5cm (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.21-5.43). 81% of patients with these 3 adverse MRE features required surgery versus 17% if none were present (P<0.001). Accuracy for these 3 MRE variables predicting surgery was high (AUC 0.76).MRE findings in Crohn's  strictures are highly predictive of the  course and the need for future surgery. MRE may also identify who would benefit from treatment intensification.

Western blotting was used to determine protein levels.LINC01234 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines than in non-tumor tissues and normal epithelial cells, respectively. LINC01234 was associated with high tumor stage, larger tumor size, and metastasis. Patients with higher LINC01234 expression showed reduced OS. Cell proliferation was inhibited by LINC01234 knockdown, whereas apoptosis was enhanced. Mice injected with SW480 cells with LINC01234 knockdown displayed decreased tumor volume, weight, and Ki-67 levels compared with those injected with control cells.

Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression assessed correlations between items of the CDAI and SES-CD.A total of 353 patients were included (20.7% ileal, 30.6% colonic, 48.7% ileocolonic ). Crohn's  Activity Index and SES-CD scores were moderately correlated (R = 0.33; P < 0.001). Among CDAI items, the strongest correlations with SES-CD were seen with very soft or liquid stool frequency (SF) and patient-reported outcome 2 (PRO2; which includes SF and abdominal pain score; both R = 0.36; P < 0.001); these correlations were numerically stronger in colonic  (SF: R = 0.46; P < 0.001; PRO2: R = 0.44; P < 0.001) than in ileal  (SF: R = 0.14; P = 0.23; PRO2: R = 0.21; P = 0.07), although a test for interaction was not significant. In adjusted linear regression models, the proportion of mucosa that was inflamed and the proportion of mucosa with ulceration were positively correlated, whereas the presence of strictures was inversely correlated with SF.The SF item of the CDAI is moderately correlated with SES-CD and independently correlated with mucosal ulceration, inflammation, and strictures. Understanding why  inflammation as measured endoscopically does not correlate more strongly with patients' symptoms could help develop scales that link CD pathology to patient experience.Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative colitis. Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative colitis owing to the presence of  polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for 2 years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in 5 of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative colitis,  polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-2,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the  polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative colitis activity, but due to other lesions such as  polyps. This fact must be taken into account before carrying out relevant changes such as step-up therapy to immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs in patients with confirmed high calprotectin levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated  such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, , multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury.

We aimed to assess the methylation changes on specific genes previously associated with Crohn's  (CD) and to study their possible associations with the pathology.We included 103 participants and grouped them into 2 cohorts (a first [n = 31] and a second validation [n = 72] cohort), with active CD (aCD) and inactive CD (iCD) and healthy participants (CTR). DNA was obtained from the peripheral blood and analyzed by the Agena platform. The selected genes were catalase (CAT), α-defensin 5 (DEFA5), FasR, FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, PPA2, ABCB1, NOD2, PPARγ, and PKCζ. We used the elastic net algorithm and R software.We studied 240 CpGs. Sixteen CpGs showed differential methylation profiles among aCD, iCD, and CTR. We selected for validation those with the greatest differences: DEFA5 CpG_11; CpG_13; CAT CpG_31.32; TNF CpG_4, CpG_12; and ABCB1 CpG_21. Our results validated the genes DEFA5 (methylation gain) and TNF (methylation loss) with P values < 0.001. In both cases, the methylation level was maintained and did not change with CD activity (aCD vs iCD). The subanalysis comparison between aCD and iCD showed significant differential methylation profiles in other CpGs: TNF, FAS, ABCB1, CAT, and TNFRS1BF genes.The methylation status of DEFA5 and TNF genes provides a signature biomarker that characterizes patients with CD and supports the possible implication of the environment and the immune system in CD pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653821>Postoperative pyoderma gangrenosum after spinal fusion with instrumentation: case report.</a></h2><p>Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare  dermatosis that is most often associated with , but which can occur as a pathergic reaction around surgical incisions.

However, its effect on the development of  (IBD) and the underlying mechanism have not been clarified. This study aimed to assess the clinical value of ERβCD4 T cells in IBD patients and examine the anti- role of ERβ activation in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis in mice. We investigated the effects of ERB041 (an ERβ-specific agonist) on  cytokines and pro- T-cell and regulatory T-cell (Treg) responses in murine colitis. We tested the role of ERβ activation on Treg differentiation and its activity to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro. We found that reduced frequency of circulating ERβCD4 T cells in IBD patients was negatively correlated with inflammation and  severity. ERβ and FoxP3 expression co-localized in the intestinal tissues of IBD patients. Treatment with ERB041 significantly mitigated colitis-induced weight loss, inflammation, and  severity. It also restored the ERβCD4 T cell population in the spleen and colon lamina propria of these mice. ERB041 treatment inhibited CD4CD25 and CD8 T cell infiltration and restored Tregs and activated T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) Tregs in the colon lamina propria. In vitro, we found that ERβ activation enhanced Treg differentiation, immunosuppression, and TGF-β1/Smad signaling in CD4 T cells. Our data suggest that ERβCD4 T cells represent a potential biomarker for evaluating IBD  severity, and ERβ activation may be valuable for the treatment of IBD by enhancing the Treg response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is controversy whether anastomotic ulcers represent  recurrence and should be included in the grading system. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of anastomotic ulcers on Crohn's  recurrence in patients with prior ileocolic resections. Secondary aims included defining the prevalence of anastomotic ulcers, risk factors for development, and their natural history.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing an ileocolic resection between 2008 and 2017 at a large academic center, with a postoperative colonoscopy assessing the neoterminal ileum and ileocolic anastomosis. The primary outcome was  recurrence defined as endoscopic recurrence (>5 ulcers in the neoterminal ileum) or need for another ileocolic resection among patients with or without an anastomotic ulcer in endoscopic remission.One hundred eighty-two subjects with Crohn's  and an ileocolic resection were included. Anastomotic ulcers were present in 95 (52.2%) subjects. No factors were associated with anastomotic ulcer development. One hundred eleven patients were in endoscopic remission on the first postoperative colonoscopy. On multivariable analysis, anastomotic ulcers were associated with  recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.64; 95% CI, 1.21-10.95; P = 0.02). Sixty-six subjects with anastomotic ulcers underwent a second colonoscopy, with 31 patients (79.5%) having persistent ulcers independent of medication escalation.Anastomotic ulcers occur in over half of Crohn's  patients after ileocolic resection. No factors are associated with their development. They are associated with Crohn's  recurrence and are persistent.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

Understanding these geographical differences is crucial for formulating effective strategies for preventing and treating IBD. We report the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of IBD in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of , Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.We modelled mortality due to IBD using a standard Cause of Death Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated. All of the estimates were reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).In 2017, there were 6·8 million (95% UI 6·4-7·3) cases of IBD globally. The age-standardised prevalence rate increased from 79·5 (75·9-83·5) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 84·3 (79·2-89·9) per 100 000 population in 2017. The age-standardised death rate decreased from 0·61 (0·55-0·69) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 0·51 (0·42-0·54) per 100 000 population in 2017. At the GBD regional level, the highest age-standardised prevalence rate in 2017 occurred in high-income North America (422·0 [398·7-446·1] per 100 000) and the lowest age-standardised prevalence rates were observed in the Caribbean (6·7 [6·3-7·2] per 100 000 population). High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate, while low SDI regions had the lowest age-standardised prevalence rate. At the national level, the USA had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate (464·5 [438·6-490·9] per 100 000 population), followed by the UK (449·6 [420·6-481·6] per 100 000). Vanuatu had the highest age-standardised death rate in 2017 (1·8 [0·8-3·2] per 100 000 population) and Singapore had the lowest (0·08 [0·06-0·14] per 100 000 population). The total YLDs attributed to IBD almost doubled over the study period, from 0·56 million (0·39-0·77) in 1990 to 1·02 million (0·71-1·38) in 2017. The age-standardised rate of DALYs decreased from 26·5 (21·0-33·0) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 23·2 (19·1-27·8) per 100 000 population in 2017.The prevalence of IBD increased substantially in many regions from 1990 to 2017, which might pose a substantial social and economic burden on governments and health systems in the coming years.

Inferring potential related microbes for  can not only promote  prevention, diagnosis and treatment, but also provide valuable information for drug development. Considering that experimental methods are expensive and time-consuming, developing computational methods is an alternative choice. However, most of existing methods are biased towards well-characterized  and microbes. Furthermore, existing computational methods are limited in predicting potential microbes for new .Here, we developed a novel computational model to predict potential human microbe- associations (MDAs) based on Weighted Meta-Graph (WMGHMDA). We first constructed a heterogeneous information network (HIN) by combining the integrated microbe similarity network, the integrated  similarity network and the known microbe- bipartite network. And then, we implemented iteratively pre-designed Weighted Meta-Graph search algorithm on the HIN to uncover possible microbe- pairs by cumulating the contribution values of weighted meta-graphs to the pairs as their probability scores. Depending on contribution potential, we described the contribution degree of different types of meta-graphs to a microbe- pair with bias rating. Meta-graph with higher bias rating will be assigned greater weight value when calculating probability scores.The experimental results showed that WMGHMDA outperformed some state-of-the-art methods with average AUCs of 0.9288, 0.9068 ±0.0031 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and 5-fold cross validation (5-fold CV), respectively. In the case studies, 9, 19, 37 and 10, 20, 45 out of top-10, 20, 50 candidate microbes were manually verified by previous reports for asthma and  (IBD), respectively. Furthermore, three common human  (Crohn's , Liver cirrhosis, Type 1 diabetes) were adopted to demonstrate that WMGHMDA could be efficiently applied to make predictions for new .

Observation started with the date of the first prescription of index tumor necrosis factor α-inhibitors (anti-TNFα) or vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy and lasted 12 months. Non-persistence was assumed in case of a switch to another biologic or a treatment gap of >90 days.We included 1,248 IBD biologic treatment starters (502 adalimumab, 77 golimumab, 441 infliximab, 228 VDZ); 837/411 were biologic-naïve (bio-naïve)/ biologic-experienced (bio-experienced). Mean age of bio-naïve/bio-experienced anti-TNFα patients was 39.2/38.1 years (54.9%/56.7% female) and 42.6/37.8 years for VDZ patients (56.3%/54.9% female). Seven hundred and seventy-two patients (61.9%) were persistent with their index biologic therapy after 12 months (61.9%/61.8% bio-naïve/bio-experienced). Percentage of persistent patients was 69.7% for VDZ (65.6%/71.3%) and 60.1% for anti-TNFα (61.4%/55.5%). VDZ was associated with later non-persistence in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.675; p = 0.003) compared to anti-TNFα.Only 60-70% of IBD -patients are still persistent with their biologic therapy after 12 months.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal  cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of blocking IL-6 is imperative. We investigated these consequences by evaluating the effects of IL-6 deletion on the spontaneous colitis of IL-10 deficient mice (IL-10-/-).IL-6/IL-10 double-deficient mice (IL-6-/-/IL-10-/-) were generated and analyzed for intestinal inflammation, general phenotypes, and molecular/biochemical changes in the colonic mucosa by comparing to those of WT and IL-10-/- mice.Unexpectedly, the IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice manifested more pronounced gut inflammation and earlier  onset than IL-10-/- mice, both locally (colon and small ) and systemically (splenomegaly, ulcerative dermatitis, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and monocytosis). IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice exhibited elevations of multiple cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-12, TNFα) and chemokines (MCP-1 and MIG), but not IFN-γ (Th1), IL-17A and IL-17G (Th17), or IL-22 (Th22). FOXP3 and TGF-β, two key factors for Regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation, were significantly down-regulated in the colonic mucosa, but not in the thymus or mesenteric lymph nodes, of IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice. CTLA-4 was diminished while iNOS was upregulated in the colonic mucosa of IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice.In IL-10-/- mice, complete IL-6 blockade significantly aggravates gut inflammation, at least in part by suppressing Treg/CTLA-4 and promoting the IL-1β/Th2 pathway. In addition, the double mutant exhibits signs of severe systemic inflammation. Our data define a new function of IL-6 and suggest that caution should be exercised when targeting IL-6 in IBD patients, particularly those with defects in IL-10 signaling.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).
