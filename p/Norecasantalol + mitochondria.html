The involvement of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in necroptosis has not been studied.We performed experiments in mice with an  deletion in collecting duct (CD) principal cells (PCs), and cultured tubular epithelial cells treated with an ILK inhibitor or ILK siRNA knockdown. deletion in CD PCs resulted in acute tubular injury and early mortality in mice. Progressive interstitial fibrosis and inflammation associated with the activation of the canonical TGF- signaling cascade were detected in the kidneys of the mice lacking ILK in the CD PCs. In contrast to the minimal apoptosis detected in the animals' injured CDs, widespread necroptosis was present in ILK-deficient PCs, characterized by cell swelling, deformed , and rupture of plasma membrane. In addition, ILK deficiency resulted in increased expression and activation of necroptotic proteins MLKL and RIPK3, and membrane translocation of MLKL in CD PCs. ILK inhibition and siRNA knockdown reduced cell survival in cultured tubular cells, concomitant with increased membrane accumulation of MLKL and/or phospho-MLKL. Administration of a necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1, blocked cell death  and significantly attenuated inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and renal failure in ILK-deficient mice.The study demonstrates the critical involvement of ILK in necroptosis through modulation of the RIPK3 and MLKL pathway and highlights the contribution of CD PC injury to the development of inflammation and interstitial fibrosis of the kidney.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643037>High Concentration of Ketone Body β-Hydroxybutyrate Modifies Synaptic Vesicle Cycle and Depolarizes Plasma Membrane of Rat Brain Synaptosomes.</a></h2><p>Ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of diabetes mellitus in which plasma levels of ketone bodies can reach 20-25 mM. This condition is life-threatening. In contrast, a ketogenic diet, achieving plasma levels of ketone bodies of about 4-5 mM, can be used for treating different brain diseases. However, the factors leading to the conversion of the neuroprotective ketone bodies' action to the neurotoxic action during ketoacidosis are still unknown. We investigated the influence of high concentration (25 mM) of the main ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), on intrasynaptosomal pH (pHi), synaptic vesicle cycle, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial potentials. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, it was shown that BHB at concentrations of 8 and 25 mM did not influence pHi in synaptosomes. By means of the fluorescent dye acridine orange, it was demonstrated that 25 mM of BHB had no effect on exocytosis but inhibited compensatory endocytosis by 5-fold. Increasing buffer capacity with 25 mM HEPES did not affect endocytosis. Glucose abolished BHB-induced endocytosis inhibition. Using the fluorescent dye DiSC3(5), it was shown that 25 mM of BHB induced a significant plasma membrane depolarization. This effect was not impacted by glucose. Using the fluorescent dye rhodamine-123, it was shown that BHB alone (25 mМ) did not alter the potential of intrasynaptosomal .Importantly, the high concentration of BHB (25 mМ) causes the depolarization of the plasma membrane and stronger inhibition of endocytosis compared with the intermediate concentration (8 mM).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648943>Tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activities in a mouse model of methylmalonic aciduria.</a></h2><p>Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a propionate pathway disorder caused by dysfunction of the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT). MMUT catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an anaplerotic reaction which feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. As part of the pathological mechanisms of MMA, previous studies have suggested there is decreased TCA activity due to a "toxic inhibition" of TCA cycle enzymes by MMA related metabolites, in addition to reduced anaplerosis. Here, we have utilized  isolated from livers of a mouse model of MMA (Mut-ko/ki) and their littermate controls (Ki/wt) to examine the amounts and enzyme functions of most of the TCA cycle enzymes. We have performed mRNA quantification, protein semi-quantitation, and enzyme activity quantification for TCA cycle enzymes in these samples. Expression profiling showed increased mRNA levels of fumarate hydratase in the Mut-ko/ki samples, which by contrast had reduced protein levels as detected by immunoblot, while all other mRNA levels were unaltered. Immunoblotting also revealed decreased protein levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Interesting, the decreased protein amount of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was reflected in decreased activity for this enzyme while there is a trend towards decreased activity of fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3, succinyl-CoA synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase are not statistically different in terms of quantity of enzyme or activity. Finally, we found decreased activity when examining the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in series with succinate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase in the Mut-ko/ki mice compared to their littermate controls, as expected. This study demonstrates decreased activity of certain TCA cycle enzymes and by corollary decreased TCA cycle function, but it supports decreased protein quantity rather than "toxic inhibition" as the underlying mechanism of action. SUMMARY: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn metabolic disorder of propionate catabolism. In this disorder, toxic metabolites are considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism for acute and long-term complications. However, despite optimized therapies aimed at reducing metabolite levels, patients continue to suffer from late complications, including metabolic stroke and renal insufficiency. Since the propionate pathway feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, we investigated TCA cycle function in a constitutive MMA mouse model. We demonstrated decreased amounts of the TCA enzymes, Mdh2 and Ogdh as semi-quantified by immunoblot. Enzymatic activity of Ogdh is also decreased in the MMA mouse model compared to controls. Thus, when the enzyme amounts are decreased, we see the enzymatic activity also decreased to a similar extent for Ogdh. Further studies to elucidate the structural and/or functional links between the TCA cycle and propionate pathways might lead to new treatment approaches for MMA patients.Copyright © 2019.

TMEM70 absence causes severe ATP-synthase deficiency and leads to a neonatal mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathy in humans. However, the exact biochemical function of TMEM70 remains unknown. Using TMEM70 conditional knockout in mice, we show that absence of TMEM70 impairs the early stage of enzyme biogenesis by preventing incorporation of hydrophobic subunit c into rotor structure of the enzyme. This results in the formation of an incomplete, pathologic enzyme complex consisting of F domain and peripheral stalk but lacking F proton channel composed of subunits c and a. We demonstrated direct interaction between TMEM70 and subunit c and showed that overexpression of subunit c in  cells partially rescued TMEM70 defect. Accordingly, TMEM70 knockdown prevented subunit c accumulation otherwise observed in F-deficient cells. Altogether, we identified TMEM70 as specific ancillary factor for subunit c. The biologic role of TMEM70 is to increase the low efficacy of spontaneous assembly of subunit c oligomer, the key and rate-limiting step of ATP-synthase biogenesis, and thus to reach an adequately high physiologic level of ATP synthase in mammalian tissues.-Kovalčíková, J., Vrbacký, M., Pecina, P., Tauchmannová, K., Nůsková, H., Kaplanová, V., Brázdová, A., Alán, L., Eliáš, J., Čunátová, K., Kořínek, V., Sedlacek, R., Mráček, T., Houštěk, J.

For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.5-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in  and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651552>A Novel Approach to Investigating Brain Waste Removal in Humans.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled.

The results of C8G hepatotoxicity proteomics shows that, a total of 773 differentially expressed proteins were screened and analyzed using GO analysis and Pathway enrichment analysis. Our results show that C8G can lead to abnormal oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting the function of mitochondrial complexes, resulting in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and eventually resulting in mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Western blot results verified the accuracy of quantitative proteomic results, and also evaluated the expression of Bax, caspase-3, -8, -9, Bcl-2, Cyt C in the  and cytosolic.

The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) together with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) forms the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MIB), a large protein complex present in mammalian  that partakes in the formation and maintenance of cristae. We report here a new subunit of the mammalian MICOS/MIB complex, an armadillo repeat-containing protein 1 (ArmC1). ArmC1 localizes both to cytosol and , where it associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane through its carboxy-terminus. ArmC1 interacts with other constituents of the MICOS/MIB complex and its amounts are reduced upon MICOS/MIB complex depletion.  lacking ArmC1 do not show defects in cristae structure, respiration or protein content, but appear fragmented and with reduced motility.

SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653782>Condensin II protein dysfunction impacts mitochondrial respiration and stress response.</a></h2><p>The maintenance of mitochondrial respiratory function and homeostasis is essential to human health. Here, we identify Condensin II subunits as novel regulators of mitochondrial respiration and stress response. Condensin II is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. While the effects of Condensin II depletion on nuclear genome organization are well-studied, effects on essential cytoplasmic and metabolic processes are not as well understood. Excitingly, we observe that Condensin II Chromosome Associated Protein (CAP) subunits individually localize to different regions of , suggesting possible mitochondrial-specific functions independent from the canonical Condensin II holocomplex. Changes in cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial respiration are observed in Condensin II CAP subunit-deficient cells. Surprisingly, we find that loss of NCAPD3 also sensitizes cells to oxidative stress. Together, these studies identify new, and possibly independent, roles for Condensin II CAP subunits in preventing mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. These findings reveal a new area of Condensin protein research that could contribute to the identification of targets to treat diseases where aberrant function of Condensin II proteins is implicated.© 2019.

The cortisol metabolic effects are attributed to genomic mechanisms that involve the interaction of cortisol with its glucocorticoid intracellular receptor. Furthermore, cortisol can also interact with plasma membrane glucocorticoid receptors activating a rapid nongenomic signaling; however, its contribution during the early acute phase stress response in fish is unknown. In the present work, we evaluated the effects of membrane-initiated cortisol actions in vivo in the proteome of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) skeletal muscle. Quantitative iTRAQ analyses were performed to examine proteomic changes in rainbow trout stimulated with physiological concentrations of cortisol and cortisol-BSA, a membrane-impermeable cortisol conjugate. A total of 873 proteins were identified, among which 61 and 47 proteins were differentially expressed under cortisol and cortisol-BSA treatments, respectively. Functional clustering analysis revealed an upregulation of proteins associated with  and oxidative phosphorylation. These results were validated by Western blot analysis. Additionally, using rainbow trout myotubes, the participation of membrane glucocorticoid receptors in gene expression was evaluated. The results obtained suggest that cortisol acts through a membrane canonical glucocorticoid receptor and mediates the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole metabolism suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662818>Cancer-specific metabolism: Promising approaches for colorectal cancer treatment.</a></h2><p>Investigation of cancer-specific metabolism has made it possible to establish the principle that atypically reconstituted metabolism is considered a hallmark of cancer due to changes in physiological property. Recently, a variety of targets depending on the prompted aerobic glycolysis process, starting from the abnormal uptake of glucose, and cancer-specific metabolism due to impaired mitochondrial function and abnormal expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes have been investigated and discovered. Given that most solid cancers rely on cancer-specific metabolism to support their growth, it is necessary to examine closely the specific processes of cancer metabolism and have a detailed understanding of how cellular metabolism is altered in colorectal cancer (CRC) related to CRC survival and proliferation.

Here, we investigated mechanisms through which PE21 delays yeast chronological aging and extends yeast longevity. We show that PE21 causes a remodeling of lipid metabolism in chronologically aging yeast, thereby instigating changes in the concentrations of several lipid classes. We demonstrate that such changes in the cellular lipidome initiate three mechanisms of aging delay and longevity extension. The first mechanism through which PE21 slows aging and prolongs longevity consists in its ability to decrease the intracellular concentration of free fatty acids. This postpones an age-related onset of liponecrotic cell death promoted by excessive concentrations of free fatty acids. The second mechanism of aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to decrease the concentrations of triacylglycerols and to increase the concentrations of glycerophospholipids within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This activates the unfolded protein response system in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then decelerates an age-related decline in protein and lipid homeostasis and slows down an aging-associated deterioration of cell resistance to stress. The third mechanisms underlying aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to change lipid concentrations in the mitochondrial membranes. This alters certain catabolic and anabolic processes in , thus amending the pattern of aging-associated changes in several key aspects of mitochondrial functionality.Copyright: © 2019 Medkour et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640104>Mitochondrial Transfer Ameliorates Cognitive Deficits, Neuronal Loss, and Gliosis in Alzheimer's Disease Mice.</a></h2><p>Pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases involves dysfunction of , one of the most important cell organelles in the brain, with its most prominent roles in producing energy and regulating cellular metabolism.

For this purpose, AD-mice (amyloid-β intracerebroventricularly injected) were treated intravenously (IV) with fresh human isolated . One to two weeks later, a significantly better cognitive performance was noticed in the  treated AD-mice relative to vehicle treated AD-mice, approaching the performance of non-AD mice. We also detected a significant decrease in neuronal loss and reduced gliosis in the hippocampus of treated mice relative to untreated AD-mice. An amelioration of the mitochondrial dysfunction in brain was noticed by the increase of citrate-synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities relative to untreated AD-mice, reaching activity levels of non-AD-mice.

Our investigations using the closely related mouse strains C57BL/6NJ (6NJ; +NNT) and C57BL/6J (6J; -NNT) revealed that NNT is required for the provision of NADPH and that the upregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) activity is not enough to compensate for the absence of NNT, which is consistent with previous observations. Intriguingly, despite the absence of NNT, 6J  had rates of HO production (58.56 ± 3.79 pmol mg min) that were similar to samples collected from 6NJ mice (72.75 ± 14.26 pmol mg min) when pyruvate served as the substrate. However, 6NJ  energized with succinate produced significantly less HO (59.95 ± 2.13 pmol mg min) when compared to samples from 6J mice (116.39 ± 20.74 pmol mg min), an effect that was attributed to the presence of NNT. Further investigations into the HO eliminating capacities of these  led to the novel observation that 6J  compensate for the loss of NNT by upregulating catalase. Indeed, 6NJ and 6J  energized with pyruvate or succinate displayed similar rates for HO elimination, quenching ~84% and ~86% of the HO, respectively, in the surrounding medium within 30 s. However, inclusion of palmitoyl-CoA, an NNT inhibitor, significantly limited HO degradation by 6NJ  only (~55% of HO eliminated in 30 s). Liver  from 6J mice treated with palmitoyl-CoA still cleared ~80% of the HO from the surrounding environment. Inhibition of catalase with triazole compromised the capacity of 6J  to maintain HO steady-state levels. By contrast, disabling NADPH-dependent antioxidant systems had a limited effect on the HO clearing capacity of 6J . Liver  collected from 6NJ mice, on the other hand, were more reliant on the GSH and TRX systems to clear exogenously added HO. However, catalase still played an integral in eliminating HO in 6NJ liver . Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that catalase protein levels were ~7.7-fold higher in 6J . Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that 6J liver  compensate for the loss of NNT by increasing catalase levels for the maintenance of HO steady-state levels.

This study examined whether PKCα regulates recovery of mitochondrial and kidney functions after ischemia-induced acute injury (AKI) in vivo. Markers of kidney injury were increased after bilateral ischemia and returned to normal levels in wild-type (WT) mice. Maximum mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complexes and F F -ATPase decreased after ischemia and recovered in WT mice. Reperfusion after ischemia was accompanied by translocation of active PKCα to . PKCα deletion reduced mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complex I and F F -ATPase in non-injured kidneys, indicating that PKCα is essential in developing fully functional renal . These changes in PKCα-deficient mice were accompanied by lower levels of complex I subunits (NDUFA9 and NDUFS3) and the γ-subunit of F F -ATPase. Also, lack of PKCα exacerbated ischemia-induced decreases in respiration, complex I and F F -ATPase activities, and blocked their recovery after injury, indicating a crucial role of PKCα in promoting mitochondrial recovery after AKI. Further, PKCα deletion exacerbated acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins of energy metabolism after ischemia due to decreases in deacetylase and desuccinylase (sirtuin3 and sirtuin5) levels in renal . Thus, our data show a novel role for PKCα in regulating levels of mitochondrial sirtuins and acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins. We conclude that PKCα deletion: 1) affects renal physiology by decreasing mitochondrial capacity for maximum respiration, 2) blocks recovery of mitochondrial functions, renal morphology and functions after AKI, and 3) decreases survival after AKI.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630795>Von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 8 (VWA8) localizes to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane.</a></h2><p>VWA8 is a poorly characterized mitochondrial AAA + ATPase protein.

The parasite survives as promastigotes in the insect gut and as immotile amastigotes in mammals. This study demonstrates increased autophagy in Leishmania parasite during progression of in vitro life cycle and upon exposure to stress stimuli like starvation, oxidative stress, and drugs. Autophagy inhibition during stress exposure increased cell death, indicating the importance of autophagy in cellular defense against adverse conditions. Atg8 protein, a homolog of mammalian autophagy protein LC3 is expressed in Leishmania parasite but its function remains unknown. Overexpression of Atg8 (Atg8-OE) rendered the parasites resistant to stress and capable of infecting macrophages in substantial numbers; however, disruption of the Atg8 gene (ΔAtg8) resulting in suppression of Atg8 protein expression, increased susceptibility to stress and reduced the capability to cause infection. A critical event in the Leishmania parasite lifecycle is the differentiation of promastigote forms to the disease causing amastigote forms. The failure of ΔAtg8 parasites lacking Atg8 protein to differentiate into amastigotes, unlike the Atg8-OE and vector-transfected parasites, clearly indicated Atg8 involvement in a crucial event. The inability of ΔAtg8 parasites to infect macrophages in vitro was verified in an in vivo mouse model of leishmaniases where infection could not be induced by the ΔAtg8 parasites. Autophagy is known to be involved in the remodeling of damaged organelles. The accumulation of Atg8 around damaged  suggested increase of autophagy in the vicinity of the organelle. This buildup was prevented when  generated reactive oxygen species that were quenched, suggesting them as possible signaling molecules for sensing mitochondrial instability.

Identification and characterization of enzymes involved in epitranscriptome shaping is instrumental for the elucidation of the functional roles of specific RNA modifications. Ten modified sites have been thus far identified in the mammalian mitochondrial rRNA. Enzymes responsible for two of these modifications have not been characterized. Here, we identify METTL15, show that it is the main N4-methylcytidine (m4C) methyltransferase in human cells and demonstrate that it is responsible for the methylation of position C839 in mitochondrial 12S rRNA. We show that the lack of METTL15 results in a reduction of the mitochondrial de novo protein synthesis and decreased steady-state levels of protein components of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Without functional METTL15, the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome is decreased, with the late assembly components being unable to be incorporated efficiently into the small subunit. We speculate that m4C839 is involved in the stabilization of 12S rRNA folding, therefore facilitating the assembly of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunits. Taken together our data show that METTL15 is a novel protein necessary for efficient translation in human .© The Author(s) 2019.

They participate in the transport, sorting, storage, recycling, degradation, and release of multiple substances. They interchange cargo with other organelles and participate in their renovation and degradation. We have used focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to obtain stacks of serial sections from the neuropil of the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat. Using dedicated software, we have 3D-reconstructed 1618 MVBs. The mean density of MVBs was 0.21 per cubic micron. They were unequally distributed between dendrites (39.14%), axons (18.16%), and nonsynaptic cell processes (42.70%). About one out of five MVBs (18.16%) were docked on , representing the process by which the endosomal pathway participates in mitochondrial maintenance. Other features of MVBs, such as the presence of tubular protrusions (6.66%) or clathrin coats (19.74%) can also be interpreted in functional terms, since both are typical of early endosomes. The sizes of MVBs follow a lognormal distribution, with differences across cortical layers and cellular compartments. The mean volume of dendritic MVBs is more than twice as large as the volume of axonic MVBs. In layer I, they are smaller, on average, than in the other layers.© The Author(s) 2019.

How oxygen moves from the air, where its partial pressure is about 150 mm Hg to , where it drops down to a single digit is an evolutionary marvel. In this article, we discuss the physiology of oxygen transport from the alveoli to the tissue, the alveolar gas equation and the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. In the applied physiology section, we discuss the impact of high altitude, hyperbaric conditions, carbon monoxide poisoning on the transport of oxygen. Some common pitfalls in the interpretation of pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas are also discussed. Finally, we talk about the methods of increasing oxygen delivery, the compensation for hypoxia and some indications of venous oxygen saturation measurement.Arora S, Tantia P.

The exosome markers, cluster of differentiation 63 (CD63) and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), were positively expressed in intestinal villi during turtle hibernation. The distribution and formation processes of MVBs and exosomes in turtle MRCs, GCs, and ACs were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. During hibernation, abundantly secreted early endosomes (ees) were localized in the luminal and basal cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs, and late endosomes (les) were dispersed with the supranuclear parts of the MRCs and ACs. Many "heterogeneous" MVBs were identified throughout the cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs. Interestingly, the ees, les, and MVBs were detected in the cytoplasm of the GCs during hibernation; however, they were absent during nonhibernation. Furthermore, the exocytosis pathways of exosomes and autophagic vacuoles were observed in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. In addition, the number of different MVBs with intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and heterogeneous endosome-MVB-exosome complexes was significantly increased in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. All these findings indicate that intestinal epithelial cells potentially perform a role in the secretion of MVBs and exosomes, which are essential for mucosal immunity, during hibernation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h2><p>Twist-related protein 2 (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA. Together, our studies identify an important role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in maintaining hepatic homeostasis by ameliorating steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress  the NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic scheme for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.-Zhou, L., Li, Q., Chen, A., Liu, N., Chen, N., Chen, X., Zhu, L., Xia, B., Gong, Y., Chen, X.

It's the most common metabolic bone and muscle disorder in elderly, especially in female. Osteoporosis is a pathologic process by a decrease in bone mass and deterioration in skeletal microarchitecture, accompanied by a progressive and generalized loss of muscle mass with muscle strength or a loss of physical performance with increasing rates of disability, poor mobility, frailty, and even the mortality and morbidity. Bone and muscle have been increasingly recognized as interacting tissues as a result of the mechanical effects of muscle loading on bone function. Some endocrine disorders are also related to osteoporosis and sarcopenia, e.g. diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin D deficiency, insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, sex hormones, cytokine imbalance, obesity and malnutrition. Bone and muscle dysfunction, also characterized by the predominant atrophy of type II fibers together with smaller and fewer , are associated with several genetic polymorphisms of the genes such as α-actinin 3, proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, glycine-n-acyltransferase, methyltransferase-like 21C, myostatin, and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (Fig.1). Therefore, the denervation of single muscle fibers reduces type-II fibers, which are gradually replaced by type-I fibers and adipose tissue.© 2019 The Authors.

The cell viability assay revealed that PeME significantly reduced the viability of these cells. Clear apoptotic features such as cellular morphology, cell shrinkage, and augmentation of dead cells were observed. Flow cytometry and fluorescence staining techniques confirmed the apoptotic property of PeME.  scratch invasion assay showed that cell migration rate was significantly reduced. Fluorescence microscopic studies using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining showed early and late signs of apoptosis after PeME treatment. Upon PeME stimulation, activation of caspase-3/-9 and Mu-2-related death-inducing gene (MUDENG, MuD) was observed by western blot analysis. JC-1 staining analysis by flow cytometry showed that PeME depolarized the  membrane potential (MMP). Collectively, these findings, for the first time, point to the fact that PeME has anti-cancer properties against brain, colon, and skin cancer cell lines by depolarizing the MMP and activating apoptotic signaling through the activation of caspase-3/-9 as well as MuD.

The regulatory mechanisms of these two processes share B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins and AMBRA1, which are present in both the endoplasmic reticulum and . B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins sense different stresses and interact with AMBRA1 to regulate autophagy and apoptosis, which are respectively mediated by Beclin1 and Caspases. Therefore, we investigated how different levels of stress on B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins that bind to AMBRA1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and  regulate the switch from autophagy to apoptosis.In this paper, we considered the responses of B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins, which bind to AMBRA1 in both the endoplasmic reticulum and , to two different levels of stress in a model originally proposed by Kapuy et al. We investigated how these two stress levels affect the transition from autophagy to apoptosis and their effects on apoptosis activation over time. Additionally, we analyzed how the feedback regulation in this model affects the bifurcation diagrams of two levels of stress and cell fate decisions between autophagy and apoptosis.Autophagy is activated for minor stress in  regardless of endoplasmic reticulum stress, while apoptosis is activated for only significant stress in . Apoptosis is only sensitive to  stress. The time duration before apoptosis activation is longer in the presence of high AMBRA1 levels with high endoplasmic reticulum and  stress. AMBRA1 can compete with B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins to bind and activate Beclin1 and thus promote the autophagy process for a long time before apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis is prone to occur with increasing activation of Caspases, inactivation of Beclin1-A and the Michaelis constant of Caspases.A novel mathematical model has been developed to understand the complex regulatory mechanisms of autophagy and apoptosis. Our model may be applied to further autophagy-apoptosis dynamic modeling experiments and simulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653586>Neuropathy due to impaired axonal transport of non-fragmented  in MYH14 mutation carriers.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631459>The induced damage in the hepatopancreas of Orchestia species after exposure to a mixture of Cu/Zn-An ultrastructural study.</a></h2><p>The hepatopancreas of crustaceans species has been recognized as an essential target organ to assess trace elements' effects. Due to its dynamic and capability of detoxifying trace metal, this organ often indicates distinct pathological disturbances. In the present work, we intend to evaluate the bioaccumulation of trace metal in three Orchestia species (Orchestia montagui, Orchestia gammarellus, and Orchestia mediterranea) living in symmetry in the banks of Bizerte lagoon (37°13'8″N 09°55'1″E) after their exposure during 14 days to a mixture of copper and zinc, and to highlight the effect of these metals on their hepatopancreas ultrastructure using transmission electron microscopy. At the end of the experiment, results showed that the mortality and the body mass varied according to the used nominal concentrations. Significant alterations were noted in all the treatment groups. The degree of these alterations depends on the used concentration, and they are represented especially by the cells remoteness and the border lyses, the reduction of the nuclear volume, the increase in the cytoplasm density with the presence of trace metal in the nucleus as well as in the vacuole, the disorganization and the destruction of microvilli, the condensation of the majority of cellular organelles and  swelling.

Herein, the mechanism of action of CGA-N9 was investigated. We found that CGA-N9 induced the depolarization of the cell membrane and uptake of calcium ions into the cytosol and . With the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased. Accordingly, we assessed apoptotic processes in Candida tropicalis cells post-treatment with CGA-N9 and found cytochrome c leakage, chromatin condensation and DNA degradation. The interaction of CGA-N9 with DNA in vitro showed that CGA-N9 did not degrade DNA but bound to DNA via an electrostatic interaction.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated oxidative stress precede characteristic loss of dopamine-producing neurons from the midbrain in PD. The majority of PD cases are classified as sporadic (sPD) with an unknown etiology, whereas mutations in a handful of genes cause monogenic form called familial (fPD). Both sPD and fPD is characterized by proteinopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to increased oxidative stress. These pathophysiological mechanisms create a vicious cycle feeding into each other, ultimately tipping the neurons to its demise. Effect of iron accumulation and dopamine oxidation adds an additional dimension to mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways affected. Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor which regulates basal as well as inducible expression of antioxidant enzymes and proteins involved in xenobiotic detoxification. Recent advances, however, shows a multifaceted role for Nrf2 in the regulation of genes connected with inflammatory response, metabolic pathways, protein homeostasis, iron management, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Here we review the role of  and oxidative stress in the PD etiology and the potential crosstalk between Nrf2 signaling and mitochondrial function in PD. We also make a case for the development of therapeutics that safely activates Nrf2 pathway in halting the progression of neurodegeneration in PD patients.Copyright © 2018.

However, the biochemical linkage between the cysteine proteolytic activity of Makes Caterpillars Floppy-like (MCF) effector and its cellular effects remains unknown. In this study, we identify the host cell factors that activate in vivo and in vitro MCF autoprocessing as ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) and ADP-ribosylation Factor 3 (ARF3). Autoprocessing activity is enhanced when ARF1 is in its active (GTP-bound) form compared to the inactive (GDP-bound) form. Subsequent to auto-cleavage, MCF is acetylated on its exposed N-terminal glycine residue. Acetylation apparently does not dictate subcellular localization, as MCF is found localized throughout the cell. However, the cleaved form of MCF gains the ability to bind to the specialized lipid phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate enriched in Golgi and other membranes necessary for endocytic trafficking, suggesting a fraction of MCF may be subcellular localized. Traditional thin-section electron microscopy, high-resolution cryoAPEX localization, and fluorescent microscopy show that MCF causes Golgi dispersal resulting in extensive vesiculation. In addition, host  are disrupted and fragmented. Mass spectrometry analysis found no reproducible modifications of ARF1 suggesting ARF1 is not post-translationally modified by MCF. Further, catalytically active MCF does not stably associate with ARF1. Our data indicate that ARF1 is a cross-kingdom activator of MCF, but also that MCF may mediate cytotoxicity by directly targeting another yet to be identified protein.

DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, annexin V-fluorexcein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection, and western blotting were applied to explore the apoptotic effect of Ivalin. Next, the induction effect of Ivalin on the mitochondrial pathway was also confirmed via a series of phenomena including the damage of  membrane potential,  cytochrome c escape, cleaved caspase-3 induction, and the reactive oxygen species generation. In this connection, we understood that Ivalin induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and the overload of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, we found that the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and subsequent p53 induction were associated with the apoptotic effect of Ivalin. These data confirmed that Ivalin might be a promising pro-apoptotic compound that can be utilized as a potential drug for clinical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658599>Redox-Mediated Mechanism of Chemoresistance in Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) status is stabilized by a balance of ROS generation and elimination called redox homeostasis.

Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free fatty acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634899>FSP1 is a glutathione-independent ferroptosis suppressor.</a></h2><p>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of necrotic cell death marked by oxidative damage to phospholipids. To date, ferroptosis has been believed to be restrained only by the phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH)-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs). The factors which underlie a given cell type's sensitivity to ferroptosis are, however, critical to understand the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis and how it may be exploited for cancer treatment. Although metabolic constraints and phospholipid composition contribute to ferroptosis sensitivity, no cell-autonomous mechanisms have been yet been identified that account for ferroptosis resistance. We undertook an expression cloning approach to identify genes able to complement GPX4 loss. These efforts uncovered the flavoprotein "apoptosis inducing factor -associated 2 (AIFM2)" as a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic gene. AIFM2, hereafter renamed "ferroptosis-suppressor-protein 1" (FSP1), initially described as a pro-apoptotic gene, confers an unprecedented protection against ferroptosis elicited by GPX4 deletion. We further demonstrate that ferroptosis suppression by FSP1 is mediated via ubiquinone (CoQ): its reduced form ubiquinol traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, while FSP1 catalyses its regeneration by using NAD(P)H. Pharmacological targeting of FSP1 strongly synergizes with GPX4 inhibitors to trigger ferroptosis in a number of cancer entities. In conclusion, FSP1/CoQ/NAD(P)H exists as a stand-alone parallel system, which co-operates with GPX4 and glutathione (GSH) to suppress phospholipid peroxidation (pLPO) and ferroptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631063>Sirtuin 3 attenuates neuroinflammation-induced apoptosis in BV-2 microglia.</a></h2><p>In this study, we explored the upstream regulatory mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in microglial BV-2 cells. Our results demonstrate that Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) expression was downregulated in response to LPS-induced neuroinflammation. In addition, overexpression of Sirt3 attenuated LPS-induced BV-2 cell death. Functional studies illustrated that Sirt3 overexpression promoted normal mitochondrial function and inhibited -dependent apoptosis in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. At the molecular level, suppressor of ras val-2 (SRV2) promoted LPS-mediated mitochondrial damage by inducing mitochondrial fission. Sirt3 overexpression, which suppressed the transcription of SRV2 and thus suppressed mitochondrial fission, played an anti-apoptotic role in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. Furthermore, Sirt3 inhibited SRV2 expression via the Mst1-JNK pathway, and re-activation of this pathway abolished the protective effects of Sirt3 on mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that Sirt3-induced, Mst1-JNK-SRV2 signaling pathway-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial fission protected against neuroinflammation-mediated cell damage in BV-2 microglia.

We assessed lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, exercise-induced changes in arterial O content (SaO, PaO, hemoglobin), muscle blood volume, and O extraction (via near-infrared spectroscopy). We analyzed blood samples for metabolic and hormonal vasoactive moieties and factors that are able to shift the O-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Mitochondrial oxidative capacities were assessed in permeabilized vastus lateralis muscle fibers.Lung diffusion capacity and arterial O transport were normal in patients with T1D. However, those patients displayed blunted exercise-induced increases in muscle blood volume, despite higher serum insulin, and in O extraction, despite higher erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Although complex I- and complex II-supported mitochondrial respirations were unaltered, complex IV capacity (relative to complex I capacity) was impaired in patients with T1D, and this was even more apparent in those with long-standing diabetes and high HbA. [Formula: see text]O was lower in patients with T1D than in the controls.Early defects in microvascular delivery of blood to skeletal muscle and in complex IV capacity in the mitochondrial respiratory chain may negatively impact aerobic fitness.

Furthermore, the results of an in vitro fertilization study indicate IRPS at 0.6 mg/mL markedly increased the sperm fertilization capacity (P <  0.01) and embryonic development to the blastocyst stage (P <  0.05). The addition of 0.6 mg/mL IRPS enhanced the antioxidant capacity of boar sperm, resulting in greater preservation of sperm motility and fertilization capacity during liquid storage. These findings indicate that IRPS has the potential to be used as a component of a semen-preserving diluent to maintain sperm quality during storage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino acid metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty acid elongation in  and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving.

Considering the limited efficacy and toxicity of currently available -targeting agents, it is necessary to develop effective -targeting anticancer drugs. By screening a large chemical library consisting of natural products with diverse chemical entities, we identified gracillin, a steroidal saponin, as a -targeting antitumor drug. Gracillin displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on the viability of a large panel of human cancer cell lines, including those carrying acquired resistance to chemotherapy or EGFR-targeting drugs, by inducing apoptosis. We show that gracillin attenuates -mediated cellular bioenergetics by suppressing ATP synthesis and by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistically, gracillin disrupts complex II (CII) function by abrogating succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity without affecting the succinate:ubiquinone reductase. The gracillin-induced cell death was potentiated by 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) or thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which inhibit CII by binding to the active site of SDHA or to the ubiquinone-binding site, respectively. Finally, we show that gracillin effectively suppressed the mutant-Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis and the growth of xenograft tumors derived from cell lines or patient tissues. Gracillin displayed no obvious pathophysiological features in mice. Collectively, gracillin has potential as a CII-targeting antitumor drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642107>3-(3-Methoxyphenyl)-6-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-7H-[1,2,4] triazolo [3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazine, a novel tubulin inhibitor, evokes G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer and cervical cancer are two major malignant tumors that threaten human health. The novel chemotherapeutic drugs are needed urgently to treat gastric cancer and cervical cancer with high anticancer activity and metabolic stability. Previously we have reported the synthesis, characterization and identification of a novel combretastatin A-4 analog, 3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-6-(3-amino-4- methoxyphenyl) -7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazine (XSD-7). In this study, we sought to investigate its anticancer mechanisms in a human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901 cells) and human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa cells). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that XSD-7 induced cytotoxicity in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells with inhibitory concentration 50 values of 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.12 ± 0.05 µM, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies proved that XSD-7 inhibited microtubule polymerization during cell division in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells. Then, these cells were arrested at G2/M cell cycle and subsequently progressed into apoptosis. In further study, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis and Western blot analysis demonstrated that XSD-7 treatment-induced SGC-7901 cell apoptosis via both the -mediated pathway and the death receptor-mediated pathway. In contrast, XSD-7 induced apoptosis in HeLa cells mainly via the -mediated pathway. Hence, our data indicate that XSD-7 exerted antiproliferative activity by disrupting microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest, and eventually inducing cell apoptosis. XSD-7 with novel structure has the potential to be developed for therapeutic treatment of gastric cancer and cervical cancer.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659282>RNA binding protein HuD contributes to β-cell dysfunction by impairing  dynamics.</a></h2><p>Imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics in pancreatic β-cells contributes to β-cell dysfunction in diabetes; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dynamics in the pathology of diabetes are not fully elucidated. We previously reported the reduction of RNA binding protein HuD in pancreatic β-cells of diabetes. Herein, we demonstrate that HuD plays a novel role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitochondrial fusion. We show enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation in the pancreas of db/db mice and HuD KO mice. Downregulation of HuD increases the number of cells with fragmented  and reduces the mitochondrial activity determined by mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in mouse insulinoma βTC6 cells. HuD binds to 3'-untraslated region of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) mRNA and positively regulates its expression. Ectopic expression of Mfn2 in βTC6 cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA against HuD (shHuD) restores HuD-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, our results suggest that HuD regulates mitochondrial dynamics by regulating Mfn2 level and its reduced expression leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic β-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632444>Convergent Evolution of Mitochondrial Genes in Deep-Sea Fishes.</a></h2><p>Deep seas have extremely harsh conditions including high hydrostatic pressure, total darkness, cold, and little food and oxygen. The adaptations of fishes to deep-sea environment apparently have occurred independently many times. The genetic basis of adaptation for obtaining their energy remains unknown.  play a central role in aerobic respiration. Analyses of the available 2,161 complete mitochondrial genomes of 1,042 fishes, including 115 deep-sea species, detect signals of positive selection in mitochondrial genes in nine branches of deep-sea fishes. Aerobic metabolism yields much more energy  unit of source material than anaerobic metabolism. The adaptive evolution of the mtDNA may reflect that aerobic metabolism plays a more important role than anaerobic metabolism in deep-sea fishes, whose energy sources (food) are extremely limited. This strategy maximizes the usage of energy sources. Eleven mitochondrial genes have convergent/parallel amino acid changes between branches of deep-sea fishes. Thus, these amino acid sites may be functionally important in the acquisition of energy, and reflect convergent evolution during their independent invasion of the harsh deep-sea ecological niche.Copyright © 2019 Shen, Pu, Chen, Murphy and Shen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642809>Discovery proteomics in aging human skeletal muscle finds change in spliceosome, immunity, proteostasis and .</a></h2><p>A decline of skeletal muscle strength with aging is a primary cause of mobility loss and frailty in older persons, but the molecular mechanisms of such decline are not understood. Here, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis from skeletal muscle collected from 58 healthy persons aged 20 to 87 years. In muscle from older persons, ribosomal proteins and proteins related to energetic metabolism, including those related to the TCA cycle,  respiration, and glycolysis, were underrepresented, while proteins implicated in innate and adaptive immunity, proteostasis, and alternative splicing were overrepresented. Consistent with reports in animal models, older human muscle was characterized by deranged energetic metabolism, a pro-inflammatory environment and increased proteolysis.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of  were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of , which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of  causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer.

As the thermal sensitivity of bioenergetic pathways depends on the structural and kinetic properties of its component enzymes, optimization of their  function to different thermal niches is expected to have occurred through selection. In the present study, we sought to characterize mitochondrial phenotypic adjustments to thermal niches in eight ray-finned fish species occupying a wide range of thermal habitats by comparing the activities of key mitochondrial enzymes in their hearts. We measured the activity of four enzymes that control substrate entrance into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD). We also assayed enzymes of the electron transport system (ETS): complexes I, II, I + III, and IV. Enzymes were assayed at five temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C). Our results showed that the activity of CPT, a gatekeeper of the fatty acid pathway, was higher in the cold-water fish than in the warmer-adapted fish relative to the ETS (complexes I and III) when measured close to the species optimal temperatures. The activity of HOAD showed a similar pattern relative to CI + III and thermal environment. By contrast, PDHc and PK did not show the similar patterns with respect to CI + III and temperature. Cold-adapted species had high CIV activities compared to those of upstream complexes (I, II, I + III) whereas the converse was true for warm-adapted species. Our findings reveal a significant variability of heart mitochondrial organization among species that can be linked to temperature adaptation. Cold-adapted fish do not appear to compensate for PDHc activity but likely adjust fatty acids oxidation through higher activities of CPT and HOAD relative to complexes I + III.Copyright © 2019 Hunter-Manseau, Desrosiers, Le François, Dufresne, Detrich, Nozais and Blier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637312>Ribosomal mistranslation leads to silencing of the unfolded protein response and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.</a></h2><p>Translation fidelity is the limiting factor in the accuracy of gene expression.

Little is known about the response of higher eukaryotes to chronic loss of ribosomal accuracy as per an increase in the random error rate of mRNA decoding. Here, we present a global and comprehensive picture of the cellular changes in response to translational accuracy in mammalian ribosomes impaired by genetic manipulation. In addition to affecting established protein quality control pathways, such as elevated transcript levels for cytosolic chaperones, activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and translational slowdown, ribosomal mistranslation led to unexpected responses.

Although mature mammalian red blood cells are believed to not contain organelles as Ca stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum or , a 20,000-fold gradient based on a intracellular Ca concentration of approximately 60 nM vs. an extracellular concentration of 1.2 mM makes Ca-permeable channels a major signalling tool of red blood cells. However, the internal Ca concentration is tightly controlled, regulated and maintained primarily by the Ca pumps PMCA1 and PMCA4. Within the last two decades it became evident that an increased intracellular Ca is associated with red blood cell clearance in the spleen and promotes red blood cell aggregability and clot formation. In contrast to this rather uncontrolled deadly Ca signals only recently it became evident, that a temporal increase in intracellular Ca can also have positive effects such as the modulation of the red blood cells O binding properties or even be vital for brief transient cellular volume adaptation when passing constrictions like small capillaries or slits in the spleen. Here we give an overview of Ca channels and Ca-regulated channels in red blood cells, namely the Gárdos channel, the non-selective voltage dependent cation channel, Piezo1, the NMDA receptor, VDAC, TRPC channels, Ca2.1, a Ca-inhibited channel novel to red blood cells and i.a. relate these channels to the molecular unknown sickle cell disease conductance P. Particular attention is given to correlation of functional measurements with molecular entities as well as the physiological and pathophysiological function of these channels. This view is in constant progress and in particular the understanding of the interaction of several ion channels in a physiological context just started. This includes on the one hand channelopathies, where a mutation of the ion channel is the direct cause of the disease, like Hereditary Xerocytosis and the Gárdos Channelopathy. On the other hand it applies to red blood cell related diseases where an altered channel activity is a secondary effect like in sickle cell disease or thalassemia.

The expression of 2, a  gene copy, partially compensates for  disruption due to exon-7 excision in 90% of transcripts subsequently explaining the strong clinical heterogeneity. Several alterations in energy metabolism, like glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated whether those exercise-induced benefits were associated with an improvement in metabolic status in mild SMA-like mice. We showed that untrained SMA-like mice exhibited a dysregulation of lipid metabolism with an enhancement of lipogenesis and adipocyte deposits when compared to control mice. Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high lipid oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle , we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of  and complexes expression and (2) a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs. Most of the beneficial effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol. Taking together, our data support the hypothesis that active physical exercise, including high-intensity protocols, induces metabolic adaptations at both systemic and cellular levels, providing further evidence for its use in association with SMN-overexpressing therapies, in the long-term care of SMA patients.Copyright © 2019 Houdebine, D’Amico, Bastin, Chali, Desseille, Rumeau, Soukkari, Oudot, Rouquet, Bariohay, Roux, Sapaly, Weill, Lopes, Djouadi, Bezier, Charbonnier and Biondi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653119>Pathophysiology of Calcium Mediated Ventricular Arrhythmias and Novel Therapeutic Options with Focus on Gene Therapy.</a></h2><p>Cardiac arrhythmias constitute a major health problem with a huge impact on mortality rates and health care costs.

Thus, alterations in mitochondrial parameters could indicate early events of disease manifestation or progression. However, finding reliable and quantitative tools for monitoring  and determining the network parameters, particularly in live cells, has proven challenging. Here, we present a 2D confocal imaging-based approach that combines automatic mitochondrial morphology and dynamics analysis with fractal analysis in live small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. We chose SCLC cells as a test case since they typically have very little cytoplasm, but an abundance of smaller  compared to many of the commonly used cell types. The 2D confocal images provide a robust approach to quantitatively measure mitochondrial dynamics and morphology in live cells. Furthermore, we performed 3D reconstruction of electron microscopic images and show that the 3D reconstruction of the electron microscopic images complements this approach to yield better resolution. The data also suggest that the parameters of mitochondrial dynamics and fractal dimensions are sensitive indicators of cellular response to subtle perturbations, and hence, may serve as potential markers of drug response in lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633821>Senescent human melanocytes drive skin ageing via paracrine telomere dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Cellular senescence has been shown to contribute to skin ageing. However, the role of melanocytes in the process is understudied. Our data show that melanocytes are the only epidermal cell type to express the senescence marker p16 during human skin ageing. Aged melanocytes also display additional markers of senescence such as reduced HMGB1 and dysfunctional telomeres, without detectable telomere shortening. Additionally, senescent melanocyte SASP induces telomere dysfunction in paracrine manner and limits proliferation of surrounding cells via activation of CXCR3-dependent mitochondrial ROS. Finally, senescent melanocytes impair basal keratinocyte proliferation and contribute to epidermal atrophy in vitro using 3D human epidermal equivalents. Crucially, clearance of senescent melanocytes using the senolytic drug ABT737 or treatment with -targeted antioxidant MitoQ suppressed this effect. In conclusion, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent melanocytes affect keratinocyte function and act as drivers of human skin ageing.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648074>A second intracellular copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and a manganese superoxide dismutase in Oxya chinensis: Molecular and biochemical characteristics and roles in chlorpyrifos stress.</a></h2><p>A second intracellular copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (icCuZnSOD2) and manganese SOD (MnSOD) were cloned and characterized in Oxya chinensis. The open reading frame (ORF) of OcicCuZnSOD2 and OcMnSOD are 462 and 672 bp encoding 153 and 223 amino acids, respectively. OcicCuZnSOD2 contains two signature sequences, one potential N-glycosylation site, and seven copper/zinc binding sites. OcMnSOD includes a  targeting sequence of 7 amino acids at N-terminal, one signature sequence, two N-glycosylation sites, and four manganese binding sites. The secondary structure and homology model of OcicCuZnSOD2 include nine β sheets, two Greek-key motifs, and one electrostatic loop. OcMnSOD contains nine α-helices and three β-sheets. Phylogenetic analysis shows that OcMnSOD is evolutionarily conserved while OcicCuZnSOD2 may be gene duplication and is paralogous to OcicCuZnSOD1. OcMnSOD expressed widely in all tissues and developmental stages. OcicCuZnSOD2 showed testis-specific expression and expressed highest in the 5th-instar nymph and the adult. The optimum temperatures and pH values of the recombinant OcicCuZnSOD2 and OcMnSOD were 40 °C and 8.0. They were stable at 25-55 °C and at pH 5.0-12.0 and pH 6.0-12.0, respectively. The activity and mRNA expression of each OcSOD were assayed after chlorpyrifos treatments. Total SOD and CuZnSOD activities first increased then declined under chlorpyrifos stress. Chlorpyrifos induced the mRNA expression and activity of OcMnSOD as a dose-dependent manner and inhibited OcicCuZnSOD2 transcription. The role of each OcSOD gene in chlorpyrifos stress was investigated using RNAi and disc diffusion assay with Escherichia coli overexpressing OcSOD proteins. Silencing of OcMnSOD significantly increased ROS content in chlorpyrifos-exposed grasshoppers. Disc diffusion assay showed that the plates with E. coli overexpressing OcMnSOD had the smaller inhibition zones around the chlorpyrifos-soaked filter discs.

Our previous work revealed that diverse upstream events correlated with altered mitochondrial proteome in human muscle biopsies. However, several proteins showed relatively unchanged expression suggesting that post-translational modifications, mainly protein phosphorylation could influence their activity and regulate mitochondrial processes. We conducted mitochondrial phosphoprotein profiling, by proteomics approach, of healthy human skeletal muscle (n = 10) and three muscle diseases (n = 10 each): Dysferlinopathy, Polymyositis and Distal Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles. Healthy human muscle mitochondrial proteins displayed 253 phosphorylation sites (phosphosites), which contributed to metabolic and redox processes and mitochondrial organization etc. Electron transport chain complexes accounted for 84 phosphosites. Muscle pathologies displayed 33 hyperphosphorylated and 14 hypophorphorylated sites with only 5 common proteins, indicating varied phosphorylation profile across muscle pathologies. Molecular modelling revealed altered local structure in the phosphorylated sites of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 and complex V subunit ATP5B1. Molecular dynamics simulations in complex I subunits NDUFV1, NDUFS1 and NDUFV2 revealed that phosphorylation induced structural alterations thereby influencing electron transfer and potentially altering enzyme activity. We propose that altered phosphorylation at specific sites could regulate mitochondrial protein function in the skeletal muscle during physiological and pathological processes.Copyright © 2019.

While there is no antiviral therapy available against this potentially lethal disease, the efficacy of the only approved vaccine is not optimal and its safety has been recently questioned. In order to develop better vaccines based on attenuated and/or chimeric viruses, one must consider how the human immune system is engaged during DENV infection. The activation of the innate immunity through the detection of viruses by cellular sensors is the first line of defence against those pathogens. This triggers a cascade of events which establishes an antiviral state at the cell level and leads to a global immunological response. However, DENV has evolved to interfere with the innate immune signalling at multiple levels, hence dampening antiviral responses and favouring viral replication and dissemination. This review elaborates on the interplay between DENV and the innate immune system. A special focus is given on the viral countermeasure mechanisms reported over the last decade which should be taken into consideration during vaccine development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653091>Intracellular Redox-Balance Involvement in Temozolomide Resistance-Related Molecular Mechanisms in Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common astrocytic-derived brain tumor in adults, characterized by a poor prognosis mainly due to the resistance to the available therapy.

Sensitive and resistant GBM cells were used to test the role of mitochondrial ROS release in TMZ-resistance. Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (CMA) activation in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) release has been measured by monitoring the expression of specific genes. Treatments with HO were used to test their potential in reverting resistance. Fluctuations of cytoplasmic ROS levels were accountable for CMA induction and cytotoxic effects observed in TMZ sensitive cells after treatment. On the other hand, in resistant cells, TMZ failed in producing an increase in cytoplasmic ROS levels and CMA activation, preventing GBM cell toxicity. By increasing oxidative stress, CMA activation was recovered, as also cell cytotoxicity, especially in combination with TMZ treatment. Herein, for the first time, it is shown the relation between mitochondrial ROS release, CMA activation and TMZ-responsiveness in GBM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638340>Thymoquinone suppresses platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration and neointimal formation.</a></h2><p>The excessive proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are mainly responsible for vascular occlusion diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and restenosis. Our previous study demonstrated thymoquinone (TQ) attenuated monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aim of the present study is to systematically examine inhibitory effects of TQ on platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs in vitro and neointimal formation in vivo and elucidate the potential mechanisms. Vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from the aorta in rats. Cell viability and proliferation were measured in VSMCs using the MTT assay. Cell migration was detected by wound healing assay and Transwell assay. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Ki-67-positive cells were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry and terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining, respectively. Molecules including the -dependent apoptosis factors, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), PTEN/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were determined by Western blot. Neointimal formation was induced by ligation in male Sprague Dawley rats and evaluated by HE staining. Thymoquinone inhibited PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation and the increase in α-SMA and Ki-67-positive cells. Thymoquinone also induced apoptosis via -dependent apoptosis pathway and p38MAPK. Thymoquinone blocked VSMC migration by inhibiting MMP2. Finally, TQ reversed neointimal formation induced by ligation in rats. Thus, TQ is a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of occlusive vascular diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Their development proposes structure optimization in respect of availability and activity towards target cells and organelles. Selection of 1 or its precursor betulonic acid 2 and the optimal linker is of particular importance for drug candidate identification among the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates.In this study new C-28-TPP conjugated derivatives of 1 and 2 with the alkyl/alkoxyalkyl linkers of variable length were synthesized and compared regarding their anticancer, antibacterial, and -targeted effects.The TPP conjugates of 1 and 2 [6a-f, 7a-f] were synthesized by the reaction of halogenalkyl esters [3a-f, 4a-f, 5] with triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile upon heating. Cytotoxicity (MTT assay), antibacterial activity (microdilution assay) and mitochondrial effects (flow cytofluorometry) were studied.Conjugation with the TPP group greatly increased cytotoxicity of the triterpenoids up to 30 times.

Based on the results, 6a can be selected for further preclinical investigation as a potential anticancer compound.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid Metabolism Directs Fetal Liver Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h2><p>The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The identification of human FA blood biomarkers related to disease severity and neuro-pathomechanism could support clinical trials of drug efficacy. To try to identify human biomarkers of neuro-pathomechanistic relevance, we compared the overlapping gene expression changes of primary blood and skin cells of FA patients with changes in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) of the KIKO FA mouse model. As DRG is the primary site of neurodegeneration in FA, our goal was to identify which changes in blood and skin of FA patients provide a 'window' into the FA neuropathomechanism inside the nervous system. In addition, gene expression in frataxin-deficient neuroglial cells and FA mouse hearts were compared for a total of 5 data sets. The overlap of these changes strongly supports mitochondrial changes, apoptosis and alterations of selenium metabolism. Consistent biomarkers were observed, including three genes of mitochondrial stress (MTIF2, ENO2), apoptosis (DDIT3/CHOP), oxidative stress (PREX1), and selenometabolism (SEPW1). These results prompted our investigation of the GPX1 activity as a marker of selenium and oxidative stress, in which we observed a significant change in FA patients. We believe these lead biomarkers that could be assayed in FA patient blood as indicators of disease severity and progression, and also support the involvement of , apoptosis and selenium in the neurodegenerative process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661433>Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine, the offspring born from the marriage of nanotechnology and medicine, has already brought momentous advances in the fight against a plethora of unmet diseases from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative to diabetes and cancer. Here, we review a conceptual framework that will provide a basic understanding about the molecular mechanism of action of a therapeutic nanomaterial inside biological milieu. In this review, we highlight how the catalytic nature of a transition metal oxide nanomaterial influences the cellular redox homeostasis, supports the cellular antioxidant defence system and reactivates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated signalling to perform normal cell functions like cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, toxicity, and protein interactions. With numerous examples, we describe the redox modulatory nature of d-block metal oxide nanomaterials and their biomimetic nanozyme activities to protect the , the cellular redox mediator which prevents an organism from various diseases.

We have demonstrated a new kind of oxygen nanosensors based on a ruthenium complex doped solid silica nanoparticles, which showed high oxygen sensing performance (I0/I100 = 3.29, t95 < 3 s) and ease of surface functionalization. Their sensing performance can be tuned by changing types of oxygen-sensitive probes and particle morphology. The nanosensors showed excellent control in both sensor size (from 30 to 200 nm), monodispersity, morphology, surface chemistry, and batch to batch consistency. Their uniform size distribution and good biocompatibility made them suitable for intracellular studies. Because the sensor surface can be easily functionalized with arbitrary units (such as transmembrane motifs, drugs, organelle-targeting groups, imaging reagent, multiple sensor probes), these nanosensors provide a general platform to build easy-to-use tools for intracellular applications. The ease of surface functionalization was demonstrated by modifying the sensors outer surface with morpholinopropylamine and (3-carboxypropyl) triphenyl phosphonium, to actively target intracellular lysosomes and  of the tested cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, MCF-10A). Applying the -targeting oxygen nanosensor together with our custom-built rapid phosphorescent lifetime imaging system, variations of intracellular oxygen have been quantitatively imaged and traced (in millisecond intervals) in real time and in-situ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636543>Development and Application of Sub-Mitochondrial Targeted Ca Biosensors.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial Ca uptake into the mitochondrial matrix is a well-established mechanism. However, the sub-organellar Ca kinetics remain elusive. In the present work we identified novel site-specific targeting sequences for the intermembrane space (IMS) and the cristae lumen (CL). We used these novel targeting peptides to develop green- and red- Ca biosensors targeted to the IMS and to the CL. Based on their distinctive spectral properties, and comparable sensitivities these novel constructs were suitable to visualize Ca-levels in various (sub) compartments in a multi-chromatic manner. Functional studies that applied these new biosensors revealed that knockdown of MCU and EMRE yielded elevated Ca levels inside the CL but not the IMS in response to IP-generating agonists. Knockdown of VDAC1, however, strongly impeded the transfer of Ca through the OMM while the cytosolic Ca signal remained unchanged. The novel sub-mitochondrially targeted Ca biosensors proved to be suitable for Ca imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution in a multi-chromatic manner allowing simultaneous measurements. These informative biosensors will facilitate efforts to dissect the complex sub-mitochondrial Ca signaling under (patho)physiological conditions.Copyright © 2019 Waldeck-Weiermair, Gottschalk, Madreiter-Sokolowski, Ramadani-Muja, Ziomek, Klec, Burgstaller, Bischof, Depaoli, Eroglu, Malli and Graier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655741>Oxygen regulatory mechanisms of nitrogen fixation in rhizobia.</a></h2><p>Rhizobia are α- and β-proteobacteria that form a symbiotic partnership with legumes, fixing atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia and providing it to the plant. Oxygen regulation is key in this symbiosis. Fixation is performed by an oxygen-intolerant nitrogenase enzyme but requires respiration to meet its high energy demands. To satisfy these opposing constraints the symbiotic partners cooperate intimately, employing a variety of mechanisms to regulate and respond to oxygen concentration. During symbiosis rhizobia undergo significant changes in gene expression to differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Legumes host these bacteroids in specialized root organs called nodules. These generate a near-anoxic environment using an oxygen diffusion barrier, oxygen-binding leghemoglobin and control of  localization. Rhizobia sense oxygen using multiple interconnected systems which enable a finely-tuned response to the wide range of oxygen concentrations they experience when transitioning from soil to nodules. The oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ and hybrid FixL-FxkR two-component systems activate at relatively high oxygen concentration and regulate fixK transcription. FixK activates the fixNOQP and fixGHIS operons producing a high-affinity terminal oxidase required for bacterial respiration in the microaerobic nodule. Additionally or alternatively, some rhizobia regulate expression of these operons by FnrN, an FNR-like oxygen-sensing protein. The final stage of symbiotic establishment is activated by the NifA protein, regulated by oxygen at both the transcriptional and protein level. A cross-species comparison of these systems highlights differences in their roles and interconnections but reveals common regulatory patterns and themes. Future work is needed to establish the complete regulon of these systems and identify other regulatory signals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Determining locations of active calcium release sites, and how their recruitment changes in response to stimuli and in disease states is therefore of central interest in cardiac physiology. Current algorithms for detecting release sites from live cell imaging data are however not easily validated against a known "ground truth," which makes interpretation of the output of such algorithms, in particular the degree of confidence in site detection, a challenging task. Computational models are capable of integrating findings from multiple sources into a consistent, predictive framework. In cellular physiology, such models have the potential to reveal structure and function beyond the temporal and spatial resolution limitations of individual experimental measurements. Here, we create a spatially detailed computational model of calcium release in an eight sarcomere section of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, using electron tomography reconstruction of cardiac ultrastructure and confocal imaging of protein localization. This provides a high-resolution model of calcium diffusion from intracellular stores, which can be used as a platform to simulate confocal fluorescence imaging in the context of known ground truth structures from the higher resolution model. We use this capability to evaluate the performance of a recently proposed method for detecting the functional response of calcium release sites in live cells. Model permutations reveal how calcium release site density and  acting as diffusion barriers impact the detection performance of the algorithm. We demonstrate that site density has the greatest impact on detection precision and recall, in particular affecting the effective detectable depth of sites in confocal data. Our findings provide guidance on how such detection algorithms may best be applied to experimental data and give insights into limitations when using two-dimensional microscopy images to analyse three-dimensional cellular structures.Copyright © 2019 Ladd, Tilūnaitė, Roderick, Soeller, Crampin and Rajagopal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664760>Protein Phase Separation and Determinants of in cell Crystallization.</a></h2><p>Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in cells is known as a complex physicochemical process causing the formation of membrane-less organelles (MLOs). Cells have well-defined different membrane-surrounded organelles like , endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, etc., however, on demand they can create membrane-less organelles as stress granules, nucleoli and P bodies to cover vital functions and regulatory activities. However, the mechanism of intracellular molecule assembly into functional compartments within a living cell remains till now not fully understood. (Soft Matter 2019, 15 (6):1135-1154). In vitro and in vivo investigations unveiled that MLOs emerge after preceding liquid-liquid, liquid-gel, liquid-semi-crystalline, or liquid-crystalline phase separations. Liquid-liquid and liquid-gel MLOs form the majority of cellular phase separation events, while the occurrence of micro-sized crystals in cells was only rarely observed, however can be considered as a result of a preceding protein phase separation event. In vivo, also known and termed as in cellulo crystals, are reported since 1853 (Botanische Zeitung, 13, 881-8 821 855; CR Mem. Soc. Biol. 5, 450-454, 1853). In some cases, they have been linked to vital cellular functions, such as storage and detoxification. However, the occurrence of in cellulo crystals is also associated to diseases like cataract, hemoglobin C diseases etc. (Biology Chemistry De Gruyter 2018, 399 (7):751-752).

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway.  are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged  to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632863>Juvenile Parkinson Disease.</a></h2><p>Juvenile Parkinson's disease (JPD) is a rare movement disorder that presents before the age of 21 years.

However, the specific participants and precise mechanisms underlying this apoptotic pathway are poorly understood. The proapoptotic proteins Bak and Bax-members of the Bcl-2 family-are essential for the functioning of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout Bak in the human SH-SY5Y cell line and determined the effects of this knockout on TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis. Our data showed that overexpression of Bcl-2 dramatically prevented TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis, and then pro-apoptotic protein Bak was downregulated and became more resistant to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis, because both TNF/CHX-induced PARP cleavage and caspase activation were blocked in BAK-/- cells or using specific siRNA, whereas Bax was dispensable in TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis, as evidenced using specific siRNA. Bax translocated from the cytosol into the  in response to TNF/CHX, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of Bak significantly decreased this translocation. These results indicate that TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis does not occur in Bak-/- cells, suggesting that TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis is Bak-dependent but Bax-independent.Copyright © 2019 Jingtian Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654710>In vitro study of the protective effect of manganese against vanadium-mediated nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage.</a></h2><p>We aimed to study the effect of vanadium(V) exposure on cell viability, nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and to elucidate if these effects can be reverted by co-exposure to V and manganese (Mn).

Most brain aging studies are focused on neurons and less on astrocytes which are the most abundant cells in the brain known to be in charge of various functions including the maintenance of brain physical formation, ion homeostasis, and secretion of various extracellular matrix proteins. Altered mitochondrial dynamics, defective mitophagy or mitochondrial damages are causative factors of mitochondrial dysfunction, which is linked to age-related disorders. Etoposide is an anti-cancer reagent which can induce DNA stress and cellular senescence of cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated whether etoposide induces senescence and functional alterations in cultured rat astrocytes. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity was used as a cellular senescence marker. The results indicated that etoposide-treated astrocytes showed cellular senescence phenotypes including increased SA-β-gal-positive cells number, increased nuclear size and increased senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) such as IL-6. We also observed a decreased expression of cell cycle markers, including Phospho- Histone H3/Histone H3 and CDK2, and dysregulation of cellular functions based on wound-healing, neuronal protection, and phagocytosis assays. Finally, mitochondrial dysfunction was noted through the determination of mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and the measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR).

Transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and plays a pathologic role in the progression of renal disease. Experimental Approach A mouse model of renal I/R injury and a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model for human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2s) were used. Key Results I/R injury up-regulated renal expression of FOXO1, and treatment with FOXO1-selective inhibitor AS1842856 prior to I/R injury decreased serum urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and the tubular damage score after injury. Post-I/R injury AS1842856 treatment could also ameliorate renal function and improve the survival rate of mice following injury. AS1842856 administration reduced mitochondrial mediated apoptosis, suppressed the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and accelerated recovery of ATP both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, FOXO1 inhibition improved mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed mitophagy. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was down-regulated in both I/R and H/R injury, which could be abrogated by FOXO1 inhibition. Experiments using integrated bioinformatics analysis and coimmunoprecipitation established that FOXO1 inhibited PGC-1α transcription by competing with CREB for its binding to transcriptional coactivators CREBBP/EP300 (CBP/P300). Conclusion And Implications These findings suggested that FOXO1 was critical to maintain mitochondrial function in renal tubular epithelial cells and FOXO1 may serve as a therapeutic target for pharmacologic intervention in renal.This article is protected by copyright.

Increased gene expression of TNF-α and CRP was significantly correlated with the reduced HNF4α expression and with other ER stress markers. In conclusion, endoplasmic reticulum stress, confirmed at ultrastructure level, plays an important role in pathogenesis of HFD-induced hepatic steatosis.

The present study was aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying QDTS's renoprotection. The main components of QDTS were identified by ultra-high liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and pharmacological databases, among which active components were screened by oral bioavailability and drug-likeness. Their regulation on autophagy-related nutrient-sensing signal molecules (AMPK, SIRT1, and mTOR) was retrieved and analyzed through the Pubmed database. Then, db/db mice were randomly divided into three groups (model control, valsartan and QDTS), and given intragastric administration for 12 weeks, separately. Fasting and random blood glucose, body weight, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and injury markers of liver and kidney were investigated to evaluate the effects and safety. Renal histological lesions were assessed, and the expressions of proteins related to nutrient-sensing signals and autophagy were investigated. Thirteen active components were screened from 78 components identified. Over half the components had already been reported to improve nutrient-sensing signals. QDTS significantly reduced UAE, ameliorated mesangial matrix deposition, alleviate the expression of protein and mRNA of TGF-β, α-SMA, and Col I, as well as improved the quality of  and the number of autophagic vesicles of renal tubular cells although the blood glucose was not decreased in db/db mice. Compared to the db/db group, the expression of the autophagy-inducible protein (Atg14 and Beclin1) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) were up-regulated, autophagic substrate transporter p62 was down-regulated in QDTS group. It was also found that the expression of SIRT1 and the proportion of p-AMPK (thr172)/AMPK were increased, while the p-mTOR (ser2448)/mTOR ratio was decreased after QDTS treatment in db/db mice, which was consistent with the effect of its active ingredients on the nutrient-sensing signal pathway as reported previously. Therefore, QDTS may prevent the progression of DN by offering the anti-fibrotic effect. The renoprotection is probably attributable to the regulation of nutrient-sensing signal pathways, which activates autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Wang, Zhao, Ajay, Jiao, Zhang, Wang, Gao, Yuan, Liu and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631599>[Renal Injury and Its Mechanisms in   Mice].</a></h2><p>To study the mechanism of renal injury in   mice with the leptin receptor homozygous deficiency.Ten male of 28-week-old   mice with leptin receptor heterozygous deficiency were selected as control group and ten male   mice with leptin receptor homozygous deficiency were used in this study.

Macrophages are well-known for their pathogenic role in kidney fibrosis. Here, we report that PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in macrophages is compromised in experimental and human kidney fibrosis. We demonstrate downregulation of mitophagy regulators, mitofusin-2 (MFN2) and Parkin, downstream of PINK1 in kidney fibrosis. Loss of either Pink1 or Prkn promoted renal extracellular matrix accumulation and frequency of profibrotic/M2 macrophages. Pink1-/- or Prkn-/- bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed enhanced expression of rictor.  from TGF-β1-treated Pink1-/- BMDMs exhibited increased superoxide levels, and reduced respiration and ATP production. In addition, mitophagy in macrophages involves PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream MFN2 and MFN2-facilitated recruitment of Parkin to damaged , and macrophage-specific deletion of Mfn2 aggravates kidney fibrosis. Moreover, mitophagy regulators were downregulated in human CKD kidney and TGF-β1-treated human renal macrophages, whereas Mdivi1 treatment suppressed mitophagy mediators and promoted fibrotic response. Taken together, our study is the first to demonstrate that macrophage mitophagy plays a protective role against kidney fibrosis via regulating PINK1/MFN2/Parkin-mediated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652604>Hyperacetylation of Cardiac Mitochondrial Proteins Is Associated with Metabolic Impairment and Sirtuin Downregulation after Chronic Total Body Irradiation of ApoE  Mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Alteration in energy metabolism has been suggested to contribute to radiation-induced heart pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction being a hallmark of this disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of acetylation in heart  in the long-term response to chronic radiation. ApoE-deficient C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate (20 mGy/day) gamma radiation for 300 days, resulting in a cumulative total body dose of 6.0 Gy. Heart  were isolated and analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Radiation-induced proteome and acetylome alterations were further validated using immunoblotting, enzyme activity assays, and ELISA. In total, 71 proteins showed peptides with a changed acetylation status following irradiation. The great majority (94%) of the hyperacetylated proteins were involved in the TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, oxidative stress response and sirtuin pathway. The elevated acetylation patterns coincided with reduced activity of mitochondrial sirtuins, increased the level of Acetyl-CoA, and were accompanied by inactivation of major cardiac metabolic regulators PGC-1 alpha and PPAR alpha. These observations suggest that the changes in mitochondrial acetylation after irradiation is associated with impairment of heart metabolism. We propose a novel mechanism involved in the development of late cardiac damage following chronic irradiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665043>Arabidopsis thaliana alternative dehydrogenases: a potential therapy for mitochondrial complex I deficiency? Perspectives and pitfalls.</a></h2><p>Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH-2 (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the  were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per oxygen atom reduced to water by half in control cells.In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH-2 should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640957>[Interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cell death induced by dexamethasone].</a></h2><p>To investigate the relationship between necroptosis and apoptosis in MCET3-E1 cell death induced by glucocorticoids.MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated with 10-6 mol/L dexamethasone followed by treatment with the apoptosis inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (40 μmol/L) or the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (40 μmol/L) for 2 h. At 72 h after incubation with dexamethasone, the cells were harvested to determine the cell viability using WST-1 assay and the rate of necrotic cells using annexin V/PI double staining; the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using Hoechst staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential and the level of ATP in the cells were also evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the microstructural changes of the cells. The expressions of RIP-1 and RIP-3 in the cells were detected by Western blotting.At a concentration of 10-6 mol/L, dexamethasone induced both apoptosis and necroptosis in MC3T3- E1 cells. Annexin V/PI double staining showed that inhibition of cell apoptosis caused an increase in cell necrosis manifested by such changes as mitochondrial swelling and plasma membrane disruption, as shown by electron microscopy; Hoechst staining showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced. When necroptosis was inhibited by necrostatin-1, MC3T3-E1 cells showed significantly increased apoptosis as shown by both AV/PI and Hoechst staining, and such changes were accompanied by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level in the cells.In the process of dexamethasone-induced cell death, necroptosis and apoptosis can transform reciprocally accompanied by functional changes of the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632331>Energy Metabolism and Redox State in Brains of Wistar Audiogenic Rats, a Genetic Model of Epilepsy.</a></h2><p>The Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is a genetic model of epilepsy, specifically brainstem-dependent tonic-clonic seizures, triggered by acute auditory stimulation. Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher oxygen consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino acids transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653054>Suppression of the Peripheral Immune System Limits the Central Immune Response Following Cuprizone-Feeding: Relevance to Modelling Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Cuprizone (CPZ) preferentially affects oligodendrocytes (OLG), resulting in demyelination. To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.2%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for 5 weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods. Notably, CPZ(±PT)-feeding induced changes in the brain proteome related to the suppression of immune function, cellular metabolism, synaptic function and cellular structure/organization, indicating that demyelinating conditions, such as MS, can be initiated in the absence of adaptive immune system involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657540>Task-Specific Design of Immune-Augmented Nanoplatform to Enable High-Efficiency Tumor Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Potentiating systemic immunity against breast cancer is in the most urgent demand as breast cancer is low sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) is thought to play multiple roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism. We recently reported that altering PGC-1α gene expression modulates mitochondrial functions in N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP) treated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, possibly via the regulation of Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression. In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the potential beneficial effects of PGC-1α in the substantia nigra of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated C57BL mice.The overexpression or knockdown of the PGC-1α gene in the mouse model of dopaminergic neurotoxicity was performed using a stereotactic injection of lentivirus in MPTP-treated male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to one of 6 groups (n=24 per group): normal saline (NS) intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) (con); MPTP i.p. (M); solvent of the lentivirus striatal injection (lentivirus control) + MPTP i.p. (LVcon+M); lentivirus striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LV+M); LV-PGC-1α striatum injection + MPTP i.p. (LVPGC+M); and LV-PGC-1α-siRNA striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LVsiRNA+M). Intraperitoneal injections of MPTP/NS were conducted two weeks after lentivirus injection.We found significant improvement in motor behavior and increases in tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the substantia nigra (SN) in the brains of mice in the LVPGC+M group. The opposite tendency was observed in those in the LVsiRNA+M group. The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the SN region was also consistent with the changes in PGC-1α expression. Electron microscopy showed an increasing trend in the mitochondrial density in the LVPGC+M group and a decreasing trend in the M and LVsiRNA+M groups compared to that in the controls.Our results indicated that PGC-1α rescues the effects of MPTP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in C57BL mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661838>Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 3 is Critical for α-Synuclein Uptake and MPP-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h2><p>α-Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Fatty acids partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive oxygen species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h2><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and  through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the  to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).

As a facultative intracellular pathogen, MRSA is capable of persisting within professional phagocytes including macrophages. Here, we identify a role for CASP11 in facilitating MRSA survival within murine macrophages. We show that MRSA actively prevents the recruitment of  to the vicinity of the vacuoles they reside in to avoid intracellular demise. This process requires CASP11 since its deficiency allows increased association of MRSA-containing vacuoles with . The induction of mitochondrial superoxide by antimycin A (Ant A) improves MRSA eradication in casp11 cells, where  remain in the vicinity of the bacterium. In WT macrophages, Ant A does not affect MRSA persistence. When mitochondrial dissociation is prevented by the actin depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D, Ant A effectively reduces MRSA numbers. Moreover, the absence of CASP11 leads to reduced cleavage of CASP1, IL-1β, and CASP7, as well as to reduced production of CXCL1/KC. Our study provides a new role for CASP11 in promoting the persistence of Gram-positive bacteria.© 2019 The Authors.

Internalized PNP in RAECM activate autophagy, are delivered to lysosomes, and undergo [Ca]-dependent exocytosis. In this study, we explored nanoparticle (NP) interactions with A549 cells.After exposure to PNP or ambient pollution particles (PM0.2), live single A549 cells were studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy. PNP uptake and egress were investigated and activation of autophagy was confirmed by immunolabeling with LC3-II and LC3-GFP transduction/colocalization with PNP. Mitochondrial membrane potential, mitophagy, and lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) were assessed in the presence/absence of apical nanoparticle (NP) exposure.PNP uptake into A549 cells decreased in the presence of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of macropinocytosis. PNP egress was not affected by increased cytosolic [Ca]. Autophagy activation was indicated by increased LC3 expression and LC3-GFP colocalization with PNP. Increased LMP was observed following PNP or PM0.2 exposure. Mitochondrial membrane potential was unchanged and mitophagy was not detected after NP exposure.Interactions between NP and A549 cells involve complex cellular processes leading to lysosomal dysfunction, which may provide opportunities for improved nanoparticle-based therapeutic approaches to lung cancer management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660070>Self-generating oxygen enhanced mitochondrion-targeted photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment with hypoxia scavenging.</a></h2><p>Tumor hypoxia is an important reason for the limited therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) because of the oxygen requirement of the therapeutic process. PDT consumes tissue oxygen and destroys tumor vasculature, further hampering its own efficacy in promoting tumor deterioration. Therefore, overcoming the photodynamic exacerbation of tumor hypoxia is urgent.  Herein, we report a photodynamic nanoparticle with sustainable hypoxia remission skills by both intratumoral HO catalysis and targeted mitochondrial destruction. The MnO@MSNs@IR780 nanoparticles are formed by absorbing a photosensitizer (IR780) into 90 nm mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and capping the surface pores with 5 nm MnO nanoparticles.  These MnO nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors and respond to the HO-enriched tumor microenvironment by decomposing and catalyzing HO into O. Afterwards, IR780 is released and activated, spontaneously targeting the  due to its natural mitochondrial affinity. Under laser irradiation, this self-generated oxygen-enhanced PDT can destroy  and inhibit cell respiration, resulting in sustainable hypoxia remission in tumor tissues and consequently enhancing the therapeutic outcome.  experiments suggest that MnO@MSNs@IR780 exhibited highly mitochondrion-targeted properties and could sustainably inhibit tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the highest photoacoustic signal of HbO with the lowest Hb was observed in tumors from mice after PDT, indicating that these nanoparticles can also prevent tumor hypoxia .  Taken together, our study indicated a new approach for overcoming the sustainable hypoxia limitation in traditional PDT by targeted oxygen supplementation and  destruction.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647975>Autophagy as a novel therapeutic target in vascular calcification.</a></h2><p>The autophagy pathway is a key regulator of cellular metabolism and homeostasis, and plays a critical role in maintaining normal vascular cell function. It is well recognized that autophagy can regulate endothelial cell homeostasis, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype transition, and calcium (Ca) homeostasis in VSMCs. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that autophagy directly protects against vascular calcification (VC). Crosstalk between endosomes, dysfunctional , autophagic vesicles and Ca and phosphate (Pi) enriched matrix vesicles (MVs) may underpin the pathogenesis of VC.

In the current study, we explored the upstream mediator for cardiomyocytes necrosis induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury with a focus on mitochondrial function and JNK-Bnip3 pathway.  Cell necrosis was determined via MTT assay, TUNEL staining and PI staining. siRNA transfection was performed to inhibit Ripk3 activation in response to HR injury. Pathway blocker was applied to prevent JNK activation.  Ripk3 was rapidly increased in HR-treated cardiomyocytes and correlated with the necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, silencing of Ripk3 attenuated HR-mediated cardiomyocytes necrosis. At the molecular levels, Ripk3 deletion sustained mitochondrial bioenergetics and stabilized mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Besides, Ripk3 deletion also reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and inhibited mPTP opening. To the end, we found Ripk3 activation was along with JNK pathway activation and Bnip3 upregulation. Interestingly, blockade of JNK pathway abolished the harmful effects of HR injury on mitochondrial function, energy metabolism and redox balance. Moreover, overexpression of Bnip3 abrogated the protection action played by Ripk3 deletion on cardiomyocytes survival.

In Experiment 1, assessment of cell membrane integrity by trypan blue exclusion staining was used to select the best cryoprotectant solution for each cryopreservation method. Primary growth (PG) oocytes showed the best percentage of membrane integrity (63.5 ± 2.99%) when SF4 solution (2 M methanol + 0.1 M trehalose + 10% egg yolk solution) was employed. The vitrification solution, which presented the highest membrane integrity (V2; 1.5 M methanol + 5.5 M MeSO + 0.5 M sucrose + 10% egg yolk solution) was selected for Experiment 2. Experiment 2 aimed to compare the vitrification and slow freezing techniques in the following parameters: morphology, oxidative stress, mitochondrial activity, and DNA damage. Frozen ovarian tissue showed higher ROS levels and lower mitochondrial activity than vitrified ovarian tissue. Ultrastructural observations of frozen PG oocytes showed rupture of the plasma membrane, loss of intracellular contents and a large number of damaged , while vitrified PG oocytes had intact  and cell plasma membranes.

Among ciliates, anaerobic and aerobic lineages are interspersed, demonstrating that the switch to an anaerobic lifestyle with hydrogenosomes has occurred repeatedly and independently. To investigate the molecular details of this transition we generated genomic and transcriptomic datasets from anaerobic ciliates representing three distinct lineages. Our data demonstrate that hydrogenosomes have evolved from ancestral  in each case and reveal different degrees of independent mitochondrial genome and proteome reductive evolution, including the first example of complete mitochondrial genome loss in ciliates. Intriguingly, the FeFe-hydrogenase used for generating H2 has a unique domain structure among eukaryotes and appears to have been present, potentially through a single lateral gene transfer from an unknown donor, in the common aerobic ancestor of all three lineages.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and  DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells.

We previously reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding LKB1 is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Since astrocyte activation and metabolic function have important roles in regulating neuroinflammation and neuropathology, we examined the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 in astrocytes in a chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of MS. To reduce LKB1, a heterozygous astrocyte-selective conditional knockout (het-cKO) model was used. While disease incidence was similar, disease severity was worsened in het-cKO mice. RNAseq analysis identified Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enriched in het-cKO mice relating to mitochondrial function, confirmed by alterations in mitochondrial complex proteins and reductions in mRNAs related to astrocyte metabolism. Enriched pathways included major histocompatibility class II genes, confirmed by increases in MHCII protein in spinal cord and cerebellum of het-cKO mice. We observed increased numbers of CD4+ Th17 cells and increased neuronal damage in spinal cords of het-cKO mice, associated with reduced expression of choline acetyltransferase, accumulation of immunoglobulin-γ, and reduced expression of factors involved in motor neuron survival. In vitro, LKB1-deficient astrocytes showed reduced metabolic function and increased inflammatory activation. These data suggest that metabolic dysfunction in astrocytes, in this case due to LKB1 deficiency, can exacerbate demyelinating disease by loss of metabolic support and increase in the inflammatory environment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640150>Targeting NRF2 for the Treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia: A Comparison among Drugs.</a></h2><p>NRF2 (Nuclear factor Erythroid 2-related Factor 2) signaling is impaired in Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive nervous system damage and degeneration of nerve fibers in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The loss of frataxin in patients results in iron sulfur cluster deficiency and iron accumulation in the , making FRDA a fatal and debilitating condition. There are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of FRDA and molecules able to activate NRF2 have the potential to induce clinical benefits in patients. In this study, we compared the efficacy of six redox-active drugs, some already adopted in clinical trials, targeting NRF2 activation and frataxin expression in fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies of FRDA patients. All of these drugs consistently increased NRF2 expression, but differential profiles of NRF2 downstream genes were activated. The Sulforaphane and -acetylcysteine were particularly effective on genes involved in preventing inflammation and maintaining glutathione homeostasis, the dimethyl fumarate, omaxevolone, and EPI-743 in counteracting toxic products accumulation, the idebenone in mitochondrial protection.

Although numerous of research to prove the protective-effect roles of glutathione (GSH) in this event, the changes of GSH concentrations in living cells remain largely unclear, and there are scare evidences to unveil its roles by fluorescence imaging. Herein, we have designed and synthesized two distinctive "off-on" near-infrared (NIR) ﬂuorescent probes BCy-SeSe and BCy-SS based on a new fluorophore BCy-Keto for specific response to mitochondrial GSH changes during cerebral I/R process. Both of them exhibit powerful targeting capability in  and excellent photophysical properties towards endogenous GSH with high selectivity and sensitivity. In contrast to BCy-SS, BCy-SeSe was screened to carry out biological application on account of its faster response rate. We have utilized BCy-SeSe to real-time image GSH during cerebral I/R process in living cells and mice focal cerebral ischemia model (middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO), the intensive studies revealed that the low GSH levels were associated with aggravation of apoptosis and cerebral infarction. And pretreatment GSH synthase inhibitor aggravates damage while GSH-ester alleviates damage, confirming GSH is effective on cerebrum from I/R protection.

Although the treatment outcomes of HNSCC have improved in recent years, the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage disease remains poor. Current treatment strategies for HNSCC include surgery as a primary therapy, while radio-, chemo-, and biotherapeutics can be applied as second-line therapy. Although tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a potent tumor suppressor cytokine, the stimulation of opposing signals impairs its clinical utility as an anticancer agent. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms regulating TNF-α‑induced opposing signals and their biological consequences in HNSCC cell lines. We determined the molecular mechanisms of TNF-α-induced opposing signals in HNSCC cells. Our in vitro analysis indicated that one of these signals triggers apoptosis, while the other induces both apoptosis and cell survival. The TNF-α-induced survival of HNSCC cells is mediated by the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)/nuclear factor (NF)-κB-dependent pathway, while TNF-α-induced apoptosis is mediated by mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms through FADD-caspase-8-caspase-3 and ASK-JNK-p53-Noxa pathways. The localization of Noxa protein to both the  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was found to cause mitochondrial dysregulation and ER stress, respectively. Using inhibitory experiments, we demonstrated that the FADD‑caspase-8‑caspase-3 pathway, together with mitochondrial dysregulation and ER stress-dependent pathways, are essential for the modulation of apoptosis, and the NF-κB pathway is essential for the modulation of anti-apoptotic effects/cell survival during the exposure of HNSCC cells to TNF-α. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms of TNF-α-induced opposing signals in HNSCC cells and may further help in the development of novel therapeutic approaches with which to minimize the systemic toxicity of TNF-α.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644243>Nucleoside Analogues.</a></h2><p>The nucleoside analogues are an important class of antiviral agents now commonly used in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The nucleoside analogues resemble naturally occurring nucleosides and act by causing termination of the nascent DNA chain. These agents are generally safe and well tolerated as they are used by the viral, but not human polymerases in DNA replication. Actually, nucleoside analogues are a large class of agents that include drugs for cancer (cytarabine, gemcitabine, mercaptopurine), rheumatologic diseases (azathioprine, allpurinol) and even bacterial infections (trimethoprim). The nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV infection are often referred to as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, they have activity against both DNA dependent and RNA dependent DNA polymerases. They are believed to inhibit viral replication by several mechanisms, either by competitive inhibition of the viral polymerase or by DNA chain termination. Many of the antiviral nucleoside analogues are blocked at the 3’ hydroxyl group of the deoxyribonucleic acid, which results in failure of elongation of the nascent DNA molecule. Other antiviral nucleoside analogues are negative enantiomers (L-forms: lamivudine, emtricitabine, telbivudine) of the natural (D-form) nucleosides and interfere with replication, partially because of steric hindrance when they are taken up by the viral polymerase or added to the DNA molecule. Nucleoside analogues that are phosphorylated at the 5’ site are often referred to as nucleotide analogues, but this distinction is artificial as these agents (tenofovir, adefovir) are also nucleoside analogues. These features of the structure of nucleoside analogues are important because of the danger that they might be used by human polymerases and incorporated into RNA or DNA, which is the basis of the serious toxicities of the nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues can cause liver injury by several mechanisms. Most characteristic is a mitochondrial type of hepatic injury that is probably caused by the nucleoside analogue becoming incorporated into or blocking mitochondrial DNA synthesis by the mitochondrial gamma polymerase, leading to a depletion of  or decrease in their function. Mitochondrial injury can affect multiple tissues thereby causing myopathy, neuropathy, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and/or hepatic injury. The hepatic injury is characterized by accumulation of lactic acidosis, microvesicular steatosis and hepatic synthetic failure (LASH). Serum aminotransferase levels may be minimally elevated and jaundice arises late. The most dramatic example of hepatic mitochondrial injury occurred with the drug fialuridine (FIAU), a nucleoside analogue that was withdrawn after several fatalities due to hepatic failure, lactic acidosis and pancreatitis arising 2 to 3 months after initiation of therapy during phase 2 trials in humans. A similar, but rare and less dramatic and partially reversible hepatic mitochondrial injury has been linked to use of didanosine (dideoxyinosine: ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytine: ddC), stavudine (d4T) and less commonly to zidovudine (AZT).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647776>Treatment of Neurodegeneration: Integrating Photobiomodulation and Neurofeedback in Alzheimer's Dementia and Parkinson's: A Review.</a></h2><p> A review of photobiomodulation (PBM) in Alzheimer's dementia is submitted. The addition of PBM in neurodegenerative diseases is a dual modality that is at present gaining traction as it is safe, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for treating neurodegeneration with photons that stimulate  increasing adenosine triphosphate and proteasomes increasing misfolded protein removal. Neurofeedback provides neural plasticity with an increase in brain-derived nerve factor mRNA and an increase in dendrite production and density in the hippocampus coupled with overall growth in dendrites, density, and neuronal survival.  Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. PBM and neurobiofeedback (NBF)address the multiple gene expression and upregulation of multiple pathogenic pathway inflammation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial disorders, insulin resistance, methylation defects, regulation of neuroprotective factors, and regional hypoperfusion of the brain. There is no human evidence to suggest a clinical therapeutic benefit from using consistent light sources while significantly increasing safety concerns.  A PBM test with early- to mid-Alzheimer's was reported in 2017, consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a small pilot group of early- to mid-dementia subjects under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Clinical Trial.  PBM-treated subjects showed that active treatment subjects tended to show greater improvement in the functioning of the executive: clock drawing, immediate recall, practical memory, and visual attention and task switching (Trails A&B). A larger study using the CerebroLite helmet in Temple Texas again of subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled IRB-approved FDA Clinical Trial demonstrated gain in memory and cognition by increased clock drawing.

These pathways survey MOM proteome from the cytoplasmic and the inter-membrane space (IMS) sides. They detect and degrade MOM proteins with misfolded cytoplasmic and IMS domains, remove mistargeted tail-anchored proteins, and clear mitochondrial precursor proteins clogged in the TOM import complex.

However, excessive autophagy can be deleterious to cardiomyocytes. CCN1/Cyr61, a matricellular protein, is expressed in the stressed heart to induce cardiomyopathy. The role of autophagy in CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity was not clear. Here, we found that autophagy was induced in the myocardium of the isoproterenol (ISO; 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days; s.c.) treated mice, where CCN1 expression is colocalized. The knock-in mice carrying an integrin α6β1-binding-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were resistant to the ISO-induced cardiac injury and autophagy. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that CCN1 dose- and time-dependently induced GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosome formation in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. The formation of autolysosomes in response to CCN1 (5 μg/ml; 3 h) treatment was identified by the acridine orange staining. The autophagy induction was confirmed by the elevated protein levels of Beclin 1, Atg5, and LC3-II, and the decrease of p62. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or by silencing Atg5 gene enabled CCN1-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells, suggesting a protective role of autophagy. CCN1 binds to integrin α6β1 to induce autophagy through reactive oxygen species, and the activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, mitophagy was observed after CCN1 treatment for the clearance of depolarized . Together, these results demonstrated that autophagy is induced in response to CCN1/α6β1 signaling in cardiomyocytes to alleviate CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655204>The humanin peptide mediates ELP nanoassembly and protects human retinal pigment epithelial cells from oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Humanin (HN) is a hydrophobic 24-amino acid peptide derived from mitochondrial DNA that modulates cellular responses to oxidative stress and protects human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from apoptosis. To solubilize HN, this report describes two genetically-encoded fusions between HN and elastin-like polypeptides (ELP). ELPs provide steric stabilization and/or thermo-responsive phase separation. Fusions were designed to either remain soluble or phase separate at the physiological temperature of the retina. Interestingly, the soluble fusion assembles stable colloids with a hydrodynamic radius of 39.1 nm at 37 °C. As intended, the thermo-responsive fusion forms large coacervates (> 1,000 nm) at 37 °C. Both fusions bind human RPE cells and protect against oxidative stress-induction of apoptosis (TUNEL, caspase-3 activation). Their activity is mediated through STAT3; furthermore, STAT3 inhibition eliminates their protection. These findings suggest that HN polypeptides may facilitate cellular delivery of biodegradable nanoparticles with potential protection against age-related diseases, including macular degeneration.Copyright © 2019.

Aβ42O also regulate the proliferative and differentiative properties of stem cells.We aimed to study whether Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage is involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation.Human iPSCs-derived neural stem cell (NSC) was applied to investigate the effect of Aβ42O on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage using mitoSOX staining and long-range PCR lesion assay, respectively. mtDNA repair activity was measured by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in vitro assay using  isolates and the expression and localization of NHEJ components were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. The expressions of Tuj-1 and GFAP, detected by immunofluorescence and qPCR, respectively, were examined as an index of neurons and astrocytes production.We show that in NSC Aβ42O treatment induces ROS production and mtDNA damage and impairs DNA end joining activity. NHEJ components, such as Ku70/80, DNA- PKcs, and XRCC4, are localized in  and silencing of XRCC4 significantly exacerbates the effect of Aβ42O on mtDNA integrity. On the contrary, pre-treatment with Phytic Acid (IP6), which specifically stimulates DNA-PK-dependent end-joining, inhibits Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage and neuronal differentiation alteration.Aβ42O-induced mtDNA repair impairment may change cell fate thus shifting human NSC differentiation toward an astrocytic lineage.

This study was designed to explore the effect of autophagy on -mediated macrophage apoptosis and vulnerable plaques. Here, we generated the mouse model of vulnerable carotid plaque in ApoE mice. Application of ApoE mice with rapamycin (an autophagy inducer) inhibited necrotic core formation in vulnerable plaques by decreasing macrophage apoptosis. However, 3-methyladenine (an autophagy inhibitor) promoted plaque vulnerability through deteriorating these indexes. To further explore the mechanism of autophagy on macrophage apoptosis, we used macrophage apoptosis model in vitro and found that 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC, one of the primary oxysterols in oxLDL) caused macrophage apoptosis with concomitant impairment of , characterized by the impairment of mitochondrial ultrastructure, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial potential dissipation, mitochondrial fragmentation, excessive ROS generation and both caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation.

We have used the Scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique to measure transport of Na, K, H, Cl, NH  and Ca across the nuchal organ and body surface of embryos and neonates bathed in dechlorinated Hamilton tap water. Influx of Na and efflux of H and NH  were measured across the nuchal organ of both embryos and neonates. We propose that the efflux of K and Cl across the nuchal organ in embryos is related to the expansion of the haemocoel and release of intracellular solutes into the extracellular space during development. K is taken up across the nuchal organ later during development, coincident with expansion of the intracellular compartment through development of gills and other organs. Ca influx across the nuchal organ and body surface of neonates but not embryos is presumably related to calcification of the exoskeleton. Increases in the levels of Na and Ca in the water within the brood chamber suggests maternal provisioning of ions for uptake by the embryos. Our data thus support roles of the nuchal organ in ionoregulation, pH regulation, and nitrogenous waste excretion.© 2019.

In support of this, experimental studies using animal models of obesity show that chronic exercise prevents the development of obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction (cardiomyopathy). Whether exercise also improves the tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion in these models is less clear, and may depend on the type of exercise procedure as well as time of initiation. We have previously shown a reduction in ischemic-injury in diet-induced obese mice, when the exercise was started prior to the development of cardiac dysfunction in this model. In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of exercise on ischemic-tolerance when exercise was initiated after the development obesity-mediated. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20-22 weeks, where they were subjected to high-intensity interval training (HIT) during the last 3 weeks of the feeding period. Sedentary HFD fed and chow fed mice served as controls. Left-ventricular (LV) post-ischemic functional recovery and infarct size were measured in isolated perfused hearts. We also assessed the effect of 3-week HIT on mitochondrial function and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO). Sedentary HFD fed mice developed marked obesity and insulin resistance, and demonstrated reduced post-ischemic cardiac functional recovery and increased infarct size. Three weeks of HIT did not induce cardiac hypertrophy and only had a mild effect on obesity and insulin resistance. Despite this, HIT improved post-ischemic LV functional recovery and reduced infarct size. This increase in ischemic-tolerance was accompanied by an improved mitochondrial function as well as reduced MVO. The present study highlights the beneficial effects of exercise training with regard to improving the ischemic-tolerance in hearts with cardiomyopathy following obesity and insulin resistance. This study also emphasizes the exercise-induced improvement of cardiac energetics and mitochondrial function in obesity/diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Boardman, Rossvoll, Lund, Hafstad and Aasum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661991>Pyrroloquinoline quinone protected autophagy-dependent apoptosis induced by mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in INS-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is the main metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in organisms and is commonly used as a plasticizer. Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced  release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection.

These treatments, while causing similar, although mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent (RP-cells) or independent (RD-cells), delayed apoptosis, surprisingly generated identical kinetics and levels of dihydrorhodamine oxidation, indicative of O formation. These similarities were attributable to the involvement of a common upstream event resulting in activation of the two O-generating systems, and to intrinsic features of the cells. Both mechanisms required an initial and sequential mobilization of Ca from the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), with however different implications. The close contacts existing between the RyR and the  created optimal conditions for the Ca clearance, and the ensuing formation of O in RP-cell . Exposure to low concentrations of l-ascorbic acid (AA) transported by high affinity mechanisms in cells and , suppressed O formation. Much more Ca, and hence more arsenite, was necessary to promote NADPH oxidase activation in RD-cells, as a consequence of the cytosolic dilution and mitochondrial clearance of Ca. For the same reasons, an exposure to high concentrations of AA was required to suppress O formation under these conditions.Copyright © 2018.

The study was to investigate their role in cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the underlying mechanism. Isolated hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were Langendorff-perfused and cardiac I/R was achieved by 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Different concentrations of polyamines (0.1, 1, 10, and 15 μmol/L of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), cyclosporin A (0.2 μmol/L), or atractyloside (20 μmol/L) were given 10 min before the onset of reperfusion. The hemodynamics were monitored; the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the coronary effluent were measured spectrophotometrically; infarct size was determined by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method; and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening was determined spectrophotometrically by the Ca-induced swelling of isolated cardiac . The results showed that compared to I/R alone, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment improved heart function, reduced LDH release, decreased infarct size, and these effects were inhibited by atractyloside (MPTP activator). In isolated  from normal rats, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment inhibited MPTP opening. However, 10 and 15 μmol/L polyamines treatment had the opposite effects, and these effects were inhibited by cyclosporin A (MPTP inhibitor). Our findings showed that polyamines may have either protective or damaging effects on hearts suffering from I/R by inhibiting or activating MPTP opening.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647771>Correction to:  Are a Subset of Extracellular Vesicles Released by Activated Monocytes and Induce Type I IFN and TNF Responses in Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653274>Targeting  as an anticancer strategy.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636573>Enhancing Autophagy Diminishes Aberrant Ca Homeostasis and Arrhythmogenesis in Aging Rabbit Hearts.</a></h2><p>Aging in humans is associated with a 10-40-fold greater incidence of sudden cardiac death from malignant tachyarrhythmia. We have reported that thiol oxidation of ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) by -derived reactive oxygen species (mito-ROS) contributes to defective Ca homeostasis in cardiomyocytes (CMs) from aging rabbit hearts. However, mechanisms responsible for the increase in mito-ROS in the aging heart remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that age-associated decrease in autophagy is a major contributor to enhanced mito-ROS production and thereby pro-arrhythmic disturbances in Ca homeostasis.Ventricular tissues from aged rabbits displayed significant downregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial autophagy compared with tissues from young controls. Blocking autophagy with chloroquine increased total ROS production in primary rabbit CMs and mito-ROS production in HL-1 CMs. Furthermore, chloroquine treatment of HL-1 cells depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) to 50% that of controls. Blocking autophagy significantly increased oxidation of RyR2, resulting in enhanced propensity to pro-arrhythmic spontaneous Ca release under β-adrenergic stimulation. Aberrant Ca release was abolished by treatment with the mito-ROS scavenger mito-TEMPO. Importantly, the autophagy enhancer Torin1 and ATG7 overexpression reduced the rate of mito-ROS production and restored both Δψm and defective Ca handling in CMs derived from aged rabbit hearts.Decreased autophagy is a major cause of increased mito-ROS production in the aging heart. Our data suggest that promoting autophagy may reduce pathologic mito-ROS during normal aging and reduce pro-arrhythmic spontaneous Ca release via oxidized RyR2s.Copyright © 2019 Murphy, Baggett, Cooper, Lu, O-Uchi, Sedivy, Terentyev and Koren.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642231>[Protective Effect of a Dihydroflavonol Glycoside from  Nutt. in Mouse Model of Alcoholic Acute Pancreatitis].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of (2R, 3R)-dihydroquercetin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranose (C1) extracted from  Nutt. in a mouse model of alcoholic acute pancreatitis (FAEE-AP) induced byfatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE).The 30 healthy SPF mice were randomly divided into control group, model group, low dose group, middle dose group and high dose group, 6 in each group.

We used droplet digital (dd) PCR in combination with flow cytometric determination of nuclear DNA quantities to determine the absolute per-cell copy numbers of four mitochondrial genes (, , , and ) across four stages of melon leaf development. The copy numbers of these mitochondrial genes not only varied during leaf development but also differed among each other, and there was no correlation between the copy numbers of the mitochondrial genes and their transcript levels. The gene copy numbers varied from approximately 36.8 ± 4.5 ( copies in the 15th leaf) to approximately 82.9 ± 5.7 ( copies in the 9th leaf), while the mean number of  was approximately 416.6 ± 182.7 in the 15th leaf and 459.1 ± 228.2 in the 9th leaf. These observations indicate that the leaf cells of melon do not contain sufficient copies of mitochondrial genes to ensure that every mitochondrion possesses the entire mitochondrial genome. Given this cytological evidence, our results indicate that mtDNA in melon exists as a sub-genomic molecule rather than as a single-master circle and that the copy numbers of individual mitochondrial genes may vary greatly. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) controlling the relative prevalence and transmission of sub-genomic mtDNA molecules should provide insights into the continuity of the mitochondrial genome across generations.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646533>The Role of Mitochondrial Calcium Signaling in the Pathophysiology of Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>The pioneering work of Richard Altman on the presence of  in cells set in motion a field of research dedicated to uncovering the secrets of the .

Much of the function of the  relies on Ca homeostasis and the presence of effective Ca signaling to maintain the balance between mitochondrial function and dysfunction and subsequently, cell survival. Ca regulates the mitochondrial respiration rate which in turn increases ATP synthesis, but too much Ca can also trigger the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway; however, cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to modulate mitochondrial Ca influx and efflux in order to sustain their metabolic demand and ensure their survival. Therefore, targeting the mitochondrial Ca signaling involved in the bioenergetic and apoptotic pathways could serve as potential approaches to treat cancer patients.

Delivering DOX into the , lacking drug efflux proteins, is an interesting method to overcome DOX resistance. To solve the problem of positively charged triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for mitochondrial targeting , a charge reversal strategy was developed.  An acidity triggered cleavable polyanion PEI-DMMA (PD) was coated on the surface of positively charged lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle (DOX-PLGA/CPT) to form DOX-PLGA/CPT/PD  electrostatic interaction. The mitochondrial localization and anticancer efficacy of DOX-PLGA/CPT/PD was evaluated both  and in .  The surface negative charge of DOX-PLGA/CPT/PD prevents from rapid clearance in the blood and improved the accumulation in tumor tissue through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The hydrolysis of amide bonds in PD in weakly acidic tumor tissue leads to the conversion of DOX-PLGA/CPT/PD to DOX-PLGA/CPT. The positive charge of DOX-PLGA/CPT enhances the interaction with tumor cells, promotes the uptake and improves DOX contents in tumor cells. Once endocytosed by tumor cells, the exposed TPP in nanomedicine results in effective mitochondrial localization of DOX-PLGA/CPT. Afterward, DOX can release from the nanomedicine in the , target mtDNA, induce tumor cells apoptosis and overcome DOX resistance of MCF-7/ADR breast cancer.

At 28 days of age, sixty broilers were randomly divided into the control group (25 ± 2 °C; 24 h/day) and the heat stress group (36 ± 2 °C; 8 h/day lasted for 1 week or 2 weeks). Fifteen broilers per group were respectively euthanized, and some samples were respectively collected from the control and the heat stress groups at the end of the 1st week or the 2nd week of heat stress. A typical heat stress response has been observed at this temperature. Compared with the control group, the birds subjected to heat stress at the end of the 1st week reduced (P ＜ 0.05) body weight (BW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), the activity of serum antioxidant enzyme and content of glutathione (GSH), while increased (P ＜ 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum corticosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, when the heat stress lasted for the end of the 2nd week, there was no significant difference (P ＞ 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, FCR and serum contents of corticosterone, MDA and GSH. Regardless of duration of thermal stress, the localization of ABCG2 protein had no change. Moreover, heat stress also did not affect (P ＞ 0.05) the IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in the pectorales, crureus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and spleen, while significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05) the corresponding tissues ROS production at the end of the 1st week of heat stress. In contrast, at the end of the 2nd week of heat stress, IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in heat stress group significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05), while the corresponding tissues ROS production had no difference (P ＞ 0.05) compared to the control group. Collectively, duration of thermal stress affects growth performance, serum oxidative stress indices, and the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production of broiler tissues in a time-dependent manner.

Although molecular pathways of this underexcretion have been elucidated, its etiology remains mostly unknown. We demonstrate that gout can be caused by a mutation in LDHD within the putative catalytic site of the encoded d-lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in augmented blood levels of d-lactate, a stereoisomer of l-lactate, which is normally present in human blood in miniscule amounts. Consequent excessive renal secretion of d-lactate in exchange for uric acid reabsorption culminated in hyperuricemia and gout. We showed that LDHD expression is enriched in tissues with a high metabolic rate and abundant  and that d-lactate dehydrogenase resides in the  of cells overexpressing the human LDHD gene. Notably, the p.R370W mutation had no effect on protein localization. In line with the human phenotype, injection of d-lactate into naive mice resulted in hyperuricemia. Thus, hyperuricemia and gout can result from the accumulation of metabolites whose renal excretion is coupled to uric acid reabsorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644286>Exploring the photo-toxicity of hypoxic active iridium(III)-based sensitizers in 3D tumor spheroids.</a></h2><p>Among all molecules developed for anticancer therapies, photodynamic therapeutic agents have a unique profile. Their maximal activity is specifically triggered in tumors by light and toxicity of even systemically delivered drug is prevented in non-illuminated parts of the body. Photosensitizers exert their therapeutic effect by producing reactive oxygen species  a light-activated reaction with molecular oxygen. Consequently, the lowering of pO deep in solid tumors limits their treatment and makes essential the design of oxygen-independent sensitizers. In this perspective, we have recently developed Ir(III)-based molecules able to oxidize biomolecules by type I processes under free-oxygen conditions. We examine here their photo-toxicity in relevant biological models. We show that drugs, which are -accumulated, induce upon light irradiation a dramatic decrease of the cell viability, even under low oxygen conditions. Finally, assays on 3D tumor spheroids highlight the importance of the light-activation step and the oxygen consumption rate on the drug activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656131>Mitochondrial Protein Poldip2 Controls VSMC Differentiated Phenotype by O-Linked GlcNAc Transferase-Dependent Inhibition of a Ubiquitin Proteasome System.</a></h2><p> The mitochondrial protein polymerase interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) is required for the activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. As a consequence, Poldip2 deficiency induces metabolic reprograming with repressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity. Though homozygous deletion of Poldip2 is lethal, heterozygous mice are viable and show protection against aneurysm and injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia, diseases linked to loss of VSMC differentiation. Thus, we hypothesize that the metabolic reprograming induced by Poldip2 deficiency controls VSMC differentiation.  To determine the role of Poldip2-mediated metabolic reprograming in phenotypic modulation of VSMC.  We show that Poldip2 deficiency in vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of the serum response factor (SRF), Myocardin, and MRTFA and dramatically represses KLF4. Consequently, Poldip2-deficient VSMC and mouse aorta express high levels of contractile proteins and, more significantly, these cells do not dedifferentiate nor acquire macrophage-like characteristics when exposed to Cholesterol or PDGF. Regarding the mechanism, we found that Poldip2 deficiency upregulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and OGT-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation. Increased protein glycosylation causes the inhibition of a nuclear UPS responsible for SRF stabilization and KLF4 repression and is required for the establishment of the differentiated phenotype in Poldip2-deficient cells.  Our data show that Poldip2 deficiency induces a highly differentiated phenotype in VSMCs through a mechanism that involves regulation of metabolism and proteostasis. Additionally, our study positions -initiated signaling as key element of the VSMC differentiation programs that can be targeted to modulate VSMC phenotype during vascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646322>Ferroptosis was involved in the oleic acid-induced acute lung injury in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ferroptosis in acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model induced by oleic acid (OA). ALI was induced in the mice via the lateral tail vein injection of pure OA. The histopathological score of lung, lung wet-dry weight ratio and the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as the evaluation indexes of ALI. Iron concentration, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the lung tissues were measured using corresponding assay kits. The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry weight ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the  of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657561>Proteasome independent protein knockdown by small-molecule inhibitor for the undruggable lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Therapeutic target identification and corresponding drug development is a demanding task for the treatment of lung adeno-carcinoma, especially the most malignant proximal-proliferative subtype without druggable protein kinase mutations. Using a cell-SELEX-generated aptamer, we discovered a new tumor driver protein, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), which is specifically overexpressed in the most lethal subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. Tar-geted LRPPRC protein knockdown is a promising therapeutic strategy for the undruggable LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). Nevertheless, LRPPRC is mainly located in  and degraded by protease. Current protein knockdown approaches, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have limitations in their applications to the proteins degraded through proteasome-independent ways. Here, we designed an aptamer-assisted high-throughput method to screen small molecules which could bind to LRPPRC directly, disrupt the interaction of LRPPRC with its stabilizing chaperon protein, and lead to LRPPRC degradation by mitochondrial protease. The screened compound, gossypol-acetic acid (GAA), is an old medicine which can accomplish the new function for targeted LRPPRC knockdown. It showed significant antitumor effects even with the LRPPRC positive patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model.

This undesirable outcome may be due to some hidden factors that can intensify the consequences of AKI. Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a universal chemical used in plastics industry, is currently unavoidable and can be harmful to the liver. This study explored whether BPA exposure could be a causative factor that increase severity of remote liver injury after AKI and examined the preventive benefit by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in this complex condition. Male Wistar rats were given vehicle, BPA, or BPA + NAC for 5 weeks then underwent 45 min renal ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion (RIR), a group of vehicle-sham-control was also included. RIR not only induced AKI but produced liver injury, triggered systemic oxidative stress as well as inflammation, which increasing severity upon exposure to BPA. Given NAC to BPA-exposed rats diminished the added-on effects of BPA on liver functional impairment, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis caused by AKI. NAC also mitigated the abnormalities in mitochondrial functions, dynamics, mitophagy, and ultrastructure of the liver by improving the mitochondrial homeostasis regulatory signaling AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3. The study demonstrates that NAC is an effective adjunct for preserving mitochondrial homeostasis and reducing remote effects of AKI in environments where BPA exposure is vulnerable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653868>Regulation of the ER stress response by a mitochondrial microprotein.</a></h2><p>Cellular homeostasis relies on having dedicated and coordinated responses to a variety of stresses.

Here, we discover that a previously uncharacterized 54-amino acid microprotein PIGBOS regulates UPR. PIGBOS localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with the ER protein CLCC1 at ER- contact sites. Functional studies reveal that the loss of PIGBOS leads to heightened UPR and increased cell death.

ROS are also produced by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases in response to growth factors and cytokines by normal physiological signaling pathways. NADPH oxidase, a member of NOX family, utilizes molecular oxygen (O2) to generate ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2•-). Imbalance between ROS production and its elimination is known to be the major cause of various human diseases. NOX family proteins are exclusively involved in ROS production which makes them attractive target(s) for the treatment of ROS-mediated diseases including cancer. Molecules such as Keap1/Nrf2, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDRs), NF-κB, KRAS, kallistatin, gene associated with retinoic-interferon-induced mortality-19 and deregulated metabolic pathways are involved in ROS production in association with NADPH oxidase. Therapeutic strategies targeting NADPH oxidases in ROS driven cancers are not very effective due to its complex regulatory circuit. Tumor suppressor miRNAs viz. miR-34a, miR-137, miR-99a, and miR-21a-3p targeting NADPH oxidases are predominantly downregulated in ROS driven cancers. miRNAs also regulate other cellular machineries such as Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and NMDRs involved in ROS production and consequently drug resistance. Here we discuss the structure, function and metabolic role of NADPH oxidase, NOX family protein-protein interaction, their association with other pathways and NADPH oxidase alteration by miRNAs. Moreover, we also discuss and summarize studies on NADPH oxidase-associated with various malignancies and their therapeutic implications.

Autophagy induction was monitored by acidic vesicular organelle staining and EGFP-LC3 transfection. 20()-GRg3 inhibited autophagy of cells in a starved state, making it impossible for cells to maintain a steady state through autophagy, and then induced apoptosis. 20()-GRg3 blocked the late stage of autophagy (fusion of lysosomes and degradation of autophagic lysosomes), including a decrease in acidic vesicular organelle fluorescence, increased LC3 I-II conversion, accumulation of EGFP-LC3 fluorescence, GFP-mRFP-LC3 red-green fluorescence ratio, degradation of the substrate p62, and loss of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis, which induced apoptosis. ROS increased, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, apoptotic inducer AIF was released from , and nuclear transfer occurred, triggering a series of subsequent apoptotic events. Autophagy inducer rapamycin inhibited the apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3, whereas autophagy inhibitor BA1 promoted apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3.

Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of  and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the biological role of the TNT-mediated vesicle exchange between stromal and leukemic cells, implicating the direct vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided protection of leukemic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648130>Early reversal cardiac with esmolol in hypertensive rats: The role of subcellular organelle phenotype.</a></h2><p>Our group has previously shown that short-term treatment (48 h) with esmolol reduces left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). However, we do not know the mechanism that explain this effect. The aim of this study was to assess the role that the subcellular organelle phenotype plays in early cardiac reverse after short-term treatment with esmolol.14-Month-old male SHRs were randomly assigned to receive esmolol (300 μg/kg/min) (SHR-E) or vehicle (SHR). Age-matched male Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) served as controls. After 48 h of treatment, an ultrastructural analysis of heart tissue (left ventricle) was performed. We studied cardiomyocyte ultrastructural remodeling of subcellular organelles by electronic microcopy in all groups.SHR group showed significant morphometric and stereological changes in  and subcellular organelles (cytoplasm and nucleus, myofibril structure,  structure, Z-Disk, intercalated disk, T-system and cystern), and also changes in the extracellular matrix (collagen) with respect to WKY group. Esmolol significantly improved the morphology and stereology mitochondrial, reduced the organelle phenotype abnormalities but no produced changes in the extracellular matrix with respect to SHR group. Interesantly, parameters of  (regularity factor, ellipsoidal form factor and density of volume), and all parameters of subcellular organelles returned to the normality in SHR-E.Our results show that left ventricular hypertrophy reversal after short-term treatment with esmolol is associated with reversal of subcellular organelle phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

We compared the mt genomes of the 27 fungal species in the Pezizomycotina and Basidiomycotina subphyla, with the results revealing that H. marmoreus is a sister to Tricholoma matsutake and the phylogenetic distribution of this fungus based on the mt genome. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Ascomycetes  started to diverge earlier than that of Basidiomycetes and supported the robustness of the hyper metric tree. The fungal sequences are highly polymorphic and gene order varies significantly in the dikarya data set, suggesting a correlation between the gene order and divergence time in the fungi mt genome. To detect the mt genome variations in H. marmoreus, we analyzed the mtDNA sequences of 48 strains. The phylogeny and variation sited type statistics of H. marmoreus provide clear-cut evidence for the existence of four well-defined cultivations isolated lineages, suggesting female ancestor origin of H. marmoreus. Furthermore, variations on two loci were further identified to be molecular markers for distinguishing the subgroup containing 32 strains of other strains. Fifteen conserved protein-coding genes of mtDNAs were analyzed, with fourteen revealed to be under purifying selection in the examined fungal species, suggesting the rapid evolution was caused by positive selection of this gene.Our studies have provided new reference mt genomes and comparisons between species and intraspecies with other strains, and provided future perspectives for assessing diversity and origin of H. marmoreus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630563>Chemomodulatory effects of  extract via -dependent apoptosis and necroptosis in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>The present study intended to assess the anticancer potential of  ethyl acetate fraction (AVEAF) in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453) and against -methyl--nitrosourea (MNU) induced mammary carcinoma in Sprague-Dawley rats which resemble the human estrogen dependent breast cancer. The SRB assay showed that the maximum growth inhibition rate of AVEAF on MCF-7 cell was 27.12 at 100 µg/ml. Flow cytometry analysis observed that AVEAF induced the cell cycle arrest at the S phases and decreased in mitochondrial membrane potential on the MCF-7 cells. AVEAF elevated intracellular ROS level in the MCF-7 cells which were reversed with -acetycysteine (2 mM) pretreatment indicating that AVEAF induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis via augmentation of intracellular ROS. Western blotting exhibited that AVEAF increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax while decreasing anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression which promoted the cleavage of caspase-9, PARP1, RIPK 1, and RIPK 3. Additionally, AVEAF exerted anticancer effect on tumor-bearing rats and the tumor inhibition rate is 50%. Data of the study indicate that AVEAF exhibits In Vitro and In Vivo anticancer activities that associate with its ROS-mediated mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and necroptosis in MCF-7 cells and may serve as a potential against breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645842>Metformin restores the mitochondrial membrane potentials in association with a reduction in TIMM23 and NDUFS3 in MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h2><p>SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP) develop mitochondrial dysfunction and other cellular responses similar to those that occur in the dopaminergic neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been shown in animal models of PD that neuronal death can be prevented by metformin, an anti-diabetic drug. Both MPP and metformin inhibit complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It has been reported that decreased levels of the mitochondrial inner membrane proteins TIMM23 and NDUFS3 are associated with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial depolarization. In the present study, we investigated the effects of metformin on MPP-induced neurotoxicity using differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The results showed that pretreatment with metformin increased the viability of MPP-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Pretreatment with metformin decreased the expression of TIMM23 and NDUFS3 in MPP-treated SH-SY5Y cells. This was correlated with reduced mitochondrial fragmentation and an improvement in the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results suggest that metformin pretreatment protects against MPP-induced neurotoxicity, and offer insights into the potential role of metformin in protecting against toxin-induced parkinsonism.Copyright © 2019 Chanthammachat et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653761>A small molecule protects mitochondrial integrity by inhibiting mTOR activity.</a></h2><p>Apoptosis activation by cytochrome  release from  to cytosol is a normal cellular response to mitochondrial damage. Using cellular apoptosis assay, we have found small-molecule apoptosis inhibitors that protect cells from mitochondrial damage. Previously, we reported the discovery of a small molecule, Compound A, which blocks dopaminergic neuron death in a rat model of Parkinson's disease through targeting succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) of complex II to protect the integrity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Here, we report a small molecule, Compound R6, which saves cells from apoptosis via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated induction of autophagy. Additionally, we show that Compound R6 protects mitochondrial integrity and respiration after induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Encouragingly, and supporting the potential further application of Compound R6 as a tool for basic and medicinal research, a pharmacokinetics (PK) profiling study showed that Compound R6 is metabolically stable and can pass the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, Compound R6 accumulates in the brain of test animals via intravenous and intraperitoneal administration. Finally, we found that Compound R6 confers significant neuroprotective effects on a rat cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model, demonstrating its potential as a promising drug candidate for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640251>The Charcot-Marie Tooth Disease Mutation R94Q in MFN2 Decreases ATP Production but Increases Mitochondrial Respiration under Conditions of Mild Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Charcot-Marie tooth disease is a hereditary polyneuropathy caused by mutations in Mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a GTPase in the outer mitochondrial membrane involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and bioenergetics. Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented  but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase M2, suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into . Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that  harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654556>PINK1 overexpression protects against cerebral ischemia through Parkin regulation.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dynamics and function are important for cell survival regulation under stress. In this study, we report that cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury significantly reduced mitochondrial function through reduced PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) expression, ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) levels, and increased oxidative stress compared to sham rats. PINK1 overexpression mice significantly improved mitochondrial function by increased mitochondrial complex I, II, and III activities and ATP levels with concomitant decline in reactive oxygen species levels. PINK1 overexpression mice after I/R injury significantly reduced apoptosis through downregulation of cytochrome c, p53 expressions compared to cerebral I/R injury rats. Furthermore, we showed from parkin siRNA studies that PINK1 regulated phosphorylation parkin is critical to the protection against cerebral I/R injury.

In healthy tissues, the maintenance of MQC depends upon an exquisite balance between mitophagy (removal of damaged  by autophagy) and biogenesis (de-novo synthesis of ). Here, we show that mitophagy is disrupted in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and decoupled from mitochondrial biogenesis during the progression of the disease. Diabetic retinas from human post-mortem donors and experimental mice exhibit a net loss of mitochondrial contents during the early stages of the disease process. Using novel diabetic mitophagy-reporter mice (mitoQC-Ins2Akita) alongside pMitoTimer (a molecular clock to address mitochondrial-age dynamics), we demonstrate that mitochondrial loss arose due to an inability of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for diabetes-exacerbated mitophagy. However, as diabetes duration increases, Pink1-dependent mitophagy deteriorates, leading to the build-up of  primed for degradation in DR. Impairment of mitophagy during prolonged diabetes is linked with the development of retinal senescence, a phenotype that blunted hyperglycaemia-induced mitophagy in mitoQC primary Müller cells. Our findings suggest that normalizing mitochondrial turnover may preserve MQC and provide novel therapeutic options for the management of DR-associated complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661894>Rewiring of Cancer Cell Metabolism by Mitochondrial VDAC1 Depletion Results in Time-Dependent Tumor Reprogramming: Glioblastoma as a Proof of Concept.</a></h2><p>Reprograming of the metabolism of cancer cells is an event recognized as a hallmark of the disease. The mitochondrial gatekeeper, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), mediates transport of metabolites and ions in and out of , and is involved in -mediated apoptosis. Here, we compared the effects of reducing hVDAC1 expression in a glioblastoma xenograft using human-specific si-RNA (si-hVDAC1) for a short (19 days) and a long term (40 days). Tumors underwent reprograming, reflected in rewired metabolism, eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and differentiation. Short- and long-term treatments of the tumors with si-hVDAC1 similarly reduced the expression of metabolism-related enzymes, and translocator protein (TSPO) and CSCs markers. In contrast, differentiation into cells expressing astrocyte or neuronal markers was noted only after a long period during which the tumor cells were hVDAC1-depleted. This suggests that tumor cell differentiation is a prolonged process that precedes metabolic reprograming and the "disappearance" of CSCs. Tumor proteomics analysis revealing global changes in the expression levels of proteins associated with signaling, synthesis and degradation of proteins, DNA structure and replication and epigenetic changes, all of which were highly altered after a long period of si-hVDAC1 tumor treatment. The depletion of hVDAC1 greatly reduced the levels of the multifunctional translocator protein TSPO, which is overexpressed in both the  and the nucleus of the tumor. The results thus show that VDAC1 depletion-mediated cancer cell metabolic reprograming involves a chain of events occurring in a sequential manner leading to a reversal of the unique properties of the tumor, indicative of the interplay between metabolism and oncogenic signaling networks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647884>Sirt3-dependent deacetylation of COX-1 counteracts oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial complexes are prone to sirtuin (Sirt)3-mediated deacetylation modification, which may determine cellular response to stimuli, such as oxidative stress. In this study, we show that the cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-1, a core catalytic subunit of mitochondrial complex IV, was acetylated and deactivated both in 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride-treated NIH/3T3 cells and hydrogen peroxide-treated primary neuronal cells, correlating with apoptotic cell death induction by oxidative stress. Inhibition of Sirt3 by small interfering RNA or the inhibitor nicotinamide induced accumulation of acetylation of COX-1, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased cell apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of Sirt3 enhanced deacetylation of COX-1 and inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Significantly, rats treated with ischemia/reperfusion injury, a typical oxidative stress-related disease, presented an inhibition of Sirt3-induced hyperacetylation of COX-1 in the brain tissues. Furthermore, K13, K264, K319, and K481 were identified as the acetylation sits of COX-1 in response to oxidative stress.

We investigated the genetic relevance and determinants of mitral leaflet size by performing extensive gene analyses in patients with HCM.Anterior mitral leaflet (AML) lengths were measured in HCM patients (n = 211) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 30) using echocardiography with hemodynamic and chamber geometric assessments. We analyzed 82 nuclear DNA (8 sarcomeric genes, 74 other HCM-associated genes) and mitochondrial DNA. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed in the 132 HCM patients.Average indexed AML was significantly longer for HCM than for controls (17.2 ± 2.3 vs. 13.3 ± 1.6 mm/m, P <  0.001). Average AML length correlated with body surface area (BSA), left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume (P <  0.001) and LV mass by CMR (P < 0.001). Average indexed AML by BSA of pure-apical HCM was significantly shorter than other typed HCM (16.6 ± 2.0 vs. 17.4 ± 2.4 mm/m, P = 0.025). Indexed AML was independently correlated with left atrial wall stress. The thin filament mutation group showed larger average AML (31.9 ± 3.8 vs. 29.6 ± 3.8 mm, P = 0.045), but this was not significant with the indexed value. No difference in AML size among subgroups was observed based on the presence of sarcomere protein or -related gene variants (P > 0.05).AML elongation was a unique finding of HCM.

This fragmentation was correlated with reduced cytotoxicity and NK cell loss, resulting in tumor evasion of NK cell-mediated surveillance, which predicted poor survival in patients with liver cancer. The hypoxic tumor microenvironment drove the sustained activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin-GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (mTOR-Drp1) in NK cells, resulting in excessive mitochondrial fission into fragments.

Here we showed that CVB3 induced ER stress response and apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes. We found that Ca -calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was activated by ER stress-dependent intracellular Ca overload in the CVB3 infected H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Treatment with an inhibitor of ER stress, 4-PBA, attenuated intracellular Ca accumulation indirectly and reduced CaMKII activity. Inhibition of CaMKII with pharmacological inhibitor (KN-93) or shRNA reduced CVB3-induced H9c2 apoptosis and repressed cytochrome c release from  to cytoplasm. Whereas overexpression of the activated mutant of CaMKII (CaMKII-T287D) enhanced CVB3-induced H9c2 apoptosis and mitochondrial cytochrome c release, which could be alleviated by blocking of mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU) or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Further in vivo investigation revealed that blocking of CaMKII with KN-93 prevented cardiomyocytes apoptosis and improved cardiac contractile function in CVB3 infected mouse heart. Collectively, these findings provide a novel evidence that CaMKII plays a vital role in promotion of CVB3-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which links ER stress and mitochondrial Ca uptake.

These pathological conditions make  of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate  function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet.  from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control  (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney  was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF  due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664682>Identification of PP2A and S6 Kinase as Modifiers of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase-Induced Neurotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Mutations in LRRK2 are currently recognized as the most common monogenetic cause of Parkinsonism. The elevation of kinase activity of LRRK2 that frequently accompanies its mutations is widely thought to contribute to its toxicity. Accordingly, many groups have developed LRRK2-specific kinase inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy. Given that protein phosphorylation is a reversible event, we sought to elucidate the phosphatase(s) that can reverse LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation, with the view that targeting this phosphatase(s) may similarly be beneficial. Using an unbiased RNAi phosphatase screen conducted in a Drosophila LRRK2 model, we identified PP2A as a genetic modulator of LRRK2-induced neurotoxicity. Further, we also identified ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), a target of PP2A, as a novel regulator of LRRK2 function.

This dysfunction can be indirectly assessed using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. A total of 118 patients with MDD and 116 age- and sex-matched control subjects were recruited for this study, and mtDNA copy numbers were measured in peripheral blood cells. This study also examined the potential variables that might impact mtDNA copy number in MDD, including age and clinical features. Additionally, epigenetic control of mtDNA copy number was examined by assessing DNA methylation ratios in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) promoter in nuclear DNA and the displacement loop (D-loop) region of mtDNA. The present results showed that patients with MDD had a higher mtDNA copy number and a decreased DNA methylation status in the PGC1α promoter. mtDNA copy numbers were negatively associated with an age, psychomotor agitation, and somatic symptoms in MDD. These results suggest that the alterations in mitochondrial function and epigenetic change of PGC1α may be relevant to the pathophysiology of MDD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, hypoxia upregulates the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ), a group of peptides known to impair/inhibit the electron transport chain (ETC) of reactions that support oxphos in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This is a hypothesis paper that reconciles the hypoxia-induced upregulation of Aβ with Aβ's ETC-inhibiting action and, specifically, posits an oxphos-enhancing effect of this inhibition under conditions of newly developing or otherwise mild hypoxia. This effect is typically transient; that is, under conditions of prolonged or severe hypoxia, the oxphos-enhancing activity is overwhelmed by Aβ's well-known toxic actions on  and other cellular components. The hypothesis is motivated by evidence that the IMM transmembrane potential Ψm, an important determinant of ETC activity, exhibits heterogeneity, i.e., a range of values, among a given local population of . It specifically proposes that during oxygen limitation, Aβ selectively inactivates ETC complexes in  that exhibit relatively low absolute values of Ψm, thereby suppressing oxygen binding and consumption by complex IV of the ETC in these . This effect of Aβ on low-Ψm  is hypothesized to spare hypoxia-limited oxygen for oxphos-enabling utilization by the ETC of the remaining active, higher-Ψm local , and thereby to increase overall ATP generated collectively by the local mitochondrial population, i.e., to ameliorate hypoxia-induced oxphos reduction. The protective action of Aβ hypothesized here may slow the early development of hypoxia-associated cellular deterioration/loss in Alzheimer's disease and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664643>Allopregnanolone Reverses Bioenergetic Deficits in Female Triple Transgenic Alzheimer's Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (Allo) promoted neural stem cell regeneration, restored cognitive function, and reduced Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology in the triple transgenic Alzheimer's mouse model (3xTgAD). To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain metabolism, we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling pathways while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty acid metabolism, and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A) pathways while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657869>The topologies of N -Adenosine methylation (m A) in land plant  and their putative effects on organellar gene-expression.</a></h2><p> serve as major sites of ATP production, and play key roles in many other metabolic processes that are critical to the cell.

Here, we investigated the role of the DGUOK in the self-renewal of lung cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Our data support that DGUOK overexpression strongly correlates with cancer progression and patient survival. The depletion of DGUOK robustly inhibited lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth, metastasis, and CSC self-renewal. Mechanistically, DGUOK is required for the biogenesis of respiratory complex I and mitochondrial OXPHOS, which in turn regulates CSC self-renewal through AMPK-YAP1 signaling. The restoration of mitochondrial OXPHOS in DGUOK KO lung cancer cells using NDI1 was able to prevent AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of YAP and to rescue CSC stemness. Genetic targeting of DGUOK using doxycycline-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 was able to markedly induce tumor regression. Our findings reveal a novel role for mitochondrial dNTP metabolism in lung cancer tumor growth and progression, and implicate that the mitochondrial deoxynucleotide salvage pathway could be potentially targeted to prevent CSC-mediated therapy resistance and metastatic recurrence.© 2019 The Authors.

Beta-cells can stay in the off-mode, ready-mode or on-mode; the mode-switching being determined by the open state probability of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels, and the activity of enzymes like glucokinase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Mitochondrial metabolism is critical for insulin secretion. A sound understanding of the intermediary metabolism, electrophysiology, and cell signaling is essential for comprehension of the entire spectrum of the stimulus-secretion coupling. Depolarization brought about by inhibition of the ATP sensitive potassium channel, together with the inward depolarizing currents through the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, leads to electrical activities, opening of the voltage-gated calcium channels, and exocytosis of insulin. Calcium- and cAMP-signaling elicited by depolarization, and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, including the free fatty acid receptors, are intricately connected in the form of networks at different levels. Activation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor augments insulin secretion by amplifying calcium signals by calcium induced calcium release (CICR). In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, use of the sulfonylureas that act on the ATP sensitive potassium channel, damages the beta cells, which eventually fail; these drugs do not improve the cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, drugs acting through the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor protect the beta-cells, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. The use of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists is increasing and that of sulfonylurea is decreasing. A better understanding of the stimulus-secretion coupling may lead to the discovery of other molecular targets for development of drugs for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646583>Key molecular pathways in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and also become an emerging risk factor for liver-related complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver-related burden of NASH is likely to increase and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is probably to be the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020, as a consequence of increased disease prevalence and of the lack of an effective treatment. The first step in the NAFLD development is represented by fat accumulation in the liver, a condition that is commonly associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. Notably, it has been acknowledged that the step from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to NASH is key step in the NASH formation, and the mechanisms behind this transition have been extensively studied. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunity is a driving force in NAFLD progression because it directly regulates all key pathogenic features of the disease processes, including metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the currently available signaling pathways of NASH formation, including oxidative stress, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), -associated pathways, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nuclear receptors, and other signal pathways, for the aim of a better understanding of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649854>Actively priming autophagic cell death with novel transferrin receptor-targeted nanomedicine for synergistic chemotherapy against breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Recently, considerable attention in the field of cancer therapy has been focused on the mammalian rapamycin target (mTOR), inhibition of which could result in autophagic cell death (ACD). Though novel combination chemotherapy of autophagy inducers with chemotherapeutic agents is extensively investigated, nanomedicine-based combination therapy for ACD remains in infancy. In attempt to actively trigger ACD for synergistic chemotherapy, here we incorporated autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAP) into 7pep-modified PEG-DSPE polymer micelles (7pep-M-RAP) to specifically target and efficiently priming ACD of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with high expression of transferrin receptor (TfR). Cytotoxic paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded micelle (7pep-M-PTX) was regarded as chemotherapeutic drug model. We discovered that with superior intracellular uptake  and more tumor accumulation of micelles , 7pep-M-RAP exhibited excellent autophagy induction and synergistic antitumor efficacy with 7pep-M-PTX. Mechanism study further revealed that 7pep-M-RAP and 7pep-M-PTX used in combination provided enhanced efficacy through induction of both apoptosis- and -associated autophagic cell death. Together, our findings suggested that the targeted excess autophagy may provide a rational strategy to improve therapeutic outcome of breast cancer, and simultaneous induction of ACD and apoptosis may be a promising anticancer modality.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The placenta provides the fetus with the necessary nutrition and oxygen and takes away the metabolic waste. Patients with GDM are diagnosed and treated merely on the basis of the blood glucose level; this approach does nothing to help evaluate the status of the placenta, which is worth noting in GDM. The purpose of this research was to clarify the relation between thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the placenta of patients with GDM, which has thus far remained unclear.The expression of TXNIP in the placentas of 10 patients with GDM and 10 healthy puerperae (control group) was investigated via immunofluorescence. The relation among TXNIP, ROS, and the function of  was explored in HTR-8/SVneo cells stimulated by high glucose (HG).The results showed the expression of TXNIP in the placentas of patients with GDM was higher than that in the control group, and the expression of TXNIP in HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with HG was higher than that in the control group, causing the accumulation of ROS and changes of , promoting apoptosis and inhibition of migration.High expression of TXNIP caused by HG mediates the increasing ROS and the  dysfunction in GDM; this impairs the function of the placenta and is the basis for the prediction of perinatal outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634539>Acteoside ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis through inhibiting peroxynitrite-mediated mitophagy activation.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease in central nervous system (CNS) with limited therapeutic drugs. In the present study, we explored the anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective properties of Acteoside (AC), an active compound from medicinal herb Radix Rehmanniae (RR) and neuroprotective effects of AC on MS pathology by using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. We tested the hypothesis that AC could alleviate EAE pathogenesis through inhibiting inflammation and ONOO--mediated mitophagy activation in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that AC treatment effectively ameliorated neurological deficit score and postponed disease onset in the EAE mice. AC treatment inhibited inflammation/demyelination, alleviated peripheral activation and CNS infiltration of encephalitogenic CD4 T cells and CD11b activated microglia/macrophages in the spinal cord of EAE mice. Meanwhile, AC treatment reduced ONOO production, down-regulated the expression of iNOS and NADPH oxidases, and inhibited neuronal apoptotic cell death and mitochondrial damage in the spinal cords of the EAE mice. Furthermore, AC treatment decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in mitochondrial fraction, and inhibited the translocation of Drp1 to the . In vitro studies further proved that AC possessed strong ONOO scavenging capability and protected the neuronal cells from nitrative cytotoxicity via suppressing ONOO-mediated excessive mitophagy. Taken together, Acteoside could be a potential therapeutic agent for multiple sclerosis treatment. The suppression of ONOO-induced excessive mitophagy activation could be one of the critical mechanisms contributing to its anti-inflammatory and anti-demyelinating properties.Copyright © 2019.

However, Cc has moonlighting roles outside  driving the transition of apoptotic cells from life to death. When living cells are damaged, Cc escapes its natural mitochondrial environment and, once in the cytosol, it binds other proteins to form a complex named the apoptosome-a platform that triggers caspase activation and further leads to controlled cell dismantlement. Early released Cc also binds to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which stimulates further massive Cc release from . Besides the well-characterized binding proteins contributing to the pro-apoptotic functions of Cc, many novel protein targets have been recently described. Among them, histone chaperones were identified as key partners of Cc following DNA breaks, indicating that Cc might modulate chromatin dynamics through competitive binding to histone chaperones. In this article, we review the ample set of recently discovered anti-apoptotic proteins-involved in DNA damage, transcription and energetic metabolism-reported to interact with Cc in the cytoplasm and even the nucleus upon DNA breaks.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663667> Targeting Selenophene Modified BODIPY-Based Photosensitizers for Treatment of Hypoxic Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Two red absorbing, water soluble and  (MT) targeting selenophene substituted BODIPY based photosensitizers (PSs) were realized (BOD-Se, BOD-Se-I) and their potential as photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents were evaluated. BOD-Se-I showed higher 1O2 generation yield thanks to the enhanced heavy atom effect and this derivative was further tested detailly in cell culture studies under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. BOD-Se-I not only effectively functioned under hypoxic conditions but also showed highly selective photocytotoxicity towards cancer cells. The selectivity is believed to arise from difference in mitochondrial membrane potentials of healthy and cancerous cells. To best of our knowledge this marks the first example of a MT targeted BODIPY PS that functions under hypoxic conditions. Remarkably, thanks to the design strategy all these properties where realized by a compound that was synthesized in only five steps with 32% overall yield.

A previous study focused on its antioxidant mechanism, whereas in this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of a series of 28 analogues and the mechanism of apoptosis of the most cytotoxic compound against wild-type (HCT-116) and p53 mutant (HT-29) colorectal cancer cell lines. The series of analogues comprise of different families, namely hydrazone, oxadiazole, thiosemicarbazides and triazoles. In the initial cytotoxicity screening, N-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyloxy) benzohydrazide, henceforth known as, P5H, was found to be most cytotoxic against human colorectal cancer cell lines (IC for HCT-116 = 11.79 μM and HT-29 = 18.52 μM). Additionally, P5H was found to have some degree of selectivity towards cancer cells compared to normal human colon cells (CCD-112 CoN). Subsequent investigation had brought insight on P5H ability to induce apoptosis in both HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed both cell lines were arrested at the G2/M phase upon treatment. Our study concluded that P5H induced the death receptor, DR5 in HCT-116 and -mediated apoptosis pathway in HT-29. Therefore, P5H may be a promising candidate as a chemotherapy agent against colon cancer.

The CMT2K axonal form is associated with GDAP1 dominant mutations, which according to the affected domain cause a gradient of severity. Indeed, the p.C240Y mutation, located within GDAP1 glutathione S-transferase (GST) domain and associated to a mitochondrial complex I defect, is related to a faster disease progression, compared to other mutations, such as the p.R120W located outside the GST domain. Here, we analysed the pathophysiology of six CMT2K fibroblast cell lines, carrying either the p.C240Y or p.R120W mutations. We show that complex I deficiency leads to a redox potential alteration and a significant reduction of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression, a major deacetylase sensitive to the cellular redox state, and NRF1 the downstream target of SIRT1. In addition, we disclosed that the p.C240Y mutation is associated with a greater mitochondrial oxidative stress than the p.R120W mutation. Moreover, complex I activity is further restored in CMT2K mutant cell lines exposed to resveratrol. Together, these results suggest that the reduction of oxidative stress may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for CMT2K.Copyright © 2018.

Accumulation of 7S DNA in iPD and LRRK2-PD fibroblasts was related with an increase in H-strand mtDNA transcription.These results show that 7S DNA accumulation, low mtDNA replication, high H-strand transcription, and low mtDNA release compose a pattern of mtDNA dysfunction shared by both iPD and LRRK2-PD fibroblasts. Moreover, these results suggest that the deregulation of the genetic switch formed by 7SDNA that alternates between mtDNA replication and transcription is a fundamental pathophysiological mechanism in both idiopathic and monogenic Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2018.

Pink1 mutations are the second most common cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to characteristic motor impairments, PD patients also commonly exhibit cognitive impairments. As the hippocampus plays a prominent role in cognition, we tested if loss of Pink1 in mice influences learning and memory. While wild-type mice were able to perform a contextual discrimination task, age-matched Pink1 knockout (Pink1) mice showed an impaired ability to differentiate between two similar contexts. Similarly, Pink1 mice performed poorly in a delayed alternation task as compared to age-matched controls. Poor performance in these cognitive tasks was not the result of overt hippocampal pathology. However, a significant reduction in hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels was detected in the Pink1 mice. This decrease in hippocampal TH levels was also associated with reduced DOPA decarboxylase and dopamine D2 receptor levels, but not post-synaptic dopamine D1 receptor levels. These presynaptic changes appeared to be selective for dopaminergic fibers as hippocampal dopamine beta hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, and tryptophan hydroxylase levels were unchanged in Pink1 mice. Administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 to Pink1 mice was found to improve performance in the context discrimination task. Taken together, our results show that Pink1 loss may alter dopamine signaling in the hippocampus, which could be a contributing mechanism for the observed learning and memory impairments.Copyright © 2018.

T2D presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for insulin resistance and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle  are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally.

Presequence processing upon import is essential for proteostasis and survival, but the consequences of dysfunctional protein maturation are unknown. We find that impaired presequence processing causes accumulation of precursors inside  that form aggregates, which escape degradation and unexpectedly do not cause cell death. Instead, cells survive via activation of a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-like pathway that is triggered very early after precursor accumulation. In contrast to classical stress pathways, this immediate response maintains mitochondrial protein import, membrane potential, and translation through translocation of the nuclear HMG-box transcription factor Rox1 to . Rox1 binds mtDNA and performs a TFAM-like function pivotal for transcription and translation. Induction of early mtUPR provides a reversible stress model to mechanistically dissect the initial steps in mtUPR pathways with the stressTFAM Rox1 as the first line of defense.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

CNH has also been shown to be cardioprotective in isolated rat heart. In this study, we hypothesize that this cardioprotective effect of CNH is mediated by activation of µ and delta2 ORs and preservation of mitochondrial function. Hearts from rats adapted to CNH (12 % oxygen) for 3 weeks were extracted, perfused in the Langendorff mode and subjected to 45 min of global ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. Intervention groups were pretreated for 10 min with antagonists for different OR types: naloxone (300 nmol/l), the selective delta OR antagonist TIPP(psi) (30 nmol/l), the selective delta1 OR antagonist BNTX (1 nmol/l), the selective delta2 OR antagonist naltriben (1 nmol/l), the selective peptide delta OR antagonist CTAP (100 nmol/l) and the selective kappa OR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (3 nmol/l). Creatine kinase activity in coronary effluent and cardiac contractile function were monitored to assess cardiac injury and functional impairment. Additionally, cardiac tissue was collected to measure ATP and to isolate  to measure respiration rate and calcium retention capacity. Adaptation to CNH decreased myocardial creatine kinase release during reperfusion and improved the postischemic recovery of contractile function. Additionally, CNH improved mitochondrial state 3 and uncoupled respiration rates, ADP/O, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium retention capacity and myocardial ATP level during reperfusion compared to the normoxic group. These protective effects were completely abolished by naloxone, TIPP(psi), naltriben, CTAP but not BNTX or nor-binaltorphimine.

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging, and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species, impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering, may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, -targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD.

Our ultramicroscopic characterization of cytosolic lipid droplet degradation in central vacuole-absent cells and central vacuole-containing cells of senescent watermelon leaves demonstrated two degradation pathways: the small vacuole-associated pathway and the central vacuole-associated pathway. This provided an insight into the subcellular mechanisms for the isolation of the fatty acids derived from lipid droplets.

While most genes expressed "in the remaining" oligodendrocytes are downregulated in schizophrenia, only a few are upregulated. To the latter group belong prohibitin 2 and DISC 1, which were recently identified as -located mitophagy receptors. Their overexpression, together with greatly reduced numbers and densities of oligodendroglial  and the structurally "normal appearance of the remaining " in these cells as reported by Uranova's group (Uranova et al., 2001, 2004, 2018), point to enhanced mitophagy in oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia, which is possibly even cell protective by preventing apoptosis. Since massive loss of white matter oligodendrocytes is a characteristic feature of schizophrenia, we assume that increased mitophagy is a late event in the development and/or further progression of white matter pathologic changes. Moreover, altered oligodendroglial mitophagy might in part result from antipsychotic treatment. Further studies are clearly needed to substantiate our hypothesis on enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in schizophrenia, whereby the "drug-naïve state" and the possible influence of antipsychotic treatment could be elegantly simulated using animal models of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevention at high concentrations is evidenced by the significant inhibition of mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca and phosphate; in this condition, AGM both prevents the release of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) and enhances the release of other pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO. As these factors are released without MPT induction, the involvement of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) could be hypothesized. Cyclosporin A (CsA), a powerful inhibitor of MPT, enhanced the AGM-mediated inhibition of swelling, and surprisingly, prevented the release of cyt c and Smac/DIABLO. In the presence of Ca, AGM also activated the Bcl-2 family protein Bax, a key factor in inducing MOMP, which is inactivated by CsA. Together with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Bax forms channels in the outer membrane further supporting the involvement of MOMP in the release of pro-apoptotic factors. In view of the fact that VDAC was inactivated by ruthenium red, which in turn inhibited the release of cyt c, it can be hypothesized that, on the one hand, AGM inhibits MPT induction and, on the other, it selectively permeabilizes the outer membrane via MOMP induction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654396>PTEN inhibition attenuates endothelial cell apoptosis in coronary heart disease via modulating the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is a major pathogenic factor in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and endothelial dysfunction (ED) plays a primary role in the occurrence and development of AS. In our study, we attempted to evaluate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in endothelial cell apoptosis under oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) stimulation and identify the associated mechanisms. The results of our study demonstrated that ox-LDL induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) death via mitochondrial apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial potential, increased  permeability transition pore opening, cellular calcium overload, and caspase-9/-3 activation. In addition, ox-LDL also suppressed cellular energy production via downregulating the mitochondrial respiratory complex. Moreover, ox-LDL impaired HUVECs migration. Western blot analysis showed that PTEN expression was upregulated after exposure to ox-LDL and knockdown of PTEN could attenuate ox-LDL-mediated endothelial cell damage. Furthermore, we found that ox-LDL impaired mitophagy activity, whereas PTEN deletion could improve mitophagic flux and this effect relied on the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) axis. When the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2 pathway was inhibited, PTEN deletion-associated HUVECs protection was significantly reduced, suggesting that the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy axis is required for PTEN deletion-mediated endothelial cell survival under ox-LDL. Taken together, our results indicate that ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell damage is associated with PTEN overexpression, and inhibition of PTEN could promote endothelial survival via activating the AMPK-CREB-Mfn2-mitophagy signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h2><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair.

To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic metabolism impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy metabolism and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric acid (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on energy homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. The findings provide novel insights into the impact of this neglected foodborne mycotoxin in the dysregulation of energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

Below toxic levels, hydrogen sulfide promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and function, thereby conferring protection against cellular stress. For these reasons, increases in hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen sulfide-producing enzymes have been implicated in several human disease states. This review will first summarize our current understanding of hydrogen sulfide production and metabolism, as well as its signaling mechanisms; second, this work will detail the known mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide in the  and the implications of its mitochondrial-specific impacts in several pathologic conditions.-Murphy, B., Bhattacharya, R., Mukherjee, P.

In advanced age cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction impairs NVC responses, which contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Recently, we have shown that pharmacological treatments that attenuate mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provide significant neurovascular protection, improving NVC responses in aged mice. Transgenic mice that overexpress human catalase localized to the  (mCAT) are protected from age-related mitochondrial oxidative stress and exhibit a longevity phenotype associated with resistance to several age-related pathologies. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that -targeted overexpression of catalase also confers protection against age-related impairment of NVC responses. To achieve this goal, NVC responses were assessed in aged (24 months old) mCAT mice and compared with those in age-matched wild-type mice and young control mice by measuring CBF responses (laser speckle contrast imaging) evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that mitochondrial overexpression of catalase resulted in improved NVC in aged mice due to preserved NO-mediated (L-NAME inhibitable) component of the response. Thus, our present and previous findings demonstrate that interventions that boost mitochondrial antioxidative defenses confer significant cerebromicrovascular protective effects, which preserve NVC responses in aged mice. Our findings provide additional proof-of-concept for the potential use of -targeted antioxidants as therapy for prevention of vascular cognitive impairment associated with aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644972>Mitochondrial dysfunction is the cause of one of the earliest changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging in Charcot neuroarthopathy - Oedema of the small muscles in the foot.</a></h2><p>The hypothesis laid out in this thesis states that the early changes seen on an MR imaging in those with early Charcot neuroarthopathy may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction. In a Charcot foot, there is movement between bones. In an attempt to prevent this movement, the small muscles of the foot contract continuously when the foot is weight bearing. This contraction takes energy in the form of ATP. However, the reduction of glucose transport into the muscle cells due to insulin resistance / insufficiency, leads to reduction in the ATP producing capacity of the . The ATP depletion affects the cell membrane gradient leading to mitochondrial and cellular swelling. These early cellular changes could then be picked up with MR imaging as muscle oedema.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive metabolic plasticity, TIC metabolism is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with metabolic features, with some focus on oxidative metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid metabolism. These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their metabolism will require advanced methodologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635379>Cyst Reduction in a Polycystic Kidney Disease  Model Using Smac Mimics.</a></h2><p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited malady affecting 12.5 million people worldwide. Therapeutic options to treat PKD are limited, due in part to lack of precise knowledge of underlying pathological mechanisms. Mimics of the second -derived activator of caspases (Smac) have exhibited activity as antineoplastic agents and reported recently to ameliorate cysts in a murine ADPKD model, possibly by differentially targeting cystic cells and sparing the surrounding tissue. A first-in-kind  PKD model has now been employed to probe further the activity of novel Smac mimics. Substantial reduction of cystic defects was observed in the Malpighian (renal) tubules of treated flies, underscoring mechanistic conservation of the cystic pathways and potential for efficient testing of drug prototypes in this PKD model. Moreover, the observed differential rescue of the anterior and posterior tubules overall, and within their physiologically diverse intermediate and terminal regions implied a nuanced response in distinct tubular regions contingent upon the structure of the Smac mimic. Knowledge gained from studying Smac mimics reveals the capacity for the  model to precisely probe PKD pharmacology highlighting the value for such critical evaluation of factors implicated in renal function and pathology.</p></html>
