Because type 1 diabetic rats also develop impaired baroreflex-mediated NTS activation, we hypothesized that improving glycemic control in OZR would enhance compromised baroreflexes and NTS activation. Fasting blood glucose measured by telemetry was comparable in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) at 12-17 wk. However, with access to food, OZR were chronically hyperglycemic throughout this age range. By 15-17 wk of age, tail samples yielded higher glucose values than those measured by telemetry in OZR but not LZR, consistent with reports of exaggerated stress responses in OZR. Injection of glucose (1g/kg ip) produced larger rises in glucose and areas under the curve in OZR than LZR. Treatment with metformin (300 mg·kg·day) or pioglitazone (5 mg·kg·day) in drinking water for 2-3 wk normalized fed glucose levels in OZR with no effect in LZR. After metformin treatment, area under the curve for blood glucose after glucose injection was reduced in OZR and comparable to LZR. Hyperinsulinemia was slightly reduced by each treatment in OZR, but insulin was still greatly elevated compared with LZR. Neither treatment reduced hypertension in OZR, but both treatments significantly improved the blunted phenylephrine-induced bradycardia and NTS c-Fos expression in OZR with no effect in LZR. These data suggest that restoring glycemic control in OZR enhances baroreflex control of heart rate by improving the response of the NTS to raising arterial pressure, even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283093>Evaluation of Hypoglycaemia with Non-Invasive Sensors in People with Type 1 Diabetes and Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycaemia.</a></h2><p>People with type 1 diabetes and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) are prone to severe hypoglycaemia. Previous attempts to develop non-invasive hypoglycaemia alarm systems have shown promising results, but it is not known if such alarms can detect severe hypoglycaemia in people with IAH. We aimed to explore whether a combination of non-invasive sensors could reliably evaluate hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose (PG) minimum 2.5 mmol/L) in people with IAH. Twenty participants with type 1 diabetes and IAH underwent randomly ordered, single blinded hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic clamps. Sweating, skin temperature, ECG, counterregulatory hormones and symptoms of hypoglycaemia were assessed. Overall, we were not able to detect clamp-induced hypoglycaemia with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for further clinical use. As a post-hoc analysis, we stratified participants according to their ability to identify hypoglycaemic symptoms during hypoglycaemic clamps. Five out of 20 participants could identify such symptoms. These participants had a significantly higher adrenaline response to hypoglycaemia (p < 0.001) and were reliably identified by sensors. Based on our observations, a non-invasive alarm system based on measurement of sweating responses and ECG changes during hypoglycaemia might provide an alert at a plasma glucose concentration around 2.5 mmol/L if an adequate sympatho-adrenal reaction is elicited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359371>N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate  related changes in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p> and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced  characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced . These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825046>Dietary choline and betaine intakes and risk of total and lethal prostate cancer in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.</a></h2><p>Two prior cohort studies suggested that choline, but not betaine intake, is associated with an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Given that evidence remains limited, we evaluated whether intakes of choline and derivative betaine are associated with total and lethal PCa risk and PCa death in men with PCa.We included 6,528 men (24.4% African American) without a cancer diagnosis at baseline (1987-1989) followed through 2012. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire coupled with a nutrient database. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total and lethal PCa risk overall and by race.Choline intake was not associated with total (n = 811) or lethal (n = 95) PCa risk overall or by race. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal (tertile 3 vs 1, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-1.00, p trend = 0.04), but not total PCa risk; patterns for lethal PCa were similar by race. Neither nutrient was associated with PCa death in men with PCa.Choline intake was not associated with total or lethal PCa or with PCa death in men with PCa. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal, but not total PCa risk or with PCa death in men with PCa. Our results do not support the hypothesis that higher choline intake increases lethal PCa risk, but do suggest that higher betaine intake may be associated with lower lethal PCa risk. Further investigation with a larger number of lethal cases is needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30414175></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30504766>Adipocyte OGT governs diet-induced hyperphagia and .</a></h2><p>Palatable foods (fat and sweet) induce hyperphagia, and facilitate the development of . Whether and how overnutrition increases appetite through the adipose-to-brain axis is unclear. O-linked beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) couples nutrient cues to O-GlcNAcylation of intracellular proteins at serine/threonine residues. Chronic dysregulation of O-GlcNAc signaling contributes to metabolic diseases. Here we show that adipocyte OGT is essential for high fat diet-induced hyperphagia, but is dispensable for baseline food intake. Adipocyte OGT stimulates hyperphagia by transcriptional activation of de novo lipid desaturation and accumulation of N-arachidonyl  (AEA), an endogenous appetite-inducing cannabinoid (CB). Pharmacological manipulation of peripheral CB1 signaling regulates hyperphagia in an adipocyte OGT-dependent manner.

Despite its worldwide prevalence, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of NASH. The progression of NASH is mainly accelerated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipotoxicity. The transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is pivotal for the elimination of ROS. Accordingly, activators of Nrf2 have been implicated as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of NASH. Niclosamide ( salt; NEN), a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), is currently used as an anthelmintic drug for the treatment of parasitic infections. Recently, NEN was shown to improve hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. However, the underlying mechanism of its antioxidant function in NASH remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NEN induces AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of p62 at S351 that can lead to noncanonical Nrf2 activation. We also demonstrate that NEN protects cells and mouse liver from acute lipotoxic stress through activating p62-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Taken together, NEN can be used for clinical applications and has the potential to provide a new therapeutic option for NASH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we hypothesized that a combination of luteolin and l-theanine would synergistically act to improve memory function and glucose disturbances in rats infused with amyloid-β, and the mechanisms underlying these actions were investigated. Rats that received an amyloid-β(25-35) infusion into the CA1 region of the hippocampus were fed dextrin (AD-CON), 0.1% luteolin (AD-Lut), 0.2% l-theanine (AD-Thea), or both 0.05% luteolin and 0.1% l-theanine (AD-LuTh) in conjunction with a high-fat diet over 8 weeks. AD-LuTh improved memory function, as determined by water maze and passive avoidance tests, by potentiating the hippocampal insulin signaling and reducing inflammation: Luteolin mainly potentiated insulin signaling via the pAkt➔pGSK➔pTau pathway, and l-theanine primarily reduced tumor necrosis factor-α. In the metabolomics analysis of the hippocampus lysates, the concentration of proline, phenylpyruvic acid, and normetanephrine decreased in the AD-LuTh compared to AD-CON. Norepinephrine contents were lower in the AD-CON than non-AD rats with a high fat diet with 0.2% dextrin, whereas AD-Thea and AD-LuTh inhibited the decrease. Both the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh increased glucose infusion rates and decreased hepatic glucose output under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions, indicating improved whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Disturbances in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamp were most effectively corrected by the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh treatments. In conclusion, the hypothesis of the study was accepted. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine prevented Alzheimer disease-like symptom, possibly by improving hippocampal insulin signaling, norepinephrine metabolisms, and decreasing neuroinflammation. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine may be a useful therapeutic option for preventing and/or delaying the progression of memory dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The obtained 1:1 stoichiometry was further confirmed by two spectrometric methods, UV-Vis study and spectrofluorimetry. Significant shifts in IR stretching frequency also support the inclusion process. Relative stabilities of the inclusion complexes were established by the association constants obtained from UV-Vis spectroscopic measurements, program based mathematical calculation of conductivity data. Calculations of the thermodynamic parameters dictates thermodynamic feasibility of the inclusion process. Spectrofluorometric measurement scaffolds the UV-Vis spectroscopic measurement validating stability of the ICs once again. Mass spectroscopic measurement gives the molecular ion peaks corresponding to the inclusion complex of 1:1 molar ratio of host and guest molecules. The mechanism of inclusion was drawn by H-NMR and 2D ROESY spectroscopic analysis. Surface texture of the inclusion complexes was studied by SEM. Finally, the cytotoxic activities of the inclusion complexes were analyzed and found, Cell viability also balances for non-toxic behavior of the ICs.

In addition to the classical "Two-hit" theory, NAFLD has been recognized as a typical gut microbiota-related disease because of the intricate role of gut microbiota in maintaining human health and disease formation. Moreover, gut microbiota is even regarded as a "metabolic organ" that play complementary roles to that of liver in many aspects. The mechanisms underlying gut microbiota-mediated development of NAFLD include modulation of host energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and bile acid and choline metabolism. As a result, gut microbiota have been emerging as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD by manipulating it in various ways, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and herbal components.

OEA, SEA, and PEA are present in human milk, and we hypothesized that the content of OEA, SEA, and PEA in mother's milk differed for infants being heavy (high weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ)) or light (low WAZ) at time of milk sample collection. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentration of OEA, SEA, and PEA in milk samples collected four months postpartum from mothers to high ( = 50) or low ( = 50) WAZ infants. Associations between OEA, SEA, and PEA concentration and infant anthropometry at four months of age as well as growth from birth were investigated using linear and logistic regression analyses, adjusted for birth weight, early infant formula supplementation, and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index. Mean OEA, SEA, and PEA concentrations were lower in the high compared to the low WAZ group (all  < 0.02), and a higher concentration of SEA was associated with lower anthropometric measures, e.g., triceps skinfold thickness (mm) (β = -2.235, 95% CI = -4.04, -0.43,  = 0.016), and weight gain per day since birth (g) (β = -8.169, 95% CI = -15.26, -1.08,  = 0.024).

Dysregulation of these systems contributes to stress-related diseases such as human , but their interrelation remains unclear. The study was aimed to test for the first time in vivo whether central noradrenergic activity quantitatively indexed by the availability of the presynaptic NA transporter (NAT) is associated with HPA axis responsiveness as measured with the combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin releasing hormone stimulation (dex/CRH) test and copeptin as a surrogate marker of the serum AVP tone in highly obese, otherwise, healthy individuals compared to age- and sex-matched non-obese, healthy controls. In order to assess central NAT availability, positron emission tomography (PET) was applied using the NAT-selective radiotracer S,S-[C]O-methylreboxetine (MRB) and correlated with curve indicators derived from the dex/CRH test (maximum, MAX, and area under the curve, AUC, for cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) as well as with copeptin. In non-obese controls, positive correlations were found between the NAT distribution volume ratios (DVR) of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala with the HPA response (OFC: ACTH r = 0.87, p = .001; cortisol r = 0.86, p = .002; amygdala: ACTH r = 0.86, p = .002; cortisol r = 0.79, p = .006), while in , the hypothalamic DVR correlated inversely with the HPA axis response (cortisol, r = -0.66, p = .04) and with copeptin (r = -0.71, p = .02). This association of central NAT availability with HPA axis responsiveness and copeptin suggests a mechanistic interaction between noradrenergic transmission with HPA axis activity and the serum AVP system that differs between non-obese individuals with prefrontal-limbic involvement and  with a hypothalamic-centered relationship. Whether the latter finding contributes to obesogenic behavior needs to be further explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463916>Hepatocyte Notch activation induces liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Fibrosis is the major determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) but has no approved pharmacotherapy in part because of incomplete understanding of its pathogenic mechanisms. Here, we report that hepatocyte Notch activity tracks with disease severity and treatment response in patients with NASH and is similarly increased in a mouse model of diet-induced NASH and liver fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function mouse models showed attenuated NASH-associated liver fibrosis, demonstrating causality to -induced liver pathology. Conversely, forced activation of hepatocyte Notch induced fibrosis in both chow- and NASH diet-fed mice by increasing Sox9-dependent Osteopontin (Opn) expression and secretion from hepatocytes, which activate resident hepatic stellate cells. In a cross-sectional study, we found that OPN explains the positive correlation between liver Notch activity and fibrosis stage in patients. Further, we developed a Notch inhibitor [ antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO)] that reduced fibrosis in NASH diet-fed mice. In summary, these studies demonstrate the pathological role and therapeutic accessibility of the maladaptive hepatocyte Notch response in NASH-associated liver fibrosis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of β3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and energy expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Collectively, these results demonstrate that transient overexpressed VEGF-A activates the sympathetic nervous system, which hence promotes lipolysis and browning in adipose tissue.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352954>Increased FGF21 in brown adipose tissue of tyrosine hydroxylase heterozygous mice: implications for cold adaptation.</a></h2><p>Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the first step in catecholamines synthesis. We studied the impact of reduced TH in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation. In adult heterozygous ( ) mice, dopamine and noradrenaline (NA) content in BAT decreased after cold exposure. This reduced catecholaminergic response did not impair cold adaptation, because these mice induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and maintained BAT temperature to a similar extent than controls ( ). Possible compensatory mechanisms implicated were studied.  and  expression, key genes in BAT activation, were elevated in  mice at thermoneutrality from day 18.5 of embryonic life. Likewise, plasma FGF21 and liver  mRNA were increased. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process that triggers elevations in FGF21, showed higher phospho-IRE1, phospho-JNK, and CHOP in BAT of  mice at thermoneutrality. Also, increased lipolysis in BAT of cold-exposure  mice was demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and FFA content. Overall, these results indicate that the mild effects of  haploinsufficiency on BAT function are likely due to compensatory mechanisms involving elevations in  and  and through adaptive changes in the lipid profile.Copyright © 2018 Vázquez et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653498>Organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) is a distinct catecholamines clearance route in adipocytes mediating the beiging of white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a particularly appealing target for therapeutics in the treatment of metabolic diseases through norepinephrine (NE)-mediated signaling pathways. Although previous studies report NE clearance mechanisms via SLC6A2 on sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues (ATs), the low catecholamine clearance capacity of SLC6A2 may limit the cleaning efficiency. Here, we report that mouse organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3; Slc22a3) is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes, which differs from other known routes such as adjacent neurons or macrophages. We further show that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes Maoa, Maob, and Comt, providing the molecular basis on NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. Under NE administration, ablation of Oct3 induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared with littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal WAT (ingWAT) in adipose-specific Oct3-deficient mice shows much stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than in littermate controls, and this response involves enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb) pathway activation. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to significantly higher levels to compensate for the loss of ATP production in adipose-specific Oct3 knockout (KO) mice, indicating the fundamental role of glucose metabolism during beiging. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolishes the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient ingWAT, indicating the NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes in Oct3 KO adipocytes. Of note, reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 are also identified to be associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Collectively, our results demonstrate that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30730909>Fat cells gobbling up norepinephrine?</a></h2><p>The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) controls key aspects of adipose tissue (AT) function through the release of norepinephrine (NE) and beta adrenergic signaling.

Song and colleagues show that adipocytes can also clear NE through organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3). This contributes to our understanding of how adrenergic signaling is controlled in AT and also emphasizes the need to develop better methods to assess adrenergic signaling in vivo.</p></html>
