More importantly, the possible cause-effect links between gut flora and PD pathogenesis have been identified using PD animal models. Recent studies have found that probiotics improve the symptoms associated with constipation in PD patients. In addition,    (FMT) was recently shown to provide a protective effect against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in mice. Effective microbial therapy for PD includes probiotics and FMT. Therefore, microbial therapy may be a useful and novel approach for treatment of PD.

Studies of    (FMT) and antibiotics on neonatal pig mainly focused on intestinal development and mucosal immunity, but the information on metabolism is lacking. The objective of this study was to investigate the responses of metabolome and transcriptome in the livers of neonatal piglets that were orally inoculated with maternal  bacteria suspension and amoxicillin (AM) solution. Five litters of Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire neonatal piglets were used as five replicates and nine piglets in each litter were randomly assigned to the control (CO), AM or FMT groups. Neonatal piglets in three groups were fed with 3 mL saline (0.9%), AM solution (6.94 mg/mL) or  bacteria suspension (>10/mL), respectively, on days 1-6. At the age of 7 and 21 days, one piglet from each group in each litter was sacrificed, and the serum and liver were collected for analysis. The RNA sequencing analysis showed that the mRNA expressions of  () () () () and  () were downregulated ( < ) by AM on day 7, and that the mRNA expressions of  () and  were downregulated () by FMT on day 7. GC-MS analysis showed that AM and FMT treatments mainly affected fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism on days 7 and 21. AM and FMT both reduced () the blood levels of triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on day 7. AM reduced ) the blood level of cholesterol on day 21, and FMT reduced the blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-C on day 21. These results indicate that early intervention with FMT or AM can reduce fatty acid oxidative catabolism and amino acid biosynthesis of neonatal piglets, which provides a reference for regulation host metabolism through early intervention in animal production and even human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30807838>Impact of 5 fluorouracil chemotherapy on gut inflammation, functional parameters, and gut .</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence suggests that gut  may influence the response to chemotherapy. We sought to characterize the effects of 5 fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy on colon inflammation and functional measures in colorectal cancer (CRC) and to further determine whether gut  can influence this response. 50 C57BL/6 were randomized into four groups; Control + Vehicle (n = 10), Control + 5FU (n = 10), AOM/DSS + Vehicle (n = 15), and AOM/DSS + 5FU (n = 15). CRC was induced chemically by a single 10 mg/kg injection of azoxymethane (AOM) followed by two cycles (% and 1%) of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Mice were then treated with 3 cycles of vehicle or 5FU (cycle 1: 40 mg/kg, cycle  + 3: 20 mg/kg). Functional tests (grip strength and run-to-fatigue) were performed prior to 5FU treatment (baseline) and at the completion of the second cycle of 5FU. Following the third 5FU cycle, mice were euthanized and the colon was evaluated for expression of inflammatory genes using RT-qPCR and stool samples were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. A second experiment used    from 5FU treated mice to control mice (n = 10-15/group) to determine whether 5FU associated changes in the  could influence functional measures and colon inflammation. 5FU reduced grip strength (p < 0.05) and caused a trending decrease in run-to-fatigue performance in cancer mice (p = 0.06). Select intestinal inflammatory genes were significantly elevated with 5FU treatment and this was further exacerbated with cancer (p < 0.05).  analysis revealed increased dissimilarity and alterations in bacterial taxonomy in 5FU and AOM/DSS-treated mice (p < 0.05).   from 5FU treated mice reduced functional performance (p < 0.05) and altered select colon inflammatory markers (p < 0.05). This study provides evidence of an effect of 5FU on inflammatory responses and functional measures in a mouse model of CRC and suggests that gut microbes may play a role in some, but not all, 5FU related perturbations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this work was to determine the safety, tolerability, and impact on mucosal/stool  and brain function in HE after capsular FMT in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Virginia. Patients with cirrhosis with recurrent HE with MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) <17 on SOC were randomized 1:1 into receiving 15 FMT capsules versus placebo from a single donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Endoscopies with duodenal and sigmoid biopsies, stool analysis, cognition, serum lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and duodenal antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression at baseline were used. Clinical follow-up with SOC maintenance was performed until 5 months. FMT-assigned patients underwent repeat endoscopies 4 weeks postenrollment. Twenty subjects on lactulose/rifaximin were randomized 1:1. MELD score was similar at baseline (9.6 vs. 10.) and study end (10. vs. 10.5). Six patients in the placebo group required hospitalizations compared to 1 in FMT, which was deemed unrelated to FMT. Infection/HE episodes were similar between groups. Baseline microbial diversity was similar in all tissues between groups. Post-FMT, duodenal mucosal diversity (P = 0.01) increased with higher Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae and lower Streptococcaceae and Veillonellaceae. Reduction in Veillonellaceae were noted post-FMT in sigmoid (P = 0.04) and stool (P = 0.05). Duodenal E-cadherin (P = 0.03) and defensin alpha 5 (P = 0.03) increased whereas interleukin-6 (P = 0.02) and serum LBP (P = 0.009) reduced post-FMT. EncephalApp performance improved post-FMT only (P = 0.02). Conclusion: In this phase 1 study, oral FMT capsules are safe and well tolerated in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent HE. FMT was associated with improved duodenal mucosal diversity, dysbiosis, and AMP expression, reduced LBP, and improved EncephalApp performance.

These changes lead to dysbiosis in the  of different parts of the body, resulting in inflammation. The constant immune stimulation resulting in part from dysbiosis is associated with morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Dysbiosis as a dynamic event worsens with decompensation such as with hepatic encephalopathy, infections or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). These microbial patterns could be applied as diagnostic and prognostic measures in cirrhosis in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Current therapies for cirrhosis have differing impacts on gut microbial composition and functionality. Dietary modifications and the oral cavity have emerged as newer targetable factors to modulate the microbiome, which could affect inflammation and, potentially improve outcomes. Additionally,  microbial  is being increasingly studied to provide compositional and functional modulation of the microbiome. Ultimately, a combination of targeted therapies may be needed to provide an optimal gut milieu to improve outcomes in cirrhosis.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile the efficacy of FMT for treating chronic diseases associated with microbial dysbiosis has so far been modest with a much higher variability in patient response. Notably, a number of studies suggest that FMT success is dependent on the microbial diversity and composition of the stool donor, leading to the proposition of the existence of FMT super-donors. The identification and subsequent characterization of super-donor gut microbiomes will inevitably advance our understanding of the microbial component of chronic diseases and allow for more targeted bacteriotherapy approaches in the future. Here, we review the evidence for super-donors in FMT and explore the concept of keystone species as predictors of FMT success. Possible effects of host-genetics and diet on FMT engraftment and maintenance are also considered. Finally, we discuss the potential long-term applicability of FMT for chronic disease and highlight how super-donors could provide the basis for dysbiosis-matched FMTs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30539026>Implications of the Intestinal  in Diagnosing the Progression of Diabetes and the Presence of Cardiovascular Complications.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of diabetes is steadily rising, and once it occurs, it can cause multiple complications with a negative impact on the whole organism. Complications of diabetes may be macrovascular: such as stroke and ischemic heart disease as well as peripheral vascular and microvascular diseases-retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Key factors that cause cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, and decreased vascular response capacity. Microbes can be considered a complex endocrine system capable of ensuring the proper functioning of the body but are also responsible for the development of numerous pathologies (diabetes, coronary syndromes, peripheral arterial disease, neoplasia, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatic steatosis). Changes in the intestinal  may influence the host's sensitivity to insulin, body weight, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Dysbiosis causes activation of proinflammatory mechanisms, metabolic toxicity, and insulin resistance. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a microbial organic compound generated by the large intestine, and its concentration increases in the blood after ingestion of foods rich in L-carnitine and choline, such as red meat, eggs, and fish. The interest for TMAO in cardiometabolic research has recently emerged, given the preclinical evidence that reveals a link between TMAO, diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. Intestinal  can be modulated by changing one's lifestyle but also by antibiotic, probiotic, prebiotic, and  . The purpose of this article is to highlight issues related to the involvement of  and trimethylamine N-oxide in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Better appreciation of the interactions between food intake and intestinal floral-mediated metabolism can provide clinical insights into the definition of individuals with diabetic risk and cardiometabolic disease as well as potential therapeutic targets for reducing the risk of progression of the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30648128>Recurrent Relatively Resistant  Infection in  Immunocompromised Hosts Cleared With Prolonged Antibiotics and   .</a></h2><p>Two immunocompromised patients with relapsing gastrointestinal infection with relatively resistant  were cured with prolonged ertapenem followed by encapsulated  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30627262>Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of    in the Treatment of  Infection in Patients With and Without Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Tertiary Care Center's Experience.</a></h2><p> infection (CDI) carries a large burden on the national public health with its high morbidity and mortality rates. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are generally at higher risk of infection, recurrence and complications. Therefore, the need for more reliable and safe therapy is necessary. Our study aims to evaluate long-term    (FMT) outcomes in the general population compared to patients with IBD.A single center long-term follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of FMT in patients with and without IBD. Prior to FMT data including demographics, prior treatment of CDI and severity of symptoms were gathered via chart review. Post FMT, all patients were surveyed after  days, 30 days and > 1 year to assess clinical and laboratory response. Our study outcomes included primary cure rate (negative CDI testing > 1 year after single FMT), and secondary cure rate (negative CDI testing > 1 year after repeat FMT or after an additional course of antibiotic with or without repeat FMT).Seventy-eight patients with recurrent or refractory CDI and subsequent FMT treatment were included. Mean age was 57 years, and 69% were females and twenty-one (27%) had IBD. Primary cure rate was achieved in 77% of the cases while secondary cure rate reached 100% at the end of the study. IBD patients were younger with an average age of 47 years, and had more complains of abdominal pain (71%), and required escalation of therapy in 50% of patients.FMT was effective in the eradication of CDI in patients with and without IBD, but with no significant symptoms improvement in patients with IBD. Future randomized control studies are needed to examine the long-term progression of IBD and quality of life in patients treated with FMT compared to standard therapy of antibiotics for recurrent CDI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957161>Low Cure Rates in Controlled Trials of    for Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is highly effective for treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in observational studies (>90%), but cure rates in clinical trials are lower. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of FMT for recurrent CDI in open-label studies and clinical trials .A systematic search from January 1978 to March 2017 was performed to include clinical trials of FMT for CDI. We analyzed CDI resolution by calculating weighted pooled rates (WPRs).Thirteen trials were included, comprising 610 patients with CDI treated with single FMT. Overall, 439 patients had clinical cure (WPR, 76.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 66.4%-85.7%). There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 91.35%). Cure rates were lower in randomized trials (139/216 patients; WPR, 67.7%; 95% CI, 54.%-81.3%) than in open-label studies (300/394 patients; WPR, 82.7%; 71.1%-94.3%) (P < .001). Subgroup analysis by FMT delivery modality showed lower cure rates with enema than colonoscopy (WPR, 66.3% vs 87.4%; P < .001) but no difference between colonoscopy and oral delivery (WPR, 87.4% vs 81.4%; P = .17). Lower rates were seen for studies including both recurrent and refractory CDI than for those including only recurrent CDI (WPR, 63.9% vs 79%; P < .001).FMT was associated with lower cure rates in randomized trials than in open-label and in observational studies. Colonoscopy and oral route are more effective than enema for stool delivery. The efficacy also seems to be higher for recurrent than for refractory CDI.© The Author(s) 2018.

Gut microbiome deregulation has been implicated in major conditions such as obesity, type  diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty acid liver disease and cancer, but its precise role in aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we find that two different mouse models of progeria are characterized by intestinal dysbiosis with alterations that include an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and a decrease in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia. Consistent with these findings, we found that human progeria patients also display intestinal dysbiosis and that long-lived humans (that is, centenarians) exhibit a substantial increase in Verrucomicrobia and a reduction in Proteobacteria.    from wild-type mice enhanced healthspan and lifespan in both progeroid mouse models, and  with the verrucomicrobia Akkermansia muciniphila was sufficient to exert beneficial effects. Moreover, metabolomic analysis of ileal content points to the restoration of secondary bile acids as a possible mechanism for the beneficial effects of reestablishing a healthy microbiome.

Although    (FMT) represents an alternative treatment option for infection-related diarrhea, the application of FMT in HSCT patients is greatly restricted for safety reasons. Furthermore, the therapeutic outcomes of FMT as a diarrhea treatment are somewhat related to the choice of the FMT donor. Here, we comprehensively profiled the dynamic changes in the intestinal  after FMT from two donors with different feeding patterns and the same severely diarrheal recipient undergoing HSCT via a 45-day clinical observation. Importantly, no adverse events attributed to FMT were observed. The stool volume and frequency of the patient were reduced when we used  from donor #1 (mixed feeding), but these changes were not observed after FMT from donor # (exclusive breastfeeding).

Items included baseline demographics and FMT knowledge and perception. Investigated motivators and deterrents included economic compensation, screening process, time commitment, and stool donation logistics.

Country of residence, age and occupation were not associated with willingness to donate stool. Factors increasing willingness to donate were: already a blood donor (OR 1.64), male, altruism, economic benefit, knowledge of how FMT can help patients (OR 1.32), and positive attitudes towards FMT (OR 1.39). Factors decreasing willingness to donate were: stool collection unpleasant (OR 0.92), screening process invasive (OR 0.92), higher stool donation frequency, negative social perception of stool, and logistics of collection/transporting .

This study appraises current literature and provides an overview of the effectiveness and limitations of FMT as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS). Five electronic databases and two gray literature sources were searched up to 10 December 2018. All interventional and observational studies that contained information on the relevant population (adult patients with obesity and MS), intervention (receiving allogeneic FMT) and outcomes (metabolic parameters) were eligible. From 1096 unique citations, three randomized placebo-controlled studies (76 patients with obesity and MS, body mass index = 34.8 ± 4.1 kg/m, fasting plasma glucose = 5.8 ± 0.7 mmol/L) were included for review. Studies reported mixed results with regards to improvement in metabolic parameters. Two studies reported improved peripheral insulin sensitivity (rate of glucose disappearance, RD) at 6 weeks in patients receiving donor FMT versus patients receiving the placebo control. In addition, one study observed lower HbA1c levels in FMT patients at 6 weeks. No differences in fasting plasma glucose, hepatic insulin sensitivity, body mass index (BMI), or cholesterol markers were observed between two groups across all included studies.

This review will discuss the emerging role of the gut  in brain development and behavior. Animal studies have clearly demonstrated effects of the gut  on gene expression and neurochemical metabolism impacting behavior and performance. Based on these changes, a modulating role of the gut  has been demonstrated for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and movement including Parkinson's, and importantly for the pediatric population autism. Critical developmental windows that influence early behavioral outcomes have been identified that include both the prenatal environment and early postnatal colonization periods. The clearest data regarding the role of the gut  on neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders is from animal studies; however, human data have begun to emerge, including an association between early colonization patterns and cognition. The importance of understanding the contribution of the gut  to the development and functioning of the nervous system lies in the potential to intervene using novel microbial-based approaches to treating neurologic conditions. While pathways of communication between the gut and brain are well established, the gut microbiome is a new component of this axis. The way in which organisms that live in the gut influence the central nervous system (CNS) and host behavior is likely to be multifactorial in origin. This includes immunologic, endocrine, and metabolic mechanisms, all of which are pathways used for other microbial-host interactions. Germ-free (GF) mice are an important model system for understanding the impact of gut microbes on development and function of the nervous system. Alternative animal model systems have further clarified the role of the gut , including antibiotic treatment,  , and selective gut colonization with specific microbial organisms. Recently, researchers have started to examine the human host as well. This review will examine the components of the CNS potentially influenced by the gut , and the mechanisms mediating these effects. Links between gut microbial colonization patterns and host behavior relevant to a pediatric population will be examined, highlighting important developmental windows in utero or early in development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250122>  : a Future Therapeutic Option for Obesity/Diabetes?</a></h2><p>The aim of this review is to summarize the current data available on the metabolic effects of    (FMT) including obesity and glucose metabolism in humans.Gut  dysbiosis is a frequent characteristic observed in obesity and related metabolic diseases. Pieces of evidence mostly generated in mouse models suggest that rescuing this dysbiosis associates with improved metabolism. In humans, dietary or bariatric surgery interventions are often accompanied by complete or partial restoration of this dysbiosis together with weight reduction and metabolic amelioration. FMT is an interesting option to modify gut  and has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, albeit only used in routine care for Clostridium difficile infection. However, there are only limited data on using FMT in the metabolic context. FMT from lean donors significantly improves insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome. However, there is a wide range of clinical responses. Interestingly in subjects with high microbial gene richness at baseline and when FMT donors that are metabolically compromised are used, no metabolic improvement is seen. Moreover, more studies evaluating the effect of FMT in patients with overt type  diabetes are warranted. Furthermore, interventions (in the receiver prior to FMT) aiming to enhance FMT response also need evaluation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719359>Adhesion Ileus after    in Long-Standing Radiation Colitis.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is a novel strategy for the therapy of dysbiosis-associated disorders via modulation of the gut . Intestinal dysbiosis is associated not only with digestive disorders, but also with a variety of extra-digestive disorders. A worldwide increasing number of FMT can be expected in the future as well as an increase in adverse events. We describe the case of a patient with chronic radiation colitis that developed adhesion ileus  days after FMT. Since these problems never occured before and the short time interval favours a causality, we speculate about FMT-induced alterations in gut motility causing a "trapping" of the small intestine in an adhesion and other mechanisms beyond "pure" coincidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405910>Zinc Deficiency and the Recurrence of  Infection after   : A Retrospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent  infection (CDI). However, in 12% of patients treated with FMT, CDI recurs within one month. Zinc deficiency predicts increased diarrheal frequency in malnourished children, but little is known about its association with FMT outcome. We hypothesized that zinc levels were an independent predictor of CDI recurrence after FMT.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 80 patients (mean age, 66; 59 women) receiving FMT for CDI from 9/2013-9/2016 at a tertiary care center. Zinc levels were measured within 90 days before FMT. The primary outcome was CDI recurrence within 90 days after FMT. We controlled for risk factors for FMT failure using Cox regression. We also analyzed the effect of zinc supplementation in individuals with deficiency.Forty-nine subjects had a normal zinc level, and 31 had a low level (<0.66 g/mL). CDI recurred in 3/49 (6%) patients with normal zinc and 5/31 (16%) patients with low zinc (HR = 11.327, 95% CI = .162-59.336, =0.004). Among low zinc subjects,  of 25 (8%) that received zinc supplements and 3 of 6 (50%) that did not receive zinc supplements had recurrence of CDI (HR = 0.102, 95% CI = 0.015-0.704, =0.021).Zinc deficiency was associated with increased CDI recurrence after FMT. Among zinc-deficient patients, supplementation was associated with reduced recurrence.

At present, all the treatments are mainly targeting symptoms like inflammation. The disease remains regarded as incurable, largely due to lacking of knowledge on its etiology. Our previous studies suggested that impaired inactivation of digestive proteases by deconjugated bilirubin in experimental colitis, thus bacterial β-glucuronidase for catalyzing the reaction, may have played critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD.We first analyzed β-glucuronidase activity in gut tissue and  of mice by a colitis model. Then the effect of β-glucuronidase on experimental colitis was investigated in detail by administration of β-glucuronidase (from E. coli) and  material  to mice with 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days.Mice with colitis showed unchanged activity of β-glucuronidase in colon tissue but decreased activity in . Treatment with bacterial β-glucuronidase at 100 U or above alleviated DSS-induced colitis as demonstrated by the less body weight loss, less disease activity score, increased expression of tight junction proteins and decreased gut permeability, decreases in MPO, TNF-α, IL-1β, TLR-4 and MyD88, and increase in IL-10 and IκBα in gut, restored  β-glucuronidase and gut  along with decreases in  digestive proteases.  of  material from control to colitis mice showed similar effects as treatment with β-glucuronidase.Bacterial β-glucuronidase showed strong inhibition on colitis along with the reduction in  digestive proteases, which may be a crucial diagnostic and therapeutic target for IBD.Copyright © 2019.

The pathogenesis of CD infection (CDI) involves the acquisition of CD with a concurrent disruption of the native gut flora. Antibiotics are a major risk although other contributing factors have also been identified. Clinical management combines discontinuation of the offending antibiotic, initiation of CD-specific antibiotic therapy, probiotic agent use,    (FMT), and surgery as the "last resort" option. The aim of this study is to review short-term clinical results following the implementation of FMT protocol (FMTP) at our community-based university hospital.After obtaining Institutional Review Board and Infection Control Committee approvals, we implemented an institution-wide FMTP for patients diagnosed with CDI. Prospective tracking of all patients receiving FMT between July 1, 2015, and February 1, 2017, was conducted using REDCap™ electronic data capture system. According to the FMTP, indications for FMT included (a) three or more CDI recurrences, (b) two or more hospital admissions with severe CDI, or (c) first episode of complicated CDI (CCDI). Risk factors for initial infection and for treatment failure were assessed. Patients were followed for at least 3 months to monitor for cure/failure, relapse, and side effects. Frozen 250 mL FMT samples were acquired from OpenBiome (Somerville, MA, USA). After 4 h of thawing, the liquid suspension was applied using colonoscopy, beginning with terminal ileum and proceeding distally toward mid-transverse colon. Monitored clinical parameters included disease severity (Hines VA CDI Severity Score or HVCSS), concomitant medications, number of FMT treatments, non-FMT therapies, cure rates, and mortality. Descriptive statistics were utilized to outline the study results.A total of 35 patients (mean age 58.5 years, 69% female) were analyzed, with FMT-attributable primary cure achieved in 30/35 (86%) cases. Within this subgroup, /30 (6.7%) patients recurred and were subsequently cured with long-term oral vancomycin. Among five primary FMT failures (14% total sample), 3 (60%) achieved medical cure with long-term oral vancomycin therapy and  (40%) required colectomy. For the seven patients who either failed FMT or recurred, long-term vancomycin therapy was curative in all but two cases. For patients with severe CDI (HVCSS ≥3), primary and overall cure rates were 6/10 (60%) and 8/10 (80%), respectively. Patients with CCDI ( = 4) had higher HVCSS (4 vs. 3) and a mortality of 25%. Characteristics of patients who failed initial FMT included older age (70 vs. 57 years), female sex (80% vs. 67%), severe CDI (80% vs. 13%), and active opioid use during the initial infection (60% vs. 37%) and at the time of FMT (60% vs. 27%). The most commonly reported side effect of FMT was loose stools.This pilot study supports the efficacy and safety of FMT administration for CDI in the setting of a community-based university hospital. Following FMTP implementation, primary (86%) and overall (94%) nonsurgical cure rates were similar to those reported in other studies. The potential role of opioids as a modulator of CDI warrants further clinical investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925252>Potential Role of the Gut Microbiome in ALS: A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Recent data suggest that dysbiosis of gut  may contribute to ALS etiology and progression. This review aims to explore evidence of associations between gut  and ALS etiology and pathophysiology. Databases were searched for publications relevant to the gut microbiome in ALS. Three publications provided primary evidence of changes in microbiome profiles in ALS. An ALS mouse model revealed damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability in the intestine versus controls along with a shifted microbiome profile, including decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. In a subsequent publication, again using an ALS mouse model, researchers showed that dietary supplementation with butyrate relieved symptoms and lengthened both time to onset of weight loss and survival time. In a small study of ALS patients and healthy controls, investigators also found decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. Essential for maintaining gut barrier integrity, butyrate is the preferred energy source of intestinal epithelial cells. Ten other articles were reviews and commentaries providing indirect support for a role of gut  in ALS pathophysiology. Thus, these studies provide a modicum of evidence implicating gut  in ALS disease, although more research is needed to confirm the connection and determine pathophysiologic mechanisms. Nurses caring for these patients need to understand the gut microbiome and its potential role in ALS in order to effectively counsel patients and their families about emerging therapies (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, and  microbial ) and their off-label uses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434991>Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of gut  impairs corneal development in postnatal mice by affecting CCR2 negative macrophage distribution.</a></h2><p>Antibiotics are extremely useful, but they can cause adverse impacts on host bodies.

The reconstitution of the gut  with   in antibiotic-treated mice largely reversed these impairments in corneal development. Furthermore, C-C chemokine receptor type  negative (CCR2) macrophages were confirmed to participate in corneal development, and their distribution in the cornea was regulated by the gut .

In addition, probiotics were shown to have the potential effect of restoring corneal development in antibiotic-treated mice.

It is uncertain if anti-CDI prophylaxis or probiotics would reduce risk. We therefore aimed to compare the risk of CDI with and without antibiotic exposure and the benefit of concomitant anti-CDI antibiotic or probiotic prophylaxis.This is a multicenter retrospective study carried out at three large FMT referral centers of patients who underwent FMT for recurrent CDI. Patients were assessed for antibiotic use, as well as concomitant use of prophylactic anti-CDI antibiotics or probiotics. Time to CDI recurrence after FMT was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.A total of 404 patients were included: 63% were females, with a mean age of 61.3 ± 18.8 years. Mean length of post-FMT follow-up was 18.1 ± 11.9 months (range .-45.). Among the entire cohort 8.1% (n = 33) experienced a CDI recurrence. Overall, 111 patients (27.4%) used a non-CDI antibiotic, of which 16.% (n = 18) experienced a CDI recurrence. Patients who used non-CDI antibiotics were more likely to develop CDI (HR 8.44, 95% CI 4.21-16.93, p < 0.001). The risk of CDI recurrence was not different between patients who received anti-CDI antibiotic prophylaxis to those who did not (HR = 1.88, 95% CI 0.72-4.86, p = 0.); however, probiotic prophylaxis was associated with a greater risk of CDI recurrence (HR = .65, 95% CI 1.02-6.86, p = 0.045).Non-CDI antibiotic use was not uncommon after successful FMT and significantly increased the risk of a new episode of CDI.

This study investigated the effects of maternal faecal  orally administered to neonatal piglets after birth on growth performance, selected microbial populations, intestinal permeability and the development of intestinal mucosal immune system. In total, 12 litters of crossbred newborn piglets were selected in this study. Litter size was standardised to 10 piglets. On day 1, 10 piglets in each litter were randomly allotted to the faecal   (FMT) and control groups. Piglets in the FMT group were orally administrated with 2ml faecal suspension of their nursing sow per day from the age of 1 to 3 days; piglets in the control group were treated with the same dose of a placebo (0.1M potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol (vol/vol)) inoculant. The experiment lasted 21 days. On days 7, 14 and 21, plasma and faecal samples were collected for the analysis of growth-related hormones and cytokines in plasma and lipocalin-, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), selected  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in faeces. Faecal   increased the average daily gain of piglets during week 3 and the whole experiment period. Compared with the control group, the FMT group had increased concentrations of plasma growth hormone and IGF-1 on days 14 and 21. Faecal   also reduced the incidence of diarrhoea during weeks 1 and 3 and plasma concentrations of zonulin, endotoxin and diamine oxidase activities in piglets on days 7 and 14. The populations of Lactobacillus spp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the concentrations of faecal and plasma acetate, butyrate and total SCFAs in FMT group were higher than those in the control group on day 21. Moreover, the FMT piglets have higher concentrations of plasma transforming growth factor-β and immunoglobulin G, and faecal sIgA than the control piglets on day 21. These findings indicate that early intervention with maternal faecal  improves growth performance, decreases intestinal permeability, stimulates sIgA secretion, and modulates gut  composition and metabolism in suckling piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580506>   from Healthy Donors Reduced Alcohol-induced Anxiety and Depression in an Animal Model of Chronic Alcohol Exposure.</a></h2><p>Alcohol addiction can cause brain dysfunction and threatens both individuals and society.

Although the two-week FMT starting at the end of alcohol treatment had few effects, the  started at 8% ethanol exposure alleviated alcohol-induced depression in tail suspension test. More importantly, accompanied by three-week exposure, the five-week FMT significantly decreased anxiety-like behaviors in open field test and depression in tail suspension test.

Environmental hazards are also thought to be associated with genetic susceptibility factors that increase AD pathogenesis. However, there is limited experimental evidence regarding the link between chronic noise stress and microbiome-gut-brain axis alterations, which may be closely related to AD development.The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the effects of chronic noise exposure on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain. We established SAMP8 mouse models to examine the consequences of noise exposure on the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Hippocampal amyloid-β (Aβ) assessment and the Morris water maze were used to evaluate AD-like changes, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing analyses were used for intestinal flora measurements, and assessment of endothelial tight junctions and serum neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator levels, as well as   , was conducted to explore the underlying pathological mechanisms.Chronic noise exposure led to cognitive impairment and Aβ accumulation in young SAMP8 mice, similar to that observed in aging SAMP8 mice. Noise exposure was also associated with decreased gut  diversity and compositional alterations. Axis-series studies showed that endothelial tight junction proteins were decreased in both the intestine and brain, whereas serum neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator levels were elevated in young SAMP8 mice exposed to chronic noise, similar to the observations made in the aging group. The importance of intestinal bacteria in noise exposure-induced epithelial integrity impairment and Aβ accumulation was further confirmed through   experiments. Moreover, the effects of chronic noise were generally intensity-dependent.Chronic noise exposure altered the gut , accelerated age-related neurochemical and inflammatory dysregulation, and facilitated AD-like changes in the brain of SAMP8 mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657333>[   regulates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in cerebral cortex of septic rats through intestinal ].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of    on septic gut flora and the cortex cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in rats.Sixty clean grade male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into normal saline (NS) control group, sepsis model group and    group by random number table, with 20 rats in each group.

The brain function was evaluated by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the proportion of each waveform in EEG was calculated. After sacrifice of rats, the brain tissues were harvested, the levels of protein expression of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) were determined by Western Blot, and positive cells of Iba-1 in brain tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry method. The levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Seven days after the reproduction of the model, all rats in the NS control group survived, while 10 rats and 8 rats died in the sepsis model group and    group, respectively, with mortality rates of 50% and 40% respectively.

Our center first performed FMT to treat a 13-month-old boy with severe CDI in 2013. Until February 2018, our center had performed 114 pediatric FMT procedures in 49 subjects.To investigate the safety of FMT in children.A retrospective study was conducted on 49 patients who underwent 114 FMT treatments at our hospital. All FMT processes followed uniform standards. Adverse events (AEs) related to FMT were divided into short-term (48 h post-FMT) and long-term (3 mo). All potential influencing factors for AEs, such as gender, age, time of FMT infusion, route of administration, disease type, immune function state, and donor relative genetic background, were analyzed as independent factors. The significant independent factors and risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Forty-nine patients (mean age 68.1 mo, range 4 to 193 mo) were recruited. Their average follow-up time after the first FMT was 23.1 mo. The incidence of short-term AEs was 26.32% (30/114). The most common short-term AEs were abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting, which were all self-limited and symptom-free within 48 h. Two severe AEs occurred, and one patient died in the fourth week after FMT. All-cause mortality was .04%. As independent factors, age ( = 0.006) and immune state ( = 0.002) had significant effects. Age greater than 72 mo seemed to be correlated with more AEs than age 13 to 36 mo ( = 0.04).

In our present study, we determined whether an alteration in GM is a decisive factor in anxiety-like and depression-like behavior and its impact on brain neurochemistry. An antibiotic cocktail was used to deplete the GM of mice before they were colonized, via    (FMT), by the GM of control mice or mice that had been exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS donors). The CUMS-donor group of mice and the mice that were colonized by their  (the CUMS-recipient group) both showed higher levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to the controls. The GM community of the CUMS-donor and CUMS-recipient was distinctively different from the controls, with the CUMS group characterized by a lower relative abundance of  and a higher relative abundance of . Interestingly, FMT affected both behavior and neuroinflammation. Mice given the CUMS  had significant elevations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampus, which were accompanied by upregulated indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that GM modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus through dysfunctional -gut-brain axis, exacerbating anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes. Key Points Chronic unpredictable mild stress increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in mice. Mice colonized with gut  (GM) from stressed mice showed similar behaviors. The GM composition of the donor and recipient mice was also comparable. Their relative pattern of two bacteria has been tied to neuroinflammatory activity. The results suggest a link between GM, brain function, and anxiety and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361890>   for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy and safety of    (FMT) for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) are reviewed, and practical issues for pharmacists to consider are discussed.Eight randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of FMT for recurrent CDI were analyzed. The trials varied in the type of sample (fresh, frozen, lyophilized), route of administration (nasogastric tube, colonoscopy, enema, oral), and comparator agent (different type of FMT, vancomycin). Efficacy rates ranged from 43.8% to 96.% with FMT, and safety data were relatively similar. With these favorable data, pharmacists are likely to be involved at multiple steps in the delivery of FMT to patients with recurrent CDI, including the procurement, documentation, and administration of various products and patient education.FMT is an option for recurrent CDI that is supported by findings of randomized controlled trials, although a preferred method for the delivery remains to be defined.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of 3-IS.At a RAC cutoff of <30%, the binary logarithm of 3-IS (medium 3-IS: ≤.5; high 3-IS: >.5) was predictive with an accuracy of 82% (negative predictive value: 87%, positive predictive value 67%). Accuracy was improved by combing antibiotic history with 3-IS levels (accuracy 89%, npv 88%, ppv 92%).In conjunction with patient antibiotic history, 3-IS is a candidate marker to predict RAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29703851>Efficacy and safety of faecal   in patients with psoriatic arthritis: protocol for a 6-month, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.</a></h2><p>An unbalanced intestinal  may mediate activation of the inflammatory pathways seen in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). A randomised, placebo-controlled trial of faecal   (FMT) infused into the small intestine of patients with PsA with active peripheral disease who are non-responsive to methotrexate (MTX) treatment will be conducted. The objective is to explore clinical aspects associated with FMT performed in patients with PsA.This trial is a randomised, two-centre stratified, double-blind (patient, care provider and outcome assessor), placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Eighty patients will be included and randomised (1:1) to either placebo (saline) or FMT provided from an anonymous healthy donor. Throughout the study, both groups will continue the weekly self-administered subcutaneous MTX treatment, remaining on the preinclusion dosage (15-25 mg/week). The clinical measures of psoriasis and PsA disease activity used include the Short (-page) Health Assessment Questionnaire, the Dermatology Quality of Life Index, the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Enthesitis Index, the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, a dactylitis digit count, a swollen/tender joint count (66/68), plasma C reactive protein as well as visual analogue scales for pain, fatigue and patient and physician global assessments. The primary end point is the proportion of patients who experience treatment failure during the 6-month trial period. The number of adverse events will be registered throughout the study.This is a proof-of-concept clinical trial and will be performed in agreement with Good Clinical Practice standards. Approvals have been obtained from the local Ethics Committee (DK-S-20150080) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (15/41684). The study has commenced in May 2017.

Pediatrics accounts for a small percentage of worldwide infection; however, screening and diagnosis are confounded by asymptomatic colonization in young infants. Metronidazole and oral vancomycin have historically been the agents used to manage CDI in both pediatrics and adults. Newer agents and alternative therapies, such as   , may offer additional benefit. Recent guidelines updates from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America separate pediatric and adult recommendations for epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This review will discuss the risk factors, management, prevention, and updated guideline recommendations for CDI in the pediatric population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468999>Efficacy and safety of    for decolonization of intestinal multidrug-resistant microorganism carriage: beyond  infection.</a></h2><p>Persistent reservoirs of multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO) that are prevalent in hospital settings and communities can lead to the spread of MDRO. Currently, there are no effective decolonization strategies, especially non-pharmacological strategies without antibiotic regimens. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of    (FMT) for the eradication of MDRO. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on the use of FMT for the decolonization of MDRO. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception through January 2019. Of the 1395 articles identified, 20 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, the efficacy of FMT for the eradication of each MDRO was 70.3% (102/146) in 121 patients from the 20 articles. The efficacy rates were 68.% (30/44) for gram-positive bacteria and 70.6% (72/102) for gram-negative bacteria. Minor adverse events, including vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and ileus, were reported in patients who received FMT. FMT could be a promising strategy to eradicate MDRO in patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish a comprehensive FMT protocol for standardized treatment. Key messages The development of new antibiotics lags behind the emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO). New strategies are needed. Theoretically,    (FMT) might recover the diversity and function of commensal  from dysbiosis in MDRO carriers and help restore colonization resistance to pathogens.

Over the last  decades evidence has emerged to suggest that inflammation-derived oxidative damage and cytokine induced toxicity may play a significant role in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell infiltration has been observed in the brain parenchyma of patients with PD. Furthermore, evidence for inflammatory changes has been reported in the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve branches and glial cells. The presence of α-synuclein deposits in the post-mortem brain biopsy in patients with PD has further substantiated the role of inflammation in PD. It has been suggested that the α-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread "prion like" via the vagus nerve into lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain; this is known as the Braak hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, dysphagia, and hypersalivation), altered gut  and leaky gut have been observed in PD patients several years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. These clinical observations have been supported by in vitro studies in mice as well, demonstrating the role of genetic (α-synuclein overexpression) and environmental (gut dysbiosis) factors in the pathogenesis of PD. The restoration of the gut microbiome in patients with PD may alter the clinical progression of PD and this alteration can be accomplished by carefully designed studies using customized probiotics and   .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576642>AGA Technical Review on the Management of Mild-to-Moderate Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h2><p>Most patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have mild-to-moderate disease activity, with low risk of colectomy, and are managed by primary care physicians or gastroenterologists. Optimal management of these patients decreases the risk of relapse and proximal disease extension, and may prevent disease progression, complications, and need for immunosuppressive therapy. With several medications (eg, sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded 5-aminosalicylates [ASA], mesalamines, and corticosteroids, including budesonide) and complex dosing formulations, regimens, and routes, to treat a disease with variable anatomic extent, there is considerable practice variability in the management of patients with mild-moderate UC. Hence, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform clinical guidelines, this technical review was developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework for interventional studies. Focused questions included the following: (1) comparative effectiveness and tolerability of different oral 5-ASA therapies (sulfalsalazine vs diazo-bonded 5-ASAs vs mesalamine; low- (< g) vs standard (-3 g/d) vs high-dose (>3 g/d) mesalamine); () comparison of different dosing regimens (once-daily vs multiple times per day dosing) and routes (oral vs rectal vs both oral and rectal); (3) role of oral budesonide in patients mild-moderate UC; (4) comparative effectiveness and tolerability of rectal 5-ASA and corticosteroid formulations in patients with distal colitis; and (5) role of alternative therapies like probiotics, curcumin, and    in the management of mild-moderate UC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Restricting energy intake, or caloric restriction (CR), can reduce body weight and improve metabolic parameters in overweight or obese patients. We previously found that Lingguizhugan decoction (LZD) in combination with CR can effectively lower plasma lipid levels in patients with metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanism underlying CR and LZD treatment is still unclear.To investigate whether CR and LZD improve metabolic parameters by modulating gut .We extracted the water-soluble components out of raw materials and dried as LZD extracts. Eight-week old male C57BL/6 mice were treated with a 3-d treatment regime that included 24 h-fasting followed by gavage of LZD extracts for  consecutive days, followed by a normal diet (ND)  for 16 wk. To test the effects of gut  on diet-induced obesity, 8-wk old male C57BL/6 mice received    (FMT) from CR and LZD-treated mice every 3 d and were fed with high-fat diet (HFD)  for 16 wk. Control mice received either saline gavage or FMT from ND-fed mice receiving saline gavage as mentioned above. Body weight was monitored bi-weekly. Food consumption of each cage hosting five mice was recorded weekly. To monitor blood glucose, total cholesterol, and total triglycerides, blood samples were collected  submandibular bleeding after 6 h fasting. Oxygen consumption rate was monitored with metabolic cages.  were collected, and  DNA was extracted. Profiles of gut  were mapped by metagenomic sequencing.We found that CR and LZD treatment significantly reduced the body weight of mice fed with ND (28.71 ± 0.29  28.05 ± 0.15,  < 0.05), but did not affect plasma total cholesterol or total triglyceride levels. We then transplanted the   collected from CR and LZD-treated mice under ND feeding to HFD-fed mice. Intriguingly, transplanting the mice with   from CR and LZD-treated mice potently reduced body weight (44.95 ± 1.02  40.53 ± 0.97,  < 0.001). FMT also reduced HFD-induced hepatosteatosis, in addition to improved glycemic control. Mechanistic studies found that FMT increased OCR of the mice and suppressed the expression and protein abundance of lipogenic genes in the liver. Metagenomic analysis revealed that HFD drastically altered the profile of gut , and FMT modified the profile of the gut .Our study suggests that CR and LZD improve metabolic parameters by modulating gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29712976>Impact of HIV and Type  diabetes on Gut  Diversity, Tryptophan Catabolism and Endothelial Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>HIV infection and type  diabetes are associated with altered gut , chronic inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. We aimed to investigate the combined effect of these diseases on gut  composition and related metabolites, and a potential relation to endothelial dysfunction in individuals with HIV-infection only (n = 23), diabetes only (n = 16) or both conditions (n = 21), as well as controls (n = 24).   was analyzed by Illumina sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. Markers of endothelial dysfunction (asymmetric dimethylarginine [ADMA]), tryptophan catabolism (kynurenine/tryptophan [KT]-ratio), and inflammation (neopterin) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The combination of HIV and type  diabetes was associated with reduced gut  diversity, increased plasma KT-ratio and neopterin. Microbial genes related to tryptophan metabolism correlated with KT-ratio and low alpha diversity, in particular in HIV-infected with T2D. In multivariate analyses, KT-ratio associated with ADMA (β = 4.58 [95% CI .53-6.63], p < 0.001), whereas  composition per se was not associated with endothelial dysfunction. Our results indicate that tryptophan catabolism may be related to endothelial dysfunction, with a potentially detrimental interaction between HIV and diabetes.

Uncertainty exists regarding FMT effectiveness for CDI with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and regarding its effects on disease activity and effectiveness in transferring the donor  to patients with and without IBD.Subjects with and without IBD who underwent FMT for recurrent or severe CDI between 2013 and 2016 at The Mount Sinai Hospital were followed for up to 6 months. The primary outcome was CDI recurrence 6 months after FMT. Secondary outcomes were (1) CDI recurrence  months after FMT; () frequency of IBD flare after FMT; (3)  engraftment after FMT; (and 4) predictors of CDI recurrence.One hundred thirty-four patients, 46 with IBD, were treated with FMT. Follow-up was available in 83 and 118 patients at 6 and  months, respectively. There was no difference in recurrence in patients with and without IBD at 6 months (38.7% vs 36.5%; P > 0.99) and  months (22.5% vs 17.9%; P = 0.63). Proton pump inhibitor use, severe CDI, and comorbid conditions were predictors of recurrence. Pre-FMT  was not predictive of CDI recurrence. Subjects with active disease requiring medication escalation had reduced engraftment, with no difference in engraftment based on CDI recurrence or IBD endoscopic severity at FMT.Inflammatory bowel disease did not affect CDI recurrence rates 6 months after FMT. Pre-FMT  was not predictive of recurrence, and microbial engraftment was impacted in those requiring IBD treatment escalation, though not by CDI recurrence or IBD disease severity.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

TMAO is generated enzymatically in the liver by the oxidation of trimethylamine (TMA), which is produced from dietary choline, carnitine and betaine by gut bacteria. It is known that certain members of methanogenic archaea (MA) could use methylated amines such as trimethylamine as growth substrates in culture. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of gut colonization with MA on lowering plasma TMAO concentrations. Initially, we screened for the colonization potential and TMAO lowering efficacy of five MA species in C57BL/6 mice fed with high choline/TMA supplemented diet, and found out that all five species could colonize and lover plasma TMAO levels, although with different efficacies. The top performing MA, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosarcina mazei, and Methanomicrococcus blatticola, were transplanted into Apoe mice fed with high choline/TMA supplemented diet. Similar to C57BL/6 mice, following initial provision of the MA, there was progressive attrition of MA within  microbial communities post- during the initial 3 weeks of the study. In general, plasma TMAO concentrations decreased significantly in proportion to the level of MA colonization. In a subsequent experiment, use of antibiotics and repeated  of Apoe mice with M. smithii, led to high engraftment levels during the 9 weeks of the study, resulting in a sustained and significantly lower average plasma TMAO concentrations (18. ± 19.6 μM) compared to that in mock-transplanted control mice (120.8 ± 13.0 μM, p < 0.001). Compared to control Apoe mice, M. smithii-colonized mice also had a 44% decrease in aortic plaque area (8,570 μm [95% CI 19587-151821] vs. 15,369 μm [95% CI [70058-237321], p = 0.34), and 52% reduction in the fat content in the atherosclerotic plaques (14,283 μm [95% CI 4,957-23,608] vs. 29,870 μm [95% CI 18,074-41,666], p = 0.10), although these differences did not reach significance. Gut colonization with M. smithii leads to a significant reduction in plasma TMAO levels, with a tendency for attenuation of atherosclerosis burden in Apoe mice. The anti-atherogenic potential of MA should be further tested in adequately powered experiments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920927>Gut  dysbiosis and diarrhea in kidney  recipients.</a></h2><p>Posttransplant diarrhea is associated with kidney allograft failure and death, but its etiology remains unknown in the majority of cases.

The Shannon diversity index was significantly lower in 28 diarrheal  specimens from 25 recipients with posttransplant diarrhea than in 112  specimens from 46 recipients without posttransplant diarrhea. We found a lower relative abundance of 13 commensal genera (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P ≤ .15) in the diarrheal  specimens including the same 4 genera identified in our prior study. The 28 diarrheal  specimens were also evaluated by a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for 22 bacterial, viral, and protozoan gastrointestinal pathogens, and 26 specimens were negative for infectious etiologies. Using PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) to predict metagenomic functions, we found that diarrheal  specimens had a lower abundance of metabolic genes.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients having on average three or more complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week.The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 50.0%, 38.5% and 32.7% of patients over week intervals 3-4, 9-12 and 21-24, respectively ( < 0.01 for all comparisons). Significant improvements were also observed in other bowel movement assessments, colonic transit time, constipation-related symptoms and quality of life; but all improvements diminished at weeks 12 and 24. Incompleteness of evacuation served as the only factor associated with efficacy. No serious treatment-related adverse events were observed.This study suggested FMT was effective and safe for STC, while a late loss of efficacy was also observed. A lower degree of sensation of incompleteness predicted a better outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218940>Improvement of Good's syndrome by   : the first case report.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29942096>Molecular phenomics and metagenomics of hepatic steatosis in non-diabetic obese women.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis is a multifactorial condition that is often observed in obese patients and is a prelude to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we combine shotgun sequencing of  metagenomes with molecular phenomics (hepatic transcriptome and plasma and urine metabolomes) in two well-characterized cohorts of morbidly obese women recruited to the FLORINASH study. We reveal molecular networks linking the gut microbiome and the host phenome to hepatic steatosis. Patients with steatosis have low microbial gene richness and increased genetic potential for the processing of dietary lipids and endotoxin biosynthesis (notably from Proteobacteria), hepatic inflammation and dysregulation of aromatic and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated that    and chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid, a microbial product of aromatic amino acid metabolism, successfully trigger steatosis and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Molecular phenomic signatures were predictive (area under the curve = 87%) and consistent with the gut microbiome having an effect on the steatosis phenome (>75% shared variation) and, therefore, actionable via microbiome-based therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924853>Effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics in overweight and obese adults: a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized trials.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that modulation of the gut  may contribute to body weight control.This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference in overweight and obese adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2).Five electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library/CENTRAL, LILACS, and Web of Science-were searched from inception to August 2017. No language restrictions were applied.Randomized and quasi-randomized parallel trials that assessed the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics vs any other intervention but bariatric surgery or   in overweight or obese adults were selected.Three teams of  authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. Data were pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.Nineteen randomized trials (28 publications, 1412 participants) were included. There were no differences in mean body weight change [mean difference (MD), -0.54 kg; 95%CI, -1.09 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) or mean BMI change (MD, -0.19 kg/m2; 95%CI, -0.43 to 0.04; I2 = 51%; low quality of evidence) between groups who received probiotics or synbiotics and control groups. Oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced mean waist circumference compared with control (MD, -0.82 cm; 95%CI, -1.43 to -0.21; I2 = 46%; low quality of evidence).The findings suggest that oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics has a small effect to reduce waist circumference but no effect on body weight or BMI, although the quality of evidence is low to moderate. Therefore, the current evidence is not definitive. Large-scale trials are needed and may help to better inform clinical practice.PROSPERO registration number CRD42018075126.© The Author(s) 2019.

This multicenter, retrospective study evaluated FMT safety, effectiveness, and risk factors for failure in SOT patients. Primary cure and overall cure were defined as resolution of diarrhea or negative C difficile stool test after a single FMT or after subsequent FMT(s) ± anti-CDI antibiotics, respectively. Ninety-four SOT patients underwent FMT, 78% for recurrent CDI and 22% for severe or fulminant CDI. FMT-related adverse events (AE) occurred in 22.3% of cases, mainly comprising self-limiting conditions including nausea, abdominal pain, and FMT-related diarrhea. Severe AEs occurred in 3.% of cases, with no FMT-related bacteremia. After FMT, 25% of patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease had worsening disease activity, while 14% of cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients had reactivation. At 3 months, primary cure was 58.7%, while overall cure was 91.3%. Predictors of failing a single FMT included inpatient status, severe and fulminant CDI, presence of pseudomembranous colitis, and use of non-CDI antibiotics at the time of FMT. These data suggest FMT is safe in SOT patients. However, repeated FMT(s) or additional antibiotics may be needed to optimize rates of cure with FMT.© 2018 The American Society of  and the American Society of  Surgeons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29997912>Peroral Low-Dose  Infection of Human -Associated Mice - A Subacute Ileitis Model to Unravel Pathogen-Host Interactions.</a></h2><p>Within 1 week following high-dose  infection, mice develop lethal necrotizing ileitis.

Intestinal inflammation was further characterized by increased apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells, which were accompanied by elevated proliferating gut epithelial cell numbers. As compared to naive controls, infected mice displayed elevated numbers of intestinal T lymphocytes and regulatory T-cells and increased pro-inflammatory mediator secretion. Remarkably,  gondii-induced apoptotic and pro-inflammatory immune responses were not restricted to the gut, but could also be observed in extra-intestinal compartments including kidney, liver, and lung. Strikingly, low-dose  infection resulted in increased serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

Improvement of intestinal inflammation occurs through restoration of the immunological balance between pro-inflammatory T-helper 1 (Th1) responses and both T-helper  (Th2) and regulatory responses. However, detailed mechanisms explaining how P28GST prevents colitis and promotes gut homeostasis remain unknown. Considering the complex interplay between the adaptive and innate immune system and the intestinal , we raised the question of the possible role of the microbial ecosystem in the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the helminth-derived P28GST protein. We first analyzed, by 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacterial profiles of mice   at several time points of the P28GST-immunomodulation period prior to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-colitis. The influence of gut  in the P28GST-mediated anti-inflammatory effects was then assessed by    experiments from P28GST-immunized mice to either conventional or  depleted naïve recipient mice. Finally, the experimental data were supplemented by the temporal   compositions of P28GST-treated Crohn's disease patients from a pilot clinical study (). The P28GST administration slightly modulated the diversity and composition of mouse   while it significantly reduced experimental colitis in mice.    experiments failed to restore the P28GST-induced anti-inflammatory effects. In Crohn's disease patients, P28GST also induced slight changes in their overall  bacterial composition. Collectively, these results provide key elements in both the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and the safe therapeutic use of immunomodulation with such promising helminth-derived molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624757>Hair regrowth following fecal  transplantation in an elderly patient with alopecia areata: A case report and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>Alopecia areata is a hair loss disease associated with genetics, autoimmunity, and other factors. There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × .0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata. Large and well-designed studies are required to confirm the role of FMT in alopecia areata.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

However, there are a paucity of data on long-term durability and safety of FMT. The aim of this study is to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of FMT for RCDI. Ninety-four patients underwent FMT via retention enema for RCDI between 2008 and 2012 and completed a follow-up questionnaire 4 to 8 years following the last FMT. Of these, 32 were unreachable and 37 were deceased; 23 of the remaining 25 participants completed the survey. No CDI recurrences were reported in patients treated with FMT; 12 of the 23 participants (52.%) received at least one course of non-CDI antibiotic(s). Nine participants (40.9%) received probiotics and 4 (17.4%) received both non-CDI antibiotics and probiotics. All 23 participants rated their overall health compared with pre-FMT. Current health was considered "much better" in 17 patients (73.9%); "somewhat better" in 3 patients (13.0%); and "about the same" in 3 patients (13.0%). A total of 11 participants (47.8%) reported an increase in weight of more than 5 kg (kg) post-FMT and 9 participants (39.1%) reported no change in weight (± 5 kg). Four of the 23 participants (17.4%) reported improvement or resolution (undifferentiated colitis, n = 1; Crohn's disease, n = ; ulcerative colitis, n = 1) of pre-existing gastrointestinal condition following FMT. Eight of 23 participants (34.8%) experienced new medical condition(s) post-FMT. The long-term efficacy (48-96 months) of FMT for RCDI appears to be durable even after non-CDI antibiotic use.

Products for MT, such as stool, are likely to be as or more dangerous than more highly manipulated microbial products that scientists and regulators agree should be regulated as biologic drugs.

We hypothesize that pathological shifts in gut  composition (dysbiosis) caused by stress and gut conditions result in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways mediated by the Nod-like receptors family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome (an intracellular platform involved in the activation of inflammatory processes).

In this review we describe MDD/chronic stress-induced changes in: 1) NLRP3 inflammasome; ) gut ; and 3) metabolic pathways; and how inflammasome signaling may affect depressive-like behavior and gut  composition. The implication is that novel therapeutic strategies could emerge for MDD and co-morbid conditions.

FMT protocols involving anaerobic stool processing methods may enhance microbial viability and allow efficacy with a lower treatment intensity.To assess the efficacy of a short duration of FMT therapy to induce remission in UC using anaerobically prepared stool.A total of 73 adults with mild to moderately active UC were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 3 Australian tertiary referral centers between June 2013 and June 2016, with 12-month follow-up until June 2017.Patients were randomized to receive either anaerobically prepared pooled donor FMT (n = 38) or autologous FMT (n = 35) via colonoscopy followed by  enemas over 7 days. Open-label therapy was offered to autologous FMT participants at 8 weeks and they were followed up for 12 months.The primary outcome was steroid-free remission of UC, defined as a total Mayo score of ≤ with an endoscopic Mayo score of 1 or less at week 8. Total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 (0 = no disease and 12 = most severe disease). Steroid-free remission of UC was reassessed at 12 months. Secondary clinical outcomes included adverse events.Among 73 patients who were randomized (mean age, 39 years; women, 33 [45%]), 69 (95%) completed the trial.

Current treatments are limited by the high disease recurrence rate, severity of clinical forms, disruption of the gut , and colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In this review, we resumed current treatment options from official recommendation to promising alternatives available in the management of adult CDI, with regard to severity and recurring or non-recurring character of the infection. Vancomycin remains the first-line antibiotic in the management of mild to severe CDI. The use of metronidazole is discussed following the latest US recommendations that replaced it by fidaxomicin as first-line treatment of an initial episode of non-severe CDI. Fidaxomicin, the most recent antibiotic approved for CDI in adults, has several advantages compared to vancomycin and metronidazole, but its efficacy seems limited in cases of multiple recurrences. Innovative therapies such as    (FMT) and antitoxin antibodies were developed to limit the occurrence of recurrence of CDI.

The lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models to investigate host-microbe interactions is considered a substantial bottleneck for  research. Organoids represent an attractive model system because they are derived from primary tissues and embody key properties of the native gut lumen; however, access to the organoid lumen for experimental perturbation is challenging. Here, we report the development and validation of a high-throughput organoid microinjection system for cargo delivery to the organoid lumen and high-content sampling.A microinjection platform was engineered using off-the-shelf and 3-dimensional printed components. Microinjection needles were modified for vertical trajectories and reproducible injection volumes. Computer vision (CVis) and microfabricated CellRaft Arrays (Cell Microsystems, Research Triangle Park, NC) were used to increase throughput and enable high-content sampling of mock bacterial communities. Modeling preformed using the COMSOL Multiphysics platform predicted a hypoxic luminal environment that was functionally validated by  of -derived microbial communities and monocultures of a nonsporulating anaerobe.CVis identified and logged locations of organoids suitable for injection. Reproducible loads of 0. nL could be microinjected into the organoid lumen at approximately 90 organoids/h. CVis analyzed and confirmed retention of injected cargos in approximately 500 organoids over 18 hours and showed the requirement to normalize for organoid growth for accurate assessment of barrier function. CVis analyzed growth dynamics of a mock community of green fluorescent protein- or Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria, which grew within the organoid lumen even in the presence of antibiotics to control media contamination.

The objective of this proof of concept study was to evaluate safety, efficacy, and donor microbial engraftment of an intensified    (FMT) consisting of a single endoscopic FMT followed by daily oral FMT for  weeks in patients with ADP.We performed a prospective placebo-controlled double-blind FMT trial in patents with established ADP and planned to enroll 20 patients in this proof of concept study. In case of non-response, patients were offered an optional open label active FMT treatment. The endpoints were safety, clinical remission without need for antibiotics during 16 weeks of follow-up, quantitative changes of  calprotectin (FCP), and engraftment of donor FMT as determined by metagenomic sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.Due to a lower than expected clinical remission rate and low FMT engraftment, enrollment in the study was stopped prematurely after 6 patients were included. All 6 patients enrolled in the placebo-controlled portion failed to respond and needed antibiotic rescue therapy shortly after FMT. FCP increased in the majority of patients in the setting of relapse after FMT. In the active open label FMT extension study 1 out of 5 patients achieved antibiotic-free clinical remission. FMT engraftment after active FMT was observed only in this single patient, whereas engraftment of donor FMT occurred in none of the other patients receiving active FMT, paralleling the lack of clinical response.Low donor FMT engraftment resulted in low clinical efficacy of FMT in patients with ADP.

Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial    (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function,  composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement. The need for an in-depth analysis of the donor´s stool and correct selection pre-FMT is evident.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068891>Stroke Dysbiosis Index (SDI) in Gut Microbiome Are Associated With Brain Injury and Prognosis of Stroke.</a></h2><p> Significant dysbiosis occurs in the gut microbiome of stroke patients. Condensing these broad, complex changes into one index would greatly facilitate the clinical usage of gut microbiome data. Here, we formulated a gut  index in patients with acute ischemic stroke based on their gut  dysbiosis patterns and tested whether the index was correlated with brain injury and early outcome.  A total of 104 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 90 healthy individuals were recruited, and their gut microbiotas were compared and to model a Stroke Dysbiosis Index (SDI), which representing stroke-associated dysbiosis patterns overall. Another 83 patients and 70 controls were recruited for validation. The association of SDI with stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score) and outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score: favorable, 0-; unfavorable, >) at discharge was also assessed. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used in human flora-associated (HFA) animals to explore the causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and stroke outcome.  Eighteen genera were significantly different between stroke patients and healthy individuals. The SDI formula was devised based on these microbiome differences; SDI was significantly higher in stroke patients than in healthy controls. SDI alone discriminated stroke patients from controls with AUCs of 74.9% in the training cohort and 84.3% in the validation cohort. SDI was significantly and positively correlated with NIHSS score on admission and mRS score at discharge. Logistic regression analysis showed that SDI was an independent predictor of severe stroke (NIHSS ≥8) and early unfavorable outcome (mRS >). Mice receiving   from high-SDI patients developed severe brain injury with elevated IL-17 γδ T cells in gut compared to mice receiving  from low-SDI patients (all  < 0.05).  We developed an index to measure gut  dysbiosis in stroke patients; this index was significantly correlated with patients' outcome and was causally related to outcome in a mouse model of stroke. Our model facilitates the potential clinical application of gut  data in stroke and adds quantitative evidence linking the gut  to stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154629>Reducing Cost and Complexity of    Using Universal Donors for Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection.</a></h2><p>   resolves recurrent Clostridium difficile infections in greater than 82% of patients.

This was a retrospective comparison of two historical cohorts.A total of 111   transplantations were performed on 105 patients (56 from patient-directed donors and 55 from universal donors). Median recipient age was 66 years (18-96) with male to female ratio of 1:.7, equivalent in both cohorts. Total consultation fees were significantly lower in the universal donor group owing to fewer infectious disease consultations. Costs for donor screening and stool preparation were lower in the universal donor cohort ($485.0 vs. $1189.90 ± 541.4, p < 0.001, 95% CI 559.9-849.9). Time from consultations to infusion was shorter in the universal donor cohort (18.9 ± 19.1 vs. 36.4 ± 23.3 days, p < 0.001, 95% CI 9.521-25.591). Recurrences within 8 weeks after    were equivalent (p = 0.354). Adverse events were equivalent.   using universal donors versus patient-directed donors for recurrent C. difficile showed comparable efficacy and short-term complications. The use of universal donors resulted in significant cost savings and scheduling efficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183502>Bugs in the system: bringing the human microbiome to bear in cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>The influence of the composition of the human microbiome on the efficacy of cancer directed immunotherapies, such as antibodies directed against the programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1), has garnered increasing attention as the role of immunotherapies in the care of cancer has grown. Dysbiosis (altered ) has recently been reported to adversely affect the efficacy of cancer directed immunotherapies, and correction of this dysbiosis has the potential to improve the efficacy of these treatments. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship remains unknown. Current methods for characterizing the microbiome likely capture only a small portion of the highly complex interaction between the microbiome and the immune system. Here we discuss the recent reports of the influence of dysbiosis on cancer immunotherapy, methods to more fully characterize the interaction between the microbiome and the immune system, and methods of modulating the immune system to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221971>IL-33 drives group  innate lymphoid cell-mediated protection during Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) incidence has tripled over the past 15 years and is attributed to the emergence of hypervirulent strains. While it is clear that C. difficile toxins cause damaging colonic inflammation, the immune mechanisms protecting from tissue damage require further investigation. Through a transcriptome analysis, we identify IL-33 as an immune target upregulated in response to hypervirulent C. difficile. We demonstrate that IL-33 prevents C. difficile-associated mortality and epithelial disruption independently of bacterial burden or toxin expression. IL-33 drives colonic group  innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) activation during infection and IL-33 activated ILC2s are sufficient to prevent disease. Furthermore, intestinal IL-33 expression is regulated by the  as    (FMT) rescues antibiotic-associated depletion of IL-33. Lastly, dysregulated IL-33 signaling via the decoy receptor, sST2, predicts C. difficile-associated mortality in human patients. Thus, IL-33 signaling to ILC2s is an important mechanism of defense from C. difficile colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301451>Effects of    With Oral Capsules in Obese Patients.</a></h2><p>Studies in mice have shown that the intestinal  can contribute to obesity via the anorexigenic gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and bile acids, which affect lipid metabolism. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study of the effects of    (FMT) in obese, metabolically uncompromised patients.We performed a double-blind study of 22 obese patients (body mass index [BMI] ≥5 kg/m) without a diagnosis of diabetes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or metabolic syndrome. Participants were assigned randomly (1:1) to groups that received FMT by capsules (induction dose of 30 capsules at week 4 and maintenance dose of 12 capsules at week 8) or placebo capsules. FMT capsules were derived from a single lean donor (BMI, 17.5 kg/m). Patients were followed up through week 26; the primary outcome was safety. Stool and serum samples were collected from patients at baseline and at weeks 1, 4, 6, 8, and 12 after administration of the first dose of FMT or placebo and analyzed by 16S RNA gene sequencing. Stool and serum samples were analyzed for metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additional outcomes were the change in area under the curve for GLP1 at week 12.We observed no significant differences in adverse events between patients who received FMT vs placebo. There was no increase in the area under the curve of GLP1 in either group. Patients who received FMT had sustained shifts in microbiomes associated with obesity toward those of the donor (P < .001). Patients who received FMT had a sustained decrease in stool levels of taurocholic acid (P < .05) compared with baseline; bile acid profiles began to resemble those of the donor more closely. We did not observe significant changes in mean BMI at week 12 in either group.In a placebo-controlled pilot study, we found that FMT capsules (derived from a lean donor) were safe but did not reduce BMI in obese metabolically uncompromised patients. The FMT capsules were well tolerated and led to sustained changes in the intestinal microbiome and bile acid profiles that were similar to those of the lean donor.

We present the design of randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy and compliance of bowel preparation between mid-gut tubing and oral administering for MRE in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).This is an open-label, multicenter RCT. Ninety-six patients with CD in need of MRE examination and mid-gut tubing (prepared for    and/or enteral nutrition), aged ≥ 14 years, will be included. Patients will be randomized 1:1 into either bowel preparation by oral administering (oral group) or bowel preparation through mid-gut transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) (tubing group). The primary outcome measures are: (1) degree of discomfort before/during/after bowel preparation for MRE using a visual 5-grade scale (1 = few, 5 = very severe); and () grade of bowel distention evaluated by a 5-grade scale (1 = 0-20% segmental distention,  = 20-40% distention, 3 = 40-60% distention, 4 = 60-80% distention, 5 = 80-100% distention). The secondary outcome measure is the accuracy of lesion detection through MRE confirmed by colonoscopy which is evaluated by a 5-point scale.The outcome of this study is expected to provide a novel effective clinical protocol of bowel preparation for MRE in patients with CD. We hope to highlight the concept of physician-patient satisfaction based on different methods of bowel preparation for MRE.ClinicalTrials.gov,  .

Dysbiosis, characterized by the alteration of the composition of the resident commensal bacteria in a host compared to healthy individuals, is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), two subtypes of IBD. There is growing interest to correct the underlying dysbiosis through the use of    (FMT) for the treatment of IBD.The objective of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of IBD.We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register databases from inception to 19 March 2018. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index.Only randomized trials or non-randomized studies with a control arm were considered for inclusion. Adults or pediatric participants with UC or CD were eligible for inclusion. Eligible interventions were FMT defined as the administration of  material containing distal gut  from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a someone with UC or CD. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, or no intervention.Two authors independently screened the titles and extracted data from the included studies. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess study bias. The primary outcomes were induction of clinical remission, clinical relapse, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, endoscopic remission and endoscopic response, quality of life scores, laboratory measures of inflammation, withdrawals, and microbiome outcomes. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to synthesize effect sizes across trials. The overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was rated using the GRADE criteria.Four studies with a total of 277 participants were included. These studies assessed the efficacy of FMT for treatment of UC in adults; no eligible trials were found for the treatment of CD. Most participants had mild to moderate UC. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one study was conducted in Canada, and another in the Netherlands. Three of the included studies administered FMT via the rectal route and one study administered FMT via the nasoduodenal route. Three studies were rated as low risk of bias. One study (abstract publication) was rated as unclear risk of bias. Combined results from four studies (277 participants) suggest that FMT increases rates of clinical remission by two-fold in patients with UC compared to controls. At 8 weeks, 37% (52/140) of FMT participants achieved remission compared to 18% (24/137) of control participants (RR .03, 95 % CI, 1.07 to 3.86; I² = 50%; low certainty evidence). One study reported data on relapse at 12 weeks among participants who achieved remission. None of the FMT participants (0/7) relapsed at 12 weeks compared to 20% of control participants (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.98, 17 participants, very low certainty evidence). It is unclear whether there is a difference in serious adverse event rates between the intervention and control groups. Seven per cent (10/140) of FMT participants had a serious adverse event compared to 5% (7/137) of control participants (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.58; 4 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Serious adverse events included worsening of UC necessitating intravenous steroids or surgery; infection such as Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus, small bowel perforation and pneumonia. Adverse events were reported by two studies and the pooled data did not show any difference between the study groups. Seventy-eight per cent (50/64) of FMT participants had an adverse event compared to 75% (49/65) of control participants (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.31; I² = 31%; moderate certainty evidence). Common adverse events included abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, bloating, upper respiratory tract infection, headaches, dizziness, and fever. Four studies reported on clinical response at 8 weeks. Forty-nine per cent (68/140) of FMT participants had a clinical response compared to 28% (38/137) of control participants (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.98 to .95, I² = 50%, low certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission at 8 weeks was reported by three studies and the combined results favored FMT over the control group. Thirty per cent (35/117) of FMT participants achieved endoscopic remission compared to 10% (11/112) of control participants (RR .96, 95 % CI 1.60 to 5.48, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence).   may increase the proportion of participants achieving clinical remission in UC. However, the number of identified studies was small and the quality of evidence was low. There is uncertainty about the rate of serious adverse events. As a result, no solid conclusions can be drawn at this time. Additional high-quality studies are needed to further define the optimal parameters of FMT in terms of route, frequency, volume, preparation, type of donor and the type and disease severity. No studies assessed efficacy of FMT for induction of remission in CD or in pediatric participants. In addition, no studies assessed long-term maintenance of remission in UC or CD. Future studies are needed to address the therapeutic benefit of FMT in CD and the long-term FMT-mediated maintenance of remission in UC or CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221898>   for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: Experience, protocol, and results.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is a highly effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (R-CDI). Despite its excellent efficacy, it is still not a routine procedure in most European centers. FMT has not been widely used in Spain to date. We describe our experience with FMT, including a novel approach based on oral  capsules.We analyzed a prospectively recorded case series of patients with R-CDI treated with FMT at a single center (June 2014-July 2017). Primary outcome was defined as resolution of CDI without recurrence in a two-month period. FMT was administered via colonoscopy, nasojejunal tube, or oral capsules. All stool donors were rigorously screened.FMT was performed in 13 patients with R-CDI. Median age was 75.0 years and 76.9% were females. Six FMT were performed via nasojejunal tube, 5 via oral capsules, and  by colonoscopy. There were no procedure-related adverse events, except for bacteremia in one patient. During follow-up, R- CDI was observed in one patient at one month after FMT. The primary resolution rate was 83.3% and the overall resolution rate was 91.7%. FMT by capsules achieved a 100% resolution rate, colonoscopy 100%, and nasojejunal tube 80.0%.In our cohort, FMT proved to be safe and effective, even in high risk patients. Oral administration in capsules also proved to be safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective for R-CDI. In our experience, the FMT capsule formulation seems feasible in the routine of a hospital. This administration method will allow FMT to be more widely used.©The Author 2018. Published by Sociedad Española de Quimioterapia.

It is well established that psoriasis and IBD have high concordance rates, and similar changes in immune cells and microbiome composition have been reported in both conditions. To study this connection, we used a combination murine model of psoriatic dermatitis and colitis in which mice were treated topically with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) and fed dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).We applied IMQ topically to B6 mice (IMQ mice) and subsequently fed them % DSS in their drinking water. Disease activity and immune cell phenotypes were analyzed, and the microbial composition of  samples was investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We transplanted  from IMQ mice to germ-free IQI/Jic (IQI) mice and fed them DSS to assess the effect of the gut microbiome on disease.We first confirmed that IMQ mice showed accelerated DSS colitis. IMQ mice had decreased numbers of IgD and IgM B cells and increased numbers of non-cytokine-producing macrophages in the gut. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of IMQ mice were perturbed, with significant reductions of  and  populations. Germ-free mice transplanted with  from IMQ mice, but not with  from untreated mice, also developed exacerbated DSS colitis.These results suggest that skin inflammation may contribute to pathogenic conditions in the gut via immunologic and microbiological changes.

Literature related to FMT for the treatment of UC from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane databases, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang Data were searched and screened with update study in May 2018. Two independent investigators extracted information according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Meta-analysis was conducted by Stata 12.0 software.  A total of 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 19 non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) including 536 participants met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed that FMT significantly increased the clinical remission rate (.47, 95 1.40-4.33, 0.02) and clinical response rate (1.86, 95 1.15-3.02, 0.01) in UC patients without increasing the incidence of severe adverse effects (1.40, 95 0.51-3.79, 0.51).

In turn, CDI can increase IBD activity. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and therapy is required. Many diagnostic and treatment studies on patients with CDI without inflammatory bowel disease are not congruent with IBD patients. This overview summarizes the everyday data of recent years and condenses these into four guiding principles. 1) patients with IBD present a risk population for a CDI. A CDI not only worsens the disease activity in the short term, but also causes increased morbidity and mortality in the long term. ) If a CDI is suspected, glutamate-dehydrogenase (GDH) detection should be carried out quickly. If this is positive, and the disease activity is high, a therapy against C. difficile already may be initiated and-if necessary-terminated in cases of negative confirmation tests. 3) IBD patients with a proven CDI should be treated primarily with vancomycin. 4) In a relapsing CDI,  microbiome transfer is an effective therapeutic measure. However, activation of the IBD must be expected in about 15 % of cases. Consistent adherence to these guidelines may help treat a CDI in IBD patients.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620079>FETR-ALS Study Protocol: A Randomized Clinical Trial of Fecal  Transplantation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</a></h2><p> Among the key players in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), microglia and T regulatory lymphocytes (Treg) are candidate cells for modifying the course of the disease. The gut  (GM) acts by shaping immune tolerance and regulating the Treg number and suppressive function, besides circulating neuropeptides, and other immune cells that play in concert through the gut-brain axis. Previous mouse models have shown an altered enteric flora in early stage ALS, pointing to a possible GM role in ALS pathogenesis. Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) is a well-known therapeutic intervention used to re-establish the proper microenvironment and to modulate enteric and systemic immunity.  We are going to perform a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial employing FMT as a therapeutic intervention for ALS patients (). Forty-two ALS patients, at an early stage, will be enrolled with a :1 allocation ratio (28 FMT-treated patients vs. 14 controls). Study duration will be 12 months per patient. Three endoscopic procedures for intestinal biopsies in FMT and control groups are predicted at baseline, month 6 and month 12; at baseline and at month 6 fresh feces from healthy donors will be infused at patients in the intervention arm. The primary outcome is a significant change in Treg number between FMT-treated patients and control arm from baseline to month 6. Secondary outcomes include specific biological aims, involving in-depth analysis of immune cells and inflammatory status changes, central and peripheral biomarkers of ALS, besides comprehensive analysis of the gut, saliva and fecal . Other secondary aims include validated clinical outcomes of ALS (survival, forced vital capacity, and modifications in ALSFRS-R), besides safety and quality of life.  We await FMT to increase Treg number and suppressive functionality, switching the immune system surrounding motorneurons to an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective status. Extensive analysis on immune cell populations, cytokines levels, and  (gut, fecal and saliva) will shed light on early processes possibly leading the degenerative ALS course.  This is the first trial with FMT as a potential intervention to modify immunological response to ALS and disease progression at an early stage.Copyright © 2019 Mandrioli, Amedei, Cammarota, Niccolai, Zucchi, D'Amico, Ricci, Quaranta, Spanu and Masucci.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30969003>Safety and efficacy of    in 9 critically ill patients with severe and complicated Clostridium difficile infection with impending colectomy.</a></h2><p>Significant data support the efficacy and safety of    (FMT) in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are employed to augment cytotoxic anti-cancer activity by inhibiting negative regulatory elements of the immune system. Modulating the immune system to target neoplasms has improved survivability of numerous cancers in many individuals, but forecasting outcomes post therapy is difficult due to insufficient predictive biomarkers. Recently, the tumor and gastrointestinal microbiome and immune milieu have been investigated as predictors and influencers of cancer immune therapy. In this review, we discuss: (1) ways to measure the microbiome including relevant bioinformatic analyses, () recent developments in animal studies and human clinical trials utilizing gut microbial composition and function as biomarkers of cancer immune therapy response and toxicity, and (3) using prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, and    (FMT) to modulate immune therapy. We discuss the respective benefits of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing including important considerations in obtaining samples and in designing and interpreting human and animal microbiome studies. We then focus on studies discussing the differences in response to ICIs in relation to the microbiome and inflammatory mediators. ICIs cause colitis in up to 25% of individuals, and colitis is often refractory to common immunosuppressive medications. Researchers have measured  composition prior to ICI therapy and correlated baseline  composition with efficacy and colitis. Certain bacterial taxa that appear to enhance therapeutic benefit are also implicated in increased susceptibility to colitis, alluding to a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory tumor killing and anti-inflammatory protection from colitis.

To characterize the increasing burden of IBD, we conducted a comprehensive review of IBD in the existing literature. The following parameters were reviewed: background knowledge and current standard care for IBD, including natural history, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. In addition, new imaging modalities and treatment options such as combined positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance enterography, new biologic agents, small-molecule therapy, biosimilar therapeutics, mesenchymal stem cell , and   , all of which have been introduced for IBD management, were reviewed. We also used the hospital-based as well as population-based Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to assess Taiwan-specific trends for comparison with global trends.Copyright © 2018.

This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of different methods of    (FMT), a potential therapy for CD.Patients with CD were randomized to receive FMT by gastroscopy or colonoscopy; a second  was performed 1 week later. Patients were assessed by clinical evaluation and serum testing (at weeks 1, , 4, 6, and 8) and endoscopy (8 weeks after ).  DNA was extracted and analyzed using the Illuminal sequencing platform.Of the 27 patients included in the study, clinical remission was achieved in 18 (66.7%); no significant difference was seen between the two methods. 76.9% of gastroscopy group patients and 64.3% of colonoscopy group patients experienced mild adverse events during or shortly after treatment.  diversity analyses showed that, in comparison with the donors, patients had lower operational taxonomic units (OTU; 117 vs. 258, p < 0.05) and Shannon diversity index (.05 vs. 3.46, p < 0.05). The CD patients showed a significant increase in OTU and Shannon diversity index  weeks after FMT. In comparison with the donors, CD patients had lower levels of Bacteroides, Eubacterium, faecalibacterium, and Roseburia, and higher levels of Clostridium, Cronobacter, Fusobacterium, and Streptococcus.FMT was seen to be safe and effective in this cohort of patients with CD. No significant differences in clinical remission rate and adverse events were seen between the gastroscopy and colonoscopy groups.

We investigated the role of commensal bacteria by comparing CD25KO mice housed in conventional or germ-free conditions. Germ-free CD25KO mice have greater corneal barrier dysfunction, lower goblet cell density, increased total lymphocytic infiltration score, increased expression of IFN-γ, IL-12 and higher a frequency of CD4IFN-γ cells than conventional mice.

The gut microbiome can modulate brain function and behaviors through the -gut-brain axis. Here, we found that unmedicated and medicated patients with SCZ had a decreased microbiome α-diversity index and marked disturbances of gut microbial composition versus healthy controls (HCs). Several unique bacterial taxa (e.g., Veillonellaceae and Lachnospiraceae) were associated with SCZ severity. A specific microbial panel (Aerococcaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Brucellaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Rikenellaceae) enabled discriminating patients with SCZ from HCs with 0.769 area under the curve. Compared to HCs, germ-free mice receiving SCZ microbiome   had lower glutamate and higher glutamine and GABA in the hippocampus and displayed SCZ-relevant behaviors similar to other mouse models of SCZ involving glutamatergic hypofunction. Together, our findings suggest that the SCZ microbiome itself can alter neurochemistry and neurologic function in ways that may be relevant to SCZ pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197631>   Ameliorates Experimentally Induced Colitis in Mice by Upregulating AhR.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease that occurs in the colon and rectum. While    (FMT) is gaining attention as a clinical treatment of UC, the molecular mechanisms behind this effect have yet to be fully understood. A C57BL/6 mouse model was established to test whether FMT promotes the recovery of colon inflammation. Administration of % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days successfully induced acute colitis, as evidenced by diarrhea, hematochezia and colon shortening as well as a decrease in body weight. FMT alleviated the severity of colon mucosa injury and improved histological alterations compared with that of the DSS group. In addition, FMT promoted homeostasis of the intestinal . Furthermore, FMT upregulated the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in colon tissues. These results suggest that the significant anti-inflammatory effect of FMT may be attributed to its promotion of IL-10 and TGF-β production and AHR activation.

However, the clinical use of zinc(II) complexes is hampered by hydrolytic insolubility and poor bioavailability and their anticancer mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-k30)-based solid dispersion of Zn(II)-curcumin (ZnCM-SD) against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays revealed ZnCM-SD not only reduced the viability of HepG2 cells and SK-HEP1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but also potently and synergistically enhanced cell growth inhibition and cell death in response to doxorubicin by regulating cellular zinc homeostasis. ZnCM-SD was internalized into the cells via non-specific endocytosis and degraded to release curcumin and Zn ions within cells. The anticancer effects also occur in vivo in animals following the oral administration of ZnCM-SD, without significantly affecting the weight of the animals. Interestingly, ZnCM-SD did not reduce tumor growth or affect zinc homeostasis in HepG2-bearing mice after gut microbiome depletion. Moreover, administration of ZnCM-SD alone or in combination with doxorubicin significantly attenuated gut dysbiosis and zinc dyshomeostasis in a rat HCC model. Notably,    revealed the ability of ZnCM-SD to regulate zinc homeostasis and act as a chemosensitizer for doxorubicin were dependent on the gut .

Here, we report a fasting mimicking diet (FMD), fasting 3 days followed by 4 days of refeeding for three 1-week cycles, which accelerated the retention of motor function and attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), known to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons, were increased in PD mice after FMD, suggesting an involvement of BDNF in FMD-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, FMD decreased the number of glial cells as well as the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in PD mice, showing that FMD also inhibited neuro-inflammation. 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing of   showed that FMD treatment modulated the shifts in gut  composition, including higher abundance of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Opisthokonta and lower abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level in PD mice.

Many patients report altered bowel habits including constipation, bloating, gas and loose stool post-FMT despite resolution of CDI, and the etiology remains unclear.This was a prospective cohort study of adult patients with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT (1) via colonoscopy with patient-selected donor stool, () via colonoscopy from a universal stool bank donor, or (3) via capsules from a universal stool bank. Reassessment occurred 8 weeks post-FMT. Those cured were assessed for gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, loose stools, constipation). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of post-FMT gastrointestinal symptoms.A total of 150 subjects underwent FMT for recurrent CDI, of which 68.7% (103) were female, mean age was 61.5 years±18.1 and 31 patients (20.7%) had preexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Thirty-six had FMT via colonoscopy with a patient-selected donor, 67 via colonoscopy with stool bank donors, and 47 via FMT capsules from stool bank donors. Among those cured, 41 (31.%) had gastrointestinal symptoms post-FMT. The factors associated with symptoms included younger age (57. vs. 64.1 y, P=0.03), a baseline history of irritable bowel syndrome (36.6% vs. 13.3%, P=0.002) and preexisting inflammatory bowel disease (31.7% vs. 10%, P=0.002). Small bowel exposure to donor stool was not related to symptoms (63.4% vs. 62.%, P=0.89).Altered bowel habits are a consequence of CDI and are common after FMT.

However, little is known about the effects of commonly used antidiabetic agents on the gut . In this study, we investigated the roles of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and α-glucosidase inhibitor in modulating the gut .16S-rDNA sequencing was performed to analyse the effects of DPP-4i and acarbose on the gut  in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).    (FMT) from type  diabetes patients to germ-free mice was performed to investigate the contribution of the altered microbiome to antidiabetic effects of the drugs.  metabolomics was also analysed by untargeted and targeted GC-MS systems.Although DPP-4i and α-glucosidase inhibitor both altered the gut microbial composition, only the microbiome modulation of DPP-4i contributed to its hypoglycemic effect. Specifically, the changes of 68.6% genera induced by HFD were rescued by DPP-4i. FMT showed that the DPP-4i-altered microbiome improved glucose tolerance in colonized mice, while acarbose did not. Moreover, DPP-4i increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and also promoted a functional shift in the gut microbiome, especially increasing the production of succinate.Our findings demonstrate an important effect of DPP-4i on the gut , revealing a new hypoglycemic mechanism and an additional benefit of it. Furthermore, modulating the microbial composition, and the functional shift arising from changes in the microbiome, might be a potential strategy for improving glucose homeostasis.

We sought to determine whether putative procarcinogenic bacteria (enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli harboring the colibactin toxin) could be durably transmitted from donors to patients during FMT.METHODSStool samples were collected from 11 pediatric rCDI patients and their respective FMT donors prior to FMT as well as from the patients at -10 weeks, 10-20 weeks, and 6 months after FMT. Bacterial virulence factors in stool DNA extracts and stool cultures were measured by quantitative PCR: Bacteroides fragilis toxin (bft), Fusobacterium adhesin A (fadA), and Escherichia coli colibactin (clbB).RESULTSFour of 11 patients demonstrated sustained acquisition of a procarcinogenic bacteria. Whole genome sequencing was performed on colony isolates from one of these donor/recipient pairs and demonstrated that clbB+ E. coli strains present in the recipient after FMT were identical to a strain present in the donor, confirming strain transmission. Conversely,  patients exhibited clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria following FMT from a negative donor.CONCLUSIONBoth durable transmission and clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria occurred following FMT, suggesting that additional studies on appropriate screening measures for FMT donors and the long-term consequences and/or benefits of FMT are warranted.FUNDINGCrohn's & Colitis Foundation, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30474827>Preliminary experience with single    for treatment of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy-A case series.</a></h2><p>Experimental studies demonstrated that    (FMT) may reverse intestinal microbial dysbiosis.

A 17-year-old male with moderate to severe clinical activity, which was refractory to mesalazine, azathioprine, and infliximab, underwent FMT as alternative therapy. The patient exhibited clinical improvement after the procedure; however, the symptoms returned. A second FMT was performed 8 months after the first procedure, but the patient did not improve.

In this study, we investigated the impact of FMT for rCDI upon signalling through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway. Herein, we identify that in addition to restoration of gut  and bile acid profiles, FMT for rCDI is accompanied by a significant, sustained increase in circulating levels of FGF19 and reduction in FGF21. These FGF changes were associated with weight gain post-FMT, to a level not exceeding the pre-rCDI baseline. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the restoration of gut microbial communities by FMT for rCDI is associated with an upregulated FXR-FGF pathway, and highlight the potential systemic effect of FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178906>The Clinical and Steroid-Free Remission of    to Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: A Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Since the first case of    for the treatment of ulcerative colitis was described in the year 1989, there have been an increment of case reports, case series, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

HE may be a consequence of pure liver failure, as in patients with fulminant hepatitis, or of the combination of liver failure and portal-systemic shunting, as in patients with liver cirrhosis. Episodes of HE are usually related to precipitating events, such as infections or gastrointestinal bleeding; a minority of cirrhotic patients experienced a chronic HE, refractory to standard medical treatment. The prevention of HE recurrence, after the first episode of HE, could be obtained by the administration of prophylactic therapy with lactulose, rifaximin or a combination of both. The aim of this review is to clarify some key points in the management of cirrhotic patients with HE, not responsive to first line treatment.Recent studies investigated the role of    in the treatment of HE with promising results, but further investigations are needed. In a cirrhotic patient with acute cognitive impairment, the correct diagnosis of HE, after excluding other causes of neurological diseases, is mandatory for the correct management of the precipitating factors and for the treatment. In patients not responsive to standard treatment, the probable precipitating factors have not been correctly identified, multiple precipitating events are coexisting or a new precipitating event is superimposed.

The short-term success of FMT in rCDI has led to investigations of its application to other gastrointestinal disorders and extra-intestinal diseases with presumed gut dysbiosis. Despite the promising results of FMT in these conditions, several barriers remain, including determining the characteristics of a healthy microbiome, ensuring the safety of the recipient with respect to long-term outcomes, adequate monitoring of the recipient of  material, achieving high-quality control, and maintaining reasonable costs.

These -mediated mechanisms were previously identified by observing loss of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment or dietary changes, which severely disrupt  communities. We identify a -mediated mechanism of colonization resistance against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) by comparing high-complexity commensal communities with different levels of colonization resistance. Using inbred mouse strains with different infection dynamics and S. Typhimurium intestinal burdens, we demonstrate that Bacteroides species mediate colonization resistance against S. Typhimurium by producing the short-chain fatty acid propionate. Propionate directly inhibits pathogen growth in vitro by disrupting intracellular pH homeostasis, and chemically increasing intestinal propionate levels protects mice from S. Typhimurium.

To address this issue, we evaluated the effects of synbiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics on tumorigenesis using a CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mouse model harboring a colon-specific Apc knock out, which develops adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the colon. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-administration promoted colonic tumor development in CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mice, and these tumors were associated with loss of Apc heterozygosity, as confirmed by observation of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas with β-catenin accumulation in tumor cell cytoplasm. Synbiotics-treatment suppressed dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mice, thereby reducing mortality, and inhibited tumorigenesis accelerated by DSS-administration. Conversely, neither probiotics nor prebiotics had any effect on inflammation and tumorigenesis. Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve were detected in the   of probiotics-treated mice. Synbiotics-treatment suppressed DSS-induced expression of IL-6, STAT-3, COX-, and TNF-α gene transcripts in normal colonic epithelium, indicating the possibility of suppressing tumor development. Importantly, these genes may be potential therapeutic targets in inflammation-associated colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694953>Updated guidelines for diagnosing and managing Clostridium difficile.</a></h2><p>The updated Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for managing Clostridium difficile infections remove metronidazole as first-line therapy and add    to the treatment options.

Faecal   (FMT) has been proven effective for curing recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, however no systematic review to date has addressed its effectiveness for decolonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the gut. The aim of this study was to establish whether faecal   decolonizes antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the gut of colonized adults. A systematic review was performed by undertaking a comprehensive search on MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PubMed and CINAHL databases for evidence up until May 2018. Randomized and non-randomized studies evaluating the effects of FMT on gut colonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in adults were eligible. Studies were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institution critical appraisal checklists. Quality of reporting was assessed using PROCESS and CARE checklists. Data was synthesized narratively, along with a meta-analysis of proportions for the primary outcome. Five studies with a total number of 52 participants were included. Evidence of low quality showed that decolonization was achieved in half of the cases one month after FMT with higher response noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lower response in Klebsiella pneumoniae with New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) mechanisms of resistance. In successful cases, 70% of decolonization cases occurred within the first week after FMT. Few temporary adverse events were identified. Despite the limitations of the included studies, evidence from this review indicates a potential benefit of FMT as a decolonization intervention, which can only be confirmed by future well-designed RCTs.Copyright © 2019 The Healthcare Infection Society.

Its efficacy has been proved in the treatment of  infection which has encouraged research into the use of FMT for other disorders involving gut dysbiosis, such as ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by relapsing and remitting colonic inflammation. Although the FMT protocol for  treatment is well established, there are numerous additional factors to consider when applying FMT to treat inflammatory diseases. Various studies have attempted to address these factors but technical inconsistency between reports has resulted in a failure to achieve clinically significant findings. Case reports of FMT in UC have shown favorable outcomes yet demonstrating these effects on a larger scale has proved difficult. The following review aims to explore these issues and to analyze why they may be hindering the progression of FMT therapy in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30138161>Comparing    to standard-of-care treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The use of    (FMT) as a treatment option for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) is well established. Various studies have used different forms and administration routes for FMT. We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to update the clinical knowledge about different FMT modalities for curing rCDI compared with medical treatment (MT).We searched PubMed and Medline from inception through 10 May 2018 for randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing FMT (fresh or frozen) versus MT. We used Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool to assess bias in the RCTs. We estimated odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome using a random effects model. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.We included seven RCTs comprising a total of 543 patients with recurrent CDI. There was a nonsignificant trend toward resolution of diarrhea following a single fresh FMT infusion compared with frozen FMT and MT (OR=.45, 95% CI=0.78-7.71, P=0.12, I=69%). Subgroup analysis of fresh FMT vs. frozen FMT showed no difference between the two groups (OR=.13, 95% CI=0.22-20.41, P=0.51, I=61%). Frozen FMT infusion through upper route versus lower route showed no difference (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.15-.54, P=0.51, I=0%). There was a nonsignificant trend favoring multiple treatments with FMT versus multiple courses of MT (OR=3.68, 95% CI=0.74-18.22, P=0.11, I=0%).FMT is a promising treatment modality for rCDI compared with MT alone. Different forms and routes of FMT administration seem to be equally efficacious. In future, more well-designed RCTs directed at homogenous FMT preparation and delivery methods are required to validate these findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31046972>Gut Microbiome in Health and Disease: Emerging Diagnostic Opportunities.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome is fundamental to human health and development.

Lipid peroxidation procedurally appears, ferroptosis, apoptosis and necrosis are often induced, subsequently, mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction and even cell death occur. As a result, the intestinal epithelial cells are destroyed, leading to the incompleteness of intestinal mechanical barrier. Simultaneously, iron supplement can change the compositions and metabolic processes of intestinal microbes, and the intestinal inflammatory may be worsened. In principle, the easier dissociation of Fe from oral iron supplements is, the more serious intestinal inflammation will occur. Fortunately, some interventions have been developed to alleviate these side effects. For instance, some antioxidants e.g. VE and ferulic acid have been used to prevent the formation of free radicals or to neutralize the formed free radicals. Furthermore, some new iron supplements with the ability of slow-releasing Fe, e.g. ferrous citrate liposome and EDTA iron sodium, have been successfully prepared. In order to recover the intestinal micro-ecological balance, probiotics and prebiotics, bacterial consortium , and    have been developed. This study is meaningful for us to develop safer oral iron supplements and to maintain intestinal micro-ecological health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29997909>Anti-inflammatory Effects of the Octapeptide NAP in Human -Associated Mice Suffering from Subacute Ileitis.</a></h2><p>The octapeptide NAP is well known for its neuroprotective properties.

To address this, mice with a human gut  were perorally infected with one cyst of  (day 0) and subjected to intraperitoneal synthetic NAP treatment from day 1 until day 8 postinfection (p.i.). Whereas placebo (PLC) control animals displayed subacute ileitis at day 9 p.i., NAP-treated mice exhibited less pronounced pro-inflammatory immune responses as indicated by lower numbers of intestinal mucosal T and B lymphocytes and lower interferon (IFN)- concentrations in mesenteric lymph nodes. The NAP-induced anti-inflammatory effects were not restricted to the intestinal tract but could also be observed in extra-intestinal including systemic compartments, given that pro-inflammatory cytokines were lower in liver, kidney, and lung following NAP as compared to PLC application, whereas at day 9 p.i., colonic and serum interleukin (IL)-10 concentrations were higher in the former as compared to the latter. Remarkably, probiotic commensal bifidobacterial loads were higher in the ileal lumen of NAP as compared to PLC-treated mice with ileitis.

Changes to bacteriophage composition are associated with disease, but how phages impact mammalian health remains unclear. We noted an induction of host immunity when experimentally treating bacterially driven cancer, leading us to test whether bacteriophages alter immune responses. Treating germ-free mice with bacteriophages leads to immune cell expansion in the gut. Lactobacillus, Escherichia, and Bacteroides bacteriophages and phage DNA stimulated IFN-γ via the nucleotide-sensing receptor TLR9. The resultant immune responses were both phage and bacteria specific. Additionally, increasing bacteriophage levels exacerbated colitis via TLR9 and IFN-γ. Similarly, ulcerative colitis (UC) patients responsive to    (FMT) have reduced phages compared to non-responders, and mucosal IFN-γ positively correlates with bacteriophage levels. Bacteriophages from active UC patients induced more IFN-γ compared to healthy individuals. Collectively, these results indicate that bacteriophages can alter mucosal immunity to impact mammalian health.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204469>Short chain fatty acids contribute to gut -induced promotion of colonic melatonin receptor expression.</a></h2><p>Melatonin plays an important role in various gut functions through melatonin receptors. The gut /gut hormone axis has recently received increasing attention. However, the relationship between the gut  and melatonin receptors has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effect of the gut  on colonic melatonin receptor expression in germ-free (GF) rats and to further explore the potential mechanism in Caco- cells. In this study, GF rats were transplanted with  samples from a healthy human donor. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze the microbial communities. Colon tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The correlations between melatonin receptor expression and the gut  were assessed. Melatonin receptor expression in Caco- cells was detected by Western blot. We found that    significantly increased the expression of colonic melatonin receptors in GF rats. The amount of  Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was significantly higher in    (FMT) rats than in GF rats. SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats. Additionally, acetate and propionate significantly increased melatonin receptor-1 expression in Caco- cells. Therefore, the gut  may promote melatonin receptor expression, and the mechanism may involve the action of SCFAs.

Treatment for AD is still a difficult task in clinic. AD is associated with abnormal gut . However, little is known about the role of    (FMT) in AD. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of FMT for the treatment of AD. We used an APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (Tg) mouse model. Cognitive deficits, brain deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylation of tau, synaptic plasticity as well as neuroinflammation were assessed. Gut  and its metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our results showed that FMT treatment could improve cognitive deficits and reduce the brain deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (Tg) mice. These improvements were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of tau protein and the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42. We observed an increases in synaptic plasticity in the Tg mice, showing that postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synapsin I expression were increased after FMT. We also observed the decrease of COX- and CD11b levels in Tg mice after FMT. We also found that FMT treatment reversed the changes of gut  and SCFAs.

Its protective role in intestinal colitis and tumorigenesis is dependent on the host microbiome. Host innate immunity and microbial diversity also play a role in the severity of allogeneic immune-mediated gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the principal toxicity after allogeneic haematopoietic cell . Here, we examined the role of host NLRP6 in multiple murine models of allogeneic bone marrow . In contrast to its role in intestinal colitis, host NLRP6 aggravated gastrointestinal GVHD. The impact of host NLRP6 deficiency in mitigating GVHD was observed regardless of co-housing, antibiotic treatment or colonizing littermate germ-free wild-type and NLRP6-deficient hosts with faecal microbial  from specific pathogen-free wild-type and Nlrp6 animals. Chimaera studies were performed to assess the role of NLRP6 expression on host haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cells. The allogeneic [B6Ly5. → Nlrp6] animals demonstrated significantly improved survival compared to the allogeneic [B6Ly5. → B6] animals, but did not alter the therapeutic graft-versus-tumour effects after haematopoietic cell .

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying  engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and () patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut . Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in  induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status.

Clinical efficacy and safety of FMT were assessed using questionnaires covering four aspects of IBS therapeutic efficacy and assessment of adverse effects during a 6-month follow-up.FMT improved IBS gastrointestinal symptoms and alleviated depression and anxiety, as shown by the improved IBS-QOL, IBS-SSS, GSRS, HAMA and HAMD scores at 1 month and 3 months after FMT. A total adverse event rate of FMT was 6.7% (/30). Gut  analysis revealed that FMT responders had a significantly higher Shannon diversity index before FMT than non-responders. In addition, analysis of differences in bacterial composition before and after FMT in responders showed specific abundance of the phyla Verrucomincrobia and Euryarchaeota at 1 month after FMT. At the genus level, Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia were the most abundant   1 month after FMT compared with those before FMT.FMT may be an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for treating IBS that achieves a sustained clinical response 3-6 months after the first procedure.

However, the effects of commensal  on intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules have not been elucidated systematically. Here, we investigate the impacts of antibiotic-induced depletion and subsequent restoration of the intestinal  on the murine antimicrobial molecules in intestinal mucosa. Our results demonstrate that depletion of commensal  leads to intestinal mucosa atrophy and reduction of antimicrobial molecules, including lysozyme, regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (RegIIIγ), and cryptdin 5 mRNA, whereas subsequent reconstitution of intestinal  by    (FMT) rescues mucosa morphology and antimicrobials. Importantly, our study shows that down-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), interleukin-22 (IL-22), and phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3) is associated with decreased antimicrobials, which might mediate the antibiotic-associated intestinal mucosa injury. Last, exogenous activation of the AhR/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway with the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3,-b)carbazole (Ficz) rescued antimicrobial molecule levels markedly after antibiotic treatment to levels similar to those following reconstitution of intestinal  by FMT.

However, it has been unclear whether oral FMT was effective for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in dogs.An 8-month-old, intact male French bulldog was presented with a 4-month history of intermittent large bowel diarrhoea. Physical and clinical examinations did not identify any specific causes for diarrhoea. Real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography detected C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins in a faecal sample. Based on these findings, diarrhoea in the dog was considered to be induced by C. difficile-associated colitis. The dog was treated with oral FMT, in which a faecal solution obtained from a healthy beagle was orally administered to the subject. Stool consistency and frequency and faecal blood and mucus became normal -3 days after oral FMT, and real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography was negative for C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins. No adverse events were observed.The present case report demonstrated that oral FMT was an effective treatment for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in a dog.

Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomics have the potential to improve our understanding of the dynamics of gut colonization that precede BSI in HSCT recipients. Within a prospective cohort study of children (age <18 years) undergoing HSCT, 9 subjects met criteria for mucosal barrier injury BSI. We performed whole-genome sequencing of the blood culture isolate and weekly  samples preceding the BSI to compare the genetic similarity of BSI isolates to  strains. We evaluated temporal associations between antibiotic exposures and the abundances of BSI strains in the gut  and correlated the detection of antibiotic resistance genes with the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of these strains. The median patient age was .6 years, and 78% were male. BSIs were caused by Escherichia coli (n = 5), Enterococcus faecium (n = ), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and Rothia mucilaginosa (n = 1). In the 6 BSI episodes with evaluable comparative genomics, the  strains were identical to the blood culture isolate (>99.99% genetic similarity). Gut domination by these strains preceded only 4 of 7 E. coli or E. faecium BSIs by a median of 17 days (range, 6 to 21 days). Increasing abundances of the resulting BSI strains in the gut  were frequently associated with specific antibiotic exposures. E. cloacae and R. mucilaginosa were not highly abundant in  samples preceding BSIs caused by these species. The detection of antibiotic resistance genes for β-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin predicted phenotypic resistance in BSI strains. Bacterial strains causing mucosal barrier injury BSI in pediatric HSCT recipients were observed in the gut  before BSI onset, and changes in the abundances of these strains within the gut preceded most BSI episodes. However, frequent sampling of the gut  and sampling of other ecological niches is likely necessary to effectively predict BSI in HSCT recipients.Copyright © 2019 American Society for  and Cellular Therapy.

Modification of gut  and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile acid synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut , which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco- cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Altogether, we conclude that research in this field is currently in its infancy, which may be due to the large number of factors that can elicit such alterations, the variety of related pathologies, and the heterogeneity of the population involved. Further research on the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, or  transplantations on the composition of the human gut microbiome is necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30083142>   Is Associated With Reduced Morbidity and Mortality in Porcine Circovirus Associated Disease.</a></h2><p>Porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) is a term used to describe the multi-factorial disease syndromes caused by porcine circovirus type  (PCV-), which can be reproduced in an experimental setting through the co-infection of pigs with PCV- and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The resulting PCVAD-affected pigs represent a subpopulation within the co-infected group. In co-infection studies, the presence of increased microbiome diversity is linked to a reduction in clinical signs. In this study,    (FMT) was investigated as a means to prevent PCVAD in pigs co-infected with PRRSV and PCV-2d. The sources of the FMT material were high-parity sows with a documented history of high health status and robust litter characteristics. The analysis of the donated FMT material showed the absence of common pathogens along with the presence of diverse microbial phyla and families. One group of pigs ( = 10) was administered the FMT while a control group ( = 10) was administered a sterile mock-. Over the 42-day post-infection period, the FMT group showed fewer PCVAD-affected pigs, as evidenced by a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in transplanted pigs, along with increased antibody levels. Overall, this study provides evidence that FMT decreases the severity of clinical signs following co-infection with PRRSV and PCV- by reducing the prevalence of PCVAD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130466>Nutrient Sensing in CD11c Cells Alters the Gut  to Regulate Food Intake and Body Mass.</a></h2><p>Microbial dysbiosis and inflammation are implicated in diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, it is not known whether crosstalk between immunity and  also regulates metabolic homeostasis in healthy animals. Here, we report that genetic deletion of tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) in CD11c myeloid cells (Tsc1CD11c mice) reduced food intake and body mass in the absence of metabolic disease. Co-housing and   experiments revealed a dominant role for the healthy gut  in regulation of body weight. 16S rRNA sequencing, selective culture, and reconstitution experiments further confirmed that selective deficiency of Lactobacillus johnsonii Q1-7 contributed to decreased food intake and body mass in Tsc1CD11c mice. Mechanistically, activation of mTORC1 signaling in CD11c cells regulated production of L. johnsonii Q1-7-specific IgA, allowing for its stable colonization in the gut. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected transkingdom immune- feedback loop for homeostatic regulation of food intake and body mass in mammals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that MI-, a selective inhibitor of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation-1 (MALT1), alleviated excessive inflammatory responses and was associated with restoration of healthy intestinal microbiome in mice suffering from dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. We found that the diversity of intestinal microbiome of mice with DSS-induced colitis was significantly lower than that of healthy mice. However, MI- treatment in mice with DSS-induced colitis resulted in restored microbially diverse populations. To understand the possibility of the beneficial effect of the restored microbially diverse populations of MI--treated mice with DSS-induced colitis, we showed that inserting   from MI--treated mice with DSS-induced colitis and healthy control mice into mice with DSS-induced colitis could alleviate symptoms of colitis. The possibility of MI- treatment in DSS-induced colitis, associated with restoration of healthy microbially diverse populations in addition to reshaping host immune modulating capacity by reducing inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β [IL-1β], IL-17α, and IL-22), may be considered therapeutic for ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2018 Lee et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29992140>   Is Effective in Relieving Visceral Hypersensitivity in a Postinfectious Model.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of    on visceral hypersensitivity compared with .Mice visceral hypersensitivity was induced by .

In the absence of profound perturbation, the bacterial strains that reside within an individual are mostly stable over time  . By contrast, the fate of exogenous commensal and probiotic strains applied to an established  is variable, generally unpredictable and greatly influenced by the background . Therefore, analysis of the factors that govern strain engraftment and abundance is of critical importance to the emerging field of microbiome reprogramming. Here we generate an exclusive metabolic niche in mice via administration of a marine polysaccharide, porphyran, and an exogenous Bacteroides strain harbouring a rare gene cluster for porphyran utilization. Privileged nutrient access enables reliable engraftment of the exogenous strain at predictable abundances in mice harbouring diverse communities of gut microbes. This targeted dietary support is sufficient to overcome priority exclusion by an isogenic strain  , and enables strain replacement. We demonstrate transfer of the 60-kb porphyran utilization locus into a naive strain of Bacteroides, and show finely tuned control of strain abundance in the mouse gut across multiple orders of magnitude by varying porphyran dosage. Finally, we show that this system enables the introduction of a new strain into the colonic crypt ecosystem. These data highlight the influence of nutrient availability in shaping  membership, expand the ability to perform a broad spectrum of investigations in the context of a complex , and have implications for cell-based therapeutic strategies in the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30643289>Healthy infants harbor intestinal bacteria that protect against food allergy.</a></h2><p>There has been a striking generational increase in life-threatening food allergies in Westernized societies. One hypothesis to explain this rising prevalence is that twenty-first century lifestyle practices, including misuse of antibiotics, dietary changes, and higher rates of Caesarean birth and formula feeding have altered intestinal bacterial communities; early-life alterations may be particularly detrimental. To better understand how commensal bacteria regulate food allergy in humans, we colonized germ-free mice with  from healthy or cow's milk allergic (CMA) infants. We found that germ-free mice colonized with bacteria from healthy, but not CMA, infants were protected against anaphylactic responses to a cow's milk allergen. Differences in bacterial composition separated the healthy and CMA populations in both the human donors and the colonized mice. Healthy and CMA colonized mice also exhibited unique transcriptome signatures in the ileal epithelium. Correlation of ileal bacteria with genes upregulated in the ileum of healthy or CMA colonized mice identified a clostridial species, Anaerostipes caccae, that protected against an allergic response to food. Our findings demonstrate that intestinal bacteria are critical for regulating allergic responses to dietary antigens and suggest that interventions that modulate bacterial communities may be therapeutically relevant for food allergy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987771>Consensus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>In recent decades, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become a worldwide health problem. Mexico is no exception, and therefore the Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología brought together a multidisciplinary group (gastroenterologists, endoscopists, internists, infectious disease specialists, and microbiologists) to carry out the "Consensus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection", establishing useful recommendations (in relation to the adult population) for the medical community. Said recommendations are presented herein. Among them, it was recognized that CDI should be suspected in subjects with diarrhea that have a history of antibiotic and/or immunosuppressant use, but that it can also be a community-acquired infection. A -step diagnostic algorithm was proposed, in which a highly sensitive test, such as glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), is first utilized, and if positive, confirmed by the detection of toxins through immunoassay or nucleic acid detection tests. Another recommendation was that CDI based on clinical evaluation be categorized as mild-moderate, severe, and complicated severe, given that such a classification enables better therapeutic decisions to be made. In mild-moderate CDI, oral vancomycin is the medication of choice, and metronidazole is recommended as an alternative treatment. In addition,    was recognized as an efficacious option in patients with recurrence or in the more severe cases of infection, and surgery should be reserved for patients with severe colitis (toxic megacolon), in whom all medical treatment has failed.Copyright © 2019 Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología.

VRE have a remarkable genetic plasticity allowing them to acquire genes associated with antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the treatment of deep-seated infections due to VRE has become a challenge for the clinician. The purpose of this review is to assess the current and future strategies for the management of recalcitrant deep-seated VRE infections and efforts for infection control in the hospital setting.Preventing colonization and decolonization of multidrug-resistant bacteria are becoming the most promising novel strategies to control and eradicate VRE from the hospital environment.    (FMT) has shown remarkable results on treating colonization and infection due to Clostridiodes difficille and VRE, as well as to recover the integrity of the gut  under antibiotic pressure. Initial reports have shown the efficacy of FMT on reestablishing patient  diversity in the gut and reducing the dominance of VRE in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the use of bacteriophages may be a promising strategy in eradicating VRE from the gut of patients. Until these strategies become widely available in the hospital setting, the implementation of infection control measures and stewardship programs are paramount for the control of this pathogen and each program should provide recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics and develop strategies that help to detect populations at risk of VRE colonization, prevent and control nosocomial transmission of VRE, and develop educational programs for all healthcare workers addressing the epidemiology of VRE and the potential impact of these pathogens on the cost and outcomes of patients. In terms of antibiotic strategies, daptomycin has become the standard of care for the management of deep-seated infections due to VRE. However, recent evidence indicates that the efficacy of this antibiotic is limited, and higher (10-12 mg/kg) doses and/or combination with β-lactams is needed for therapeutic success. Clinical data to support the best use of daptomycin against VRE are urgently needed. This review provides an overview of recent developments regarding the prevention, treatment, control, and eradication of VRE in the hospital setting. We aim to provide an update of the most recent therapeutic strategies to treat deep-seated infections due to VRE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660343>  in Children With  Gives Sustained Reduction in Antimicrobial Resistance and Potential Pathogen Burden.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) treats  infection (CDI). Little is known regarding the changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and potential pathogen burden that occur in pediatric recipients of FMT. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in AMR genes, potential pathogens, species, and functional pathways with FMT in children.Nine children with recurrent CDI underwent FMT. Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope .0.All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT ( < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes ( < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT ( < .001), with an increase post-FMT ( ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples ( < .001). Bacterial species  and  showed higher abundance in donors than recipients ( = .008 and  = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT. Biosynthetic pathways predominated in the donor and increased in the recipient post-FMT.FMT for CDI in children decreases AMR genes and potential pathogens and changes  composition and function. However, acquisition of certain AMR genes post-FMT combined with low levels of potential pathogens found in donors suggests that further study is warranted regarding screening donors using metagenomics sequencing before FMT.© The Author(s) 2019.

It is however unknown whether the gut microbiome and the gut barrier function is already altered early in sepsis development and whether it is possible to modulate the microbiome in early sepsis. Therefore, a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to examine the alterations of the microbiome and the gut barrier in early sepsis and the influence of a concomitant probiotic intervention on dysbiosis at this early stage of the disease was conducted. Patients with early sepsis, defined as fulfilling the sepsis definition from the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines but without signs of organ failure, received multispecies probiotic (Winclove 607 based on Omnibiotic® 10 AAD) for 28 days. Gut microbiome composition, function, gut barrier and bacterial translocation were studied. Patients with early sepsis had a significantly lower structural and functional alpha diversity, clustered differently and showed structural alterations on all taxonomic levels. Gut permeability was unaltered but endotoxin, endotoxin binding proteins and peptidoglycans were elevated in early sepsis patients compared to controls. Probiotic intervention successfully increased probiotic strains in stool and led to an improvement of functional diversity. Microbiome composition and function are altered in early sepsis. Probiotic intervention successfully modulates the microbiome and is therefore a promising tool for early intervention in sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689151>Description and genomic characterization of Massiliimalia massiliensis gen. nov., sp. nov., and Massiliimalia timonensis gen. nov., sp. nov., two new members of the family Ruminococcaceae isolated from the human gut.</a></h2><p>Using the culturomics approach, we isolated two strains, Marseille-P2963 and Marseille-P3753, from the intestinal  of a 19-year-old healthy Saudi Arabian Bedouin male and from a 32-year-old healthy Senegalese male faecal  donor. Here, we studied their phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic characteristics. Both strains were phylogenetically related, but different from Ruminococcus species. Bacterial cells were anaerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming and not motile, with neither catalase nor oxidase activities.

However, there is also evidence that FMT can be effective in treating ulcerative colitis. This study examined the approval and willingness of affected patients who underwent FMT. A standardized questionnaire containing 27 polar and open questions was dispatched to a cohort of 262 patients suffering from UC. It included questions regarding the FMT process, donors, and possible concerns. Additionally, aspects of social background and disease activity were addressed. The response rate was 31.3 % (n = 82). Forty-eight (58.5 %) patients were already aware of FMT. Forty-six (56.1 %) were willing to undergo FMT if given a respective indication. The effectiveness of the procedure (40. %), followed by failure of all other therapies (17.1 %), formed the principal motivation. The transmission of possible infectious agents (26.8 %), and the potential contamination of the stool graft leading to a deterioration of clinical symptoms, raised the most concerns. (20.7 %).The preferred delivery system of FMT was capsules (67.1 %), followed by colonoscopic application (47.6 %). The patients were in favour of a donor proposed by the physician (52,4 %). Willingness to undergo FMT did not differ significantly between genders (56.4 % women vs. 57.1 % men). Smokers (88.9 %), patients who did not watch television at all (77.8 %) and those with private health insurance, showed an increased willingness to undergo FMT. For the majority of the UC patients surveyed, FMT represents a feasible treatment option. Approximately half of the respondents would consider FMT as an alternative treatment option, even inspite of a satisfactory disease response to current standard therapies. Unsurprisingly, there are concerns regarding the transmission of possible infectious agents and the hygienic implementation of FMT itself.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124558>Gut microbiome-targeted therapies in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression.</a></h2><p>Preclinical evidence suggests that modulation of the gut microbiome could represent a new therapeutic target in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The aim of this study was to evaluate the most current evidence for liver-specific and metabolic effects of microbiome-targeted therapies (MTTs) in persons with NAFLD.We searched multiple electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from January 1, 2005 to December 1, 2018 that enrolled persons with NAFLD who received MTT rather than placebo or usual care. MTT was defined as antibiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, or    (FMT). Clinical outcomes were pooled with the use of random-effects models and heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. A random-effects meta-regression was performed to determine sources of heterogeneity in prevalence estimates between studies.Twenty-one RCTs (1252 participants) were included; 9 evaluated probiotics and 12 evaluated synbiotics, with treatment duration ranging from 8 to 28 wk. No RCTs examined the efficacy of antibiotics or FMT. Probiotics/synbiotics were associated with a significant reduction in alanine aminotransferase activity [ALT, weighted mean difference (WMD): -11.23 IU/L; 95% CI: -15.02, -7.44 IU/L] and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by elastography (reflecting inflammation and fibrosis) (WMD: -0.70 kPa; 95% CI: -1.00, -0.40 kPa), although analyses showed heterogeneity (I2 = 90.6% and I2 = 93.4%, respectively). Probiotics/synbiotics were also associated with increased odds of improvement in hepatic steatosis, as graded by ultrasound (OR: .40; 95% CI: 1.50, 3.84; I2 = 22.4%). No RCTs examined sequential liver biopsy findings. Probiotics (WMD: -1.84; 95% CI: -3.30, -0.38; I2 = 23.6%), but not synbiotics (WMD: -0.85; 95% CI: -.17, 0.47; I2 = 96.6%), were associated with a significant reduction in body mass index.The use of probiotics/synbiotics was associated with improvement in liver-specific markers of hepatic inflammation, LSM, and steatosis in persons with NAFLD. Although promising, given the heterogeneity in pooled analyses, additional well-designed RCTs are needed to define the efficacy of probiotics/synbiotics for treatment of NAFLD.

The primary outcome was achievement of steroid-free clinical remission, and the secondary outcomes were clinical response and endoscopic remission at 24 weeks. Modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed, which included subjects who underwent at least 1 FMT.Of 345 patients with UC treated during the study period, 49 (14.%) had steroid-dependent UC. Of these 49 patients, 41 underwent FMT: 33 completed 7 sessions over 22 weeks according to the protocol, and 8 discontinued treatment (non-response, 5; lost to follow-up, ; and fear of adverse effects, 1).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of antibiotic-associated dysbiosis on metabolism and GI motility in relation to colonic expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and G protein coupled receptor (GPR)43. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice (ICR, 6 weeks old, female) were orally administered vancomycin (0. mg/ml) in drinking water for 7 days. In another experiment, germ-free (GF) mice (ICR, 6 weeks old, female) were subjected to oral   (FT) using a  bacterial suspension prepared from SPF mice that had received vancomycin treatment (FT-V) or one from untreated control SPF mice (FT-C). The gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine red (6% w/v) solution. The expression of GLP-1 and GPR43 was examined by immunohistochemistry and realtime RT-PCR, and the plasma GLP-1 level was measured by ELISA. In vancomycin-treated SPF mice, the diversity of the gut  was significantly reduced and the abundance of Lactobacillus was markedly increased. Significant increases in body weight, cecum weight, plasma GLP-1 level and colonic GLP-1/GPR43 expression were also noted relative to the controls. These alterations were reproducible in GF mice with FT-V. Moreover, FT-V GF mice showed a significantly increased food intake and a significantly prolonged GITT in comparison with FT-C GF mice.

Here we sought to elucidate the functional effects of therapeutic FMT administration during experimental colitis on innate and adaptive immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. We show that therapeutic FMT reduces colonic inflammation and initiates the restoration of intestinal homeostasis through the simultaneous activation of different immune-mediated pathways, ultimately leading to IL-10 production by innate and adaptive immune cells, including CD4 T cells, iNKT cells and Antigen Presenting Cells (APC), and reduces the ability of dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages to present MHCII-dependent bacterial antigens to colonic T cells.

To study this, we used antibiotics treated and non-treated specific pathogen free Muc2-/- and Muc2+/+ littermates and germ-free mice inoculated with Eh in colonic loops as a short infection model. In antibiotic treated Muc2-/- and Muc2+/+ littermates, Eh elicited robust mucus and water secretions, enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine expression with elevated MPO activity and higher pathology scores as compared to the modest response observed in non-antibiotic treated littermates. Host responses were  specific as mucus secretion and pro-inflammatory responses were attenuated following homologous  microbial  in antibiotic-treated Muc2+/+ quantified by secretion of 3H-glucosamine newly synthesized mucin, Muc2 mucin immunostaining and immunohistochemistry. Eh-elicited pro-inflammatory responses and suppressed goblet cell transcription factor Math1 as revealed by in vivo imaging of Eh-colonic loops in Math1GFP mice, and in vitro using Eh-stimulated LS174T human colonic goblet cells. Eh in colonic loops increased bacterial translocation of bioluminescent E. coli and indigenous bacteria quantified by FISH and quantitative PCR. In germ-free animals, Eh-induced mucus/water secretory responses, but acute pro-inflammatory responses and MPO activity were severely impaired, allowing the parasite to bind to and disrupt mucosal epithelial cells. These findings have identified key roles for intestinal  and mucus in regulating innate host defenses against Eh, and implicate dysbiosis as a risk factor for amebiasis that leads to exacerbated immune responses to cause life-threatening disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009795>Efficacy of    for Clostridium difficile Infection in Children.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is commonly used to treat Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI is an increasing cause of diarrheal illness in pediatric patients, but the effects of FMT have not been well studied in children. We performed a multi-center retrospective cohort study of pediatric and young adult patients to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and factors associated with a successful FMT for the treatment of CDI.We performed a retrospective study of 372 patients, 11 months to 23 years old, who underwent FMTs at 18 pediatric centers, from February 1, 2004, to February 28, 2017; -month outcome data were available from 335 patients. Successful FMT was defined as no recurrence of CDI in the  months following FMT. We performed stepwise logistic regression to identify factors associated with successful FMT.Of 335 patients who underwent FMT and were followed for  months or more, 271 (81%) had a successful outcome following a single FMT and 86.6% had a successful outcome following a first or repeated FMT. Patients who received FMT with fresh donor stool (odds ratio [OR], .66; 95% CI, 1.39-5.08), underwent FMT via colonoscopy (OR, .41; 95% CI, 1.26-4.61), did not have a feeding tube (OR, .08; 95% CI, 1.05-4.11), or had 1 less episode of CDI before FMT (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.39) had increased odds for successful FMT. Seventeen patients (4.7%) had a severe adverse event during the 3-month follow-up period, including 10 hospitalizations.Based on the findings from a large multi-center retrospective cohort, FMT is effective and safe for the treatment of CDI in children and young adults. Further studies are required to optimize the timing and method of FMT for pediatric patients-factors associated with success differ from those of adult patients.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Recent work has shown that resveratrol can improve glucose homeostasis in obesity via changes in the gut . Studies involving  microbiome  (FMTs) suggest that either live gut  or bacterial-derived metabolites from resveratrol ingestion are responsible for producing the observed benefits in recipients. Herein, we show that obese mice receiving FMTs from healthy resveratrol-fed mice have improved glucose homeostasis within 11 days of the first , and that resveratrol-FMTs is more efficacious than oral supplementation of resveratrol for the same duration. The effects of FMTs from resveratrol-fed mice are also associated with decreased inflammation in the colon of obese recipient mice. Furthermore, we show that sterile  filtrates from resveratrol-fed mice are sufficient to improve glucose homeostasis in obese mice, demonstrating that nonliving bacterial, metabolites, or other components within the  of resveratrol-fed mice are sufficient to reduce intestinal inflammation. These postbiotics may be an integral mechanism by which resveratrol improves hyperglycemia in obesity. Resveratrol-FMTs also reduced the systolic blood pressure of hypertensive mice within  wk of the first , indicating that the beneficial effects of resveratrol-FMTs may also assist with improving cardiovascular conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550826>[Efficacy analysis of    in the treatment of 2010 patients with intestinal disorders].</a></h2><p> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of    (FMT) for intestinal disorders.  A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the ,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage disease, cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous bowel history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of inflammatory bowel disease, 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable bowel syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in  donation; () no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic diseases such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., no autoimmune disease, not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant disease; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious diseases (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative  examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; () 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every  donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the  flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day  after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule  and one-time  through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before . Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.  Of the 2010 patients, 1,497 cases received nasointestinal tube  (nasointestinal tube group), 452 cases oral capsule  (oral capsule group) and 61 cases colonoscopy (colonoscopy group). At 3 time points of 3, 12, and 36 months after FMT, the clinical cure rates and the clinical improvement rates were 41.3% (560/1 356), 35.% (320/909), 31.4% (69/220), and 29.0% (393/1 356), 27.8% (253/909), 29.1% (64/220), respectively in constipation patients; 33.1% (58/175), 29.9% (35/117), 24.5% (12/49), and 31.4% (55/175), 27.4% (32/117), 57.1% (28/49), respectively in inflammatory bowel disease patients; 87.8% (130/148), 81.8% (81/99), 78.3% (36/46), and 8.1% (12/148), 7.1% (7/99), 4.3% (/46), respectively in chronic diarrhea patients; 61.4% (78/127), 56.5% (48/85), 47.6% (20/42), and 21.% (27/127), 15.3% (13/85), 14.3% (6/42), respectively in radiation enteritis patients; 53.8% (64/119), 45.0% (36/80), 6/15, and 21.0% (25/119), 26.% (21/80), 4/15, respectively in irritable bowel syndrome patients; 23.5% (20/85), 22.8% (13/57), 20.0%(5/25), and 55.3% (47/85), 49.1% (28/57), 40.0% (10/25), respectively in autism patients.

Prokaryotes use these immune systems to defend against invaders, which include phages, plasmids, and other mobile genetic elements. Relying on the integration of spacers derived from invader sequences (protospacers) into CRISPR loci (forming spacers flanked by repeats), CRISPR-Cas systems are able to store the memory of past immunological encounters. While CRISPR-Cas systems have evolved in response to invading mobile genetic elements, invaders have also developed mechanisms to avoid detection. As a result of an arms race between CRISPR-Cas systems and their targets, CRISPR arrays typically undergo rapid turnover of spacers through the acquisition and loss events. Additionally, microbiomes of different individuals rarely share spacers. Here, we present a computational pipeline, CRISPRtrack, for strain tracking based on CRISPR spacer content, and we applied it to   microbiome data to study the retention of donor strains in recipients. Our results demonstrate the potential use of CRISPRs as a simple yet effective tool for donor-strain tracking in   and as a general purpose tool for quantifying microbiome similarity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578461>Fighting Fatty Liver Diseases with Nutritional Interventions, Probiotics, Symbiotics, and    (FMT).</a></h2><p>Pediatric obesity is rising worldwide leading the worrying phenomenon of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to shift into one of the most frequent causes of chronic liver illness in childhood. Occurrence of NAFLD depends on several factors such as the geographical area and the diagnostic modalities used; overall it ranges between 3% and 10% of pediatric population, increasing up to 70% in patients with metabolic comorbidities (Manco M, Bottazzo G, DeVito R et al, J Am Coll Nutr 27:667-676, 2008).Recent findings have related the intestinal  to a plethora of pathological conditions, including type  diabetes (T2D), obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). One of the emerging areas of the study is the link between liver diseases and gut microbiome, which has added new information to the understanding of the so-called gut-liver axis.In order to address the role of gut microbiome in NAFLD onset and progression, it is necessary to "decipher" operational codes for microbiome investigation within the context of advanced laboratory medicine to capture microbiome features and, hence, to address the function of the intestinal microbiome within the gut -liver axis.Results of these investigations have allowed the beginning of implementing the usage of probiotics and symbiotics in the medical approach of obesity and NAFLD in adults and children. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been already published on    (FMT), T2D, NASH, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).This review proposes to describe the current state of knowledge on the ways fatty liver diseases can be addressed with nutritional interventions, probiotics, symbiotics, and FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154727>[Effects and mechanism of   on acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in rats].</a></h2><p> To investigate the effect of    (FMT) on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its regulatory mechanism.  Fifteen rats were divided into control group, LPS group and LPS+FMT group by random number table method. LPS group and LPS+FMT group were intraperitoneally injected with LPS to generate rat ALI model. After 24 h of modeling,  (10 ml/kg) were given to the LPS+FMT group twice a day, and the control group and LPS group were given the same amount of normal saline. The intervention lasted for  days. After 24 h of the last   , arterial blood gas analysis was performed in each group. Then rats were sacrificed and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method was used to detect intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) content in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) was evaluated; HE staining and lung tissue pathology scoring, immunohistochemical detection of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) predominate nuclear expression and expression of ICAM-1 of alveolar epithelial cells were conducted; Western blot was used to detect the expression of proteins related to the intracellular phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. Samples of rat  were collected and DNA was extracted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16SrDNA) were sequenced at high throughput, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted on the microbial community based on the operational classification unit.  The lung W/D and lung histopathological score of the LPS group were significantly higher than those of the control group, while the arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO()) of the LPS group was significantly lower than that of the control group [(79.±5.89 vs 95.±.77) mmHg, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa](all 0.05). The results of intestinal flora sequencing revealed that the diversity index of LPS group was significantly higher than that of the control group, while the lactobacillus of LPS group rats was significantly lower than that of the control group. The content of ICAM-1 in serum, BALF and its relative expression on the cell membrane in the LPS group was significantly higher than that in the control group [(8.64±0.87) vs (7.40±0.32) ng/L; (0.941±0.035) vs (0.739±0.079) ng/L; (0.250±0.010) vs (0.076±0.010)] (all 0.05). Moreover, the relative expression levels of phosphorylated P65 (p-P65), p-PI3K and p-AKT nucleoprotein in the LPS group were significantly higher than those in the control group (4.89±0.27 vs 3.28±0.13, 0.265±0.030 vs 0.036±0.013 and 0.444±0.040 vs 0.109±0.016) (all 0.05). The above injury effect was reduced after  fungus . The lung W/D and lung pathological score of LPS+FMT group were significantly lower than those of LPS group, and PaO() of LPS+FMT group was significantly higher than that of LPS group [(88.0±3.53) mmHg]. The results of intestinal flora sequencing revealed that the diversity index of LPS+FMT group was significantly lower than that of LPS group, and the lactobacillus genus of LPS+FMT group was significantly higher than that of LPS group. ICAM-1 in the blood serum ((7.44±0.46) ng/L), BALF (0.834±0.040) ng/L) and its relative expression on alveolar epithelial cell membrane (0.173±0.030), the relative expression of p-P65, p-PI3K and p-AKT protein of NF-κB in alveolar epithelial cells was down-regulated ((.99±0.28, 0.090±0.013 and 0.206±0.018) in LPS+FMT group than those of LPS group, the differences were statistically significant (all 0.05).    can alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in rats, and its regulatory effect may be related to inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway and reducing the expression of inflammatory factor ICAM-1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877092>Altered Gut  in HIV Infection: Future Perspective of    Therapy.</a></h2><p>HIV infection progressively destroys CD4+ mononuclear cells, leading to profound cellular immune deficiency that manifests as life-threatening opportunistic infections and malignancies (i.e., AIDS).

Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight    (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (,805 subjects), and eight probiotics, prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin B; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, probiotics, and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Best practice advice 1: A stepwise approach to rule-out ongoing inflammatory activity should be followed in IBD patients with persistent GI symptoms (measurement of  calprotectin, endoscopy with biopsy, cross-sectional imaging). Best practice advice : In those patients with indeterminate  calprotectin levels and mild symptoms, clinicians may consider serial calprotectin monitoring to facilitate anticipatory management. Best practice advice 3: Anatomic abnormalities or structural complications should be considered in patients with obstructive symptoms including abdominal distention, pain, nausea and vomiting, obstipation or constipation. Best practice advice 4: Alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms should be considered and evaluated (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bile acid diarrhea, carbohydrate intolerance, chronic pancreatitis) based on predominant symptom patterns. Best practice advice 5: A low FODMAP diet may be offered for management of functional GI symptoms in IBD with careful attention to nutritional adequacy. Best practice advice 6: Psychological therapies (cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnotherapy, mindfulness therapy) should be considered in IBD patients with functional symptoms. Best practice advice 7: Osmotic and stimulant laxative should be offered to IBD patients with chronic constipation. Best practice advice 8: Hypomotility agents or bile-acid sequestrants may be used for chronic diarrhea in quiescent IBD. Best practice advice 9: Antispasmodics, neuropathic-directed agents, and anti-depressants should be used for functional pain in IBD while use of opiates should be avoided. Best practice advice 10: Probiotics may be considered for treatment of functional symptoms in IBD. Best practice advice 11: Pelvic floor therapy should be offered to IBD patients with evidence of an underlying defecatory disorder. Best practice advice 12: Until further evidence is available,    should not be offered for treatment of functional GI symptoms in IBD. Best practice advice 13: Physical exercise should be encourage in IBD patients with functional GI symptoms. Best practice advice 14: Until further evidence is available, complementary and alternative therapies should not be routinely offered for functional symptoms in IBD.

Strategies to prevent and treat type  diabetes through manipulation of the gut  are being developed. These include replacement of the gut  by  , consumption of fibres to promote the function and growth of beneficial bacteria and treatment with probiotic bacterial strains. Furthermore, it has been shown that many drugs, including drugs used for treatment of diabetes, have major impacts on gut  and, thereby, potentially on glucose metabolism. In particular, the commonly used drug metformin has been shown to influence the functional capacity of the gut , and recent evidence indicates that this may contribute to the antidiabetes effect of metformin.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

However, there is also evidence that FMT can be effective in treating obesity. This pilot study established the approval and willingness of obese patients to undergo FMT.We conducted a survey of adults with obesity using a questionnaire containing 21 both multiple choice and open questions was dispatched to a cohort of 101 persons with obesity. It included questions aiming at the process of FMT itself, donors as well as possible concerns. Additionally aspects of social background and disease activity were dealt with.The response rate amounted to 30.1% ( = 31). In our population, mean BMI was 40.5 kg/m while the vast majority already tried out treatment modalities to lose weight before. 25.8% of persons with obesity were aware of FMT. 62.1% were willing to undergo FMT if the donor was healthy and anonymous while only 6.9% clearly refused this option. Sixty preferred an anonymous donor or a person proposed by their doctor while colonoscopy was the preferred application by 76.7%. The absence of risks of the procedure (47.8%) formed the principal motivation while reduction of medication was considered as least important reason (in 26.1). Insufficient testing of the faeces concerning infections raised the most concerns (in 61.6%).For the majority of the persons with obesity surveyed FMT represents a treatment option. Approximately two thirds of the questionees would consider FMT as an alternative treatment option, even in spite of a satisfactory disease response to current standard therapies. Unsurprisingly there are concerns in regard to the transmission of possible infectious agents as well as to the hygieneic implementation of FMT itself.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29880966>Celiac Disease and   : A New Beginning?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728388>   in Experimental Ulcerative Colitis Reveals Associated Gut Microbial and Host Metabolic Reprogramming.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is gaining attention for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Data from individual case studies have suggested that FMT may be beneficial for UC, but the detailed microbial and molecular basis remains unknown. Here, we employ 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics to investigate the influence of FMT on gut microbial community composition and host metabolism in the dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC rat model. The findings from this pilot study suggest that FMT from normal donors to UC recipients could alleviate UC symptoms without close resemblance of donor's gut microbial and metabolic pattern. Meanwhile, FMT from UC donors to normal recipient rats triggered UC symptoms, UC-prone microbial shift, and host metabolic adaption. Gut  under normal conditions could maintain stable species richness and diversity upon FMT intervention, but the disturbed gut  under UC conditions could not maintain such homeostasis. Significant correlations between altered bacterial composition and host metabolism could be assigned to the pathological effects of UC (accounting for 8.0 to 16.% of total variance) and/or the FMT intervention effects (3.9 to 7.0% of total variance). Overall, our study reveals diverse gut microbial shifts in UC related FMT and their association with host metabolic reprogramming. This study combined clinical symptoms measurement, 16S rRNA gene microbial profiling and metabolomics to comprehensively investigate the gut bacterial and host metabolic association and reprogramming in FMT-treated experimental UC. These data can advance our understanding of the effect of FMT on UC and the involvement of gut microbial dysbiosis in the development of UC.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598584>Five years of    - an update of the Israeli experience.</a></h2><p>To evaluate and describe the efficacy of    (FMT) for  infection (CDI) in a national Israeli cohort.All patients who received FMT for recurrent (recurrence within 8 wk of the previous treatment) or refractory CDI from 2013 through 2017 in all the five medical centers in Israel currently performing FMT were included. Stool donors were screened according to the Israeli Ministry of Health guidelines. Clinical and laboratory data of patients were collected from patients' medical files, and they included indications for FMT, risk factors for CDI and disease severity. Primary outcome was FMT success (at least  mo free of CDI-related diarrhea post-FMT). Secondary outcomes included initial response to FMT (cessation of diarrhea within 7 d) and recurrence at 6 mo.There were 111 FMTs for CDI, with a median age of 70 years [interquartile range (IQR): 53-82], and 42% (47) males. Fifty patients (45%) were treated  the lower gastrointestinal (LGI, represented only by colonoscopy) route, 37 (33%)  capsules, and 24 (22%)  the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) route. The overall success rate was 87.4% (97 patients), with no significant difference between routes of administration ( = 0.338). In the univariant analysis, FMT success correlated with milder disease ( = 0.01), ambulatory setting ( < 0.05) and lower Charlson comorbidity score ( < 0.05). In the multivariant analysis, only severe CDI [odd ratio (OR) = 0.14,  < 0.05] and inpatient FMT (OR = 0.19,  < 0.05) were each independently inversely related to FMT success. There were 35 (32%) patients younger than 60 years of age, and 14 (40%) of them had a background of inflammatory bowel disease.FMT is a safe and effective treatment for CDI, with capsules emerging as a successful and well-tolerated route. Severe CDI is less likely to respond to FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332392>Gut -bile acid-interleukin-22 axis orchestrates polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries, and is often accompanied by insulin resistance. The mechanism of ovulatory dysfunction and insulin resistance in PCOS remains elusive, thus limiting the development of therapeutics. Improved metabolic health is associated with a relatively high  gene content and increased microbial diversity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the gut  and its metabolites on the regulation of PCOS-associated ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance. Here, we report that Bacteroides vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut  of individuals with PCOS, accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid levels.  of   from women with PCOS or B. vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian functions, insulin resistance, altered bile acid metabolism, reduced interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS. This study suggests that modifying the gut , altering bile acid metabolism and/or increasing IL-22 levels may be of value for the treatment of PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30055267>  : Current Status in Treatment of GI and Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>   was originally introduced as a method to repair intestinal  following failure of multiple treatments of recurrent Clostridiumdifficile infection with antibiotics.

The proportion of severe cases is significantly elevating and clinicians now have to contend with the problem of additional and more frequent episodes of recurrences including an upward trend in the mortality rate. This situation led us to investigate the possibility of the    (FMT). An amount of 100 ml of   solution was instilled into a nasojejunal (NJ) tube in 16 cases and into a nasogastric (NG) tube in 44 cases. In all of the cases, where the solution was instilled via nasojejunal tubes, the symptoms resolved within 24 h. We did not note any recurrences in this group. When the material was flushed in through nasogastric tubes, the symptoms resolved in 39 (88.64%) cases within 24 h. In this group, we have experienced a recurrent episode of  infection in five (11.36%) cases. Three of them were cured with a second . We have found that in our practice the upper gastrointestinal tract methods had the primary cure rate of 91.67%, whereas the secondary cure rate is 96.67%. When we compared the NJ and NG methods, we have found that the differences in the outcomes are not significant statistically ( = 0.3113 using Fisher's exact probability test).

Malnutrition perturbs the infant gut  leading to sub-optimal functioning of the immune system and further predisposing infants to enteric infections. Therefore, we hypothesized that malnutrition exacerbates rotavirus disease severity in infants.In the present study, we used a neonatal germ free (GF) piglets transplanted with a two-month-old human infant's   (HIFM) on protein deficient and sufficient diets. We report the effects of malnourishment on the HRV infection and the HIFM pig  in , intestinal and systemic tissues, using MiSeq 16S gene sequencing (V4-V5 region). analysis indicated that the HIFM  resulted in a microbial composition in pigs similar to that of the original infant . This model was then used to understand the interconnections between  diversity, diet, and HRV infection. Post HRV infection, HIFM pigs on the deficient diet had lower body weights, developed more severe diarrhea and increased virus shedding compared to HIFM pigs on sufficient diet. However, HRV induced diarrhea and shedding was more pronounced in non-colonized GF pigs compared to HIFM pigs on either sufficient or deficient diet, suggesting that the  alone moderated HRV infection. HRV infected pigs on sufficient diet showed increased  diversity in intestinal tissues; whereas, greater diversity was observed in systemic tissues of HRV infected pigs fed with deficient diet.These results suggest that proper nourishment improves the  quality in the intestines, alleviates HRV disease and lower probability of systemic translocation of potential opportunistic pathogens/pathobionts. In conclusion, our findings further support the role for  and proper nutrition in limiting enteric diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664020>The effect of surgical  stream diversion of the healthy colon on the colonic .</a></h2><p>The intestinal  plays an important role in intestinal health. After colonic diversion from the  stream, luminal nutrients for bacteria are expected to be depleted, inducing changes in microbial composition. In this study, we describe microbial changes in the healthy colon following surgical  stream diversion, studied in the surgically constructed sigmoid-derived neovagina.At various postoperative times after sigmoid vaginoplasty, rectal, neovaginal, and skin microbial swabs were obtained for microbial analysis by interspacer profiling, a PCR-based bacterial profiling technique. Differences in bacterial profiles, in terms of bacterial abundance and phylum diversity, were assessed. Microbial dissimilarities between anatomical locations were analyzed with principal coordinate analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis.Bacterial samples were obtained from 28 patients who underwent sigmoid vaginoplasty. By principal coordinate analysis, microbial profiles of samples from the sigmoid-derived neovagina were distinctively different from rectal samples. Partial least squares discriminant analysis showed that the most discriminative species derived from the phylum Bacteroidetes. The abundance and diversity of Bacteroidetes species were reduced following  stream diversion compared with rectal samples (median Shannon diversity index of .76 vs. .18, P<0.01). Similar abundance of Phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria was observed.By analyzing the microbiome of sigmoid-derived neovaginas, we studied the effects of  diversion on the microbial composition of the healthy intestine. Most changes were observed in the phylum Bacteroidetes, indicating that these bacteria are likely part of the diet-dependent (butyrate-producing) colonic microbiome. Bacteria of other phyla are likely to be part of the diet-independent microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30074108>Photobiomodulation of the microbiome: implications for metabolic and inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>The human microbiome is intimately associated with human health, with a role in obesity, metabolic diseases such as type  diabetes, and divergent diseases such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The microbiome can be changed by diet, probiotics, and faecal , which has flow-on effects to health outcomes. Photobiomodulation has a therapeutic effect on inflammation and neurological disorders (amongst others) and has been reported to influence metabolic disorders and obesity. The aim of this study was to examine the possibility that PBM could influence the microbiome of mice. Mice had their abdomen irradiated with red (660 nm) or infrared (808 nm) low-level laser, either as single or multiple doses, over a -week period. Genomic DNA extracted from faecal pellets was pyrosequenced for the 16S rRNA gene. There was a significant (p < 0.05) difference in microbial diversity between PBM- and sham-treated mice. One genus of bacterium (Allobaculum) significantly increased (p < 0.001) after infrared (but not red light) PBM by day 14. Despite being a preliminary trial with small experimental numbers, we have demonstrated for the first time that PBM can alter microbiome diversity in healthy mice and increase numbers of Allobaculum, a bacterium associated with a healthy microbiome. This change is most probably a result of PBMt affecting the host, which in turn influenced the microbiome. If this is confirmed in humans, the possibility exists for PBMt to be used as an adjunct therapy in treatment of obesity and other lifestyle-related disorders, as well as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The clinical implications of altering the microbiome using PBM warrants further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30450088>Clinical Efficacy and Microbiome Changes Following    in Children With Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) has been shown as an effective treatment for recurrent clostridium difficile infection (RCDI) in adults. In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of FMT in treating children with RCDI, and explore   changes during FMT treatment. A total of 11 RCDI subjects with a median age of 3.5 years were enrolled in this single-center prospective pilot study. All patients were cured (11/11, 100%) by FMT either through upper gastrointestinal tract route with a nasointestinal tube (13/16, 81.%) or lower gastrointestinal tract route with a rectal tube (3/16, 18.8%). The cure rate of single FMT was 63.6% (7/11), and 4 (4/11, 36.4%) cases were performed with  or 3 times of FMT. Mild adverse events were reported in 4 children (4/11, 36.4%), including transient diarrhea, mild abdominal pain, transient fever and vomit. Gut  composition analysis of 59  samples collected from 34 participants (9 RCDI children, 9 donors and 16 health controls) showed that the  diversity was lower in pediatric RCDI patients before FMT than the healthy controls and donors, and  microbial community of pre-FMT samples ( diversity) was apart from that of healthy controls and donors. No significant differences in  diversity,  diversity or phylogenetic distance were detected between donors and healthy controls. Both the richness and diversity of gut  were improved in the pediatric RCDI patients after FMT, and the bacteria community was shifted closer to the donor and healthy control group. Furthermore, FMT re-directed gut microbiome functions of pediatric RCDI toward a health state. Our results indicate that it is safe and tolerant to use FMT in treating pediatric RCDI. FMT shifted the gut microbiome composition and function in children with RCDI toward a healthy state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483574>  : Current status and challenges in China.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519847>   Capsules with Targeted Colonic Versus Gastric Delivery in Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection: A Comparative Cohort Analysis of High and Lose Dose.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium. difficile infection (rCDI).

Dysbiosis induced by the exposure to antibiotics reveals the potential therapeutic role of    (FMT) in these patients. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the safety and potential benefit of rescue FMT for AAD in critically ill patients.A series of critically ill patients with AAD received rescue FMT from Chinese fmtBank, from September 2015 to February 2019. Adverse events (AEs) and rescue FMT success which focused on the improvement of abdominal symptoms and post-ICU survival rate during a minimum of 12 weeks follow-up were assessed.Twenty critically ill patients with AAD underwent rescue FMT, and 18 of them were included for analysis. The mean of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 21.7 ± 8.3 (range 11-37). Thirteen patients received FMT through nasojejunal tube, four through gastroscopy, and one through enema. Patients were treated with four (4. ± .1, range -9) types of antibiotics before and during the onset of AAD. 38.9% (7/18) of patients had FMT-related AEs during follow-up, including increased diarrhea frequency, abdominal pain, increased serum amylase, and fever. Eight deaths unrelated to FMT occurred during follow-up. One hundred percent (/) of abdominal pain, 86.7% (13/15) of diarrhea, 69.% (9/13) of abdominal distention, and 50% (1/) of hematochezia were improved after FMT. 44.4% (8/18) of patients recovered from abdominal symptoms without recurrence and survived for a minimum of 12 weeks after being discharged from ICU.In this case series studying the use of FMT in critically ill patients with AAD, good clinical outcomes without infectious complications were observed.

GM, which is also called "the new virtual metabolic organ", makes axis with a number of extraintestinal organs, such as kidneys, brain, cardiovascular, and the bone system. The gut-liver axis has attracted greater attention in recent years. GM communication is bi-directional and involves endocrine and immunological mechanisms. In this way, gut-dysbiosis and composition of "ancient"  could be linked to pathogenesis of numerous chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic hepatitis C (CHC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), development of liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this paper, we discuss the current evidence supporting a GM role in the management of different chronic liver diseases and potential new therapeutic GM targets, like  , antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics. We conclude that population-level shifts in GM could play a regulatory role in the gut-liver axis and, consequently, etiopathogenesis of chronic liver diseases.
