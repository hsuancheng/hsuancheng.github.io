The aim of the present study is the evaluation of tissue classification approaches based on various datasets derived from the molecular profile of the organic solvent extracts of a tissue. A set of possibilities are considered for the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis: all mass spectrometric peaks over 300 counts threshold; subset of peaks selected by ranking with support vector machine algorithm; peaks selected by random forest algorithm; peaks with the statistically significant difference of the intensity determined by the Mann-Whitney U-test; peaks identified as lipids; both identified and significantly different peaks. The best predictive potential is obtained for OPLS-DA model built on nonpolar glycerolipids (Q = 0.64, AUC = 0.95), the second one is OPLS-DA model with lipid peaks selected by random forest algorithm (Q = 0.58, AUC = 0.87). Moreover, models based on particular molecular classes are more preferable from biological point of view, resulting in new explanatory mechanisms of pathophysiology and providing a pathway analysis. Another promising features for OPLS-DA modeling are phosphatidylethanolamines (Q = 0.48, AUC = 0.86).This article is protected by copyright.

And It is well known that apatite compound phosphors are one of the most promising optical materials to realize those above because of their unique structure enhanced luminescence properties and thermal stability. Here, we synthesized a co-doped single phase apatite phosphors CaLa(SiO)O:Dy/Sm (CLSO:Dy/Sm) for white light emission, which was provided with excellent thermal stability and of which luminescence intensity at 150 °C still was 92 percentage of that at room temperature. Moreover, X-ray diffraction technique, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope were employed to characterization of phase structure and morphology, and consequently pure apatite structure and gravel-like morphology of phosphors were proved. Analysis of photoluminescence spectra indicated that concentration quenching effect exist in single-doped CLSO:Dy phosphors owing to dipole-dipole interaction between Dy ions. It is revealed that maybe exist Dy ↔ Sm bilateral non-radiative  transfer processes in Dy/Sm co-doped CLSO system by PL spectra and decay curves. And variation of Sm ion concentration can control color emission, namely CIE chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperature, finally to achieve white light emission (0.309,0.309) with CCT 6848 K, able to be a potential candidate for commercial lighting applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663330>High Performance Sm-doped Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbZrO3-PbTiO3 Based Piezoceramics.</a></h2><p>High-performance piezoelectric materials are pivotal to many electromechanical applications from piezoelectric actuators, sensors to transducers. However, the general approach to achieve high piezoelectric properties by establishing morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) has limitation due to the weak anisotropy of the Gibbs free  profile at MPB region. Here, aliovalent Sm3+ doped 0.4Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-(0.6-x)PbZrO3-xPbTiO3 piezoelectric ceramics were fabricated by solid state method, where the optimized piezoelectric coefficient d33 = 910 pC/N, dielectric constant εr = 4090 and Curie temperature TC =184 °C, were obtained at x=0.352, being attributed to the synergistic contributions from the MPB and enhanced local structural heterogeneity. Rayleigh analysis was adopted to study the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in Sm-doped PMN-PZ-PT ceramics, where the extrinsic contribution was found to be on the order of 25-67% at 4 kV/cm. Of particular significance is that a large signal d33* = 820 pm/V (at 20 kV/cm) with minimal strain variation of 5% was achieved for composition of x=0.372 over temperature range of 20-160 °C, being superior to those previously reported piezoelectric ceramic materials. This work offers a good paradigm to simultaneously achieve high piezoelectric properties with good temperature stability in ferroelectric ceramics, which have great potential for piezoelectric application at elevated temperature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661282>Tuning Single-Atom Electron Spin Resonance in a Vector-Magnetic Field.</a></h2><p>Spin resonance of single spin centers bears great potential for chemical structure analysis, quantum sensing and quantum coherent manipulation. Essential for these experiments is the presence of a two-level spin system whose  splitting can be chosen by applying a magnetic field. In recent years, a combination of electron spin resonance (ESR) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been demonstrated as a technique to detect magnetic properties of single atoms on surfaces and to achieve sub-μeV  resolution. Nevertheless, up to now the role of the required magnetic fields has not been elucidated. Here, we perform single-atom ESR on individual Fe atoms adsorbed on magnesium oxide (MgO), using a 2D vector magnetic field as well as the local field of the magnetic STM tip in a commercially available STM. We show how the ESR amplitude can be greatly improved by optimizing the magnetic fields, revealing in particular an enhanced signal at large in-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we demonstrate that the stray field from the magnetic STM tip is a versatile tool. We use it here to drive the electron spin more efficiently and to perform ESR measurements at constant frequency by employing tip-field sweeps. Lastly, we show that it is possible to perform ESR using only the tip field, under zero external magnetic field, which promises to make this technique available in many existing STM systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663244>Emerging Delivery Strategies of Carbon Monoxide for Therapeutic Applications: from CO Gas to CO Releasing Nanomaterials.</a></h2><p>Carbon monoxide (CO) therapy has emerged as a hot topic under exploration in the field of gas therapy as it shows the promise of treating various diseases. Due to the gaseous property and the high affinity for human hemoglobin, the main challenges of administrating medicinal CO are the lack of target selectivity as well as the toxic profile at relatively high concentrations. Although abundant CO releasing molecules (CORMs) with the capacity to deliver CO in biological systems have been developed, several disadvantages related to CORMs, including random diffusion, poor solubility, potential toxicity, and lack of on-demand CO release in deep tissue, still confine their practical use. Recently, the advent of versatile nanomedicine has provided a promising chance for improving the properties of naked CORMs and simultaneously realizing the therapeutic applications of CO. This review presents a brief summarization of the emerging delivery strategies of CO based on nanomaterials for therapeutic application. First, an introduction covering the therapeutic roles of CO and several frequently used CORMs is provided. Then, recent advancements in the synthesis and application of versatile CO releasing nanomaterials are elaborated. Finally, the current challenges and future directions of these important delivery strategies are proposed.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This mismatch results in an excess of fat storage in ectopic depots, notably in the liver and viscera (= hepato-visceral, or central fat). There is still no FDA-approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. The prime aim should be a preferential loss of central fat, through lifestyle measures. Failure to sustain these measures is frequent, and the standard approach is to add an estroprogestagen contraceptive, even for girls who do not need contraception. Treatment with SPIOMET, a low-dose combination of spironolactone (to antagonize androgen and mineralocorticoid effects, and to activate BAT thereby raising  expenditure), pioglitazone (to raise circulating HMW adiponectin concentrations) and metformin, is an alternative approach that holds the potential to revert the PCOS phenotype.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661645>Co-expression of cellulase and xylanase genes in  toward enhanced bioethanol production from corn stover.</a></h2><p>Lignocellulose is considered as a good resource for producing renewable . Previous  studies have shown the synergistic action between cellulase and xylanase during lignocellulose biohydrolysis. In order to achieve the same effect in  to enhance the practical biotransformation, two recombinant  strains (-CBH-CA and -CBH-TS) with co-expressed cellulase and xylanase were constructed.

These traits, in turn, are influenced by a variety of environmental parameters such as temperature and precipitation, particularly in ectothermic taxa such as amphibians and reptiles. Over the past several decades, severe and prolonged episodes of drought are becoming commonplace throughout North America. Documentation of responses to this environmental crisis, however, is often incomplete, particularly in cryptic species. Here, we investigated reproduction in a population of pitviper snakes (copperhead, Agkistrodon contortrix), a live-bearing capital breeder. This population experienced a severe drought from 2012 through 2016. We tested whether declines in number of progeny were linked to this drought. Decline in total number offspring was significant, but offspring length and mass were unaffected. Reproductive output was positively impacted by precipitation and negatively impacted by high temperatures. We hypothesized that severe declines of prey species (e.g., cicada, amphibians, and small mammals) reduced  acquisition during drought, negatively impacting reproductive output of the snakes. Support for this view was found using the periodical cicada (Magicicada spp.) as a proxy for prey availability. Various climate simulations, including our own qualitative analysis, predict that drought events will continue unabated throughout the geographic distribution of copperheads which suggests that long-term monitoring of populations are needed to better understand geographic variation in drought resilience and cascading impacts of drought phenomena on ecosystem function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664112>Polymer-Salt Aqueous Two-Phase System (ATPS) Micro-Droplets for Cell Encapsulation.</a></h2><p>Biosample encapsulation is a critical step in a wide range of biomedical and bioengineering applications. Aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) droplets have been recently introduced and showed a great promise to the biological separation and encapsulation due to their excellent biocompatibility. This study shows for the first time the passive generation of salt-based ATPS microdroplets and their biocompatibility test. We used two ATPS including polymer/polymer (polyethylene glycol (PEG)/dextran (DEX)) and polymer/salt (PEG/Magnesium sulfate) for droplet generation in a flow-focusing geometry. Droplet morphologies and monodispersity in both systems are studied. The PEG/salt system showed an excellent capability of uniform droplet formation with a wide range of sizes (20-60 μm) which makes it a suitable candidate for encapsulation of biological samples. Therefore, we examined the potential application of the PEG/salt system for encapsulating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). A cell viability test was conducted on MgSO solutions at various concentrations and our results showed an adequate cell survival. The findings of this research suggest that the polymer/salt ATPS could be a biocompatible all-aqueous platform for cell encapsulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663669>Preventive antibiotic treatment of calves: emergence of dysbiosis causing propagation of obese state-associated and mobile multidrug resistance-carrying bacteria.</a></h2><p>In agriculture, antibiotics are used for the treatment and prevention of livestock disease. Antibiotics perturb the bacterial gut composition but the extent of these changes and potential consequences for animal and human health is still debated. Six calves were housed in a controlled environment. Three animals received an injection of the antibiotic florfenicol (Nuflor), and three received no treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 3 and 7 days, and bacterial communities were profiled to assess the impact of a therapy on the gut microbiota. Phylogenetic analysis (16S-rDNA) established that at day 7, antibiotic-treated microbiota showed a 10-fold increase in facultative anaerobic Escherichia spp, a signature of imbalanced microbiota, dysbiosis. The antibiotic resistome showed a high background of antibiotic resistance genes, which did not significantly change in response to florfenicol. However, the maintenance of Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded quinolone, oqxB and propagation of mcr-2, and colistin resistance genes were observed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The microbiota of treated animals was enriched with  harvesting bacteria, common to obese microbial communities. We propose that antibiotic treatment of healthy animals leads to unbalanced, disease- and obese-related microbiota that promotes growth of E. coli carrying resistance genes on mobile elements, potentially increasing the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria to humans.© 2019 The Authors.

Herein, a facile strategy was carried out to construct triple-shelled Co-VSex nanocages, starting via an ion-exchange process about Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanopolyhedrons and VO3-, followed by the formation of triple-shelled Co-VSex hollow nanocages during the process of rising the solvothermal temperature under the assistance of SeO32-. Meanwhile, triple-shelled Co-VSx and yolk-double shell Co-VOx nanocages were fabricated as references by a similar process. Benefiting from the larger surface areas and more electrolyte adsorption sites, the triple-shelled Co-VSex nanocages exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performances when applied as the electrochemical catalysts for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More concretely, the DSSC based on Co-VSex counter electrode (CE) showed outstanding power conversion efficiency of 9.68% when Pt counterpart was 8.46%. Moreover, Co-VSex electrocatalyst exhibited prominent HER performance with a low onset overpotential of 40 mV and a small Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec-1 in acid solution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665018>A metabolic reconstruction of Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112 and analysis of its potential as a cell factory.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative Lactic Acid Bacterium (LAB) that is commonly used for food fermentations and probiotic purposes. Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale metabolic models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational metabolic engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate metabolic model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the metabolism were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic pathways, the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathways, varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these pathways result in different  yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these pathways in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central metabolism demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general metabolic engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict metabolic behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663092>Screening the 4f-electron spin of TbPc single-molecule magnets on metal substrates by ligand channeling.</a></h2><p>Bis(phthalocyaninato)lanthanide (LnPc2) double-decker-based devices have recently attracted a great deal of interest for data encoding purposes. Although the 4f-electrons of lanthanide ions play a key role in the experimental methodology, their localized character, deeper in  compared to the 3d electrons of transition metals, hampers a detailed investigation. Here, our approach consists of the follow-up of the entanglement process with other molecules and with the substrate electrons by means of space-resolved detection of the Kondo resonance by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), using different substrates (from weak to strong interaction). It is found that TbPc2 molecules firstly interact with their environment by means of the π-radicals of the ligand. The radical spin of TbPc2 can be identified by STS on a weakly interacting substrate such as Au(111). In the case of a Ag(111) substrate, we are able to analyze the effect of an electron transfer on the molecule (pairing-up of the radical spin) and the subsequent quenching of the Kondo resonance. Finally, on a strongly interacting substrate such as Cu(111), a significant rearrangement of electrons takes place and the Kondo screening of the 4f electrons of the Tb ion of TbPc2 is observed. By comparative STS measurements on YPc2, that has empty 4d and 4f shells, we prove that the Kondo resonance measured in the center of the TbPc2 molecule indeed stems from the 4f-electrons. At the same time, we provide evidence for the hybridization of the 4f states with the π electron.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661451>Adsorption behavior of diclofenac-containing wastewater on three kinds of sewage sludge.</a></h2><p>Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the water environment. One of the main removal routes of DCF in wastewater is sludge adsorption, and the mechanisms need to be investigated. In this study, the effects of adsorption time, temperature, pH value, and ionic strength on the adsorption of DCF on suspended particles (SP), secondary sedimentation tank sludge (SSTS) and concentrated sludge (CS) were investigated. The results showed that most of the adsorption of DCF by the three matrices was conducted in the first 4 h and equilibrium was achieved at 8 h. The adsorption kinetics were well fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and the rate constants were 0.29-0.88 mg·(μg·min), with chemical adsorption as the dominant one. Adsorption isotherm conformed to Freundlich, Langmuir and Linear adsorption isotherm models. The order of adsorption capacity was: CS > SSTS > SP, which was proportional to the organic matter content and specific surface area of the adsorbents. The decrease of the pH value and the increase of ionic strength promoted the adsorption of DCF. The results can provide data support for the removal of DCF from different treatment unit types in wastewater treatment plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661445>Bio-stimulation of anaerobic digestion by low intensity ultrasonication.</a></h2><p>Low intensity ultrasonication (US) was applied to stimulate the biological activities in anaerobic digestion (AD) process. The enhancement in methane production was used to investigate the sono-biostimulation effects on the process performance. The 32% higher CH production was observed over control at best US intensity and irradiation time of 0.0028 W/mL and 120 s, respectively. The sono-biostimulation effects in terms of higher CH generation over control lasted for 45 h. The increase in the concentration of NH-N and K considered the indication of cell lysis under applied US conditions. At best US intensity and irradiation time, the NH-N and K fraction in the medium remained similar as of control, which indicated that no cell lysis occurred. The preliminary findings of the study showed that low intensity US can be a promising solution to enhance the process efficiency in terms of higher methane production with minimal  requirement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661280>Ion Pairing Controls Physical Properties of Ionic Liquid-Solvent Mixtures.</a></h2><p>The dissolution of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) in organic solvents has been shown to enhance ion dynamics. We previously used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the ionic liquid ([BMIM+][Tf2N-]) in 22 unique solvents over a wide range of concentrations. By screening over a large parameter space, we reached several conclusions: (1) ion diffusivity increases monotonically as a function of increasing ionic liquid composition (2) pure solvent diffusivity strongly correlates with ion diffusivity and (3) conductivity predicted by the Nernst-Einstein (NE) Equation is maximum at intermediate compositions of ionic liquid. Building off this work, we now utilize the same parameter space to study the structure of ([BMIM+][Tf2N-]) solvated in organic solvents. We explore ion correlations through a number of structural and thermodynamic properties, including liquid density, pair correlation functions, ion pairing and ion caging lifetimes, and free  calculations. Through these analyses, we find that some solvents are much more effective at screening ion-ion interactions than others and that these differences impact the ion dynamics in these mixtures. In general, the strong pairing of ionic liquids negatively impacts transport properties, but some solvents can robustly screen these interactions, resulting in greatly enhanced ion dynamics. These results uncover trends connecting ionic liquid structure to transport, which can help in the design of new electrolytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663326>Electron Microscopy Characterisation of P3 Lines and Laser Scribing-induced Perovskite Decomposition in Perovskite Solar Modules.</a></h2><p>Hybrid metal halide perovskites have emerged as a potential photovoltaic material for low-cost thin film solar cells due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, high efficiencies obtained with lab-scale cells are difficult to replicate in large modules. The upscaling process requires careful optimisation of multiple steps, such as laser scribing which divides a module into serially connected cells using a pulsed laser beam. In this work, we characterise the effect of laser scribing on the perovskite layer adjacent to a P3 scribe line using analytical scanning and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy techniques. We demonstrate that lateral flow of residual thermal  from picosecond laser pulses decomposes the perovskite layer over extended length scales. We propose that the exact nature of the change in perovskite composition is determined by the presence of pre-existing PbI2 grains, and hence by the original perovskite formation reaction. Furthermore, we show that along the P3 lines, the indium tin oxide electron transport layer is also damaged by high-fluence pulses. Our results provide a deeper understanding on the interaction between laser pulses and perovskite solar modules, highlighting the need to minimise material damage by careful tuning of both laser parameters and device fabrication procedure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664111>Enhanced Stability of MAPbI Perovskite Solar Cells using Poly(p-chloro-xylylene) Encapsulation.</a></h2><p>We demonstrated an effective poly(p-chloro-xylylene) (Parylene-C) encapsulation method for MAPbI solar cells. By structural and optical analysis, we confirmed that Parylene-C efficiently slowed the decomposition reaction in MAPbI. From a water permeability test with different encapsulating materials, we found that Parylene-C-coated MAPbI perovskite was successfully passivated from reaction with water, owing to the hydrophobic behavior of Parylene-C. As a result, the Parylene-C-coated MAPbI solar cells showed better device stability than uncoated cells, virtually maintaining the initial power conversion efficiency value (15.5 ± 0.3%) for 196 h.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665541>Detective Efficiency of Photon Counting Detectors with Spectral Degradation and Crosstalk.</a></h2><p>Charge sharing and migration of scattered and fluorescence photons in an  discriminating photon counting detector (PCD) degrade the detector's  response and can cause a single incident photon to be registered as multiple events at different energies among neighboring pixels, leading to spatio-energetic correlation. Such a correlation in conventional linear, space-invariant imaging system can be usefully characterized by the frequency dependent detective quantum efficiency DQE(f). Defining and estimating DQE(f) for PCDs in a manner consistent with that of conventional detectors is complicated because the traditional definition of DQE(f) does not address spectral information.We introduce the concept of presampling spectroscopic detective quantum efficiency, DQE (f), and present an analysis of it for CdTe PCDs using a spatial domain method that starts from a previously described analytic computation of spatio-energetic crosstalk. DQE (f) is estimated as the squared signal-to-noise ratio of the amplitude of a small-signal sinusoidal modulation of the object (cortical bone) thickness at frequency f estimated using data from the detector under consideration compared that obtained from the photon distribution incident on the detector. DQE for material decomposition (spectral) and effective monoenergetic imaging tasks for different pixel pitch is studied based on the multi-pixel Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) that accounts for inter pixel basis material correlation. Effective monoenergetic DQE is estimated from the CRLB of a linear weighted combination of basis materials, and its  dependence is also studied.Zero frequency DQE for the spectral task was ~18%, 25% and 34% for 250 μm, 500 μm and 1 mm detector pixels, respectively. Inter pixel signal correlation results in positive noise correlation between same basis material estimates of neighboring pixels, resulting in least impact on DQE at the detector's Nyquist frequency. Effective monoenergetic DQE (0) at the optimal  is relatively tolerant of spectral degradation (85-91% depending on pixel size), but is highly dependent on the selected effective , with maximum variation (in 250 μm pixels) of 17% to 85% for effective  between 30 to 120 keV.Our results show that spatio-energetic correlations degrade DQE (f) beyond what is lost by poor spectral response in a single detector element. The positive correlation between computed single basis material values in neighboring pixels results in the penalty to DQE (f) to be the least at the Nyquist frequency of the detector. It is desirable to reduce spectral degradation and crosstalk to minimize the impact on system performance. Larger pixels sizes have better spatio-energetic response due to lower of charge sharing and escape of scatter and K-fluorescence photons, and therefore higher DQE (0). Effective monoenergetic DQE (0) at the optimal  is much less affected by spectral degradation and crosstalk compared to DQE for spectral tasks.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664465>Antegrade versus retrograde screw fixation of anterior column acetabular fractures: a biomechanical in vitro study.</a></h2><p>To compare the mechanical strength of antegrade versus retrograde lag screw fixation of anterior column acetabular fractures.Standardised anterior column fractures were created in synthetic pelvis models and stabilised by either antegrade (ANTE, n = 4) or retrograde (RETRO, n = 4) anterior column screw fixation. In a validated setup, a cyclic loading protocol was applied with increasing axial force (750 cycles, 250-750 N) followed by load to failure. Construct survival,  absorbed, construct stiffness, and load to failure were assessed. Descriptive and opto-metric methods were used to describe the mode of failure.All constructs failed with loads below 1500 N. With regard to  absorbed until failure, the ANTE group resisted to 3.763 × 10 N*cycles (range 3.760 × 10-3.763 × 10) and the RETRO group to 3.762 × 10 N*cycles (range 3.761 × 10-3.765 × 10; p = 1.0). The load to failure was 1254 N (range 977-1299) in the ANTE group and 1234 N (range 1087-1456) in the RETRO group (p = 1.0). Construct stiffness with 250 N was not different between the two groups (ANTE 192 N/mm vs. RETRO 215 N/mm, p = 0.486).

An analysis of the OPEX sensitivity to 12 individual parameters (labour cost, flux, electrical  cost, membrane life, feed COD, membrane cost, membrane air-scour rate, chemicals cost, waste disposal cost, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, recirculation ratio, and transmembrane pressure) revealed OPEX to be most sensitive to labour effort and/or costs for all scenarios considered other than a large (100,000 m/day capacity) works, for which flux and electrical  costs were found to be slightly more influential. It was concluded that for small- to medium-sized plants cost savings are best made through improving the robustness of plants to limit manual intervention necessitated by unforeseen events, such as electrical/mechanical failure, foaming or sludging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663068>The ability of calcaneal and multisite quantitative ultrasound variables in the identification of osteoporosis in women and men.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the ability of calcaneal and multisite quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters in the identification of osteoporosis in women and men.A total of 131 women (mean age 53.7±11.9 years; range, 21 to 79 years) and 109 men (mean age 57.8±13.7 years; range, 24 to 85 years) whose bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine and proximal femur was measured between January 2010 and January 2012, using dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were included. Acoustic bone properties were also examined using both a calcaneal and a multisite QUS. The receiver operating characteristic analysis with the calculation of areas under the curve (AUCs) to evaluate the ability of both QUS devices for the identification of osteoporosis. We also calculated a lower and an upper threshold at a specificity of 90% and at a sensitivity of 90%, respectively, for the identification of osteoporosis along with a threshold/cut-off value with the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.All calcaneal QUS parameters showed significant AUCs within the range of 0.712 (for Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation [BUA]) and 0.764 (for Speed of Sound [SOS]) in women and ranging from 0.661 (for BUA) to 0.735 (for SOS) in men, while only radial SOS of the multisite QUS demonstrated a significant AUC value of 0.661 for identifying osteoporosis in women. A Quantitative Ultrasound Index T-score of -1.53 for women and -1.68 for men showed sensitivity and specificities around 70%.Based on the results of this study, all calcaneal QUS parameters in both women and men and possibly radial SOS measurements of the multisite QUS in women may be helpful for the identification of osteoporosis.Copyright © 2019, Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661681>Modeling nonadiabatic dynamics in condensed matter materials: Some recent advances and applications.</a></h2><p>This review focuses on recent developments in the field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD), with particular attention given to condensed-matter systems. NA-MD simulations for small molecular systems can be performed using high-level electronic structure calculations, methods accounting for the quantization of nuclear motion, and using fewer approximations in the dynamical methodology itself. Modeling condensed-matter systems imposes many limitations on various aspects of NA-MD computations, requiring approximations at various levels of theory - from the electronic structure, to the ways in which the coupling of electrons and nuclei are accounted for. Nonetheless, the approximate treatment of NA-MD in condensed-phase materials has gained a spin lately in many applied studies. A number of advancements of the methodology and computational tools have been undertaken, including general-purpose methods as well as those tailored to nanoscale and condensed matter systems. This review summarizes such methodological and software developments, puts them into the broader context of existing approaches, and highlights some of the challenges that remain to be solved.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663294>Recent Advances of Porous Graphene: Synthesis, Functionalization, and Electrochemical Applications.</a></h2><p>Graphene is a 2D sheet of sp bonded carbon atoms and tends to aggregate together, due to the strong π-π stacking and van der Waals attraction between different layers. Its unique properties such as a high specific surface area and a fast mass transport rate are severely blocked. To address these issues, various kinds of 2D holey graphene and 3D porous graphene are either self-assembled from graphene layers or fabricated using graphene related materials such as graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide. Porous graphene not only possesses unique pore structures, but also introduces abundant exposed edges and accelerates mass transfer. The properties and applications of these porous graphenes and their composites/hybrids have been extensively studied in recent years. Herein, recent progress and achievements in synthesis and functionalization of various 2D holey graphene and 3D porous graphene are reviewed. Of special interest, electrochemical applications of porous graphene and its hybrids in the fields of electrochemical sensing, electrocatalysis, and electrochemical  storage, are highlighted. As the closing remarks, the challenges and opportunities for the future research of porous graphene and its composites are discussed and outlined.© 2019 The Authors.

Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant  expenditure, acid-base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for oxygen mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of oxygen and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661246>Single-Molecule Analysis and Engineering of DNA Motors.</a></h2><p>Molecular motors are diverse enzymes that transduce chemical  into mechanical work and, in doing so, perform critical cellular functions such as DNA replication and transcription, DNA supercoiling, intracellular transport, and ATP synthesis. Single-molecule techniques have been extensively used to identify structural intermediates in the reaction cycles of molecular motors and to understand how substeps in  consumption drive transitions between the intermediates. Here, we review a broad spectrum of single-molecule tools and techniques such as optical and magnetic tweezers, atomic force microscopy (AFM), single-molecule fluorescence resonance  transfer (smFRET), nanopore tweezers, and hybrid techniques that increase the number of observables. These methods enable the manipulation of individual biomolecules via the application of forces and torques and the observation of dynamic conformational changes in single motor complexes. We also review how these techniques have been applied to study various motors such as helicases, DNA and RNA polymerases, topoisomerases, nucleosome remodelers, and motors involved in the condensation, segregation, and digestion of DNA. In-depth analysis of mechanochemical coupling in molecular motors has made the development of artificially engineered motors possible. We review techniques such as mutagenesis, chemical modifications, and optogenetics that have been used to re-engineer existing molecular motors to have, for instance, altered speed, processivity, or functionality. We also discuss how single-molecule analysis of engineered motors allows us to challenge our fundamental understanding of how molecular motors transduce .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662029>Ion channels as potential redox sensors in lysosomes.</a></h2><p>Lysosomes are central organelles that recycle materials and  to maintain intracellular homeostasis.

The aim was to investigate the impact of different labial designs on mouthguard performance.Five different custom-fabricated ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) types of mouthguards with varying thickness and different labial inserts (polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG), nylon mesh, air space) were tested with a triangulation laser sensor during different  blows, generated with a pendulum testing device. The pendulum hits were applied to the center of a pivoted tooth crown in a custom-built upper jaw model. Measurements were executed with the mouthguards on the model and with no mouthguard as a negative control.Tooth deflection was reduced with all mouthguards in comparison to no mouthguard. Increasing mouthguard thickness improved the mouthguards' shock absorption capacities. Also, adding labial inserts increased their preventive qualities in ascending order: Mouthguard with a soft insert (nylon mesh), a hard insert (PETG), air space plus a hard insert (PETG).Increasing EVA foil thickness of a mouthguard, increasing labial thickness, and adding labial inserts (soft, stiff and air space) improve mouthguard shock absorption capabilities during small hard object collisions, thereby improving dental trauma prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664841>Reciprocal Control of Hierarchical DNA Origami-Nanoparticle Assemblies.</a></h2><p>DNA origami mechanisms offer promising tools for precision nanomanipulation of molecules or nanomaterials. Recent advances have extended the function of individual DNA origami devices to material scales via hierarchical assemblies. However, achieving rapid and precise control of large conformational changes in hierarchical assemblies remains a critical challenge. Here, we demonstrate a method for controlling DNA origami-nanoparticle assemblies through a multi-scale approach in which nanoparticles impart control on the conformation of individual DNA origami mechanisms, whereas DNA origami assemblies control the conformation of nanoparticle arrays. Specifically, we show that the angular distributions of DNA origami hinge mechanisms are tunable as a function of nanoparticle size and distance from the hinge vertex. We selectively adjust the affinity of nanoparticle binding sites, resulting in hinge actuation via DNA melting without releasing the nanoparticle, thereby enabling rapid and reversible temperature-based actuation. Finally, we demonstrate this rapid actuation in DNA origami-nanoparticle arrays of length scales extending over a micron. These results provide guiding principles toward the design of dynamic, DNA-origami hierarchical materials capable of storing and releasing mechanical .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661905>Combined 2D-QSAR, Principal Component Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis Studies on Fluoroquinolones' Genotoxicity.</a></h2><p>In this paper, two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) and principal component analysis (PCA) methods were employed to screen the main parameters affecting the genotoxicity of fluoroquinolones (FQs), and the rules affecting the genetic toxicity of FQs were investigated by combining 2D-QSAR and PCA with the sensitivity analysis method. First, four types of parameters were calculated, namely, the geometric parameters (7), electronic parameters (5), physical and chemical parameters (8), and spectral parameters (7), but the physical and chemical parameters heat of formation (HF) and critical volume (CV) were excluded after the establishment of the 2D-QSAR model. Then, after PCA, it was found that the first principal component represented the main driving factors affecting the molecular genetic toxicity of FQs. In addition, after comprehensive analysis of the factor loading of the first, second, and third principal components, seven parameters affecting the genotoxicity of the FQs were screened out, namely, total  (TE), critical temperature (CT), and molecular weight (Mol Wt) (increased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs) and steric parameter (MR), quadrupole moment Q (Q), quadrupole moment Q (Q), and boiling point (BP) (decreased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs); the above key parameters were also verified by sensitivity analysis. The obtained rules could be used to determine the substitution sites and the substitution groups associated with higher genotoxicity in the process of FQ modification, and these rules agreed well with the hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR) model. Finally, it was also found through SPSS analysis that the parameters screened in this paper were significantly correlated with FQ derivatives' genetic toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665544>Cherenkov imaging for Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET).</a></h2><p>Total Skin Electron Therapy (TSET) utilizes high- electrons to treat malignancies on the entire body surface. The otherwise invisible radiation beam can be observed via the optical Cherenkov photons emitted from interactions between the high- electron beam and tissue.With a time-gated intensified camera-system, the Cherenkov emission can be used to evaluate the dose uniformity on the surface of the patient in real-time. Fifteen patients undergoing TSET in various conditions (whole body and half body) were imaged and analyzed. Each patient was monitored during TSET via in-vivo detectors (IVD) in nine locations. For accurate Cherenkov imaging, a comparison between IVD and Cherenkov profiles were conducted using a PVC board to establish the perspective corrections.With proper corrections developed in this study including the perspective and inverse square corrections, the Cherenkov imaging provided 2-dimensional maps proportional to dose and projected on patient skin. The results of ratio between chest and umbilicus points were in good agreement with in-vivo point dose measurements, with a standard deviation of 2.4% compared to OSLD measurements.Cherenkov imaging is a viable tool for validating patient specific dose distributions during TSET.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664670>Assessing the influence of land use on groundwater pollution based on coefficient of variation weight method: a case study of Shuangliao City.</a></h2><p>In this study, the quality of groundwater was tested in 95 sampling wells in Shuangliao City. Based on the results, the coefficient of variation method was used to calculate the comprehensively evaluated value F, and the grade of groundwater quality, in accordance with the actual scenario in the study area, was classified according to the results of the evaluation. The spatial distribution of groundwater quality types in the study area was classified. In addition, the influence of human activity on each groundwater subsystem was assessed. Combined with the land use types in the study area, the Circle model was used to extract the land use types in the circular buffer zone with a radius of 500 m, and the Kendall rank correlation test was used to analyze the influence of the land use types on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution. Based on the coefficient of variation, the groundwater quality standard was divided into four sections considering the actual scenario: ≤ 0.92 (I), 0.92~≤ 1.75 (II), 1.75~≤ 2.40 (III), and > 2.40 (IV). Water from class II was considered the main type for groundwater quality. NO, TFe, and Mn were deemed the main indexes of groundwater pollution. Further, land use type was found to have a great influence on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution; specifically, dry land, paddy field, areas with dense traffic, and residential areas are the main land types that affect the groundwater environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664843>Formation and stability of non-toxic perovskite precursor.</a></h2><p>Strontium, calcium, and magnesium silicate hydrate phases are synthesized by the reaction between silica and solution of metal hydroxides. The kinetics of the reaction is recorded using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), continuously monitoring the change in frequency and dissipation . Based on QCM results, it is shown that properties of solutions like the pH-value or the type of ions play a pivotal function on the rate-determining stage of the reaction, the thickness of the diffuse layer, the formation of carbonates as well as the kinetics of the formed phases. Further properties of the reaction products are investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). With the help of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD), we investigate how our synthesized phases can be turned into MSiO3 structures.

The realization of a rechargeable Ca battery technology primarily requires identification and development of suitable electrodes and electrolytes, which is why we here cover the progress starting from the fundamental electrode/electrolyte requirements, concepts, materials, and compositions employed and finally a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art, allowing us to conclude with the particular roadblocks still existing. As for crucial breakthroughs, reversible plating and stripping of calcium at the metal-anode interface was achieved only recently and for very specific electrolyte formulations. Therefore, while much of the current research aims at finding suitable cathodes to achieve proof-of-concept for a full Ca battery, the spectrum of electrolytes researched is also expanded. Compatibility of cell components is essential, and to ensure this, proper characterization is needed, which requires design of a multitude of reliable experimental setups and sometimes methodology development beyond that of other next generation battery technologies. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future strategies to make best use of the current advances in materials science combined with computational design, electrochemistry, and battery engineering, all to propel the Ca battery technology to reality and ultimately reach its full potential for  storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661536>Low  optical excitations as an indicator of structural changes initiated at the termini of amyloid proteins.</a></h2><p>There is a growing body of experimental work showing that protein aggregates associated with amyloid fibrils feature intrinsic fluorescence. In order to understand the microscopic origin of this behavior observed in non-aromatic aggregates of peptides and proteins, we conducted a combined experimental and computational study on the optical properties of amyloid-derived oligopeptides in the near-UV region. We have focused on a few model systems having charged termini (zwitterionic) or acetylated termini. For the zwitterionic system, we were able to simulate the longer tail absorption in the near UV (250-350 nm), supporting the experimental results in terms of excitation spectra. We analyzed the optical excitations responsible for the low- absorption and found a large role played by charge-transfer states around the termini. These charge-transfer excitations are very sensitive to the conformation of the peptide and in realistic fibrils may involve inter and intra chain charge reorganization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662407>Access to maternal healthcare services among Indigenous women in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, accessing maternal healthcare services (MHC) by Indigenous women in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Bangladesh.This was a cross-sectional survey among Indigenous women of reproductive age.Two upazillas (subdistricts) of Khagrachhari hill district of the CHT.Indigenous women (15-49 years) within 36 months of delivery were surveyed about accessing MHC services (antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care) for their last pregnancy and delivery.The primary outcome for this analysis is the prevalence of accessing any MHC service and secondary outcome is factors associated with access to MHC services for Indigenous women during their last pregnancy and childbirth.Of 438 Indigenous women (220 Chakma, 100 Marma, 118 Tripura) who participated, 75% were aged 16-30 years. With an 89% response rate, a total of 258 (59%) women reported accessing at least one MHC service (Chakma 51.6%, Marma 28%, Tripura 20.5%; p=<0.001). Independent factors associated with accessing MHC after adjusting for clustering were attending secondary school and above (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.9); knowledge about nearest health facilities (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8) and knowledge of pregnancy-related complications (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.8).Findings suggest that the prevalence of accessing MHC services is lower among Indigenous women in the CHT compared with national average. MHC access may be improved through better education and awareness raising of local services.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Four groups of rats were treated as follows; control group, group received BPF (1 µg/g b.wt i.p./biweekly) for 4 weeks, group irradiated at 6 Gy, group received BPF post-irradiation for 4 successive weeks. Irradiation induced a significant elevation of myocardial parameters: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), potassium (K ) and creatine kinase (CK); vascular indices: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelin-I; oxidative stress indices: malondialdehyde (MDA) associated with a significant depletion of both reduced glutathione (GSH) in the cardiac tissue homogenate and serum ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) depletion and significantly reinforced elevation of Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) indices: serum angiotensin II (AngII) and aldosterone, and also protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cyclophilin A. BPF administration altered the biochemical damage of radiation, specifically inhibited the AngII formation, aldosterone release and prevented the histopathological and immunohistochemical alterations which observed in cardiac tissue with significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) caused by irradiation. In conclusion, biochemical assays, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings of the present study demonstrated that exogenous BPF isolated from scorpion venom reduced the cardiomyopathy alterations induced by irradiation via remodeling of the RAAS pathway.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664922>Nutritional intakes and associated factors among tuberculosis patients: a cross-sectional study in China.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to examine nutrient intakes of tuberculosis (TB) patients and to identify their associated factors.In this cross-sectional study, 300 adult TB patients were surveyed in two impoverished counties in China. Nutrient intakes were evaluated through two consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and compared with the Chinese Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) 2013. The potential socio-demographic and behavioral factors were analyzed using multivariate logistic model to identify strong influential factors.We found that mean daily  intake was 1655.0 kcal (SD: 619.3 kcal) and 1360.3 kcal (SD: 552.1 kcal) for male and female patients, respectively. The mean daily  intake was significantly lower than that has been recommended by DRI (i.e., 2250 and 1800 kcal for males and females, respectively), with 87.4% of the male patients and 59.9% of female patients failed to consume adequate . The protein intakes were 44.6 g (SD: 18.2 g) and 35.9 g (SD: 12.3 g) for male and female patients, respectively, which were lower than the recommended values by DRI (i.e., 65 and 55 g for males and females, respectively). Most male (90.8%) and female (58.4%) TB patients had insufficient daily protein intake. Further analyses suggested that mean daily intakes of many micronutrients, were insufficient, while for most of patients, intakes of vitamin E and sodium were sufficient. We identified that unemployment was a risk factor for low  intake (p < 0.05) and out-home-eating was a protective factor for low protein intake (p < 0.01).In impoverished areas in China, intakes of macronutrients and most micronutrients in TB patients were inadequate compared with DRIs, especially for unemployed patients and patients eating at home.

The structure of Li-T was confirmed by NMR, IR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and computational simulation, providing detailed elucidation of the intermolecular self-association of the SQ cage with a box-shaped LiO polyhedron through strong coordination bonds. After acid treatment, Li-T undergoes lithium-proton cationic exchange, yielding hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanol (; H-T) quantitatively. The high yield of H-T seems to be influenced by Li-O bonding in the Li-T complex that affects the selective formation of hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanolate and the bulky -butyl groups which may prevent decomposition or SQ cage-rearrangement even at reflux under alkaline conditions. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography confirms the presence of the dumbbell-shaped SQ partial cages through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

The aim of the study was to repeat the audit conducted 3 years ago to compare the levels of folic acid fortification of foodstuffs over this time-frame.Over a period of 8-weeks between June and August 2017, the nutrition labels of all foodstuffs that might typically be fortified with micronutrients for sale in the supermarkets with the majority of market share in Ireland were examined. The amount of added folic acid detailed on the label was compared with those captured in 2014.In total, 1081 products with added micronutrients were examined. In percentage terms, there has been a decline of Folic Acid (FA) fortified products within the food groups-spreads, breads, cereals, cereal snacks, milks, fruit juices, yogurts/yogurt drinks and  drinks since 2014.The number of food staples fortified with FA continues to decline demonstrating that voluntary fortification in Ireland is no longer an effective measure for passively augmenting the folic acid levels of consumers.© The Author(s) 2019.

The strongest borazine-benzene stacking was found in a parallel-displaced geometry, with a CCSD(T)/CBS interaction  of -3.46 kcal mol-1. The strongest borazine-borazine stacking has a sandwich geometry, with a CCSD(T)/CBS interaction  of -3.57 kcal mol-1. The study showed that borazine forms significant stacking interactions at large horizontal displacements (over 4.5 Å), with energies of -2.20 kcal mol-1 for the borazine-benzene and -1.96 kcal mol-1 for the borazine-borazine system. The strength of interactions and their geometrical preferences can be rationalized by observing the electrostatic potentials of borazine and benzene, which is in agreement with SAPT analysis showing that electrostatics is the most important  component for borazine stacking. All the interactions found in crystal structures of borazine and related compounds were identified either as potential curve minima or the geometries obtained from their optimizations.

It is meaningful to investigate the adsorption capacity of granular activated carbon (GAC) for the two algal odorants in water, and the influences of natural organic material (NOM) and particle size. The adsorption process was studied with the four isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and modified Freundlich), four kinetic models (pseudo ﬁrst-order, pseudo second-order, Elovich, and intra-particle), and thermodynamics. The results showed that the adsorption of both compounds could be best described by the modified Freundlich isotherm and pseudo second-order model, and the obtained thermodynamic parameters (changes in heat of adsorption, entropy, and Gibbs free ) revealed that the adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous.

Accordingly, this investigation explores the waste tissue paper derived three dimensional (3D) carbon aerogel (CA) integrated with cerium dioxide (CeO) nanotubes decorated nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (NRGO) as a competent anode to address these technical complements. The direct growth of NRGO and CeO over CA in the form of freestanding and binder-free NRGO/CeO(1:2)/CA alleviates the significant constrains of conventional anode fabrication. The 3D hierarchical architectures of CA with open porous structure provide easy access of bacteria, thus increases the bacterial colonies per unit volume. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding between the interfacial oxygen atoms of CeO and lysine residues of the cytochrome c in bacteria yields excellent extracellular electron transfer efficiency. The electrostatic interaction between the NRGO and bacteria cells improves the bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, leading to the compact biofilm formation for the improved direct electron transference. With the profits of above, the MFC with NRGO/CeO(1:2)/CA demonstrates a maximum power output and good lifespan performances.

Bistability in the monolayer electrolyte memory is significantly improved by the h-BN cap, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing enhanced trapping of Li near h-BN due to a ~1.34 eV increase in the absolute value of the adsorption  compared to vacuum. The threshold voltage shift between the two states corresponds to a change in charge density of ~ 2.5 × 10 cm, and an  ratio exceeding 10 at a back gate voltage of 0 V. The  ratio remains stable after 1000 cycles and the retention time for each state exceeds 6 hours (max measured). When the write time approaches 1 ms, the on/off ratio remains > 10, showing that monolayer electrolyte-gated, 2D non-volatile FET can respond on timescales similar to existing flash memory. The data suggest that faster switching times and lower switching voltages could be feasible by top gating.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661537>Synthesis of a 3D free standing crystalline NiSe matrix for electrochemical  storage applications.</a></h2><p>The electrochemical performance for  storage of three-dimensional (3D) self-supported heterogeneous NiSex cubic-orthorhombic nanocrystals grown by a facile one-step chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach on Ni foam substrates has been explored. NiSex shows a high specific capacitance of 1333 F g-1 with ultra-high  (105 W h kg-1) and power (54 kW kg-1) densities. Furthermore, by integrating the as-grown NiSex as the anode and reduced graphene oxide as the cathode, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) prototype with a coin cell configuration has been fabricated. The device shows better capacitance (40 F g-1) with high  (22 W h kg-1) and power (5.8 kW kg-1) densities and robust cycling durability (∼88% capacitance retention after 10 000 repeated cycles). For practical reliability of the as-fabricated HSC, a red LED has been illuminated by connecting it with two charged coin cells. These outstanding performances of the HSC prove to be promising for applications in high  storage systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661245>Chemoplasmonic Oscillation: A Chemomechanical  Transducer.</a></h2><p>Chemical oscillations and waves are nonequilibrium systems that sustain a steady state with constant  input of reactants like the life systems. Most of these oscillations are theoretically and fundamentally exploited but how to mimic the  convolution of biological systems remains elusive. Here we develop a chemomechanical  transducer (CoMET) based on gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and thermo-/pH-responsive polymers, which transforms the trapped chemical  into a tangible mechanical oscillation probed by extinction spectra. Our results show that the mechanical movement of Au NPs characterized by the chemoplasmonic oscillation follows exactly the pH oscillation and can be tuned by changing the temperature and the injection rate of the reductants. It is revealed that the  input of the redox potentials which later converts to the collective (dis-)aggregation of Au NPs is the main driving force of the chemoplasmonic oscillation. The  efficiency (∼34%) and force generation (∼28 pN) of this CoMET outperforms many biochemomechanical systems, which offers an alternative means to power the nanomechanics and nanomachines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661279>Progressive Hydrophobicity of Fluorobenzenes.</a></h2><p>The potential of mean force for the dimers of fluorobenzenes sample both π-stacked and T-shaped structures for partially fluorinated benzenes viz., 1,4-difluorobenzene, 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene and 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene, and sample only the T-shaped structures for benzene and hexafluorobenzene. While, the free  for the dimerization in water is very weakly dependent on number of fluorine atoms, the formation of π-stacked structures is entropy driven and the T-shaped structures appear due to an enthalpic minimum. Interestingly, the solvation behaviour suggests that the accumulation of water around the contact and solvent-separated pairs decreases with increase in number of fluorine atoms, which signifies progressive hydrophobicity of fluorobenzenes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663644>Fillers as Heaters for Photothermal Polymerization upon NIR Light.</a></h2><p>Photo-induced thermal polymerization upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation has been reported in the literature. In this approach, a component able to convert the NIR light into heat must be used in combination with a thermal initiator to initiate the free-radical polymerization of (meth)acrylates. In recent studies, some absorbers have been presented as very efficient heat generators (called heaters). In the present work, different fillers are investigated as heaters and compared to organic NIR absorbers. An alkoxyamine (e.g., BlocBuilder-MA) is used as thermal initiator and is dissociated by the heat generated by the NIR photoexcitation of the fillers. In the present work, several fillers are examined: graphene oxide, graphene nanoplatelets, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and silicon carbide. Due to the  of the photon delivered, NIR light curing is challenging but offers several advantages compared to visible light. The most interesting feature is the deeper penetration of the light inside the photocurable resin, enabling the polymerization of thick samples. Parallel to this, incorporation of fillers in resins allows unique access to composites through photothermal polymerization of (meth)acrylates. Three different wavelengths of irradiation have been studied: 785, 940, and 1064 nm.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A common soil metal oxide, birnessite (δ-MnO), was found to mediate the transformation of m-AP with fast rates under acidic conditions. Because of the highly complexity of the m-AP transformation, mechanism-based models were taken to fit the transformation kinetic process of m-AP. The results indicated that the transformation of m-AP with δ-MnO could be described by precursor complex formation rate-limiting model. The oxidative transformation of m-AP on the surface of δ-MnO was highly dependent on reactant concentrations, pH, temperature, and other co-solutes. The UV-VIS absorbance and mass spectra analysis indicated that the pathway leading to m-AP transformation may be the polymerization through the coupling reaction. The m-AP radicals were likely to be coupled by the covalent bonding between unsubstituted C2, C4 or C6 atoms in the m-AP aromatic rings to form oligomers as revealed by the results of activation  and mass spectra. Furthermore, the toxicity assessment of the transformation productions indicated that the toxicity of m-AP to the E. coli K-12 could be reduced by MnO mediated transformation. The results are helpful for understanding the environmental behavior and potential risk of m-AP in natural environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and  balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663569>Daily consumption of fruit-flavored yoghurt enriched with vitamins B contributes to lower  intake and body weight reduction, in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Yoghurt naturally contains vitamins of B-complex which play a central role in  metabolism. This study investigates the effects of consumption of yoghurt enriched with vitamins B, in comparison with conventional yoghurt, on body weight management and glycemic control of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-2) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non-fat yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention, anthropometric characteristics, biochemical parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), vitamins B and homocysteine concentrations were determined. Dietary assessments were also performed. At the end of the intervention, body weight and BMI were reduced in the VY group (86.5 ± 3.1 vs. 87.7 ± 3.0 kg, and 29.2 ± 1.0 vs. 29.6 ± 0.9 kg m-2, respectively, P < 0.05) and dietary intake was lower compared to the CY group (7277.6 ± 332.6 vs. 9918.2 ± 612.1 kJ day-1, P < 0.05). HbA1c was marginally reduced in the VY group (6.2 ± 0.2 vs. 6.4 ± 0.3%, P = 0.08), concentrations of B1, B2 and B6 were increased (63.8 ± 5.6 vs. 52.8 ± 1.7 μg L-1, P = 0.09, 9.2 ± 1.5 vs. 6.9 ± 1.4 μg L-1, P < 0.05 and 23.0 ± 2.8 vs. 14.9 ± 1.2 μg L-1, P < 0.05, respectively) and a trend towards reduced homocysteine concentrations was observed (16.9 ± 1.7 vs. 18.3 ± 2.0 μmol L-1, P = 0.06). IL-6 was decreased in both groups but significantly in the CY group (1.33 ± 0.13 vs. 1.67 ± 0.63 pg mL-1, P < 0.05). Daily consumption of fruit-flavored yoghurt enriched with vitamins B facilitates body weight management and improves vitamins B status and homocysteine levels in overweight/obese T2DM patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663743>Light-Induced Spin Crossover in an Intermediate-Spin Penta-Coordinated Iron(III) Complex.</a></h2><p>(PMe)FeCl is an Fe(III) complex that exists in the intermediate-spin ground state in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry. An electronic state with high-spin configuration lies in close vicinity to the ground state, making it a potential spin crossover candidate. A mechanistic account of the spin crossover from the lowest quartet state (Q) to the lowest sextet state (S) of this complex is provided by exploring both thermal and light-induced spin crossover pathways. The presence of a large barrier between the two spin states suggests a possible thermal spin crossover at rather high temperature. The light-induced spin crossover is investigated by employing complete active space self consistent field calculations together with dynamic correlation and spin-orbit coupling for the lowest seven quartet and lowest five sextet states. The system in Q state upon light absorption is excited to the optically bright Q LMCT state. By following minimum  pathways along the electronic states, two light-induced pathways for spin crossover are identified. From Q state the system can photo-regenerate the ground intermediate-spin state (Q) through an internal conversion of Q/Q followed by Q/S and S/Q inter-system crossings. In an alternate route, through Q/S inter-system crossing followed by S/S internal conversion, the system can complete the spin crossover from Q to S state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661828>Non-Rigid Multi-Modal 3D Medical Image Registration Based on Foveated Modality Independent Neighborhood Descriptor.</a></h2><p>The non-rigid multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) medical image registration is highly challenging due to the difficulty in the construction of similarity measure and the solution of non-rigid transformation parameters. A novel structural representation based registration method is proposed to address these problems. Firstly, an improved modality independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND) that is based on the foveated nonlocal self-similarity is designed for the effective structural representations of 3D medical images to transform multi-modal image registration into mono-modal one. The sum of absolute differences between structural representations is computed as the similarity measure. Subsequently, the foveated MIND based spatial constraint is introduced into the Markov random field (MRF) optimization to reduce the number of transformation parameters and restrict the calculation of the  function in the image region involving non-rigid deformation. Finally, the accurate and efficient 3D medical image registration is realized by minimizing the similarity measure based MRF  function. Extensive experiments on 3D positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), T1, T2, and PD weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images with synthetic deformation demonstrate that the proposed method has higher computational efficiency and registration accuracy in terms of target registration error (TRE) than the registration methods that are based on the hybrid L-BFGS-B and cat swarm optimization (HLCSO), the sum of squared differences on entropy images, the MIND, and the self-similarity context (SSC) descriptor, except that it provides slightly bigger TRE than the HLCSO for CT-PET image registration. Experiments on real MR and ultrasound images with unknown deformation have also be done to demonstrate the practicality and superiority of the proposed method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662474>A MYC2/MYC3/MYC4-dependent transcription factor network regulates water spray-responsive gene expression and jasmonate levels.</a></h2><p>Mechanical stimuli, such as wind, rain, and touch affect plant development, growth, pest resistance, and ultimately reproductive success. Using water spray to simulate rain, we demonstrate that jasmonic acid (JA) signaling plays a key role in early gene-expression changes, well before it leads to developmental changes in flowering and plant architecture. The JA-activated transcription factors MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 modulate transiently induced expression of 266 genes, most of which peak within 30 min, and control 52% of genes induced >100-fold. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis indicates that MYC2 dynamically binds >1,300 promoters and -activation assays show that MYC2 activates these promoters. By mining our multiomic datasets, we identified a core MYC2/MYC3/MYC4-dependent "regulon" of 82 genes containing many previously unknown MYC2 targets, including transcription factors  and  bHLH19 can in turn directly activate the  promoter, indicating that MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 initiate a hierarchical network of downstream transcription factors. Finally, we also reveal that rapid water spray-induced accumulation of JA and JA-isoleucine is directly controlled by MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 through a positive amplification loop that regulates JA-biosynthesis genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665455>GLP-1 Analog Modulates Appetite, Taste Preference, Gut Hormones and Regional Body Fat Stores in Adults with Obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with alterations in appetite, gastrointestinal (GI) hormone levels and excessive fat mass. We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once daily GLP-1 analog, liraglutide on weight, satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers. The aim of this sub-study was to compare to placebo the effects of liraglutide on appetite, taste preference, regional body fat stores and anthropometric measurements.Forty obese adults received standard instruction for weight management, monthly behavioral intervention utilizing motivational interviews, and 16-week treatment of once daily liraglutide (escalated to 3mg SQ daily). At baseline and 16 weeks, the following were measured: appetite and taste preferences rated every 30 minutes for 5 hours after ingesting 300mL Ensure®; maximal tolerated volume (MTV) with a nutrient drink test; fasting and postprandial bioactive GLP-1 (7-36) and PYY levels; total and regional body fat with dual- x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and waist and hip circumference.Thirty-five participants (17 liraglutide; 18 placebo) completed the trial. Compared to placebo group, liraglutide group had significant reductions in MTV, prospective food consumption score, desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory or fatty, and an increase in perceived fullness. Postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 decreased and PYY levels increased with liraglutide relative to baseline. Significant reductions in total body, trunk, upper and lower body fat without reduction in lean body mass were observed.Liraglutide 3mg SQ modulates appetite, taste preference, gut hormones and regional body fat stores in adults with obesity without reduction in lean body mass.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Characteristic for anorexia nervosa are a reduced food intake and thus significant underweight, as well as the fear of gaining weight. Often sufferers also have a distorted self-perception, the urge to move and amenorrhea. AN is difficult to treat and often has a chronic course, and is associated with an increased mortality risk.

Participants received 16 weeks adjunctive treatment of either placebo or -acetylcysteine-alone or a combination of mitochondrial-enhancing nutraceuticals including -acetylcysteine (combination treatment). Participants were followed up 4 weeks post-treatment discontinuation (Week 20). Diet was assessed by the Cancer Council Victoria Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies, Version 2, converted into an Australian Recommended Food Score to measure diet quality, and -adjusted dietary inflammatory index score to measure inflammatory potential of diet. Body mass index was also measured. Generalised estimating equation models were used to assess whether diet quality, -adjusted dietary inflammatory index score and/or body mass index were predictors of response to significant outcomes of the primary trial: depression symptoms, clinician-rated improvement and functioning measures.In participants taking combination treatment compared to placebo, change in depression scores was not predicted by Australian Recommended Food Score, dietary inflammatory index or body mass index scores. However, participants with better diet quality (Australian Recommended Food Score) reported reduced general depression and bipolar depression symptoms ( = 0.01 and  = 0.03, respectively) and greater clinician-rated improvement ( = 0.02) irrespective of treatment and time. Participants who had a more anti-inflammatory dietary inflammatory index had less impairment in functioning ( = 0.01). Combination treatment may attenuate the adverse effects of pro-inflammatory diet ( = 0.03) on functioning. Participants with lower body mass index who received combination treatment ( = 0.02) or -acetylcysteine ( = 0.02) showed greater clinician-rated improvement.These data support a possible association between diet (quality and inflammatory potential), body mass index and response to treatment for bipolar depression in the context of a nutraceutical trial. The results should be interpreted cautiously because of limitations, including numerous null findings, modest sample size and being secondary analyses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664830>Amine Dynamics in Diamine-Appended Mg(dobpdc) Metal-Organic Frameworks.</a></h2><p>Variable-temperature 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy is used to uncover the dynamics of three diamines appended to the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc) (dobpdc4- = 4,4'-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate), an important family of CO2 capture materials.

Fibrosis occurs through the accumulation of large amounts of ECM components, synthesized by myofibroblasts in damaged lung tissue. Epithelial cells serve as one of the cellular sources of myofibroblasts via the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In this study, we investigated the role of TGF-β-secreting M2 macrophages in association with ionizing radiation-induced EMT.The lung epithelial cell line MLE12, was irradiated and the expression of EMT markers and chemokines was examined. Moreover, the mouse lung macrophage MH-S cell line was cultured with conditioned media from irradiated MLE12 cells, to examine the effects of the secreted factors on the migration ability of macrophages. For the murine pulmonary fibrosis model, mice were locally irradiated and the levels of M1 or M2 macrophage-related markers and cytokines were measured in bronchoalvelolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue.In MLE12 cells, irradiation directly induced expression of EMT-related markers and secretion of various chemokines, which lead to macrophage migration. Interestingly, the sub-population of macrophages recruited in the lung of mice after thoracic irradiation was M2 macrophages that expressed Arg-1 and CD206. M2 macrophages induced the MLE12 to undergo phenotypic conversion to form fibroblast-like cells, which leads to a down-regulation of epithelial markers and an up-regulation of new EMT-related markers. In thoracic irradiated mice, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-4 and IL-10 were increased at 2 weeks, but returned to normal levels from 16 weeks or 24 weeks after irradiation. However, thoracic irradiation led to a rapid increase of TGF-β and IGF-1 levels, which lasted up to 24 weeks. It was confirmed that M2 macrophages secreted the high levels of TGF-β. Moreover, the elimination of TGF-β from M2 macrophages attenuated mesenchymal transition of MLE12.TGF-β-secreting M2 macrophages play an important regulatory role in mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells in the lung of irradiated mice, thus contributing to radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

In this work, (1-x)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-xNaTaO3 ((1-x)BNT-xNT, x=0~0.30) lead-free relaxor ferroelectric ceramics are developed for capacitor applications. The x=0.20 ceramic exhibits superior thermal stability of discharged  density (WD) with a variation of less than 10% in an ultra-wide temperature range of -50~300 °C, showing a significant advantage compared with previously reported ceramic systems. The WD reaches 4.21 J/cm3 under 38 kV/mm at room temperature. Besides, a record high of power density (PD~89.5 MW/cm3) in BNT-based ceramics is also achieved in x=0.20 ceramic with an excellent temperature insensitivity within 25~160 oC. The x=0.20 ceramic is indicated to be an ergodic relaxor ferroelectric with coexisted R3c nanodomains and P4bm polar nanoregions at room temperature, greatly contributing to inducing large maximum polarization, maintaining low remnant polarization, and thus achieving high WD and PD. Furthermore, the diffuse phase transition from R3c to P4bm phase on heating is considered to be responsible for the superior thermal stability of the high WD and PD.

However, the lack of historical data limits our understanding of ecosystem changes with long-term exposure to human activities. Recently, lake sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) has become a powerful tool for revealing changes in ecosystems at the century and millennium scales. Here, we used sedDNA to reveal the dynamic of the microbial community (including bacteria and micro-eukaryotes) in Lake Chao over the past 150 years, and further explored the effects of long-term nutrient and heavy metal loads on these communities. Our data show that nutrient and heavy metal loads in Lake Chao have increased by ca. 2 to 4-fold since the 1960s. In response, the community structure, diversity, and ecological network of bacteria and micro-eukaryotes changed significantly during the 1960s, the 1980s and the 2010s. Importantly, community structure was more sensitive to human activities than diversity. We also found that the relative abundance of some taxa associated with nitrification and algal blooms (e.g., taxa in Nitrospira sp., Peridinales) has increased ca. 100-fold since the 1960s. Nutrient could better explain the variation in the bacterial community (ca. twice as much as heavy metal), while heavy metal explained micro-eukaryotes better (ca. 3 or 5-fold as much as nutrient). In particular, based on parsimonious models from distance-based linear model (distLM), we further identified that Pb is the key factor affecting the bacterial and micro-eukaryotes community in Lake Chao in addition to nutrient. Our study reveals the impacts of long-term human activities on lake ecosystems from multiple perspectives of nutrient and heavy metal loads, community structure, diversity and ecological network, these findings will contribute to the management and conservation of lakes in the future.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Chromia films ~10 Å thick were deposited by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of Cr at room temperature in ultrahigh vacuum on 50 Å thick TiO2-x(111) films (x < 0.3), also deposited epitaxially by MBE on Al2O3(0001). Cr deposition yields increased Ti(III) formation in the titania substrate and the formation of a Cr2O3 overlayer, without Cr/Ti interfacial mixing, as determined by in situ photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron  loss spectroscopy (EELS). In situ low  electron diffraction (LEED) and XPS data indicate that the chromia overlayer is hexagonally ordered, and ~10 Å thick. Longitudinal and polar Magneto-optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements at 285 K - 315 K provide evidence of strong exchange bias between the boundary layer magnetization of chromia and the ferromagnetic substrate. These data demonstrate the robust room temperature interaction of the boundary layer magnetization of a multiferroic antiferromagnet with a d0 ferromagnetic substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663768>Atomic-Precision Fabrication of Quasi-Full-Space Grain Boundaries in Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride.</a></h2><p>Precise control and in-depth understanding of the interfaces is crucial for the functionality-oriented material design with desired properties. Herein, via modifying the long-standing bicrystal strategy, we proposed a novel nanowelding approach to build up interfaces between two-dimensional (2D) materials with atomic precision. This method enabled us, for the first time, to experimentally achieve the quasi-full-parameter-space grain boundaries (GBs) in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). It further helps us unravel the long-term controversy and confusion on the registry of GBs in h-BN, including i) discriminate the relative contribution of the strain and chemical  on the registry of GBs; ii) identify a new dislocation core- Frank partial dislocation and four new anti-phase boundaries; and iii) confirm the universal GB faceting. Our work provides a new paradigm to the exploiting of structural-property correlation of interfaces in 2D materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664012>Traumatic Retroclival Epidural Hematoma.</a></h2><p>Retroclival epidural hematomas are particularly rare conditions that are frequently the result of high-, hyperflexion-hyperextension injuries in pediatric patients. We present the case of a 7-year-old previously healthy girl with traumatic retroclival epidural hematoma after a fall from a swing. She presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 with severe neck pain and limitation of cervical movements in all directions. Radiological examination revealed retroclival epidural hematoma, and the patient was managed conservatively with good recovery. Although conservative management leads to good recovery in most cases, retroclival epidural hematomas should always be kept in mind regardless of the severity of trauma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665668>Zinc-functionalized thymol nanoemulsion for promoting soybean yield.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report zinc-functionalized thymol nanoemulsion (Zn-TNE) by sonication method and its characterization by DLS, HR-TEM, FEG-SEM-EDS, Cryo-FESEM, FTIR and AAS studies. Zn-TNE treated seeds bestowed better seedling vigor index and higher activities of seed stored food mobilizing enzymes (α-amylase and protease). Foliar application of Zn-TNE (0.01-0.06%, v/v) enhanced defense-antioxidant enzymes activities, balanced reactive oxygen species, induced higher content of chlorophyll-a, b and higher lignin deposition in soybean plants. In the field, Zn-TNE application (0.02-0.06%, v/v) significantly controlled bacterial pustule disease (PEDC value 28-79%) and increased grain yield up to 16.6% as compared with bulk thymol application and up to 50% from control. Disease control and higher yield in soybean could be explained by diverse bioactivities of Zn-TNE in maintaining cellular homeostasis of soybean plants. Study shows that Zn-TNE can further be maneuvered for slow delivery of other micronutrients for higher crop yield.Copyright © 2019.

The  (SE) hypothesis attempts to explain species richness gradients as a function of  availability. However, limited empirical support for SE is often attributed to idiosyncratic, local-scale processes distorting the underlying SE relationship. Meanwhile, studies are also often confounded by factors such as sampling biases, dispersal boundaries and unclear definitions of  availability. Here, we used spatially structured observations of 8460 colonies of photo-symbiotic reef-building corals and a null-model to test whether  can explain observed coral species richness over depth. Species richness was left-skewed, hump-shaped and unrelated to  availability. While local-scale processes were evident, their influence on species richness was insufficient to reconcile observations with model predictions. Therefore,  availability, either in isolation or in combination with local deterministic processes, was unable to explain coral species richness across depth. Our results demonstrate that local-scale processes do not necessarily explain deviations in species richness from theoretical models, and that the use of idiosyncratic small-scale factors to explain large-scale ecological patterns requires the utmost caution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664833>Complexation Kinetics of Cyclodextrins with Bile Salt Anions:  Barriers for Threading of Ionic Groups.</a></h2><p>Binding constants for thousands of cyclodextrin complexes have been reported in the literature but much less is known about the kinetics of these host-guest complexes. In the present study, inclusion complexes of bile salts with β-cyclodextrin, γ-cyclodextrin and a methylated β-cyclodextrin were studied by NMR lineshape analysis to explore the structural factors that govern the complexation kinetics. For complexes with β-cyclodextrin, the association rate constants ranged from 2*10 to 2*10 Ms while the dissociation rate constants ranged from 12 s to 6000 s at 25 °C. The kinetics were thus significantly slower than for any other β-cyclodextrin complex reported in the literature, due to the large  barrier for threading the ionic sidechains of the bile salt anions. Bile salts with taurine and glycine sidechains had identical binding affinities but the kinetics differed by a factor of 10. Introduction of a single hydroxyl group at the binding site of the bile salts reduced the lifetimes and binding constants of the complexes more than 50 times. The strong temperature dependence of the rate constants revealed that the large activation energies were mainly enthalpic with a small contribution from entropy. The larger γ-cyclodextrin was threaded by the non-ionic end of the bile salts and the kinetics were too fast to be accurately determined. The study demonstrates that ionic groups on guest molecules constitute significant  barriers for threading and dethreading of β-cyclodextrin hosts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665522>DAY-LENGTH-DEPENDENT DELAYED-GREENING1, the Arabidopsis Homolog of the Cyanobacterial H+-Extrusion Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast pH Regulation and Optimization of Non-Photochemical Quenching.</a></h2><p>Plants convert solar  into chemical  through photosynthesis, which supports almost all life activities on earth. Because the intensity and quality of sunlight can change dramatically throughout the day, various regulatory mechanisms help plants adjust their photosynthetic output accordingly, including the regulation of light  accumulation to prevent the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a regulatory mechanism that dissipates excess light , but how it is regulated is not fully elucidated. Herein, we report a new NPQ-regulatory protein named Day-Length-dependent Delayed-Greening1 (DLDG1). The Arabidopsis DLDG1 associates with the chloroplast envelope membrane, and the dldg1 mutant had a large NPQ value compared with wild type. The mutant also had a pale-green phenotype in developing leaves but only under continuous light; this phenotype was not observed when dldg1 was cultured in the dark for ≥8 h per day. DLDG1 is a homolog of the plasma-membrane-localizing cyanobacterial proton-extrusion-protein A that is required for light-induced H+ extrusion, and also shows similarity in its amino-acid sequence to that of Ycf10 encoded in the plastid genome. Arabidopsis DLDG1 enhances the growth-retardation phenotype of the Escherichia coli K+/H+ antiporter mutant, and the everted membrane vesicles of the E. coli expressing DLDG1 show the K+/H+ antiport activity. Our findings suggest that DLDG1 functionally interacts with Ycf10 to control H+ homeostasis in chloroplasts, which is important for the light-acclimation response, by optimizing the extent of NPQ.© The Author(s) 2019.

Various treatments available to improve the appearance of PIH may incite further pigmentation thus making treatment extremely difficult and frustrating. The purpose of this study was to perform a retrospective chart and photographic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of a low  low density non-ablative fractional1927 nm wavelength laser treatment for PIH in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI.A retrospective evaluation of 61 patients with PIH treated with a 1927 nm laser was conducted at a single center. Inclusion criteria required at least 2 treatment sessions so that before and after treatment photographs would be available for comparison and study purposes. Two blinded physician-evaluators using a visual analog scale for percentage of pigmentary clearance in standard photographs assessed treatment efficacy.The mean percent improvement after treatment, evaluated by two dermatologists was 43.24%. The correlation between raters was statistically significant (Pearson's correlation coefficienct of r = 0.59, p < 0.0001). No side effects were observed in the patients treated with the 1927 nm laser.The low  low density non-ablative fractional 1927 nm wavelength laser is a safe and effective modality for improving post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with darker skin types.

Several approaches have been explored to improve their efficiency and power density, and recently, cell geometry modification has shown promise in efforts to address mass transport limitations which affect electrochemical and overall system performance. Flow-by electrode configurations have demonstrated significant power density improvements in laboratory testing, however, flow-through designs with conductive felt remain the standard at commercial scale. Concentration gradients exist within these cells, limiting their performance. A new concept of redistributing reactants within the flow frame is introduced in this paper. This research shows a 60% improvement in minimum V concentration within simulated vanadium redox flow battery (VRB/VRFB) cells through the application of static mixers. The enhanced reactant distribution showed a cell voltage improvement by reducing concentration overpotential, suggesting a pathway forward to increase limiting current density and cycle efficiencies in RFBs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664189>Author Correction: Dopant-induced electron localization drives CO reduction to C hydrocarbons.</a></h2><p>An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664348>Nutritional intervention may improve migraine severity: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Although some studies have investigated the role of nutritional intervention on migraine, they had focused on triggers or on weight change and, to the best of our knowledge, none studied diet quality.To investigate whether nutritional intervention focused on improving diet quality and healthy weight can promote improvement in clinical parameters of women with migraine.Non-controlled and non-randomized intervention study conducted for 90 days. Women received an individualized diet meal plan and nutritional orientation according to their nutritional diagnosis. Anthropometric, clinical and nutritional data were measured once a month. Diet  content and macronutrients were evaluated using 24-hour dietary recall. Diet quality was assessed through the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index-Revised (BHEI-R). The Migraine Disability Assessment and Headache Impact Test version 6 were used to assess the severity of migraine, and the Beck Depression Inventory evaluated depressive symptoms.Fifty-two women aged 44.0 ± 13.0 years were enrolled. Anthropometric characteristics, , macronutrients and fiber intake did not change after intervention. However, the BHEI-R scores improved after 60 and 90 days of intervention. Concurrent to this, the Beck Depression Inventory scores and Headache Impact Test scores decreased after 60 and 90 days, respectively. The change in the BHEI-R score was negatively correlated with the migraine severity as assessed by the Headache Impact Test at the end of the intervention.We concluded that the management of diet quality may be a good strategy for improving migraine severity, regardless of the nutritional status and weight change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663553>Ultraviolet charge-transfer-to-solvent spectroscopy of halide and hydroxide ions in subcritical and supercritical water.</a></h2><p>The temperature dependence of the vacuum ultraviolet charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) absorption spectra of aqueous halide and hydroxide ions was measured for the first time up to 380 °C in subcritical and supercritical water. With increasing temperature, absorption spectra are observed to broaden and redshift, much in agreement with previous measurements below 100 °C. These changes are discussed alongside classic cavity models of the solvated species, which tie in the configuration of the adjoining polarized medium and its critical role in light absorption for electronic transitions. The data seemingly confirm the validity of the "diffuse" model pioneered by Platzman and Franck and later revised by Stein and Treinin, which has largely gone untested for nearly 60 years due to lack of experimental data in this extended temperature range. A gradual increase in anion cavity size is inferred as a function of increasing temperature while the enthalpy and entropy of hydration are largely unaffected. The changes in solvation properties are considered in the context of recent studies of the ultraviolet spectroscopy of subcritical and supercritical water and historic studies of the CTTS absorption. The "diffuse" polarizable continuum model succeeds in describing the absorption due to lack of well-defined ion hydration shells for these ions. CTTS spectra for iodide in supercritical water show no  shift as a function of pressure/density, suggesting dielectric saturation of the I- anion by the adjacent H2O molecules at all experimental pressures/densities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665650>Impact of photoelectric effect on X-ray density logging and its correction.</a></h2><p>This paper studied the impact of the photoelectric effect of X-ray density logging in order to improve the accuracy of X-ray measurement density. Firstly, the laws governing the changes of the Compton scattering and photoelectric effect of X-rays in the formation were analyzed based on the principle of X-ray attenuation in the formation and using the XCOM program. Secondly, the impact of photoelectric effect on X-ray density logging was studied on the basis thereof. Thirdly, a method for correcting photoelectric effect by calculating the formation bulk density using the counts in both lithology window and density window was proposed. Finally, the proposed method was verified through MCNP simulation. The results indicate that photoelectric effect was an important factor affecting the accuracy of X-ray density measurement, and the lower the X-ray  was, the greater the impact of photoelectric effect on X-ray density measurement would be and the lower the accuracy of density measurement would be. As the γ-rays released from a Cs-137 source were at a high  level, the impact of photoelectric effect was basically negligible when the formation bulk density was calculated using the counts in density window; on the contrary, the X-rays released from the X-ray source was at a low  level, the impact of photoelectric effect could not be neglected when the formation bulk density was measured using X-ray. The method for calculating the formation bulk density proposed in this paper can effectively eliminate the impact of photoelectric effect and reach up to a measurement accuracy level of about 0.01g/cm, providing a theoretical foundation for accurate density measurement during X-ray density logging.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this communication, we report on our recent experimental finding that FeP nanoarray on Ti mesh (FeP NA/TM) acts as an efficient 3D catalyst electrode for the CO 2 reduction reaction to convert CO 2 to alcohols with high selectivity. In 0.5 M KHCO 3 , such FeP NA/TM is capable of achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE CH3OH ) up to 80.2%, with a total FE CH3OH+C2H5OH of 94.3% at -0.20 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.

This paper investigates the wetting phenomena on ideal micropatterned surfaces consisting of straight micro-pillars at different pillar dimensions and spacings (The word "ideal" refers to being chemically homogeneous and free of submicron-scale roughness all over the micropatterned surface). Two modeling approaches are used: 1) a thermodynamic approach analyzing the Gibbs  of the droplet-solid-gas system, and 2) a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach studying the three-dimensional dynamic wetting process to validate the results of the first approach. The thermodynamic approach incorporates three creative sub-models proposed in this paper: i) a sagging model explaining the pillar edge effect, ii) a touchdown model transitioning the droplet's partial penetrating condition toward its full penetrating condition, i.e. the Wenzel state, and iii) a liquid-volume model dynamically computing the liquid volume in-between the pillar valleys while in the partial penetrating condition or in the Wenzel state. The results of the thermodynamic approach reveal 1) a small  barrier between the Cassie and Wenzel states, 2) no partial penetration and sagging of the liquid in the Cassie state on the ideal straight micro-pillared surface, and (3) that the apparent contact angle in the most stable Wenzel state can be 5º or more lower than than the prediction of the Wenzel equation when the pillar height is equal or greater than 75 µm. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the theoretical explanation of this Wenzel deviation on micropatterned surfaces for the first time in the literature. Utilizing the state-of-the-art continuum model developed by the authors in previous studies, the CFD approach investigates the same wetting conditions, and confirms the same findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663591>Effect of nanotube coupling on exciton transport in polymer-free monochiral semiconducting carbon nanotube networks.</a></h2><p>Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) are attractive light-harvesting components for solar photoconversion schemes and architectures, and selective polymer extraction has emerged as a powerful route to obtain highly pure s-SWCNT samples for electronic applications. Here we demonstrate a novel method for producing electronically coupled thin films of near-monochiral s-SWCNTs without wrapping polymer. Detailed steady-state and transient optical studies on such samples provide new insights into the role of the wrapping polymer on controlling intra-bundle nanotube-nanotube interactions and exciton  transfer within and between bundles. Complete removal of polymer from the networks results in rapid exciton trapping within nanotube bundles, limiting long-range exciton transport. The results suggest that intertube electronic coupling and associated exciton delocalization across multiple tubes can limit diffusive exciton transport. The complex relationship observed here between exciton delocalization, trapping, and long-range transport, helps to inform the design, preparation, and implementation of carbon nanotube networks as active elements for optical and electronic applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663340>Supramolecular Anchoring of Octahedral Molybdenum Clusters onto Graphene and Their Synergies in Photocatalytic Water Reduction.</a></h2><p>Dihydrogen (H) production from sunlight should become one of the most important  production means in the future. To reach this goal, low-cost and efficient photocatalysts still need to be discovered. Here we show that red near-IR luminescent metal cluster anions, once combined with pyrene-containing cations, are able to photocatalytically produce molecular hydrogen from water. The pyrene moieties act simultaneously as  transmitters and as supramolecular linkers between the cluster anions and graphene. This association results in a hybrid material combining the emission abilities of pyrene and cluster moieties with the electronic conduction efficiency of graphene. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) studies show that this association induces a significant increase of H production compared to that produced separately by clusters or graphene. Considering the versatility of the strategy described to design this photocatalytic hybrid material, transition-metal clusters are promising candidates to develop new, environmentally friendly, and low-cost photocatalysts for HER.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661782>The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation.</a></h2><p>The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the γ-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) (66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that γ-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum γ-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 ± 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 ± 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661966>H-Atom Product Channels in the Ultraviolet Photodissociation of the 2-Propenyl Radical.</a></h2><p>The H-atom product channels in the ultraviolet photodissociation of 2-propenyl (CH2CCH3) radical were investigated in the wavelength region of 224-248 nm using photofragment translational spectroscopy. The CH2CCH3 radicals were generated by 193-nm photodissociation of 2-chloropropene and 2-bromopropene precursors. The H-atom photofragment yield spectra from both precursors revealed a broad feature peaking near 232 nm. The translational  distributions of the H + C3H4 products peaked around 7-8 kcal/mol and extended close to the maximum excess . The fraction of the total available  released as products' translation was nearly a constant (~ 0.16 using the 2-chloropropene precursor and ~ 0.18 using the 2-bromopropene precursor) in the wavelength range of 224-248 nm. The angular distribution of the H-atom product was isotropic. Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations were performed on the ground-state potential  surface of CH2CCH3 for its decomposition at a 124 kcal/mol excitation  (equivalent to 230 nm photolysis photon ). The calculations yielded branching ratios for different dissociation product channels, 32% H + allene, 35% H + propyne, 0.5% H + cyclopropene, and 32% methyl + acetylene. The experimental and QCT translational  distributions of the H-atom loss channels qualitatively agreed, consistent with the main H-atom product channels being the H + allene and H + propyne dissociations. The time scale of the 2-propenyl dissociation on the ground electronic state was calculated to be ~ 2 ps, smaller compared to that of the overall UV photodissociation (> 10 ps, implied based on the isotropic H-atom product angular distribution). The mechanism of the UV photodissociation of 2-propenyl is consistent with unimolecular dissociation proceeding on the ground state after internal conversion of the electronic excited states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662248>Metal accumulation in the acrocarp moss Atrichum undulatum under controlled conditions.</a></h2><p>Mosses are frequently used to monitor atmospheric metal contamination but few studies on metal adsorption under controlled conditions are available. Here, the accumulation of the heavy metals copper and zinc was studied in the acrocarp moss Atrichum undulatum. An in vitro culture of A. undulatum was established and the same line, size and equally old remets were exposed to six different treatments representing various metal exposure times and washing scenarios as rain simulation. The metal treatments were done in copper and zinc salts (Cu-acetate, CuSO, ZnSO and ZnCl, respectively). -Dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) was employed to detect bound heavy metals on the moss plantlets. Element distribution in stems and leaves was measured separately. The aqueous solution of metal salts facilitated an adsorption of both elements in the moss tissue as compared to solid medium. Furthermore, A. undulatum can tolerate pollution of zinc and copper in a distinctive extent; our data point towards a higher zinc tolerance whereas copper is rather harmful. However, semi-quantitatively, less zinc was detected within the moss tissue compared to copper. Interestingly, a strong positive correlation between the accumulation of copper/zinc and iron, and a strong negative correlation between copper/zinc and magnesium, respectively, was documented.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The transport and retention of CuO NPs are vital to understanding the fate as well as the life cycle of CuO NPs in the environment. This study systematically investigates the transport and retention of CuO NPs in saturated porous media, and the experimental results were explained by the CFT and DLVO theory. The van der Waals force between CuO NPs and collector was repulsive, resulting in the unfavorable deposition condition. Column experiments were conducted with saturated quartz sand under environmentally relevant pH (6, 8, 9), ionic strength (IS, 1, 10, 50 mM), and humic acid (HA, 0.1-10 mg-C/mL). Experimental results show that the breakthrough curves (BCTs) were affected by different pH and IS. Under pH 6 and 9, the mobility of CuO NPs was enhanced by high IS while the mobility was inhibited by high IS under pH 8. The mobility of CuO NPs was enhanced by humic acid and the effect was best at 0.5 mg-C/mL HA. The experimental results were successfully explained by CFT and DLVO theory, the main mechanisms were aggregation of CuO NPs, interaction  and collision between CuO NPs and collector. In general, these findings can improve our understanding of the transport and retention of CuO NPs in subsurface environments, and suggest pH, IS, HA may be key factors governing mobility and stability of CuO NPs in natural environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the interfacial photoinduced electron and hole transfer dynamics are not explored computationally. Herein we have used density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT-based fewest-switches surface-hopping dynamics simulations to investigate the light-driven electron and hole dynamics taking place at the interface of BP and the BVO(010) surface. Our results show that the BP monolayer is adsorbed on BVO(010) via van der Waals interaction. Upon irradiation the electron transfer takes place from BP to BVO(010) within 500 fs but with two distinct processes. In the first phase, the electron transfer proceeds adiabatically and is mainly driven by atomic motions. In the second phase, the electron transfer decays very slowly. The hole transfer dynamics from BVO(010) to BP exhibits a similar ultrafast decay in the first stage followed by a slow decay; however, there is comparable amount of hole trapped in an BP state due to a large  gap from its higher state. These insights may be useful for the design of novel photocatalytic water splitting materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661780>Revealing the Nanoparticle-Protein Corona with a Solid-State Nanopore.</a></h2><p>Protein adsorption at the liquid-solid interface is an old but not totally solved topic. One challenge is to find an easy way to characterize the protein behavior on nanoparticles and make a correlation with its intrinsic properties. This work aims to investigate protein adsorption on gold nanoparticles and the colloidal properties. The protein panel was chosen from different structural categories (mainly-α, mainly-β or mix-αβ). The result shows that the colloidal stability with salt addition does not depend on the structural category. Conversely, using the single nanopore technique, we show that the mainly-α proteins form a smaller corona than the mainly-β proteins.

Quantum dynamics of the wave function modulus and phase components is examined, and the associated continuity relations are summarized. The probability and current contributions to overall information-theoretic (IT) descriptors of the state global and gradient entropy/information content are identified. These resultant measures are used to determine the phase equilibria in molecular systems. The currents corresponding to the entropy- and information-optimum phases are explored, the classical (probability) and nonclassical (current) flows in molecular information systems are identified, and probability interpretation of equidensity orbitals yielding the prescribed electron density is given. The physical equivalence of variational principles for the electronic  and resultant gradient-information in open systems is stressed.

Here, we examine the effects of optical illumination on the wetting behaviors of zinc oxide (ZnO) single crystals. We find that ultraviolet irradiation above the bandgap  promotes a rapid wetting transition, characterized by instantaneous sliding of the water droplet, within a few seconds. Notably, the transition for Zn-polar (0001) ZnO surfaces is even faster than that for O-polar (000-1) ZnO surfaces. We confirmed that process is power, surface polarity, and solution pH dependent and reversible through illumination by near infrared light, which restores the water contact angle back to its initial value. Surface chemical analysis revealed that the instantaneous photocatalytic formation of surface terminated hydroxyl (-OH) groups is responsible for the observed rapid wetting transition. Density functional theory calculations with the inclusion of on-site Coulomb interactions revealed that both the Zn-polar and O-polar surfaces can be easily covered with -OH groups through adsorption of -OH groups or hydrogen atoms, respectively. This study develops a route to fabricating optically active and controllable microfluidic devices that support rapid wetting transitions for water droplet manipulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663578>Mechanisms of alumina growth via atomic layer deposition on nickel oxide and metallic nickel surfaces.</a></h2><p>We aim at elucidating the mechanism of the trimethyl aluminum (TMA) decomposition on oxidized nickel (NiO) and metallic nickel (Ni) facets in the absence of a source of hydroxyl groups. This TMA decomposition mechanism constitutes the earliest stage of growth of Al2O3 coatings with the atomic layer decomposition (ALD) method, which stabilizes nickel catalysts in -intensive processes such as the dry reforming of methane. Our first-principles calculations suggest thermodynamic favorability for the TMA decomposition on metallic nickel compared to oxidized nickel. Moreover, the decomposition of TMA on metallic nickel showed almost no differences in terms of  barriers between flat and stepped surfaces. Regarding the impact of the CH3 radicals formed after TMA decomposition, we calculated stronger adsorption on metallic nickel facets than on oxidized nickel, and these adsorption energies are comparable to the adsorption energies calculated in earlier works on Al2O3 ALD growth on palladium surfaces. These results lead us to believe in the growth of porous Al2O3 coatings triggered by CH3 contamination rather than due to preferential TMA decomposition on stepped and/or defective facets. The CH3 radicals are likely to be thermally stable at temperatures used during Al2O3 ALD processes, partially passivating the surface towards further TMA decomposition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661623>Asymmetric Morphology Transformation of Azo Molecular Glass Microspheres Induced by Polarized Light.</a></h2><p>In this work, photoinduced asymmetric morphology transformation of a type of azo molecular glass microspheres was thoroughly investigated to understand the effects of controlling factors on the process, related mechanism and unique functions. The monodispersed microspheres with their sizes over ten microns were fabricated from an isosorbide-based azo compound (IAC-4) by microfluidics. Under irradiation with linearly polarized light, the ten-micron-scale microspheres were transformed into three-dimensional (3D) asymmetric particles through directional mass transfer. Microscopic observations and optics simulation were employed to investigate the morphology transformations. The results show that the penetration depth of light at different wavelengths plays an extremely important role to affect the asymmetric deformation behavior of the IAC-4 microspheres, which determines deformation region, deformation degree and final shapes of the particles. The light intensity (50-200 mW/cm2) is a less important factor, while the deformation rate of the light-penetrated part linearly increases with the intensity. When the light intensity varies in this range, the deformation degree and the final asymmetric morphology are determined by exposure  (light intensity ∗ irradiation time). The IAC-4 microspheres with different sizes show distinct morphology transformation behavior and the deformed particles possess different shapes, caused by the variation of volume fraction of the light-penetrated part in the microspheres. The increase in the ratio of the light-penetrated part to the total volume of the microspheres results in larger scale deformations. Based on the above understanding, asymmetric particles with various morphologies could be fabricated through a precisely controllable way. The asymmetric particles loaded on various surfaces show ability to render remarkable wetting anisotropy of water droplets on the substrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661622>Promoting Transport Kinetics in Li-Ion Battery with Aligned Porous Electrode Architectures.</a></h2><p>Developing scalable  storage systems with high  and power densities is essential to meeting the ever-growing portable electronics and electric vehicle markets, which calls for development of thick electrode designs to improve the active material loading and greatly enhance the overall  density. However, rate capabilities in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) usually fall off rapidly with increasing electrode thickness due to hindered ionic transport kinetics, which is especially the issue for conversion-based electroactive materials. To alleviate the transport constrains, rational design of 3D porous electrodes with aligned channels is critically needed. Herein, magnetite (Fe3O4) with high theoretical capacity is employed as a model material, and with the assistance of micrometer-sized GO sheets, aligned Fe3O4/GO (AGF) electrodes with well-defined ionic transport channels are formed through a facile ice-templating method. The as-fabricated AGF electrodes exhibit excellent rate capacity compared with conventional slurry-casted electrodes, with an areal capacity of ~3.6 mAh∙cm-2 under 10 mA∙cm-2.

However, modulation of the inflammatory response towards biomaterials can potentially enable a favorable healing response associated with functional tissue formation and tissue regeneration. In this work, incorporation of nicotinic acid in 3D silk scaffolds is explored as an immunomodulatory strategy for implantable biomaterials. Silk scaffolds were fabricated from dissolved Bombyx mori silk fibers by freeze-drying, resulting in silk scaffolds with high porosity (>94%), well-connected macropores, a high swelling degree (>550%) and resistance to in vitro degradation. Furthermore, drug-loaded scaffolds displayed a sustained drug release and excellent cytocompatibility could be observed with osteoblast-like MG63 cells. Cultivating M1-like macrophages on the scaffolds revealed that scaffolds loaded with nicotinic acid suppress gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α, CXCL10 and CD197 as well as secretion of TNF-α in a concentration dependant manner. Hence, this study provides insights into the possible application of nicotinic acid in tissue engineering to control inflammatory responses towards biomaterials and potentially help minimizing FBR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662883>Investigation of dielectric elastomer human  harvesting to reduce knee joint torque deviation due to bracing.</a></h2><p>The use of a smart electromechanical material, dielectric elastomer, is investigated for the development of an active bracing technique, which modifies the stiffness and damping of the knee brace during  harvesting so as to reduce knee joint torque deviation during late swing in braced walking.The bracing technique considered involves a dielectric elastomer  harvesting cycle, which activates only when the knee flexor muscles are contracting eccentrically during late swing. The brace reduces the leg extension deviation during late swing in braced walking by transforming a portion of the mechanical stored  into electrical , reducing the required internal work performed within the body.Simulated behavior of the dielectric elastomer brace worn across the knee joint demonstrates that when properly activated, the dielectric elastomer brace's reduction in stiffness and increase in damping minimize the added  expenditure of knee joint bracing during late swing.The modeling results demonstrate the effective application of a soft, circumferential, dielectric elastomer  harvesting knee brace, which utilizes the changes in the dynamic behavior of the knee joint occurring during  harvesting in order to reduce the added demand placed on the knee joint under braced conditions.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661597>In Silico and In Vitro Studies of Two Non-Imidazole Multiple Targeting Agents at Histamine H Receptors and Cholinesterase Enzymes.</a></h2><p>Recently, multi-target directed ligands have been of research interest for multifactorial disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since H receptors (H Rs) and cholinesterases are involved in pathophysiology of AD, identification of dual acting compounds capable of improving cholinergic neurotransmission is of importance in AD pharmacotherapy. In the present study, H R antagonistic activity combined with anti-cholinesterase properties of two previously computationally identified lead compounds i.e. compound 3 (6-chloro-N-methyl-N-[3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide) and compound 4 (7-chloro-N-[(1-methylpiperidin-3-yl)methyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carboxamide) were tested. Moreover, molecular docking and binding free  calculations were conducted for binding mode and affinity prediction of studied ligands towards cholinesterases. Biological evaluations revealed inhibitory activity of ligands in nanomolar (compound 3: H R EC = 0.73 nM; compound 4: H R EC = 31 nM) and micromolar values (compound 3: AChE IC = 9.09 µM, BuChE IC = 21.1 µM; compound 4: AChE IC = 8.40 µM, BuChE IC = 4.93 µM) for H R antagonism and cholinesterase inhibition, respectively.

One limitation of gatifloxacin is its relatively poor corneal penetration, and the increase of its trans-corneal delivery would be beneficial to reduce the amount or frequency of daily dose. In this study, ultrasound treatment was applied to enhance the trans-corneal delivery of gatifloxacin without damage. Experiments were conducted on mouse eyes in ex vivo and in vivo conditions. Ultrasound waves with 1 MHz in frequency, 1.3 W/cm in intensity were applied onto the mouse cornea for 5 minutes, and then gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution was instilled and left there for 10 minutes. 3D gatifloxacin distribution in the cornea was measured by two-photon microscopy (TPM) imaging based on its intrinsic fluorescence. Longitudinal TPM imaging of ultrasound treated mouse corneas showed the increase of initial gatifloxacin intensities on the corneal surface compared to untreated mouse corneas by 67%, and then the increased gatifloxacin delivery into the cornea from the surface at later time. The delivered gatifloxacin in the corneal epithelium stayed longer in the ultrasound treated corneas than in the untreated corneas. The enhanced trans-corneal delivery and extended stay of gatifloxacin in the mouse cornea by ultrasound treatment could be beneficial for therapeutic effects.

While UV filters effectively reduce UV-induced ROS, they cannot prevent VIS-induced (400 - 760 nm) oxidative stress. Therefore, potent antioxidants are needed as additives to sunscreen products.We investigated VIS-induced ROS formation and the photoprotective effects of the Nrf2-inducer Licochalcone A (LicA).VIS of 400-500 nm dose-dependently induced ROS in cultured human fibroblasts at doses equivalent to 1 hour of sunshine on a sunny summer day (150 J/cm ). A pretreatment for 24 hours with 1 µM LicA reduced ROS formation to the level of unirradiated cells while UV filters alone were ineffective, even at SPF50+.

The combination of magnetic fields with clinical proton beam lines poses several challenges for dosimetry, treatment planning and dose delivery. Proton beams are deflected by magnetic fields causing considerable changes in beam trajectories and also a retraction of the Bragg peak positions. A proper prediction and compensation of these effects is essential to ensure accurate dose calculations. This work aims to develop and benchmark a Monte Carlo (MC) beam model for dose calculation of MRPT for static magnetic fields up to 1T.Proton beam interactions with magnetic fields were simulated using the GATE/Geant4 toolkit. The transport of charged particle in custom 3D magnetic field maps was implemented for the first time in GATE. Validation experiments were done using a horizontal proton pencil beam scanning system with energies between 62.4 - 252.7 MeV and a large gap dipole magnet (B = 0-1T), positioned at the isocenter and creating magnetic fields transverse to the beam direction. Dose was measured with Gafchromic EBT3 films within a homogeneous PMMA phantom without and with bone and tissue equivalent material slab inserts. Linear  transfer (LET) quenching of EBT3 films was corrected using a linear model on dose averaged LET method to ensure a realistic dosimetric comparison between simulations and experiments. Planar dose distributions were measured with the films in two different configurations: parallel and transverse to the beam direction using single  fields and spread out Bragg peaks. The MC model was benchmarked against lateral deflections and spot sizes in air of single beams measured with a Lynx PT detector, as well as dose distributions using EBT3 films. Experimental and calculated dose distributions were compared to test the accuracy of the model.Measured proton beam deflections in air at distances of 465, 665 and 1155 mm behind the isocenter after passing the magnetic field region, agreed with MC predicted values within 4 mm. Differences between calculated and measured beam Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) were lower than 2 mm. For the homogeneous phantom, measured and simulated in-depth dose profiles showed range and average dose differences below 0.2 mm and 1.2%, respectively. Simulated central beam positions and widths differed less than 1 mm to the measurements with films. For both heterogenous phantoms, differences within 1 mm between measured and simulated central beam positions and widths were obtained, confirming a good agreement of the MC model.A GATE/Geant4 beam model for protons interacting with magnetic fields up to 1T was developed and benchmarked to experimental data. For the first time, the GATE/Geant4 model was successfully validated not only for single  beams, but for SOBP, in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms. EBT3 film dosimetry demonstrated to be a powerful dosimetric tool, once the film response function is LET corrected, for measurements in-line and transverse to the beam direction in magnetic fields.

This study aimed to analyze the association between dietary quantity and diversity among anemic pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 at Madura Island, Indonesia, and involved 152 anemic pregnant women. Hemoglobin concentration was analyzed by the cyanmethemoglobin method. Dietary quantity was measured by the 2 × 24 h recall. Dietary diversity was determined by Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women of Reproductive Age (MDD-W). Spearman's rank association was performed to analyze the association between dietary diversity and quantity. The median of hemoglobin concentration was 10.1 g/dL, and 57.2% pregnant women had mild anemia. Most of the pregnant women had low adequacy levels of  and macro- and micronutrients (except for iron). More than half (57.9%) of anemic pregnant women had reached minimum dietary diversity. Family size (=0.048) and gestational age (=0.004) had negative associations with dietary diversity. Dietary diversity had positive associations with  (=0.029), protein (=0.003), vitamin A (=0.001), vitamin C (=0.004), and zinc (=0.015) adequacy levels. Dietary diversity had no significant association with calcium (=0.078) and iron adequacy level (=0.206). High prevalence of mild and moderate anemia was found among pregnant women in their third trimester.

These types of tools and methods offer the possibility to develop portable diagnosis and treatment follow-up systems. In this article, we propose the use of a three-layer diffuse reflectance model for the study of the formation of cutaneous ulcers caused by CL.

As result, the quantification of the model's variables related to the main biological parameters of skin were obtained, such as: diameter and volumetric fraction of keratinocytes, collagen; volumetric fraction of hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation. Those parameters show statistically significant differences among the different stages of the CL ulcer formation.

Studying this interface using both experimental and theoretical tools is challenging. On the theoretical front, typically one uses classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to handle large system sizes or time scales while for a more accurate quantum mechanical description Born Oppenheimer MD (BOMD) is typically used. The latter is limited to smaller system sizes and time-scales. In this study using quantum-mechanics-molecular-mechanics (QMMM), we have performed atomistic MD simulations to have a microscopic understanding of the structure of the Pt-water interface using a system size that is much larger than that accessible when using BOMD simulations. In contrast to recent reports using BOMD simulations, our study reveals that the water molecules typically form two distinct layers above the Pt-surface before they form bulk like structures. Further, we also find that a significant fraction of the water molecules at the interface are pointed towards the surface thereby disrupting the H-bond network. Consistent with this observation, the layer resolved oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function for the water molecules belonging to the solvating water layer shows a high density liquid like behaviour even though the overall water behaves like a low density liquid. A charge transfer analysis reveals that this solvating water layer donates electrons to the Pt atoms in contact with it thereby resulting in the formation of an interface dipole that is pointing towards the surface. Our results suggest that, using QMMM-MD, on one hand it is possible to study more realistic models of solid-liquid interfaces that are inaccessible with BOMD, while on the other hand one also has access to information about such systems that are not obtained from conventional classical MD simulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663575>Iron phosphorus trichalcogenide ultrathin nanosheets: enhanced photoelectrochemical activity under visible-light irradiation.</a></h2><p>Exploiting novel visible-light sensitive materials for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) technique is deeply meaningful for  conversion and analytic detection.

However, the poor mobility and aqueous corrosion of NZVI in the porous subsurface have hindered its practical applications. In this research, the NZVI surface was coated with a novel Mg(OH) shell (NZVI@Mg(OH)) to improve the feasibility of NZVI for remediation. In the column tests for continuous removal of Cr(VI) from the flowing water, the Mg(OH) shell greatly improved the delivery of NZVI into the sand columns. Coating NZVI with Mg(OH) shell also showed considerably greater chemical stability than bare NZVI and thus greater resistance to aqueous corrosion. In addition, the dissolution of Mg(OH) allowed the reactivity to be gradually recovered along the sand column for Cr(VI) reduction. As a result, compared to bare NZVI in the columns, NZVI@Mg(OH) significantly prolonged the breakthrough period of Cr(VI) and hence increased the columns' Cr(VI) removal capacity. Moreover, the Cr(III) produced was effectively immobilized by NZVI@Mg(OH), even under an acidic condition (pH 4.0). The results show that Mg(OH) coating is a promising technique to improve the longevity and capacity of NZVI for full-scale in-situ soil and groundwater remediation.Copyright © 2019.

Previous research using food recalls suggests that the total  intake of food-insecure women is not elevated, though macronutrient composition may differ from that of food-secure women. There is limited evidence on temporal patterns of food consumption. Here, we used food recalls from women in the 2013-4 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES,  = 2798) to characterise temporal patterns of food consumption in relation to food insecurity. Compared to the food-secure, food-insecure women had more variable time gaps between eating; ate a smaller and less variable number of distinct foods at a time; were more variable from day to day in their time of first consumption; were more variable from day to day in the number of times they ate; and consumed relatively more carbohydrate, less protein, and less fibre. However, their overall  intake was no higher. Food-insecure women had higher BMIs (2.25 kg/m), and around 15% of the BMI difference between food-insecure and food-secure women was accounted for by their more variable time gaps between eating, their lower diversity of foods, and their lower fibre consumption. Food insecurity is associated with measureable differences in the temporal pattern of food consumption, and some of these differences shed light on how food-insecure women come to have higher body weights.Copyright © 2019 Daniel Nettle and Melissa Bateson.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665702>Evaluation of bone-regeneration effects and ectopic osteogenesis of collagen membrane chemically conjugated with stromal cell-derived factor-1 in vivo.</a></h2><p>Because the collagen membrane lacks osteoinductivity, it must be modified with bioactive components to trigger rapid bone regeneration.

Furthermore, ectopic osteogenesis was examined by histological analysis with Von Kossa staining, with the samples counterstained by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that in the chemical cross-linking group and cell-seeding group, the bone volume fraction, bone surface area fraction, and trabecular number were significantly increased and showed more new bone formation compared to the control and physical adsorption groups.

Herein, we had reported a method to synthesize highly reactive yet stable defective iron-based Metal organic frameworks by using different monocarboxylic acids with varying lengths as a modulator. The physical-chemical characterization illustrating that modulators could improve the crystallinity, enlarge pore size and enhance catalytic performance and octanoic acid (OA) was screened to be the suitable choice. The catalytic performance of catalysts was detected through persulfate (PS) activation for degrading Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). The study demonstrated that the highest degradation efficiency for 0.018 mmol L TBBPA was that 97.79% in the conditions of the 1.0 g L Fe(BDC)(DMF,F)-OA-30 dosage and TBBPA:PS = 200:1. In addition, there was observed that no obvious change of the crystal structure, little the leachable iron concentration in the solutions and no significant loss of catalytic activities of Fe(BDC)(DMF,F)-OA-30 after 5th cycles. The iron valence state of Fe(BDC)(DMF,F)-OA-30 before and after degradation and electrochemical properties reveal that the partial substitution of organic ligands by octanoic acid, when removing OA and forming defects by heat and vacuum treatment to generate coordinatively unsaturated metal sites and accelerate the original transmission of electronic, leading to enhance the activity of persulfate activation for efficient removal TBBPA.Copyright © 2019.

Of these, 616 were seen again 3 y later for the longitudinal analysis. -adjusted DII (E-DII) was calculated from a validated diet history questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/m2; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men. The association between incident falls and E-DII was partly mediated by concentrations of IL-7.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664807>"Button and Buttonhole" Supramolecular Structure Enables the Self-Healing Behaviors of Functionalized Poly(ether sulfone) Membranes for Osmotic Power Generation.</a></h2><p>Osmotic power generation has emerged as an advanced technology toward water- nexus to tackle global water pollution. It provides a sustainable use of salinity gradient from water resources yet encounters major obstacles caused by pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) membrane fouling. Although membranes with good antifouling properties are widely studied, their antifouling functions are readily lost when scratches or detachments occur through physical damage during operation and chemical degradation by water and corrosive foulants. Consequently, it is important to develop antifouling membranes with autonomous self-healing capabilities. Herein, self-healable functionalized poly(ether sulfone) (PES) antifouling membranes have been fabricated via the sequential conjugation of the zwitterionic random copolymer [poly(1-(1-(1-adamantylcarbonyloxy)methyl)-3-vinylimidazolium bromide--1-(3-sulfopropyl)-3-vinylimidazolium--vinylamine)] (P(ADVI--SBVI--VA), abbreviated as PASV copolymer) and linear cyclodextrin polymer (LPCD) on polydopamine-preactivated PES supports. The self-healing behaviors rely on the judiciously designed "button-and-buttonhole" supramolecular network. Specifically, β-cyclodextrins in LPCD and adamantines in PASV act as "buttonholes" and "buttons", respectively. Under physical and chemical damages, the β-cyclodextrin "buttonhole" may sacrificially detach from the adamantine "button" of PASV but then recap another adamantine to restore the protective function. The antifouling and self-healing traits of as-functionalized PES--PASV-LPCD membranes were demonstrated by the superior antiprotein behaviors and improved antimicrobial performances on both nonaged and aged samples. In the PRO process, the modified membranes were effective in mitigating organic fouling and exhibited higher power density (79% of the initial value) than the nonmodified ones (47% of the initial value) in municipal wastewater testing. The strategy for engineering inherently healable and antifouling membranes paves a new pathway for the development of sustainable membranes for osmotic power production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663832>Relationships between -scores at the hip and bone mineral density at the distal femur and proximal tibia in persons with spinal cord injury.</a></h2><p> To identify -score values at the total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN) that correspond to the cutoff value of <0.60 g/cm for heightened risk of fracture at the distal femur (DF) and proximal tibia (PT Retrospective analysis of data in a research center's database.

This study examines community engagement in garden building activities in a rapid urbanization context, aiming to explore the application of community-engaged research methods for the promotion of neighbourhood environments. The Community Garden Initiative consisting of an array of progressive actions is formulated by the research team, featuring a process of increasing involvement of community members and decreasing intensity of external interventions. These activities have been launched based on community-university partnerships in Shanghai since 2014, synchronising with a transformation of urban regeneration paradigm in China where people-oriented approaches are more emphasized. Five actions covering 70 community gardens are analysed through surveys on participants' attitudes and perceptions towards the activities. The results of the study presented people's rapid acceptance of participation in public affairs, reflected possible measures to promote public participation, and confirmed the positive impacts of the garden building on the neighbourhood environmental health as well as on the community-building. Taking into account that residents generally lack the consciousness and capacities required to implement actions at the initial stage of community engagement, we proposed in the conclusion to start with external interventions and capacity buildings carried out by professionals as a supplement to the 'community-driven' principle of CBPR methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665463>Supplemental effects of dietary nucleotides on intestinal health and growth performance of newly weaned pigs.</a></h2><p>Intestinal challenges upon weaning would increase the needs of nucleotides for enterocyte proliferation whereas de novo synthesis maybe insufficient. This study aimed to evaluate supplemental effects of dietary nucleotides on intestinal health and growth performance in newly weaned pigs. Fifty newly weaned pigs (19-d-old, 25 barrows and 25 gilts, 4.76 ± 0.42 kg BW) were individually housed and allotted to 5 treatments with increasing nucleotide supplementation (0, 50, 150, 250, and 500 mg/kg) based on a randomized complete block design with the initial BW and sex as blocks. Dietary nucleotides were provided from YT500 (Hinabiotech, Guangzhou, China). Pigs were fed for 21 d based on 2 phases (Phase 1: 11 d and Phase 2: 10 d) and experimental diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements suggested by NRC (2012). Feed intake and BW were recorded. Titanium oxide (0.4%) was added as an indigestible marker from d 17. Plasma collected on d 18 was used to measure tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Pigs were euthanized on d 21 to collect tissues to evaluate TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, morphology, and crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Ileal digesta were collected to measure ileal nutrient digestibility. Data were analyzed using contrasts in the MIXED procedure of SAS. Nucleotide supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADFI in phase 1. Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ADG in Phase 1, whereas increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and tended to increase (P = 0.082) ADG in overall. Increasing nucleotide supplementation changed (quadratic, P < 0.05) villus height-crypt ratio (at 247 mg/kg) and decreased (linear, P < 0.05) crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Increasing nucleotide supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) jejunal IL-6 (at 50 and 150 mg/kg) and tended to change (quadratic, P = 0.074) plasma MDA (at 231 mg/kg). Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ileal digestibility of  and ether extract. In conclusion, nucleotide supplementation at a range of 50 to 250 mg/kg in the diets seems to be beneficial to newly weaned pigs by enhancing growth performance possibly due to reduced intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress as well as improved intestinal villi structure and  digestibility.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the obvious thermal boundary resistance and anisotropic heat conduction still remain major bottlenecks for efficient heat dissipation. Herein, a biomimetic design enabled by radially aligned, bimodal graphene frameworks (RG-Fin) is proposed to achieve highly efficient and isotropic thermal transport. An interconnected RG skeleton is prepared via a radial ice-template method, serving as the primary expressway for isotropic heat conduction. Tree-leaf-like graphene nanofins are vertically grown on the RG surface to provide additional thermal pathways for bimodal phonon transportation, which can reduce the thermal boundary resistance without degrading the thermal properties of the skeleton. An RG-Fin composite exhibits a superior thermal conductivity of 4.01 W m-1 K-1 (almost 20 times that of a polymer) at an ultralow loading of 1.53 vol%, demonstrating an exceptionally large thermal conductivity enhancement efficiency of 1247%, which far exceeds those of graphene-based polymer composites. Further theoretical analysis and finite element simulations reveal the critical role of the nanofins in significantly decreasing the thermal boundary resistance (by almost 27-fold). Finally, the practical thermal management of running a CPU module is demonstrated, in which the heating-up rate of the RG-Fin composite is ∼2.0 times that of a pure polymer. This strategy provides an innovative avenue for designing radially aligned networks to realize isotropic and efficient thermoconductive composites for thermal management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662668>Structure and Morphometrics of  (Monogenea: Ancyrocephalidae) from  (Percidae) in Czechia.</a></h2><p>New morphometric data, including details of the copulatory system and attachment structures, as well as inner organs are provided for  Creplin, 1839.

Owl wings have three morphological characteristics (leading-edge serrations, trailing-edge serrations and velvet-like surfaces) that effectively suppress aerodynamic noise in low Reynolds numbers. Among them, trailing-edge serrations are widely considered the most effective noise-reduction method. Although different serrations have been studied, the quantitative relationship and influence mechanism between the serration shape, wavelength and amplitude are poorly understood. The acoustic characteristics of asymmetrical aerofoils with different trailing-edge serrations have not been fully studied. This work investigates the flow characteristics and acoustic scattering mechanisms of novel owl-based aerofoils with different trailing-edge serrations. A sensitivity analysis is utilized to quantitatively investigate the influence and interaction mechanisms of the shape, wavelength and amplitude in trailing-edge noise reduction. Numerical simulations of the transient flow over the aerofoil are performed via the large eddy simulation method, and the acoustic far-field is obtained by solving the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation. The results indicate that the sawtooth and sinusoidal serrations provide the most significant noise reduction effects; the maximum noise reduction is 8.74 dB. The wavelength and amplitude play similar roles, but the amplitude has relatively greater influence. For the sawtooth and sinusoidal serrations, the large-scale vortex structures are broken into many small-scale spiral vortex structures due to the presence of the sharp serration tip. The serrations can effectively reduce the coherence of the turbulent fluctuations due to spanwise variations in the edge and may be the main reason for noise suppression. The original owl-based aerofoil generates more low-frequency noise and less high-frequency noise than aerofoils with trailing-edge serrations. The peak noise frequencies of all aerofoils are approximately 400 Hz; hence, low-frequency noise is a dominant influence in noise generation. The acoustic sources generated by transient pressure fluctuations are mainly located on the serration root.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663628>When not to rely on Boltzmann populations.

The present analysis makes use of reported  H and  C shifts and, in some particular cases, a few  J couplings. The difficulty in proper computational prediction of relative energies, in molecules capable of inter-molecular hydrogen bonding, introduces large errors in the prediction of conformationally averaged NMR properties in methods based on Boltzmann averaging such as DP4 or DP4+. In contrast CASE-3D conformational amplitudes are free parameters in the model. Here we show that the CASE-3D conformational model selection strategy, when combined with a larger  cutoff in the molecular-modelling conformational exploration, was sufficient to correctly assign the relative configuration in five of seven cases.

The SRIM stopping power software and other classical equations are used to determine the particle velocities, kinetic energies and their effective ionic charges at LETU.The estimated mean LETU values increase with atomic number (Z). Each LETU has a unique relativistic velocity, =v/c, the velocity v expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, c), and which is non-linearly proportional to Z. For ions helium and heavier ions, these velocities indicate that the effective charge Z* is around 0.99 of the full Z value at each LETU, with remarkably stable velocities of 3-4 nm.fs-1 per nucleon, or around 6-8 nm.fs-1 per unit Z. For Z=1, (protons and deuterium) some values fall outside these ranges but the result depends on the mix of proton and deuterium used in experiments. An alternative index of A/Z2 (A is the atomic mass number), suggests an average velocity of around 15 nm.fs-1 for each particle at LETU. These distances, traversed in the time of the radiochemical process initiation, are all within the dimensions of the nucleosome. Curve fitting of the data set provides a predictive equation for LETU for any ion, as LETU=30.4+108.4⁄0.61 (1-Exp[-0.61(Z-1)]) when normalised to protons. These data can be extended to heavier ions such as silicon and Iron and give values that are consistent with experimental data.Each ion probably has a unique LETU value.

Determination of CIP has raised extensive concern due to its possible toxic effects on human health. Here, a simple photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for detecting CIP has been developed by using the nitrogen-deficient graphitic carbon nitride (ND-g-CN) as a PEC active material. The ND-g-CN material exhibits two-dimension (2D) thin sheet structure with abundant nitrogen vacancies. The 2D thin sheet structure can enable the effective charge separation and transfer, thus dramatically improving the PEC performance. Simultaneously, nitrogen vacancies can serve as charge trap to efficiently inhibit the charge recombination. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of the two can widen the absorption edge and decrease the band gap of ND-g-CN material, resulting in increasing light harvesting and enhancing PEC performance. CIP can be oxidized by the holes of ND-g-CN, thus realizing effective charge separation, which can result in the amplification of the photocurrent. The designed PEC sensor demonstrated a wide detection range from 60 to 19090 ng L and a low detection limit of 20 ng L for CIP assay.

Despite significant advancements, it remains a critical challenge to ensure high sensitivity and selectivity, while achieving uniform signal enhancement and high reproducibility for quantitative detection of targeted biomarkers within a complex stem cell microenvironment. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative sensing platform, using graphene-coated homogeneous plasmonic metal (Au) nanoarrays, which synergizes both electromagnetic mechanism (EM)- and chemical mechanism (CM)-based enhancement. Through the homogeneous plasmonic nanostructures, generated by laser interference lithography (LIL), highly reproducible enhancement of Raman signals could be obtained via a strong and uniform EM. Additionally, the graphene-functionalized surface simultaneously amplifies the Raman signals by an optimized CM, which aligns the  level of the graphene oxide with the target molecule by tuning its oxidation levels, consequently increasing the sensitivity and accuracy of our sensing system.

Herein, we develop a simple yet robust acid-treatment strategy to judiciously create an amorphous TiO 2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO 2 surface as electron transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO 2 , thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO 2 surface. Such amorphous TiO 2 -coated ETL possesses an increased electron density due to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO 2 . Compared to pristine TiO 2 -based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid-treated TiO 2 ETL exhibit enhanced short circuit current and power conversion efficiency.

Here, we use a full electromagnetic Hertzian dipole antenna (HDA) model to describe the hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HP2s) in vdW crystals of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on a gold surface. The HP2 waves are investigated by broadband synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS) which covers the type I and type II hyperbolic bands simultaneously. Basically, polariton waves, observed by SINS, are assigned to the resultant electric field from the summation over the irradiated electric fields of dipoles distributed along the crystal edge and at the tip location and a non-propagating field. The values of polariton momenta and damping extracted from the HDA model present excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Our analysis shows that the confinement factor of type I HP2s exceeds that of the type II ones by up to a factor of 3. We extract anti-parallel group velocities (vg) for type I (vg,typeI = -0.005c, c is the light velocity in a vacuum) in relation to type II (vg,typeII = 0.05c) polaritonic pulses, with lifetimes of ∼0.6 ps and ∼0.3 ps, respectively. Furthermore, by incorporating consolidated optical-near field theory into the HDA model, we simulate real-space images of polaritonic standing waves for hBN crystals of different shapes. This approach reproduces the experiments with a minimal computational cost.

Animals received acute laser light irradiation (660 nm) on abdominal region using different  (0.6, 1.8, 3.6, 7.2, 13.8, 28.2, 55.8, and 111.6 J), the direct arterial pressure was measured by femoral cannulation, and systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), heart rate (HR), and time of effect were obtained. Our results indicated that 660 nm laser light presents an -dependent hypotensive effect, and 28.2 J  irradiation reached the maximum hypotensive effect, inducing a decreased SAP, DAP, and HR (decrease in SAP: - 19.23 ± 1.82 mmHg, n = 11; DAP: - 9.57 ± 2.23 mmHg, n = 11; HR: - 39.15 ± 5.10 bpm, n = 11; and time of hypotensive effect: 3068.00 ± 719.00 s, n = 11). The higher  irradiation evaluated (111.6 J) did not induce a hypotensive effect and induced an increase in HR (21.69 ± 7.89 bpm, n = 7). Taken together, our results indicate that red laser  irradiation from 7.2 to 55.8 J is the effective therapeutic window to reduce SAP, DAP, MAP, and HR and induce a long-lasting hypotensive effect in rats, with effect loss at higher  irradiation (111.6 J).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661238>Inhibition of Crystallization of Poly(ethylene oxide) by Ionic Liquid: Insight into Plasticizing Mechanism and Application for Solid-State Sodium Ion Batteries.</a></h2><p>All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) possess enhanced safety and desired cycling life compared with conventional liquid sodium batteries, showing great potential in large-scale  storage system. And polymer electrolytes based on poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) have been extensively studied for ASIBs due to its superior flexibility and processability. Nevertheless, PEO-based electrolyte without any modification can hardly meet the requirement of ASIBs at room temperature. In the past decade, unremitting efforts have been attached to inhibiting crystallization of PEO, especially via ionic liquid plasticizing. However, the plasticizing mechanism is not clear. Here, we incorporated Pyr13FSI into PEO-NaClO4 electrolyte to investigate the plasticizing effect by infrared spectrum characterizations and DFT calculations. The results indicate that FSI- anions tend to adhere to PEO backbone, generating enhanced coordination ability and more coordination site. Solid-state sodium ion batteries using PEO-NaClO4-40wt% Pyr13FSI as polymer electrolyte exhibit good cycling and rate performance. Insights into the plasticizing mechanism contributes to fabricating polymer electrolyte with high performance for ASIBs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661951>Facile Synthesis of Uniform Metal Carbide Nanoparticles from MOFs by Laser Metallurgy.</a></h2><p>We report the fast and efficient conversion of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to phase pure transition metal carbide (TMC) nanoparticles with uniform size using laser as the  source, consuming only 6-Watt power. Nanoparticles of HfC, ZrC, TiC, V8C7, α-MoC, Cr3C2 and FeCx with homogeneous sizes (varied between 6 and 20 nm) were successfully produced, among which HfC and ZrC nanoparticles were obtained, for the first time, with sizes less than 10 nm and in pure phase. This method was operated directly in air, in stark contrast to traditional furnace heating and laser spray methods, where protective atmosphere are required. The use of MOFs allowed us to precisely tune the composition of TMC nanoparticles by dialing in the right type and desirable amounts of organic linkers. FeCx nanoparticles doped with various percentages of nitrogen atoms were synthesized for Fischer-Tropsch reaction without any pretreatment or activation. Extremely high iron time of yield (FTY) values were observed, 415 μmol gFe-1 s-1 and 550 μmol gFe-1 s-1 (with addition of K), in a 40h test without any decay in performance.

Hence, such broad field of action within eukaryotic cells requires a high level of structural and functional adaptation. Therefore, mitochondria are constantly moving and undergoing fusion and fission processes, changing their shape and their interaction with other organelles. Moreover, mitochondrial activity gets fine-tuned by intra- and inter-organelle H , K , Na and Ca signaling. In this review we provide an up-to-date overview on mitochondrial strategies to adapt and respond to, as well as affect, their cellular environment.

Erroneous processing of DSBs is a cause of cell death or its transformation to a cancer cell. Four mechanistically distinct pathways have evolved in cells of higher eukaryotes to process DSBs, providing thus multiple options for the damaged cells. The homologous recombination repair (HRR) dependent subway of gene conversion (GC) removes IR-induced DSBs from the genome in an error-free manner. Classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) removes DSBs with very high speed but is unable to restore the sequence at the generated junction and can catalyze the formation of translocations. Alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) operates on similar principles as c-NHEJ but is slower and more error-prone regarding both sequence preservation and translocation formation. Finally, single strand annealing (SSA) is associated with large deletions and may also form translocations. Thus, the four pathways available for the processing of DSBs are not alternative options producing equivalent outcomes. We discuss the rationale for the evolution of pathways with such divergent properties and fidelities and outline the logic and necessities that govern their engagement. We reason that cells are not free to choose one specific pathway for the processing of a DSB but rather that they engage a pathway by applying the logic of highest fidelity selection, adapted to necessities imposed by the character of the DSB being processed. We introduce DSB clusters as a particularly consequential form of chromatin breakage and review findings suggesting that this form of damage underpins the increased efficacy of high linear  transfer (LET) radiation modalities. The concepts developed have implications for the protection of humans from radon-induced cancer, as well as the treatment of cancer with radiations of high LET.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663216>Identification of novel nonedible oil seeds via scanning electron microscopy for biodiesel production.</a></h2><p>Exploration of substitute  feed-stocks is the much-debated topic in the scientific society due to increasing power crises and related ecological concerns. As a source of sustainable , biodiesel turns out to be the best alternative to petro fuels. In this context, nonedible oil-producing seeds might be a potential source for biodiesel production owing to their environment-friendly nature and cost-effectiveness. The current study, consequently, deals with the investigation and identification of micro-morphological characters between six novel nonedible oil-bearing seeds employing scanning electron microscopy as possible biodiesel feed-stocks. Light microscopic examinations show that seed size varies from 0.3 to 1.3 cm in width and 0.5 to 1.5 cm in. Additionally, a large difference in seed color ranges from dark brown, black, and various shades of light brown was also witnessed. The FFA content of the seeds ranges in 0.3-4.1 mg KOH/g, and the seed oil content fall in 30-65% (w/w) range. SEM-mediated seed ultrastructure investigations displays greater variation in seed size, shape, color, periclinal wall shape, and sculpturing and so on. All the seeds differ from rounded, ovoid, ovate, oblong, flattened, and elliptical shape. Greater variation in seed wall structure has been seen from angular, entire, irregular, straight, elongated, smooth, and polygonal. The periclinal wall arrangements show alteration from flat, depressed, elevated, smooth, pentagonal, bullate, and coarse seed margins. The results obtained from the current study suggest that scanning electron microscopy could be a beneficial tool in vitalizing the hidden micromorphological characters among various nonedible oil producing seeds, which eventually helps in exploration, correct identification, seed classification, and authentication in future.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661401>Improved safety checklist analysis approach using intelligent video surveillance in the construction industry - a case study.</a></h2><p>The construction industry is extremely high-risk, and safety checklist analysis (SCA) is a widely used approach for safety assessment. To overcome its limitations, this paper proposes an improved safety checklist analysis (ISCA) approach using intelligent video surveillance to replace on-site inspection. Then, a case study on metro tunnel construction is adopted to illustrate the process. First, the checklist is prepared. Second, the inspection items are correlated with construction areas, and intelligent cameras are positioned to cover the major areas of the construction site to guarantee that all the items can be checked. Thus, problems with inspection items are automatically identified and recorded. Third, the inspection items are marked by a remote scoring mechanism for safety assessment. Finally, the efficiency of the improved approach is tested by a comparative analysis among three groups. The application results indicate the feasibility of the improved approach for evaluating the safety management performance at construction sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662134>Saturated fat supplemented in the form of triglycerides decreased digestibility and reduced performance of dairy cows as compared to calcium salt of fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The two most popular rumen-protected fatty acid supplements in dairy cow rations are calcium salts of palm oil fatty acid calcium salts of palm oil fatty acid (CSFA) and prilled saturated fatty acids (SFAs). The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of supplementing SFA in the form of triglycerides (TSFA), as compared to CSFA, on yields, efficiency and diet digestibility in high-yielding dairy cows. Twenty-eight (14 cows in each group) multiparous cows were fed a basal diet supplemented (on DM basis) with either 12 g/kg TSFA (~350 g/cow per day - contained 980 g/kg fat; 882.3 g/kg SFAs) or 14 g/kg CSFA (~440 g/cow per day - contained 800 g/kg fat; 566.4 g/kg SFAs). The supplement amounts in the diet were balanced according to fat content. Rumen samples were taken for measurements of ammonia and volatile fatty acids concentrations, and fecal samples were taken for digestibility measurements. The CSFA cows produced 3% higher milk yields (47.6 v. 46.2 kg/day; P < 0.0001) and 4.7% higher 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM; 44.7 v. 42.7 kg/day; P = 0.02) than the TSFA cows. No difference in milk-fat content was observed, but milk-protein content was higher in the TSFA than CSFA cows. Yields of fat and protein were similar, but lactose yields were higher in TSFA cows. There were no differences in dry matter intake or efficiency calculations between groups. The ruminal ammonia concentrations were similar between groups, whereas acetate concentrations and acetate : propionate ratio were greater for CSFA than TSFA cows. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry (P < 0.0007) and organic matters (P < 0.0003), fat (P < 0.0001), NDF and ADF (P = 0.02) were lower in the TSFA v. CSFA cows. In conclusion, the CSFA-supplemented cows produced 3% higher milk and 4.7% higher 4% FCM than the TSFA cows. However, TSFA supplementation did not depress milk-protein content. The apparent total-tract digestibility was lower for all dietary components in the TSFA cows, which was probably due to the effects of both degree of saturation and triglyceride form of the TSFA supplement. Considering that diets were balanced according to the fat content of the supplements, the lower yields of milk and FCM observed in the TSFA than CSFA cows were likely due to the lower digestibility of the fat and other nutrients in the TSFA cows, which might have negatively influenced the dietary  content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663821>Inhibition of copper-induced aggregation of human γD-crystallin by a diimine molecule and investigations on their molecular interactions.</a></h2><p>Oxidative damages in eye lens crystallin proteins due to dehomeostasis of metal ions like Cu2+ and Zn2+ cause their aggregation. Previously, we had demonstrated the protective role of Schiff bases (monoimine) towards human? D-crystallin (HGD) aggregation induced by copper ions. In continuation of that strategy, in the present work, we have synthesized a diimine Schiff base molecule (compound 5). Two imine groups were incorporated in this molecule for the enhancement of metal complexing ability. Compound 5 formed a stable complex with Cu2+ and ∼72% inhibition of copper-mediated aggregation of HGD in presence of compound 5 (8 µM) was observed. This compound was evolved as better inhibitor as compared to earlier reported compound. HGD-compound 5 binding constant was calculated as ∼105 M-1 from fluorescence quenching studies. The average binding distance of 6.52 nm between protein fluorophore and compound 5 was determined by Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) calculations. The overall interaction process was driven by entropy with a major involvement of hydrophobic forces. No significant conformational change in HGD due to its interaction with compound 5 was observed in synchronous fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy.

Removal of 1,4-dioxane by a bio-zeolite (Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190-bioaugmented ZSM-5) in the presence of several chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) was superior to removal by adsorption using abiotic zeolite. Mixtures containing 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), were an exception and completely inhibited the bio-zeolite system. Specific adsorption characteristics were studied using adsorption isotherms in single- and bi-solute systems accompanied by Polanyi-theory based Dubinin-Ashtakhov (DA) modeling. Adsorption behavior was examined using characteristic  (Ea/H) from modified DA models and molecular dynamics simulations. While the tight-fit of 1,4-dioxane in the hydrophobic channels of ZSM-5 appears to drive 1,4-dioxane adsorption, the greater hydrophobicity of trichloroethene and cis-1,2-dichloroethene cause them to have a greater affinity over 1,4-dioxane for adsorption sites on the zeolite. 1,4-Dioxane was desorbed and displaced by CVOCs, except 1,1-DCE due to its low Ea/H value, explaining why bio-zeolite only biodegraded 1,4-dioxane in 1,1-DCE-free CVOC mixtures. Understanding the adsorption mechanisms of solutes in complex mixtures is crucial for the implementation of sorption-based zeolite treatment technologies for the removal of complex contaminant mixtures from aquatic environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664330>Epidemiology of artherial hypertension in pregnants.</a></h2><p>To investigate the epidemiological data of hypertension in pregnant women, as well as to identify its possible associated events.Data collection was performed at the high-risk prenatal outpatient clinic and in the maternity ward at a public hospital in the São Paulo city, during the morning and afternoon periods, from October 2015 to July 2016. A questionnaire with 22 questions prepared by the researchers was used. The margin of error was 5% and the confidence level was 95%. For the calculation, the two-proportion equality, Pearson correlation and ANOVA tests were used.Among the interviewees, 43% had chronic hypertension, 33.3% presented with up to 20 weeks of gestation, 23.7% presented after the 20th week of gestation, 62.3% were between 18 and 35 years of age, 78.1% had a family history of hypertension, and among those aged 36 to 45 years, 11.4% were in the first gestation, and 26.3% in the second gestation.

The biosynthetic machinery responsible for the production of these secondary metabolites (SMs) (also called natural products) is often encoded by collocated groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). High-throughput genome sequencing of both isolates and metagenomic samples combined with the development of specialized computational workflows is enabling systematic identification of BGCs and the discovery of novel SMs. In order to advance exploration of microbial secondary metabolism and its diversity, we developed the largest publicly available database of predicted BGCs combined with experimentally verified BGCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc-public).

However, there are still lots of issues that need to be addressed towards the practical application. Here, free-standing Co-doped NiO three-dimensional nanosheets were prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis method and directly employed as air-breathing cathode of Li-O2 battery. The morphological phenomenon and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared cathode material were characterized by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The Co-doped NiO electrode delivered a maximum discharge capacity of around 12857 mAh g-1 with a low overpotential (0.82 V) at 200 mA g-1. Under upper-limit specific capacities of 500 mAh g-1 at 400 mA g-1, the Li-O2 batteries exhibited a long cycle-life of 165 cycles. Compared with the undoped NiO electrode, the Li-O2 battery based on the Co-doped NiO cathode showed significantly higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. This superior electrochemical performance is because the partial substitution of Ni2+ in the NiO matrix by Co2+ to improve the p-type electronic conductivity of NiO. In addition, the morphology and specific surface area of NiO are affected by Co doping, which can expand electrode-electrolyte contact area and lead to sufficient space for Li2O2 deposition. This approach harnesses the great potential of Co-doped NiO nanosheets for practical applications as advanced electrodes for rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665364>Reprogramming and differentiation-dependent transcriptional alteration of DNA damage response and apoptosis genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells.</a></h2><p>Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have a dual capability to self-renew and differentiate into all cell types necessary to develop an entire organism. Differentiation is associated with dynamic epigenetic alteration and transcriptional change, while self-renewal depends on maintaining the genome DNA accurately. Genome stability of PSCs is strictly regulated to maintain pluripotency. However, the DNA damage response (DDR) mechanism in PSCs is still unclear. There is accumulating evidence that genome stability and pluripotency are regulated by a transcriptional change in undifferentiated and differentiated states. iPSCs are ideal for analyzing transcriptional regulation during reprogramming and differentiation. This study aimed to elucidate the transcriptional alteration surrounding genome stability maintenance, including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis in fibroblasts, iPSCs and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from iPSCs as differentiated cells. After ionizing radiation exposure, foci for the DNA double-stranded break marker γ-H2AX increased, peaking at 0.5 h in all cells (>90%), decreasing after 4 h in fibroblasts (32.3%) and NPCs (22.3%), but still remaining at 52.5% (NB1RGB C2 clone) and 54.7% (201B7 cells) in iPSCs. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected, indicating that iPSCs' apoptosis increases. In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed high expression of apoptosis genes (TP53, CASP3 and BID) in iPSCs.

Each ribonucleoprotein complex comprises specific rRNAs and ribosomal proteins that are organized into functional domains. The RNA exosome complex plays a crucial role as one of the pre-60S-processing factors, because it is the RNase responsible for processing the 7S pre-rRNA to the mature 5.8S rRNA. The yeast pre-60S assembly factor Nop53 has previously been shown to associate with the nucleoplasmic pre-60S in a region containing the "foot" structure assembled around the 3' end of the 7S pre-rRNA. Nop53 interacts with 25S rRNA and with several 60S assembly factors, including the RNA exosome, specifically, with its catalytic subunit Rrp6 and with the exosome-associated RNA helicase Mtr4. Nop53 is therefore considered the adaptor responsible for recruiting the exosome complex for 7S processing. Here, using proteomics-based approaches in budding yeast to analyze the effects of Nop53 on the exosome interactome, we found that the exosome binds pre-ribosomal complexes early during the ribosome maturation pathway. We also identified interactions through which Nop53 modulates exosome activity in the context of 60S maturation and provide evidence that in addition to recruiting the exosome, Nop53 may also be important for positioning the exosome during 7S processing. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the exosome is recruited much earlier during ribosome assembly than previously thought, suggesting the existence of additional interactions that remain to be described.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662351>Ultra-processed foods and excessive free sugar intake in the UK: a nationally representative cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>To describe dietary sources of free sugars in different age groups of the UK population considering food groups classified according to the NOVA system and to estimate the proportion of excessive free sugars that could potentially be avoided by reducing consumption of their main sources.Cross-sectional data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008-2014) were analysed. Food items collected using a 4-day food diary were classified according to the NOVA system.9364 individuals aged 1.5 years and above.Average dietary content of free sugars and proportion of individuals consuming more than 10% of total  from free sugars.Poisson regression was used to estimate the associations between each of the NOVA food group and intake of free sugars. We estimated the per cent reduction in prevalence of excessive free sugar intake from eliminating ultra-processed foods and table sugar. Analyses were stratified by age group and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, survey year, region and equivalised household income (sterling pounds).Ultra-processed foods account for 56.8% of total  intake and 64.7% of total free sugars in the UK diet. Free sugars represent 12.4% of total  intake, and 61.3% of the sample exceeded the recommended limit of 10%  from free sugars. This percentage was higher among children (74.9%) and adolescents (82.9%). Prevalence of excessive free sugar intake increased linearly across quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption for all age groups, except among the elderly. Eliminating ultra-processed foods could potentially reduce the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake by 47%.Our findings suggest that actions to reduce the ultra-processed food consumption generally rich in free sugars could lead to substantial public health benefits.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Maize is both a genetic model for grass species and a potential source of lignocellulosic biomass from crop residues. Genetic improvement of maize for its utility as a bioenergy feedstock depends on identification of the specific gene family members expressed during secondary wall development in stems.High-throughput sequencing of transcripts expressed in developing rind tissues of stem internodes provided a comprehensive inventory of cell wall-related genes in maize (Zea mays, cultivar B73). Of 1239 of these genes, 854 were expressed among the internodes at ≥95 reads per 20 M, and 693 of them at ≥500 reads per 20 M. Grasses have cell wall compositions distinct from non-commelinid species; only one-quarter of maize cell wall-related genes expressed in stems were putatively orthologous with those of the eudicot Arabidopsis. Using a slope-metric algorithm, five distinct patterns for sub-sets of co-expressed genes were defined across a time course of stem development. For the subset of genes associated with secondary wall formation, fifteen sequence motifs were found in promoter regions. The same members of gene families were often expressed in two maize inbreds, B73 and Mo17, but levels of gene expression between them varied, with 30% of all genes exhibiting at least a 5-fold difference at any stage. Although presence-absence and copy-number variation might account for much of these differences, fold-changes of expression of a CADa and a FLA11 gene were attributed to polymorphisms in promoter response elements.Large genetic variation in maize as a species precludes the extrapolation of cell wall-related gene expression networks even from one common inbred line to another. Elucidation of genotype-specific expression patterns and their regulatory controls will be needed for association panels of inbreds and landraces to fully exploit genetic variation in maize and other bioenergy grass species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661843>Design of a 900 MHz Dual-Mode SWIPT for Low-Power IoT Devices.</a></h2><p>This paper presents a duty cycle-based, dual-mode simultaneous wireless information and power transceiver (SWIPT) for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in which a sensor node monitors the received power and adaptively controls the single-tone or multitone communication mode. An adaptive power-splitting (PS) ratio control scheme distributes the received radio frequency (RF)  between the  harvesting (EH) path and the information decoding (ID) path. The proposed SWIPT enables the self-powering of an ID transceiver above 20 dBm input power, leading to a battery-free network. The optimized PS ratio of 0.44 enables it to provide sufficient harvested  for self-powering and -neutral operation of the ID transceiver. The ID transceiver can demodulate the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) and the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signals. Moreover, for low-input power level, a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) scheme based on multitone is also proposed for demodulation of the information-carrying RF signals. Due to the limited power, information is transmitted in uplink by backscatter modulation instead of RF signaling. To validate our proposed SWIPT architecture, a SWIPT printed circuit board (PCB) was designed with a multitone SWIPT board at 900 MHz. The demodulation of multitone by PAPR was verified separately on the PCB. Results showed the measured sensitivity of the SWIPT to be -7 dBm, and the measured peak power efficiency of the RF  harvester was 69% at 20 dBm input power level. The power consumption of the injection-locked oscillator (ILO)-based phase detection path was 13.6 mW, and it could be supplied from the EH path when the input power level was high. The ID path could demodulate 4-ASK- and BPSK-modulated signals at the same time, thus receiving 3 bits from the demodulation process. Maximum data rate of 4 Mbps was achieved in the measurement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661895>Kinetic Models of Secondary Active Transporters.</a></h2><p>Kinetic models have been employed to understand the logic of substrate transport through transporters of the Solute Carrier (SLC) family. All SLC transporters operate according to the alternate access model, which posits that substrate transport occurs in a closed loop of partial reactions (i.e., a transport cycle). Kinetic models can help to find realistic estimates for conformational transitions between individual states of the transport cycle. When constrained by experimental results, kinetic models can faithfully describe the function of a candidate transporter at a pre-steady state. In addition, we show that kinetic models can accurately predict the intra- and extracellular substrate concentrations maintained by the transporter at a steady state, even under the premise of loose coupling between the electrochemical gradient of the driving ion and of the substrate. We define the criteria for the design of a credible kinetic model of the SLC transporter. Parsimony is the guiding principle of kinetic modeling. We argue, however, that the level of acceptable parsimony is limited by the need to account for the substrate gradient established by a secondary active transporter, and for random order binding of co-substrates and substrate. Random order binding has consistently been observed in transporters of the SLC group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661249>Side-On OMoF(η-SO) and OWF(η-SO) Complexes Featuring Peroxo-Like Sulfur Monoxide Ligand.</a></h2><p>Peroxo-like sulfur monoxide complexes of molybdenum and tungsten oxyfluorides [OMF(η-SO)] were prepared via the reactions of molybdenum and tungsten atoms and SOF in cryogenic matrixes. On the basis of the infrared spectra and density functional theory calculations, the SO ligand is bound to the metal center in a side-on fashion, and both complexes possess closed shell singlet ground states. The experimental S-O stretching frequencies of OMoF(η-SO) and OWF(η-SO) are much lower than those of SO but close to that of singlet SO, indicating that the SO ligand should be considered as SO. This is consistent with the rather long S-O bond length in comparison to that of the ONbF(η-SO) and OTaF(η-SO) complexes with SO ligand. Bonding analysis results reveal that the π* (3π) orbitals of the triplet SO molecule are both doubly occupied in OMoF(η-SO) and OWF(η-SO) due to the two-electron transfer from metal to SO. End-on isomers with M-OS or M-SO geometries were also predicted to be stable, but all of them are higher in  than the side-on complexes, and the calculated frequencies are inconsistent with the experimental values. Comparisons in bond lengths, vibrational frequencies, and natural charges between the OMF(η-SO) and OMF(η-O) complexes (M = Mo, W, Nb, Ta) further confirm the peroxo-like character of the SO ligand in OMoF(η-SO) and OWF(η-SO).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665761>Sustainable bioenergy for climate mitigation: developing drought-tolerant trees and grasses.</a></h2><p>Bioenergy crops are central to climate mitigation strategies that utilize biogenic carbon, such as BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), alongside the use of biomass for heat, power, liquid fuels and, in the future, biorefining to chemicals. Several promising lignocellulosic crops are emerging that have no food role - fast-growing trees and grasses - but are well suited as bioenergy feedstocks, including Populus, Salix, Arundo, Miscanthus, Panicum and Sorghum.These promising crops remain largely undomesticated and, until recently, have had limited germplasm resources. In order to avoid competition with food crops for land and nature conservation, it is likely that future bioenergy crops will be grown on marginal land that is not needed for food production and is of poor quality and subject to drought stress. Thus, here we define an ideotype for drought tolerance that will enable biomass production to be maintained in the face of moderate drought stress. This includes traits that can readily be measured in wide populations of several hundred unique genotypes for genome-wide association studies, alongside traits that are informative but can only easily be assessed in limited numbers or training populations that may be more suitable for genomic selection. Phenotyping, not genotyping, is now the major bottleneck for progress, since in all lignocellulosic crops studied extensive use has been made of next-generation sequencing such that several thousand markers are now available and populations are emerging that will enable rapid progress for drought-tolerance breeding. The emergence of novel technologies for targeted genotyping by sequencing are particularly welcome. Genome editing has already been demonstrated for Populus and offers significant potential for rapid deployment of drought-tolerant crops through manipulation of ABA receptors, as demonstrated in Arabidopsis, with other gene targets yet to be tested.Bioenergy is predicted to be the fastest-developing renewable  over the coming decade and significant investment over the past decade has been made in developing genomic resources and in collecting wild germplasm from within the natural ranges of several tree and grass crops. Harnessing these resources for climate-resilient crops for the future remains a challenge but one that is likely to be successful.© The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, we aim to assess the validity of REE predictive equations based on body composition variables in treatment-seeking Arab adults with overweight and obesity.Body composition and REE were measured by Tanita BC-418 bioimpedance and Vmax Encore 229 IC respectively, and predictive equations based on fat mass, fat-free mass were used in REE estimations among 87 adults of both genders, in the Outpatient Clinic in the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at Beirut Arab University (Lebanon). The mean differences between the measured and estimated REE values were calculated to assess accuracy, and the Bland-Altman method was used to assess the level of agreement.Ten predictive were included. In males, all predictive equations gave significantly different estimates of REE when compared to that measured by IC. On the other hand, in females, the mean difference between the REE value estimated by Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations and that measured using IC was not significant, and agreement was confirmed using Bland-Altman plots.We suggest Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations for accurate REE estimation in females; however, new validated REE estimation equations for males in this population are still needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661277>Direct Synthesis of Cycloalkanes from Diols and Secondary Alcohols or Ketones Using a Homogeneous Manganese Catalyst.</a></h2><p>A method for the synthesis of substituted cycloalkanes was developed using diols and secondary alcohols or ketones via a cascade hydrogen borrowing sequence. A non-noble and air-stable manganese catalyst (2 mol %) was used to perform this transformation.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate  restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of  Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%)  restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%)  restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate  restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe  restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate  restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate  restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe  restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661539>Utilization of a magnetic field-driven microscopic motion for piezoelectric  harvesting.</a></h2><p>In spite of the recent advances in the development of high performing piezoelectric materials, their applications are typically limited to the direct conversion of mechanical impact  to electrical , potentially risking mechanical failures.

Comparatively, molecular simulation methods to induce, control and quantitatively characterize such deformations remain scarce. This work defines a novel collective coordinate associated with membrane bending, which strives to combine realism (by preserving the notion of local atomic curvatures) and low computational cost (allowing its evaluation at every time step of a molecular dynamics simulation). Enhanced sampling simulations along this conformational coordinate provide convenient access to the underlying bending free  landscape. To showcase its potential, the method is applied to three state-of-the-art problems: the determination of the bending free  landscape of a POPE bilayer, the formation of a POPE liposome, and the study of the influence of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal on the budding of Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663266>O3-Type Layered Ni-Rich Oxide: A High-Capacity and Superior-Rate Cathode for Sodium-Ion Batteries.</a></h2><p>Inspired by its high-active and open layered framework for fast Li extraction/insertion reactions, layered Ni-rich oxide is proposed as an outstanding Na-intercalated cathode for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. An O3-type Na Ni Co Mn O is achieved through a facile electrochemical ion-exchange strategy in which Li ions are first extracted from the LiNi Co Mn O cathode and Na ions are then inserted into a layered oxide framework. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism of layered Ni-rich oxide during Na extraction/insertion is investigated in detail by combining ex situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron  loss spectroscopy. As an excellent cathode for Na-ion batteries, O3-type Na Ni Co Mn O delivers a high reversible capacity of 171 mAh g and a remarkably stable discharge voltage of 2.8 V during long-term cycling. In addition, the fast Na transport in the cathode enables high rate capability with 89 mAh g at 9 C.

All basal diets consisted of cereals, soybean meal, skim milk powder and premixes according to recommendations (no growth promoters or enzymes). For Trial 1, piglets from 16 litters (50% male-castrated, 50% female) were assigned to three treatment groups ( = 16) in a completely randomised block design. Groups received either 2.5% supplementation with sun dried (SD) or drum dried (DD)  powder or 2.5% of diatomaceous earth (control). For Trial 2, piglets from 12 litters received either 5% of diatomaceous earth (control) or one of three mixtures of diatomaceous earth + DD  powder (3.3%+1.7%, 1.7%+3.3% or 0.0%+5%;  = 12).

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are the main incretins. The EIA has not been investigated in healthy neonatal foals but should be important because  demands are high in healthy foals and dysregulation is frequent in sick foals.To evaluate the EIA response to carbohydrates or fasting in newborn foals. We hypothesized that incretin secretion would be higher after PO versus IV carbohydrate administration or fasting.Thirty-six healthy Standardbred foals ≤4 days of age.Prospective study. Blood was collected before and after a PO glucose test (OGT; 300, 500, 1000 mg/kg), an IV glucose test (IVGT; 300, 500, 1000 mg/kg), a PO lactose test (OLT; 1000 mg/kg), and fasting. Foals were muzzled for 240 minutes. Blood was collected over 210 minutes glucose, insulin, GIP, and GLP-1 concentrations were measured.Only PO lactose caused a significant increase in blood glucose concentration (P < .05). All IV glucose doses induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Concentrations of GIP and GLP-1 decreased until foals nursed (P < .05), at which time rapid increases in glucose, insulin, GIP, and GLP-1 concentrations occurred (P < .05).Healthy newborn foals have a functional EIA that is more responsive to milk and lactose than glucose. Non-carbohydrate factors in mare's milk may be important for EIA activity. Constant exposure of intestinal cells to nutrients to maintain EIA activity could be relevant to management of sick foals. Foals can be fasted for 4 hours without experiencing hypoglycemia.© 2019 The Authors.

Recently, the significance of the biofilm mode of growth in biotechnological applications received increased attention. Since biofilm reactors show many advantages over suspended cell reactors, especially in their higher biomass density and operational stability, bacterial biofilms have emerged as an interesting approach for the expression of specific proteins. Despite the potential of biofilm systems, recombinant protein production using biofilms has been scarcely investigated for the past 25 years. Our group has demonstrated that  biofilms were able to produce a model recombinant protein, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), at much higher levels than their planktonic counterparts. Even without optimization of cultivation conditions, an attractive productivity was obtained, indicating that biofilm cultures can be used as an alternative form of high cell density cultivation (HCDC).  remains one of the favorite hosts for recombinant protein production and it has been successfully used in metabolic engineering for the synthesis of high value products. This review presents the advantages and concerns of using biofilms for the production of recombinant proteins and summarizes the different biofilm systems which have been described for this purpose.

Several kinases use PPi as a substrate and these kinases have recently been suggested to have evolved from ATP-dependent functional homologs, which have significant amino acid sequence similarity to PPi-utilizing enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) can be divided into three types according to the phosphate donor (ATP, GTP, or PPi), and the amino acid sequence similarity of these PEPCKs is too low to confirm that they share a common ancestor. Here, we solved the crystal structure of a PPi-PEPCK homolog from the bacterium Actinomyces israelii (AiPEPCK) at 2.6 Å resolution and compared it with previously reported structures from ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs to assess the degrees of similarities and divergences among these PEPCKs and to determine the structural basis for the PPi specificity of PPi-type PEPCKs. These comparisons revealed that the amino acid residues directly contributing to substrate recognition, except for those that recognize purine moieties, are conserved. Furthermore, the order of secondary structure elements between PPi-, ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs was strictly conserved. The structure-based comparisons of the three PEPCK types provide key insights into the structural basis for PPi specificity and suggest that all of these PEPCKs are derived from a common ancestor.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663717>Valance-state controllable fabrication of Cu2-xO/Si type-II heterojunction for high-performance photodetectors.</a></h2><p>Cuprite, nominally cuprous oxide (Cu2O) but more correctly Cu2-xO, is widely used in optoelectronic applications due to its natural p-type, nontoxicity and abundant availability. However, the photoresponsivity of Cu2O/Si photodetectors (PDs) has been limited by the lack of high quality Cu2-xO films. Herein, we report a facile room-temperature solution method to prepare high-quality Cu2-xO films with controllable x value which were used as hole selective transport layers in crystalline n-type silicon based heterojunction PDs. The detection performance of Cu2-xO/Si PDs exhibits a remarkable improvement via reducing the x value, resulting in the optimized PDs with high responsivity of 417 mA W-1 and fast response speed of 1.3/230 μs. Furthermore, the performance of the heterojunction PDs can be further improved by designing the pyramidal silicon structure, with enhanced responsivity of 600 mA W-1 and response speed of 0.6/129 μs. The superior photodetecting performance of Cu2-xO/n-Si heterojunctions is attributed to (i) the matched  level band alignment, (ii) the low trap states in high-quality almost pure Cu2O thin films, (iii) the excellent light trapping. We expect the low-cost, highly efficient solution process would be of great convenience for large-scale fabrication of the Cu2-xO thin films and broaden the applications of Cuprite based optoelectronic devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663298>Dietary intake of people with dementia on acute hospital wards.</a></h2><p>The aim of this service evaluation was to understand the factors affecting meal provision on a dementia ward and assess whether meals-based dietary intake met estimated mean  requirement and reference nutrient intake (RNI). A mixed-methods approach was adopted: 1. Mapping the dietary intake for a cohort ( n =6) of inpatients with advanced dementia over a period of four consecutive days. 2. Semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of the professionals ( n =5) involved. Two of the participants' four-day mean intakes did not meet their estimated  requirement based on meal provision. All participants apart from one met the target of 0.75g of protein per kg body weight per day for the general population. Several of the nutrients consumed were at or exceeded the RNI for adults of this age, although participants' mean dietary vitamin D intake was substantially below the RNI for the general population. The themes included communication, time pressure and the continuity of service provision. The meals provided were nutritionally sound. Individuals' nutritional status was improved through staff supporting them with eating. The contribution of drinks and snacks to nutrient intake warrants further exploration. Effective communication between food providers and ward areas is important. Mealtimes should reflect patient need - for example, having the main meal in the evening and a lighter option at lunch. This does not clash with the benefits of a flexible breakfast time.© 2019 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their physicochemical properties were studied in detail by standard techniques like low angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy--dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption studies, and thermogravimetric-differential thermal (TG-DTA) analysis and spectral studies like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis (UV-Visible-DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD patterns prove that the material's phase identity is the same irrespective of metal incorporation. SEM displayed the uniform shape and size of the nanoparticles. The presence of elements such as Ti, V, Pd, Si and O in respective materials is revealed using the EDXS analysis. Around 30% weight loss arose upon calcination from room temperature to 800 °C. BET surface area analysis presented that the parent materials have a high surface area (1024 m2 g-1) which was reduced upon metal incorporation. FT-IR analysis exhibited the framework vibrations of the synthesised materials. UV-Visible-DRS analysis indicated the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions. The multivalent-metal-ion-functionalized mesoporous materials showed significant enhancement in potent antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The antimicrobial activity is because of its low lipophilicity, which no longer allows the materials to enter via the lipid membrane. Thus, the new materials neither obstruct the metal-binding sites nor inhibit the growth of microbe enzymes. Further, the results show that the transition metal ion-containing mesoporous materials possessing good anticancer activity arising from their excessive surface area to volume ratio provided appropriate association with a tumour cell due to the direct penetration of mesoporous materials into the cell wall, causing membrane damage and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664440>Very Low- Diets-Opportunity for Greater Weight Loss, but Risk of Bone Loss.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661935>A Fog Computing enabled Virtual Power Plant Model for Delivery of Frequency Restoration Reserve Services.</a></h2><p>Nowadays, centralized  grid systems are transitioning towards more decentralized systems driven by the need for efficient local integration of new deployed small scale renewable  sources.

This paper is proposing a fog computing infrastructure for the local management of  systems and the creation of coalitions of prosumers able to provide ancillary services to the grid. It features an edge devices layer for  monitoring of individual prosumers, a fog layer providing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) techniques for managing local  systems by implementing cooperative models, and a cloud layer where the service specific technical requirements are defined. On top, a model has been defined allowing the dynamical construction of coalitions of prosumers as Virtual Power Plants at the fog layer for the provisioning of frequency restoration reserve services while considering both the prosumers' local constraints and the service ones as well as the constituents' profit maximization.

Linear regression analysis showed that the presence of SO decreases REE by 1.557 kcal/day for each kg of body weight (β = -1.557; CI = -0.261 ¬- (-0.503); p = 0.004), after adjusting for age and gender.SO appears to be present in a high proportion of treatment-seeking adults with overweight or obesity of both genders, and it seems to be associated with a reduced REE, compared with those without SO.

A 2 tailed Pearson correlation analysis was conducted in order to present the relationships between body composition variables and performance measures. The main outcome of the present study is that experience in resistance training (r=0.52 to 0.74), lean body tissue (r= 0.61 to 0.95), arms mass (r=0.57 to 0.86), legs mass (r=0.53 to 0.63), bone mineral content (BMC) (r=0.52 to 0.91) and bone mineral density (BMD) (r=0.53 to 91) measures were significantly correlated (p<0.05) with most absolute (kg) and relative (Wilks) maximal strength measures.The results of the present study could guide practitioners working with athletes aged between 22 and 35 years old practicing sports with higher risks of fractures (ex., alpine skiing) to potentially utilize the squat, the bench press and the deadlift not only to build strength in order to increase sport performance, but also to increase BMC and BMD of their athletes trough heavy eccentric loading to help reduce the risks of fractures.Further studies should be directed towards interventions trying to reveal that some type of relationship does exist between BMC, BMD and powerlifting performance and in what direction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665606>Quantifying Triplet State Formation in Zinc Dipyrrin Complexes.</a></h2><p>Photocatalysis is a promising method to harness solar  and use it to form fuels and other high value chemicals, but most sensitizers used in photocatalytic reactions are complexes of rare and expensive metals such as ruthenium and iridium. Zinc dipyrromethene complexes have potential to be a more earth-abundant alternative, but their photophysical properties are largely unexplored. In this study, triplet state formation was quantified in two zinc dipyrromethene complexes, with a and without heavy atoms, by transient absorption spectroscopy. Without heavy atoms the triplet quantum yield was 16% in toluene and 27% in THF. With the addition of heavy I atoms the triplet quantum yield is increased to 62-63% and is insensitive to solvent polarity. The fact that in the absence of heavy atoms the triplet yield in is affected by solvent polarity and in the presence of heavy atoms it is not suggests that triplet formation occurs through different pathways it the two complexes. These triplet yields meet or exceed those of successful organic photosensitizers, illustrating the potential for zinc dipyrromethene complexes as photosensitizers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665612>Static and Dynamic Contributors to VILI in Clinical Practice: Pressure, , and Power.</a></h2><p>Ventilation is inherently a dynamic process. The present-day clinical practice of concentrating on the static inflation characteristics of the individual tidal cycle (plateau pressure, PEEP and their difference [driving pressure, the ratio of tidal volume to compliance]) does not take into account key factors shown experimentally to influence ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). These include rate of airway pressure change (influenced by flow amplitude, inspiratory time fraction, inspiratory inflation contour) and cycling frequency.  must be expended to cause injury, and the product of applied stress and resulting strain determines the  delivered to the lungs per breathing cycle. Understanding the principles of VILI energetics may provide valuable insights and guidance to intensivists for safer clinical practice. In this interpretive review, we highlight that the injuring potential of the inflation pattern depends upon tissue vulnerability, the number of intolerable high  cycles applied in unit time (mechanical power), and the duration of that exposure. Yet, as attractive as this /power hypothesis for encapsulating the drivers of VILI may be for clinical applications, we acknowledge that even these all-inclusive and measurable ergonomic parameters ( per cycle and power), are still too bluntly defined to pinpoint the precise biophysical link between ventilation strategy and tissue injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661104>Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy of di-manganese oxide cluster cations.</a></h2><p>Infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IR-MPD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to elucidate the geometric structure of a series of di-manganese oxide clusters Mn2Ox+ (x = 4-7). The theoretical exploration predicts that all investigated clusters contain a rhombus-like Mn2O2 core with up to four, terminally bound, oxygen atoms. The short Mn-O bond length of the terminal oxygen atoms of ≤1.58 Å indicates triple bond character instead of oxyl radical formation. However, the IR-MPD spectra reveal that higher  isomers with up to two O2 molecules η2-coordinated to the cluster core can be kinetically trapped under the given experimental conditions. In these complexes, all O2 units are activated to superoxide species. In addition, the sequential increase of the oxygen content in the cluster allows for a controlled increase of the positive charge localized on the Mn atoms reaching a maximum for Mn2O7+.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662419>Ascorbate deficiency does not limit non-photochemical quenching in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</a></h2><p>Ascorbate (Asc, vitamin C) plays essential roles in development, signaling, hormone biosynthesis, regulation of gene expression, stress resistance and photoprotection. In vascular plants, violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) requires Asc as reductant, thereby it is required for the -dependent component of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). To assess the role of Asc in NPQ in green algae, which are known to contain low amounts of Asc, we searched for an insertional Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant affected in the VTC2 gene encoding GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of Asc.. The Crvtc2-1 knockout mutant was viable and, depending on the growth conditions, contained 10 to 20% Asc relative to its wild type. When C. reinhardtii was grown photomixotrophically at moderate light, the zeaxanthin-dependent component of NPQ emerged upon strong red illumination both in the Crvtc2-1 mutant and in its wild type. Deepoxidation was unaffected by Asc deficiency, demonstrating the Chlorophycean VDE found in C. reinhardtii does not require Asc as a reductant. The rapidly induced, -dependent NPQ component characteristic of photoautotrophic C. reinhardtiicultures grown at high light was not limited by Asc deficiency either. On the other hand, a reactive oxygen species-induced photoinhibitory NPQ component was greatly enhanced upon Asc deficiency, both under photomixotrophic and photoautotrophic conditions. These results demonstrate Asc has distinct roles in NPQ formation in C. reinhardtiithan in vascular plants.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The eradication of WRR is a difficult task and environmentally friendly control methods are needed to lessen its impact. Priming plants with a stressor (biotic or abiotic) can be a strategy to enhance plant defense/tolerance against future stress episodes but, despite the known underlying common mechanisms, few studies use abiotic-priming for improving tolerance to forthcoming biotic-stress and vice versa ('cross-factor priming'). To assess whether cross-factor priming can be a potential method for enhancing avocado tolerance to WRR disease, 'Dusa' avocado rootstocks, susceptible to R. necatrix, were subjected to two levels of water stress (mild-WS and severe-WS) and, after drought-recovery, inoculated with R. necatrix. Physiological response and expression of plant defense related genes after drought-priming as well as the disease progression were evaluated.Water-stressed avocado plants showed lower water potential and stomatal limitations of photosynthesis compared to control plants. In addition, NPQ and qN values increased, indicating the activation of  dissipating mechanisms closely related to the relief of oxidative stress. This response was proportional to the severity of the water stress and was accompanied by the deregulation of pathogen defense-related genes in the roots. After re-watering, leaf photosynthesis and plant water status recovered rapidly in both treatments, but roots of mild-WS primed plants showed a higher number of overexpressed genes related with plant defense than severe-WS primed plants. Disease progression after inoculating primed plants with R. necatrix was significantly delayed in mild-WS primed plants.These findings demonstrate that mild-WS can induce a primed state in the WRR susceptible avocado rootstock 'Dusa' and reveal that 'cross-factor priming' with water stress (abiotic stressor) is effective for increasing avocado tolerance against R. necatrix (biotic stressor), underpinning that plant responses against biotic and abiotic stress rely on common mechanisms. Potential applications of these results may involve an enhancement of WRR tolerance of current avocado groves and optimization of water use via low frequency deficit irrigation strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664928>Changes in serum albumin and other nutritional markers when using sucroferric oxyhydroxide as phosphate binder among hemodialysis patients: a historical cohort study.</a></h2><p>Elevated serum phosphorus concentrations are common among maintenance hemodialysis patients. Protein is a major source of dietary phosphate, but restriction of protein intake can result in hypoalbuminemia and protein- wasting. We hypothesized that sucroferric oxyhydroxide (SO), a potent phosphate binder with a low pill burden, may reduce serum phosphorus levels in hemodialysis patients with hypoalbuminemia without adversely impacting albumin levels or dietary intake of protein.We retrospectively examined de-identified data from 79 adult, in-center hemodialysis patients with baseline hypoalbuminemia (≤ 3.5 g/dL) switched to SO as part of routine clinical care for at least 1 year. Temporal changes (3-month intervals from baseline through Q4) in phosphate binder pill burden, serum phosphorous levels, nutritional markers, and equilibrated Kt/V were analyzed. Data from a matched reference group of non-hypoalbuminemic patients (N = 79) switched to SO were also examined.SO therapy was associated with a mean reduction of 45.7 and 45.1% in daily phosphate binder pill burden, and a mean reduction of 0.4 mg/dL and 0.51 mg/dL in serum phosphorus levels for the hypoalbuminemic and non-hypoalbuminemic patients, respectively. Hypoalbuminemic patients demonstrated significant increases in mean serum albumin levels from 3.50 mg/dL at baseline to 3.69, 3.74, 3.70, and 3.69 mg/dL during Q1 through Q4, respectively (P < 0.0001), whereas serum albumin levels remained unchanged in the non-hypoalbuminemic group.Both hypoalbuminemic and non-hypoalbuminemic patients switching to SO exhibited significant reductions in serum phosphorus concentrations and daily phosphate binder pill burden. Among hypoalbuminemic patients, the initiation of SO therapy was also associated with increases in serum albumin, suggesting therapy may have allowed patients to increase their dietary intake of protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661677>Functionalized single-walled carbon-nanotube-blended P3HT-based high performance memory behavior thin-film transistors devices.</a></h2><p>We report on the fabrication and transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) blended with P3HT (poly 3-hexyl thiophene-2, 5-diyl). The composite is used as a hybrid organic active channel transistor. The performances of the fabricated devices were investigated as a function of the SWCNTs loads in the composite, and their response evaluated under white light illumination. Our results show that for SWCNT loads ≤ 1.5 wt. %, all the devices behave as p-type transistors, exhibiting excellent performance, with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 104 and a maximum on-state current (Ion) exceeding 80 μA. Moreover, compared with pristine transistors with a P3HT channel, the Hall mobility of these hybrid TFTs was found to increase by more than one order of magnitude, i.e. increasing from 0.062 to 1.54 cm2/V.s. Finally, under light illumination, the transfer characteristics (i.e. IDS as a function of VGS) were found to systematically undergo a typical shift together with a fully-reversible memory behavior.

That makes them important components of the human body and wearable assistive devices alike. This study investigates how springs placed anteriorly across the hip joint affect leg joint angles and powers, and leg muscle activities during level walking at 0.5 to 2.1 m/s. We hypothesized that the anterior hip springs (I) load hip extension, (II) support hip flexion and (III) affect ankle muscle activity and dynamics during walking. Effects at the ankle were expected because hip and ankle redistribute segmental power in concert to achieve forward progression. We observed that the participants' contribution to hip power did not increase during hip extension as the spring stored . Simultaneously, the activities of plantarflexor muscles that modulate  storage in the Achilles tendon were reduced by 28% (gastrocnemius medialis) and 9% (soleus). As the spring returned  with the onset of hip flexion, the participants' contribution to hip power was reduced by as much as 23%. Soleus activity before push-off increased by up to 9%. Instead of loading hip extension, anterior hip springs seem to store and return parts of the  normally exchanged with the Achilles tendon. Thereby, the springs support hip flexion but may reduce elastic  storage in and hence recoil from the Achilles tendon. This interaction should be considered during the design and simulation of wearable assistive devices as it might - depending on user characteristics - enhance or diminish their overall functionality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The MSCTPs of well-defined facets are synthesized on Si/SiO substrate with a quartz-tube chemical vapor deposition furnace. The MSCTP shows a spontaneous emission around 719 nm at room temperature, and a stimulated emission resonant in a single Fabry-Perot mode at 148-223 K. The lasing threshold varies from 21.56 to 53.15 μJ/cm and present a temperature dependence in an empirical exponential function with a characteristic temperature 72.73 K.

All athletes were selected from the French National Institute of Sports and Physical Education . Ultrasound measurements were made with a sonographic US BOX at the mid-thigh level. We developed a multi -linear model of body fat estimation from ultrasound and anthropometric dimensions (height, weight, waist circumference) using the DXA reference method. A cross-validation study was then performed with this linear regression on 62 males athletes proportionally stratified across the sports.The best accuracy of BF was obtained using a multi-linear model from ultrasonic and anthropometric measurements with a concordance correlation pc = 0.941. This model was then used to estimate BF on the 62 males athletes. The concordance correlation pc= 0.931 and SEE =1.60. The 95% limits of agreement for individual BF% were [-4.1;3.6%] with symmetrically distributed deviations.Comparing to DXA, ultrasonic and anthropometric measurements are both accurate techniques to estimates BF%.

Thus, toluene removal from air is necessary. To solve the problem of reducing high toluene concentrations with a short gas retention time (GRT), a quorum-sensing molecule [N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone] (OHL) was added to a biotrickling filter (BTF). In this study, a BTF was used to treat synthetic and natural waste gases containing toluene. An extensive analysis was performed to understand the removal efficiency, removal characteristics, and bacterial community of the BTF. The addition of 20 μM OHL to the BTF significantly improved toluene removal, and more than 99.2% toluene removal was achieved at a GRT of 0.5 min when natural waste gas containing toluene (590-1020 ppm or 2.21-3.83 g m) was introduced. The maximum inlet load for toluene was 337.9 g m h. Moreover, the BTF exhibited satisfactory adaptability to shock loading and shutdown operations. Pseudomonadaceae (33.0%) and Comamonadaceae (26.3%) were predominant bacteria in the system after a 98-day operation. These bacteria were responsible for toluene degradation. The optimal moisture content and low pressure drop for system operations demonstrated that the BTF was  and cost efficient. Therefore, processing through a BTF with OHL is a favorable technique for toluene treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665571>Adding Increased  or Activity to Criterion (A) of the DSM-5 Definition of Hypomania and Mania: Effect on the Diagnoses of 907 Patients From the Bipolar Collaborative Network.</a></h2><p>According to DSM-IV, criterion (A) for diagnosing a hypomanic/manic episode is mood change (ie, elevated, expansive, or irritable mood). Criterion (A) was redefined in DSM-5, adding increased  or activity in addition to mood change. We sought to investigate the effect of adding increased  or activity to criterion (A) for the diagnosis of hypomania/mania and, thus, bipolar disorder.This analysis of prospectively collected data from the Bipolar Collaborative Network (1995-2002) includes 907 DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed bipolar outpatients (14,306 visits). The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was administered monthly and used to define DSM-IV and DSM-5 criterion (A) fulfillment during a hypomanic/manic visit.Patients were adults (median age = 40; IQR, 33-49), and over half (56%) were women. Median number of contributed visits was 10 (IQR, 4-23). Applying DSM-5 criterion (A) reduced the number of patients experiencing a hypomanic/manic visit by 34%, compared to DSM-IV. Visits fulfilling DSM-5 criterion (A) had higher odds of experiencing elevated levels of all other mania symptoms, compared to fulfilling DSM-IV criterion (A) only. Association between individual symptoms was strongest with mood elevation and  or activity (OR [95% CL] = 8.65, [7.91, 9.47]).The 34% reduction in the number of patients being diagnosed with a hypomanic/manic visit shows that the impact of applying DSM-5 criterion (A) is substantial. Fewer hypomanic/manic episodes may be diagnosed by the stricter DSM-5 criterion (A), but the episodes diagnosed are likely to be more severe. The DSM-5 criteria may in general prevent overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder but possibly at the cost of underdiagnosing hypomanic/manic episodes.© Copyright 2019 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662585>An Inductive Voltage/Current-Mode Integrated Power Management with Seamless Mode Transition and  Recycling.</a></h2><p>An integrated power management (IPM) with the unique capabilities of seamless-voltage/current-mode (SVCM) operation and  recycling is presented for robust inductive power delivery. Utilizing parasitic bulk diodes with lower voltage drop, this IPM seamlessly transitions between voltage mode (VM) and current mode (CM) in a safe and robust fashion, extending the input-voltage range (removing dead zone) and significantly improving power-conversion efficiency (PCE) in CM operation. The IPM first provides the required load power (P) by one-step rectification/regulation, and then stores the surplus  into a storage capacitor to extend the receiver (Rx) operation time via  recycling when the input power is insufficient.

Although many of the effects on these nontoxic photothermal agents have been well documented, a concern has arisen that the extended usage of these natural and synthetic melanins might be hindered by their limited photothermal effects under low-density light irradiation. To address this issue, herein, we propose a rational and green fabrication strategy toward a new class of synthetic melanin nanoparticles (SMNPs) with superior photothermal effects via the one-pot copolymerization of two kinds of naturally occurring monomers (arginine and dopamine). The total photothermal efficiencies of these arginine-doped SMNPs could be significantly improved (i.e., ∼60% increase) by enhancing 808 nm NIR light absorption via the construction of donor-acceptor microstructures within SMNPs and decreasing nonthermal radiative transition processes via the increase of free radical concentrations within SMNPs. The resulting SMNPs demonstrated higher photothermal therapy efficiencies in both killing 4T1 cancer cells in vitro and suppressing tumor growth and recurrence compared with conventional agents.

Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and  regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h2><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling,  metabolism, adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair. Several of these actions rely on Ca delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU's gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic metabolism impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through  metabolism and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In a previous investigation the formation of bimolecular complexes between caffeine and catechins in green tea extracts (GTE) has been experimentally proven by means of mass spectrometric and  H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The same approaches have been employed in the present study to evaluate the presence of bimolecular complexes in Ceylon tea and Mate extracts. The obtained results show that in the case of Ceylon tea extracts protonated theaflavin is detectable, together with theaflavin/caffein complexes, while caffeine/catechin complexes, already detected in green tea, are still present, but at lower concentration. This aspect is evidenced by the comparison of precursor ion scans performed on protonated caffeine for the two extracts. The spectra obtained in these conditions for GTE and Ceylon tea show that the complexes of caffeine with epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), highy abundant in the case of GTE (signal-to-chemical noise ratio in the range 50-100), are negligible (signal-to-chemical noise ratio in the range 2-3) in the case of Ceylon tea. Mate extracts show the formation of bimolecular complexes involving caffeine but not catechins, and chlorogenic acid becomes responsible for other complex formation. Under positive ion and negative ion conditions, accurate mass measurements allow the identification of malealdehyde, chlorogenic acid, caffeine, two isomers of dicaffeoylquinic acid, rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside. These data indicate that the formation of complexes in natural extracts is a common behaviour and their presence must be considered in the description of natural extracts and, consequently, in their biological activity.This article is protected by copyright.

In this study we perform numerical experiments with different uplift altitudes using the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology Earth System Model to examine potential impacts of uplift of the TP and Himalayas on eastward propagation of the MJO and the associated mechanisms. Analysis of experimental results with dynamics-based MJO diagnostics indicates two potential mechanisms. First, the uplift considerably enhances low-level mean westerlies in the Indian Ocean and convection in the Maritime Continent, which in turn strengthens boundary layer moisture convergence (BLMC) to the east of the MJO convective center. The increased BLMC reinforces upward transport of moisture and heat from BL to free atmosphere and increases lower tropospheric diabatic heating by shallow and congestus clouds ahead of the MJO center, enhancing the Kelvin-Rossby wave feedback. Second, the uplift increases upper tropospheric mean easterlies and stratiform heating at the west of the MJO center, which contributes to eastward propagation of MJO by generating positive moist static  at the east of MJO center. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the origin of the MJO and improvement in simulation of MJO propagation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664731>Proposing the solar-wind  flux hypothesis as a driver of inter-annual variation in tropical tree reproductive effort.</a></h2><p>The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects tropical environmental conditions, potentially altering ecosystem function as El Niño events interact with longer-term climate change. Anomalously warm equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures affect rainfall and temperature throughout the tropics and coincide with altered leaf flush phenology and increased fruit production in wet tropical forests; however, the understanding of mechanisms underlying this pattern is limited. There is evidence that increases in tropical tree reproduction anticipate El Niño onset, motivating the continued search for a global driver of tropical angiosperm reproduction. We present the solar-wind  flux hypothesis: that physical  influx to the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere, generated by a positive anomaly in the solar wind preceding El Niño development, cues tropical trees to increase resource allocation to reproduction.We test this hypothesis using 19 years of data from Luquillo, Puerto Rico, correlating them with measures of solar-wind .From 1994 to 2013, the solar-wind  flux into Earth's magnetosphere (E ) was more strongly correlated with the number of species fruiting and flowering than the Niño 3.4 climate index, despite Niño 3.4 being previously identified as a driver of interannual increases in reproduction.Changes in the global magnetosphere and thermosphere conditions from increased solar-wind  affect global atmospheric pressure and circulation patterns, principally by weakening the Walker circulation. We discuss the idea that these changes cue interannual increases in tropical tree reproduction and act through an unidentified mechanism that anticipates and synchronizes the reproductive output of the tropical trees with El Niño.© 2019 Botanical Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663088>Constant chemical potential cycles for capacitive deionization.</a></h2><p>The primary  consuming operations which occur within a Capacitive Deionization (CDI) cell, are the ion removal (electrosorption), ion concentrating (electrodesorption), and solution switching processes. In theory the maximum system performance for a CDI system arises when solution switching occurs while maintaining a fixed number of ions (N), and when electrosorption/desorption occurs while maintaining a fixed chemical potential (μ). These fixed state variable based operations are analogous to the Carnot cycle, where heat transfer occurs at constant temperature and compression and expansion occur while maintaining constant entropy. In reality, maintaining a constant number of ions during switching is not practically feasible, thus here we investigate two alternative cycles where switching instead occurs while maintaining constant charge or voltage. Unlike constant number of ions, maintaining charge and voltage constant is feasible using a potentiostat. These theoretical cycles were chosen as they are analogues or ideal-like (Stirling and Ericsson) cycles, which are also practically feasible. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that these alternative cycles provide an avenue to approach the theoretical limit with low saline feed water; however, they are not capable of approximating ideal operations at elevated feed-water concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664095>Structural determination of Enzyme-Graphene Nanocomposite Sensor Material.</a></h2><p>State-of-the-art ultra-sensitive blood glucose-monitoring biosensors, based on glucose oxidase (GOx) covalently linked to a single layer graphene (SLG), will be a valuable next generation diagnostic tool for personal glycemic level management. We report here our observations of sensor matrix structure obtained using a multi-physics approach towards analysis of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) on graphene-based biosensor functionalized with GOx under different pH conditions for various hierarchical GOx assemblies within SLG. We developed a methodology to separately extract the average shape of GOx molecules within the hierarchical assemblies. The modeling is able to resolve differences in the average GOx dimer structure and shows that treatment under different pH conditions lead to differences within the GOx at the dimer contact region with SLG. The coupling of different analysis methods and modeling approaches we developed in this study provides a universal approach to obtain detailed structural quantifications, for establishing robust structure-property relationships. This is an essential step to obtain an insight into the structure and function of the GOx-SLG interface for optimizing sensor performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665374>Japanese Structure Survey of Radiation Oncology in 2011.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the evolving structure of radiation oncology in Japan in terms of equipment, personnel, patient load and geographic distribution to identify and overcome any existing limitations. From March 2012 to August 2015, the Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology conducted a questionnaire based on the Japanese national structure survey of radiation oncology in 2011. Data were analyzed based on the institutional stratification by the annual number of new patients treated with radiotherapy per institution. The estimated annual numbers of new and total (new plus repeat) patients treated with radiation were 211 000 and 250 000, respectively. Additionally, the estimated cancer incidence was 851 537 cases with approximately 24.8% of all newly diagnosed patients being treated with radiation. The types and numbers of treatment devices actually used included linear accelerator (LINAC; n = 836), telecobalt (n = 3), Gamma Knife (n = 46), 60Co remote afterloading system (RALS; n = 24), and 192Ir RALS (n = 125). The LINAC system used dual- functions in 619 units, 3D conformal radiotherapy functions in 719 and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) functions in 412. There were 756 JRS or JASTRO-certified radiation oncologists, 1018.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) radiation oncologists, 2026.7 FTE radiotherapy technologists, 149.1 FTE medical physicists, 141.5 FTE radiotherapy quality managers and 716.3 FTE nurses. The frequency of IMRT use significantly increased during this time. To conclude, although there was a shortage of personnel in 2011, the Japanese structure of radiation oncology has clearly improved in terms of equipment and utility.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt obesity model was developed by exposure to different  diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low- group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium- group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high- group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal body weight and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher body weight and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth weight compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). Our findings suggest that maternal high- diet-induced obesity increases placental oxidative stress and decreases placental angiogenesis possibly through the upregulation of Nox2.Copyright © 2019 Chengjun Hu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665604>Proton transfer in Guanine-Cytosine base pairs in B-DNA.</a></h2><p>A double proton transfer reaction in a Guanine-Cytosine (GC) base pair has been proposed as a possible mechanism for rare tautomer (G*C*) formation and thus a source of spontaneous mutations. We analyze this system with free  calculations based on extensive Quantum Mechanics / Molecular Mechanics simulations to properly consider the influence of the DNA biomolecular environment. We find that, although the G*C* rare tautomer is metastable in the gas phase, it is completely unstable in the conditions found in cells. Thus, our calculations show that a double proton reaction cannot be the source of spontaneous point mutations. We have also analyzed the intrabase H transfer reactions in Guanine. Our results show that the DNA environment gives rise to a large free  difference between the rare and canonical tautomers. These results show the key role of the DNA biological environment for the stability of the genetic code.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663498>Algoriphagus sanaruensis sp. nov., a member of the family Cyclobacteriaceae, isolated from a brackish lake in Hamamatsu, Japan.</a></h2><p>Strain M8-2, which was isolated from brackish lake water (Lake Sanaru) in Japan, was characterized for representation of a novel species in the genus Algoriphagus. Cells of strain M8-2 were aerobic, Gram-stain-negative and curved-rod-shaped (0.2-0.5 µm wide and 0.7-1.9 µm long). Strain M8-2 grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 6.5-7.5 and in the presence of 0.5-1.0 % (w/v) NaCl. MK-7 was the sole isoprenoid quinone. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified polar lipid. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0. Phylogenetic analysis based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain M8-2 belonged to the genus Algoriphagus and was closely related to Algoriphagus aquatilis A8-7, Algoriphagus boseongensis BS-R1, Algoriphagus aquaeductus T4, Algoriphagus olei CC-Hsuan-617, Algoriphagusshivajiensis NIO-S3 and Algoriphagus mannitolivorans DSM 15301 with sequence similarities of 96.6-97.4 %. Results of average nucleotide identity (<75 %) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (<19 %) studies showed that M8-2 was distinct from its phylogenetic relatives. Based on the results of tests for acid production, the predominant cellular fatty acid composition, the DNA G+C content and phylogenetic position, a novel species in the genus Algoriphagus, with the name Algoriphagussanaruensis sp. nov., is proposed for strain M8-2 (=JCM 31446=LMG 29969).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661264>Second-order perturbation theory with spin-symmetry projected Hartree-Fock.</a></h2><p>We propose two different schemes for second-order perturbation theory with spin-projected Hartree-Fock. Both schemes employ the same  for the first-order wave function, which is a linear combination of spin-projected configurations. The first approach is based on the normal-ordered projected Hamiltonian, which is partitioned into the Fock-like component and the rest two-particle-like contribution. In the second scheme, the generalized Fock operator is used to construct a spin-free zeroth-order Hamiltonian. To avoid the intruder state problem, we adopt the level-shift techniques frequently used in other multi-reference perturbation theories. We describe both real and imaginary shift schemes and compare their performances by using small systems. Our results clearly show the superiority of the second perturbation scheme with an imaginary shift to other proposed approaches in various aspects, giving accurate potential  curves, spectroscopic constants, and singlet-triplet splitting energies. We also apply these methods to transition metal complexes for computing spin gaps as well as the potential  curve of the chromium dimer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663329>Impact of oxygen vacancy occupancy on charge carrier dynamics in BiVO photoanodes.</a></h2><p>Oxygen vacancies are ubiquitous in metal oxides and critical to performance, yet the impact of these states upon charge carrier dynamics important for photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications, remains contentious and poorly understood. A key challenge is the unambiguous identification of spectroscopic fingerprints which can be used to track their function. Herein, we employ five complementary techniques to modulate the electronic occupancy of states associated with oxygen vacancies  in BiVO photoanodes, allowing us to identify a spectral signature for the ionisation of these states. We obtain an activation  of ̴ 0.2 eV for this ionisation process, with thermally activated electron de-trapping from these states determining the kinetics of electron extraction, consistent with improved photoelectrochemical performance at higher temperatures. Bulk, un-ionised states however, function as deep hole traps, with such trapped holes being energetically unable to drive water oxidation. These observations help address recent controversies in the literature over oxygen vacancy function, providing new insights into their impact upon photoelectrochemical performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665599>Seed-free Selective Deposition of Lithium metal into Tough Graphene Framework for Stable Lithium Metal Anode.</a></h2><p>Graphene has been wildly used as a host to suppress dendrite growth to stabilize lithium metal anode. However, the high overpotential of lithium deposition on pure graphene have to be lowered by doping or employing precious metal. Additionally, the soft nature of graphene rendered itself to aggregate, consequently squeezing room for lithium accommodation. Herein, a tough graphene framework composed by 3D periodic hollow spheres was reported as free-standing host to stabilize lithium metal anodes. The prepared 3D periodic hollow structure not merely reinforces the framework to maintain hollow structure under pressure caused by assembling battery, but also lower the overpotential without the help of dopant or precious metal. It is worthy of noting that high efficiency of ion diffusion, thanking to the channels interconnecting hollow spheres by holes on the walls, benefits both suppression of lithium dendrite and rate capability. The properties of low density and high mechanical strength make graphene frameworks electrode a promising lightweight Li host material, which reveals a new avenue for designing high- density electrode materials.</p></html>
