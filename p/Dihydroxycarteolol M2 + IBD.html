Along with C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin (FC) is the standard test for assessing  activity, even though its specificity and accuracy are not optimal and it lacks a validated cutoff. Over the past few decades, several fecal markers released from intestinal inflammatory cells have been investigated in ; they are the subject of this systematic review.A systematic electronic search of the English literature up to April 2017 was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library. Only papers written in English that analyzed fecal biomarkers in  were included. In vitro studies, animal studies, studies on blood/serum samples, and studies analyzing FC or fecal lactoferrin alone were excluded.Out of 1023 citations, 125 eligible studies were identified. Data were grouped according to each fecal marker including S100A12, high-mobility group box 1, neopterin, polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase, fecal hemoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, human neutrophil peptides, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, chitinase 3-like-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, lysozyme, -pyruvate kinase, myeloperoxidase, fecal eosinophil proteins, human beta-defensin-2, and beta-glucuronidase. Some of these markers showed a high sensitivity and specificity and correlated with disease activity, response to therapy, and mucosal healing. Furthermore, they showed a potential utility in the prediction of clinical relapse.Several fecal biomarkers have the potential to become useful tools complementing FC in  diagnosis and monitoring. However, wide variability in their accuracy in assessment of intestinal inflammation suggests the need for further studies.© 2017 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America.

Increasing evidence has shown that macrophages polarize to different phenotypes depending on the intestinal microenvironment and are associated with the progression of . In the present study, we investigated the effect of oxytocin, a neuroendocrinal, and pro-health peptide, on the modulation of macrophages polarization and the progression of experimental colitis. Our data demonstrated that oxytocin decreased the sensitivity of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimulation with lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, but increased the sensitivity to IL-4 stimulation with enhanced expression of -type genes, arginase I (Arg1), CD206, and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3). This bidirectional modulation was partly due to the up-regulation of β-arrestin2 and resulted in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and reinforcement of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 phosphorylation. Moreover, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) myeloid deficiency mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) intervention compared with the wild mice. For the first time, we reveal that oxytocin-oxytocin receptor system participates in modulating the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and alleviates experimental colitis.

This study aimed to determine site-specific effects of defined macrophage subtypes on the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.Macrophage subtypes in situ in intestinal specimens of patients with  were visualized by immunohistochemistry. In vitro polarization of human peripheral CD14 cells yielded M1 or  macrophages. The influence of primary monocytes or macrophage subtypes on epithelial barrier integrity was analyzed by transepithelial resistance measurements, Western blot analysis, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and cytometric bead array in a coculture model of primary human macrophages and layers of intestinal epithelial cell lines.The lamina propria of the inflamed intestine in patients with , predominantly in Crohn's disease, is massively infiltrated by CD68 cells also positive for inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α. The presence of M1 macrophage shifted the balance in the local macrophage compartment towards a proinflammatory state. In the coculture model, monocytes and M1 macrophages reduced transepithelial resistance as a marker for epithelial barrier integrity. The mechanisms for paracellular leakage included intracellular relocalization of tight junction proteins like claudin-2 and epithelial cell apoptosis. Determined by specific cytokine blockade, M1 macrophages exerted their deleterious effect mainly through TNF-α, whereas monocyte-mediated damage was driven by the inflammasome effector cytokines, interleukin-1β and interleukin-18.Lamina propria monocytes and M1 macrophages invading intestinal tissues directly contribute to disrupting the epithelial barrier through deregulation of tight junction proteins and induction of epithelial cell apoptosis, thus driving intestinal inflammation in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625616>Amelioration of colitis in mice by Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1 by M1 to  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of immune responses by intestine to environmental antigens leads to the chronic inflammatory disease, Inflammatory bowel disease (). Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate . We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10.  macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to - macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

However, molecular regulation of such a circuity remains undefined. Claudin-1 (Cld-1), a tight-junction integral protein deregulation alters colonic epithelial cell (CEC) differentiation, and promotes colitis severity while impairing colitis-associated injury/repair. Tumorigenesis is a product of an unregulated wound-healing process and therefore we postulated that upregulated Cld-1 levels render  patients susceptible to the colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Villin Cld-1 mice are used to carryout overexpressed studies in mice. The role of deregulated Cld-1 expression in CAC and the underlying mechanism was determined using a well-constructed study scheme and mouse models of DSS colitis/recovery and CAC. Using an inclusive investigative scheme, we here report that upregulated Cld-1 expression promotes susceptibility to the CAC and its malignancy. Increased mucosal inflammation and defective epithelial homeostasis accompanied the increased CAC in Villin-Cld-1-Tg mice. We further found significantly increased levels of protumorigenic  macrophages and β-cateninSer552 (β-CatSer552) expression in the CAC in Cld-1Tg vs. WT mice. Mechanistic studies identified the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in Cld-1-dependent activation of the β-CatSer552, which, in turn, was dependent on proinflammatory signals. Our studies identify a critical role of Cld-1 in promoting susceptibility to CAC. Importantly, these effects of deregulated Cld-1 were not associated with altered tight junction integrity, but on its noncanonical role in regulating Notch/PI3K/Wnt/ β-CatSer552 signaling. Overall, outcome from our current studies identifies Cld-1 as potential prognostic biomarker for  severity and CAC, and a novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889230>Sarcopenia and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in oncologic and transplant surgery. It has a high incidence in chronic inflammatory states including inflammatory bowel disease (). The validity of existing data in  and of sarcopenia's correlation with surgical outcomes is limited.We performed a systematic review to assess the correlation of sarcopenia with the requirement for surgery and surgical outcomes in patients with . Observational studies of patients with  in whom an assessment of sarcopenic status/skeletal muscle index was undertaken, a proportion of whom proceeded to surgical management, were selected.A total of 5 studies with a combined 658  patients met the inclusion criteria. The majority (70%) had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Median (range) body mass index and skeletal muscle index were reported in 4 studies and were 16.58 (13.66-22.50) kg/ and 44.52 (42.90-50.64) cm2/, respectively. Forty-two percent of  patients had sarcopenia. Notably, none of the studies assessed both the anatomical and functional component required for a correct assessment of sarcopenia. Three studies noted that sarcopenic  patients had a higher probability of requiring surgery. The rate of major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥IIIa) was significantly higher in patients with sarcopenia. Improved perioperative nutrition management may mitigate the risk of complications.Many  patients are young, may be malnourished, and commonly require emergent surgery. There is considerable heterogeneity in the assessment of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is common in the  population and can predict the need for surgical intervention. Sarcopenia correlates with an increased rate of major postoperative complications. Improved perioperative intervention may diminish this risk. A formal assessment, screening by a dedicated  dietician, and preoperative physical therapy may facilitate early intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26224047>Berberine ameliorates TNBS induced colitis by inhibiting inflammatory responses and Th1/Th17 differentiation.</a></h2><p>Th1 and Th17 cells, and their associated cytokines, have been associated with the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Berberine (BBR), a compound long used in traditional Chinese medicines, has been reported to have therapeutic effects in treating experimental colitis. In this study, we show that BBR had a protective effect on mice with TNBS-induced colitis. BBR inhibited levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α both in the local colon and sera, and transiently increased levels of IL-22. BBR also markedly increased sIgA expression in the colon. BBR had pronounced effects on macrophage populations. Treatment with BBR adjusted the /M1 ratio. In addition, BBR exerted effects on adaptive immunity by suppressing numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as expression levels of their associated cytokines and transcriptional factors. BBR downregulated STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation, and inhibited phosphorylation of NF-kB. In vitro experiments showed that BBR inhibited the differentiation of Th17 and, to a lesser degree, Th1 cells, without affecting regulatory T cells. Therefore, we conclude that BBR plays a regulatory role in modulating the balance of immune responses in TNBS-induced colitis.

The aim was to evaluate whether VAT, beyond body mass index (BMI), is associated with CD behavior, disease activity, quality of life (QoL), or outcomes.Body composition data and clinical, anthropometric, disease activity (fecal calprotectin [FC]), and QoL scores were gathered prospectively on adults with CD at 0, 12, and 24 months. BMI and, VAT metrics (visceral adipose tissue volume [cm3]/height [] index and VAT:subcutaneous adipose tissue [SAT] ratio) were calculated. Inflammatory bowel disease-related surgery and hospitalization were recorded over extended follow-up (median, 51 months). Multivariable linear mixed effects and logistic regression analyses were performed.Ninety-seven participants were assessed at baseline (55% male; median age, 31 years), 84 at 12 months, and 72 at 24 months. VAT:SAT was positively associated with stricturing disease behavior (log odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 3; P = 0.01) and elevated FC in patients with ileocolonic disease (β, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.32 to 2.3; P = 0.01). VAT:SAT was associated with lower QoL, particularly in those with ileal disease (β, -12; 95% CI, -19 to -4.5; P = 0.05). However, no prospective associations were observed between serial VAT measurements and time to surgery or hospitalization. No correlations were found between BMI and disease behavior, activity, or QoL.VAT:SAT, rather than BMI, is associated with stricturing CD behavior, elevated FC, and reduced QoL in a disease distribution-dependent manner.

However, there have been no reports on the kinetics of AIM in  and the impact of AIM on the pathogenesis of . In this study, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic utility of levels of AIM and their correlation with the activity of Crohn's disease (CD) and .We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine AIM serum levels in 16 healthy subjects and 90 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, namely 39 with CD and 51 with ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as 17 patients with Behcet's disease (BD) as intestinal disease controls. We compared serum AIM levels among groups and examined whether there were correlations between serum AIM levels and disease activity and type. We also performed immunohistochemical staining of AIM in intestinal tissues of patients with CD.Serum AIM levels were significantly higher in patients with CD than in patients with UC, BD, and controls (3.27 ± 2.14, 1.88 ± 1.43, 2.34 ± 1.37, and 2.13 ± 0.64 μg/ml, respectively; P < 0.01). There was no difference in serum AIM levels before and after treatment in patients with CD. However, in these patients the diagnostic rate using AIM was better than that based on anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. AIM was expressed in macrophages that were positive for CD14, CD16, or both in the intestinal tissues of patients with CD.AIM is a novel biomarker of CD that can distinguish CD from UC or BD.

Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of  remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α in mouse models of . Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-α. Colitis severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80/iNOS cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas  macrophages (F4/80/CD206 cells) were increased.

We uploaded a protocol to PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018089424). Database and manual searches yielded 1823 unique records. Of these, 395 full-texts were screened for eligibility.

Pan-hydroxylase inhibition is protective in experimental colitis, in which PHD1 plays a prominent role. However, it is currently unknown how PHD1 targeting regulates this protection and which cell type(s) are involved. Here, we demonstrated that Phd1 deletion in endothelial and haematopoietic cells (Phd1 Tie2:cre) protected mice from dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, with reduced epithelial erosions, immune cell infiltration, and colonic microvascular dysfunction, whereas the response of Phd2 Tie2:cre and Phd3 Tie2:cre mice to DSS was similar to that of their littermate controls. Using bone marrow chimeras and cell-specific cre mice, we demonstrated that ablation of Phd1 in haematopoietic cells but not in endothelial cells was both necessary and sufficient to inhibit experimental colitis. This effect relied, at least in part, on skewing of Phd1-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory  phenotype. These cells showed an attenuated nuclear factor-κB-dependent response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which in turn diminished endothelial chemokine expression. In addition, Phd1 deficiency in dendritic cells significantly reduced interleukin-1β production in response to LPS.

Moreover, IL-33 restored goblet cell numbers and induced macrophage switching from the M1 to the  phenotype. These effects were sufficient to ameliorate colitis in dextran sodium sulfate, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, and peritoneal cavity cell transfer models. IL-33 facilitated goblet cell restoration via modulating macrophages toward the  phenotype. In addition, wound healing was significantly faster in IL-33-treated human monocyte-derived macrophages than in control cells, which could be attributed to increased polarisation into  macrophages. We found that patients with  show decreased serum levels of IL-33 compared with healthy individuals and that IL-33 can attenuate colitis and aid tissue repair in mice.

In this study, we demonstrated that reduction in inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis ameliorates experimental acute colitis. A soluble and stable angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) variant, COMP-Ang1, possesses anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. We investigated the effects of COMP-Ang1 on an experimental colonic inflammation model. Experimental colitis was induced in mice by administering 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) via drinking water. We determined body weight, disease activity indices, histopathological scores, lymphatic density, anti-ER-HR3 staining, and the expression of members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and various inflammatory cytokines in the mice. The density of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) and VEGFR-3-positive lymphatic vessels increased in mice with DSS-induced colitis. We observed that COMP-Ang1-treated mice showed less weight loss, fewer clinical signs of colitis, and longer colons than Ade-DSS-treated mice. COMP-Ang1 also significantly reduced the density of LYVE-1-positive lymphatic vessels and the disruption of colonic architecture that is normally associated with colitis and repressed the immunoregulatory response. Further, COMP-Ang1 treatment reduced both M1 and  macrophage infiltration into the inflamed colon, which involved inhibition of VEGF-C and D expression. Thus, COMP-Ang1, which acts by reducing inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis, may be used as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of  and other inflammatory diseases.COMP-Ang1 decreases inflammatory-induced lymphangiogenesis in experimental acute colitis. COMP-Ang1 improves the symptom of DSS-induced inflammatory response. COMP-Ang1 reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inflamed colon.

The 452 patients incurred 1633 dermatology clinic visits, 278 dermatologic procedures, and 1108 dermatology telephone encounters. The most frequent indication was contact dermatitis or dermatitis. Factors associated with dermatology use were family history of skin cancer, employment, systemic steroids, longer disease duration, emergency room use, and the number of -related clinic visits. Between 8.3 and 11% of  patients recommended for skin cancer screening visited dermatology each year, and the resulting incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer was 35.4/10,000 [95% CI 23.3-51.5] and melanoma was 6.56/10,000 [95% CI 2.1-15.3].Less than one in ten  patients obtain dermatologic care.

We examined whether administering extracts of MSCs (MSC-Ex) instead of MSCs could augment the beneficial effects of MSC therapy by overcoming the low homing efficiency of MSCs systemically administered in inflammatory bowel diseases (). Dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model was established in C57BL/6 mice, and MSC-Ex was administered intraperitoneally. MSC-Ex reduced colitis, disease activity index (DAI), and histological colitis scores, and increased the body weight. Treatment with MSC-Ex completely blocked the induction of inflammatory cytokines, which were strongly detected in mice with colitis. MSC-Ex shifted the macrophage functional phenotype from M1 to  by decreasing the levels of MCP1, CXCL9, and iNOS, but increasing the levels of IL-10, LIGHT, CCL1, and Arg-1. MSC-Ex recovered the destruction of the epithelial barrier in the differentiated Caco-2 cells in vitro. Treatment with MSC-Ex was more potent than that with MSC in reducing DAI, the histological score, and nitrite levels.

Thus, regulation of inflammation is regarded as the ultimate therapy for intestinal disease. Substance-P (SP) is known to mediate proliferation, migration, and cellular senescence in a variety of cells. SP was found to mobilize stem cells from bone marrow to the site of injury and to suppress inflammatory responses by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and  macrophages. In this study, we explored the effects of SP in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced intestine damage model. The effects of SP were evaluated by analyzing crypt structures, proliferating cells within the colon, cytokine secretion profiles, and immune cells population in the spleen/mesenteric lymph nodes in vivo. DSS treatment provoked an inflammatory response with loss of crypts in the intestines of experimental mice. This response was associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-17, and low levels of Tregs and  macrophages, leading to severely damaged tissue structure. However, SP treatment inhibited inflammatory responses by modulating cytokine production as well as the balance of Tregs/Th 17 cells and the M1/ transition in lymphoid organs, leading to accelerated tissue repair. Collectively, our data indicate that SP can promote the regeneration of tissue following damage by DSS treatment, possibly by modulating immune response. Our results propose SP as a candidate therapeutic for intestine-related inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, we evaluated whether new therapeutic probiotics have anti-colitic effects, and we investigated their mechanisms related to NF-κB and ER-stress pathways.Luciferase, nitric oxide, and cytokine assays using HT-29 or RAW264.7 cells were conducted. Mouse colitis was induced using dextran sulfate sodium and confirmed by disease activity index and histology. Macrophages and T-cell subsets in isolated peritoneal cavity cells and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Gene and cytokine expression profiles were determined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA1) and Pediococcus pentosaceus inhibited nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 cells, but only LA1 inhibited Tnfa and induced Il10 expression. LA1 increased the lifespan of dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice and attenuated the severity of colitis by inducing  macrophages in peritoneal cavity cells and Th2 and Treg cells in splenocytes. The restoration of goblet cells in the colon was accompanied by the induction of Il10 expression and the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we found that LA1 exerts an anti-colitic effect by improving ER stress in HT-29 cells as well as in vivo.We showed that LA1 significantly interferes with ER stress and suppresses NF-κB activation.

Here, we update the current status of  biomarkers, including serological, fecal, and genetic (DNA and microRNA [miRNA]) biomarkers. As an update, the classical serological biomarkers, including ASCA, pANCA, anti-OmpC, anti-Cbir, anti-I2, and other anti-glycan antibodies, are discussed only briefly. Emphasis in this article is given to those that have been recently identified or extensively characterized, as well as to the clinical utilities of biomarkers, with special attention to prediction of disease complication and activity assessment, mucosal healing, and response to therapies. In particular, we discuss the utilities of blood-based biomarkers predicting therapeutic response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, such as anti-anti-TNFα antibodies or anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and trough level of anti-TNFα. Fecal biomarkers, which have recently attracted substantial attention, are also discussed extensively, including the well-characterized calprotectin and lactoferrin, as well as the recently characterized -PK, CHI3L1, neopterin, MMP-9, and HMGB1.

Associations were tested by Cox regression.Overweight subjects (25≤BMI<30 kg/) had the lowest risk of CD, whereas obesity (BMI≥30kg/) increased the risk of CD at all ages, and low BMI (BMI<18.5kg/) associated with CD diagnosed at age 18-<40 years. Hence, using normal weight subjects as the reference, adjusted HRs for risk of developing CD (at age 18-<40 years) were 1.8(95%CI, 0.9-3.7) for underweight, 0.6(0.3-1.2) for overweight, and 1.5(0.8-2.7) for obese individuals (pre-pregnancy BMI). HRs were greater for BMI determined 18 months after delivery. Splines for CD risk according to waist:height ratio confirmed a U-shaped relationship with CD occurring <40 years, and a linear relationship with CD diagnosed at age 40+. There was no relationship between BMI and risk of UC.For the first time, we demonstrate that both high BMI and low BMI are risk factors for CD.

Nutrition risk was confirmed by the  dietitian (RD) and gastroenterologist (GI). Agreement between screening tools and RD/GI assessment was computed using Cohen's kappa.Of the 110 patients screened, 75 (68.2%) patients had Crohn's Disease and 35 (31.8%) ulcerative colitis. Mean BMI was 26.4 kg/ (SD=5.8). RD/GI assessment identified 23 patients (20.9%) at nutrition risk. The SaskIBD-NR tool classified 21 (19.1%) at some nutrition risk, while MUST classified 17 (15.5%). The SaskIBD-NR tool had significant agreement with the RD/GI assessment (k 0.83, p<0.001), while MUST showed a lack of agreement (k 0.15, p=0.12).

The Wnt signaling pathway mediates mucosal repair and  macrophages that coordinate efficient healing have been related to Wnt ligand expression. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) mediates  polarization in vitro and we hypothesize that a STAT6-dependent macrophage phenotype mediates mucosal repair in acute murine colitis by activating the Wnt signaling pathway. Our results reveal an impaired mucosal expression of  macrophage-associated genes and delayed wound healing in STAT6(-/-) mice treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). These mice also exhibited decreased mucosal expression of Wnt2b, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a, diminished protein levels of nuclear β-catenin that is mainly located in crypts adjacent to damage, and reduced mRNA expression of two Wnt/β-catenin target molecules Lgr5 and c-Myc when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Murine peritoneal macrophages treated with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and polarized toward an M2a phenotype overexpressed Wnt2b, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a in a STAT6-dependent manner. Administration of a Wnt agonist as well as transfer of properly polarized M2a macrophages to STAT6(-/-) mice activated the Wnt signaling pathway in the damaged mucosa and accelerated wound healing.

Depending on stimulation, macrophages rapidly polarize to functionally distinct phenotypes that are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (). 1,25‑Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) has immunomodulatory activity, and 1,25(OH)D deficiency is correlated with autoimmune diseases, especially . This study aimed to explore whether 1,25(OH)D modulates macrophage polarization in inflammation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and colitis mice were treated with 1,25(OH)D. Macrophages were transfected with siRNA-vitamin D receptor (VDR) or miR-125b mimic or inhibitor, and 1,25(OH)D-pretreated colitis mice were injected with a miR-125b agomir. The distribution of macrophage subsets and macrophage subtype characteristics was analyzed. As expected, 1,25(OH)D transformed lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 macrophages to the  subset, downregulated tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-6 expression and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) phosphorylation, and upregulated IL-10, arginase-1, VDR, and IRF4 expression. SiRNA-VDR and miR-125b mimic significantly impaired 1,25(OH)D activity. In colitis mice, 1,25(OH)D pretreatment ameliorated disease activity, converted M1 macrophages to the  subtype, suppressed IRF5 phosphorylation, and increased IRF4 expression in lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC). miR-125b agomir injections reversed 1,25(OH)D action. Collectively, the results demonstrate that 1,25(OH)D downregulates miR-125b expression and promotes M1 macrophage polarization to the  subtype. 1,25(OH)D pretreatment ameliorated colitis by restoring the LPMC macrophage subtype balance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We have reported that both SLC7A2 expression and L-Arg availability are decreased in colonic tissues from inflammatory bowel disease patients and that mice lacking Slc7a2 exhibit a more severe disease course when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Here, we present evidence that SLC7A2 plays a role in modulating colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). SLC7A2 was localized predominantly to colonic epithelial cells in WT mice. Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, Slc7a2 mice had significantly increased tumor number, burden, and risk of high-grade dysplasia vs. WT mice. Tumors from Slc7a2 mice exhibited significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-1β, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-3, CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but decreased levels of IL-4, CXCL9, and CXCL10 compared to tumors from WT mice. This was accompanied by a shift toward pro-tumorigenic  macrophage activation in Slc7a2-deficient mice, as marked by increased colonic CD11bF4/80ARG1 cells with no alteration in CD11bF4/80NOS2 cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. The shift toward  macrophage activation was confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from Slc7a2 mice. In bone marrow chimeras between Slc7a2 and WT mice, the recipient genotype drove the CAC phenotype, suggesting the importance of epithelial SLC7A2 in abrogating neoplastic risk. These data reveal that SLC7A2 has a significant role in the protection from CAC in the setting of chronic colitis, and suggest that the decreased SLC7A2 in inflammatory bowel disease () may contribute to CAC risk.

Studies have suggested that ketanserin exerts anti-inflammatory effects independent of the baroreflex; however, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of ketanserin in colitis and the possible underlying mechanisms. The expression of 5-HT2AR was assessed in the colon tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease () and in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The therapeutic potential of ketanserin was investigated in the mice with colitis. In the colon tissue samples from the patients with , a high expression level of 5-HT2AR was observed. Treatment with ketanserin attenuated the progression of experimental colitis in the mice, as indicated by body weight assessment, colon length, histological scores and cytokine release. The colonic macrophages from the ketanserin-treated mice with colitis exhibited a decreased production of inflammatory cytokines, with  polarization and impaired migration. The knockdown of 5-HT2AR using siRNA partly abolished the inhibitory effects of ketanserin on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow derived-macrophages (BMDMs), thus demonstrating that the inhibitory effects of ketanserin on the production of inflammatory cytokines are partly dependent on 5-HT2AR. Ketanserin also inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in BMDMs. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrate that ketanserin alleviates colitis.

We focused here on the effects of guggulsterone on macrophage modulation in colitis as a potential therapeutic molecule in human  and explore the underlying mechanisms. Gene expression in macrophages was examined and wound-healing assay using HT-29 cells was performed. Colitis in wild-type and IL-10-, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-, and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-deficient mice was induced via the administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) into the colon. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, guggulsterone suppressed intestinal inflammation amplified by TREM-1 stimulation, in which the suppression of NF-κB, activating protein-1, and proteasome pathways was involved. In the TNBS-induced colitis model, guggulsterone reduced disease activity index scores and TREM-1 expression, stimulated IL-10 production, and improved survival in wild-type mice. These effects were not observed in IL-10-, TLR4-, and MyD88-deficient mice. Guggulsterone also suppressed M1 polarization, yet induced the  phenotype in macrophages from  patients as well as from mice. These findings indicate that guggulsterone blocks the hyperactivation of macrophages via TREM-1 suppression and induces  polarization via IL-10 mediated by the TLR4 signaling pathway. Furthermore, this study provides a new rationale for the therapeutic potential of guggulsterone in the treatment of . NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that guggulsterone attenuates triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1)-mediated hyperactivation of macrophages and polarizes macrophages toward the  phenotype. This was mediated by IL-10 and partly Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways. Overall, these data support that guggulsterone as a natural plant sterol modulates macrophage phenotypes in colitis, which may be of novel therapeutic importance in inflammatory bowel disease treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29441068>Control of Intestinal Inflammation, Colitis-Associated Tumorigenesis, and Macrophage Polarization by Fibrinogen-Like Protein 2.</a></h2><p>Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is critical for immune regulation in the inflammatory state. Elevated Fgl2 levels are observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (), but little is known about its functional significance. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of Fgl2 in the development of intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Here, we report that Fgl2 deficiency increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and CAC in a mouse model. During colitis development, the expression of the membrane-bound and secreted forms of Fgl2 (mFgl2 and sFgl2, respectively) in the colon were increased and predominantly expressed by colonic macrophages. In addition, using bone marrow chimeric mice, we determined that Fgl2 function in colitis is strictly related to its expression in the hematopoietic cells. Loss of Fgl2 induced the polarization of M1, but suppressed that of  both  and , independent of intestinal inflammation. Thus, Fgl2 suppresses intestinal inflammation and CAC development through its role in macrophage polarization and may serve as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases, including .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26856241>Sorting nexin 10 acting as a novel regulator of macrophage polarization mediates inflammatory response in experimental mouse colitis.</a></h2><p>In response to changes in microenvironment, macrophages polarize into functionally distinct phenotypes, playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (). Here, we investigated the effects of sorting nexin 10 (SNX10), a protein involved in endosomal trafficking and osteoclast maturation, on regulation of macrophage polarization and progression of mouse colitis. Our results revealed that SNX10 deficiency increased the population of -type monocytes/macrophages, and protected against colonic inflammation and pathological damage induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). By in vitro study, we showed that deficiency of SNX10 polarized macrophages derived from mouse bone marrow or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) towards an anti-inflammatory  phenotype, which partially reversed by SNX10 plasmid transfection. Adoptive transfer of SNX10(-/-) macrophages ameliorated colitis in WT mice. However, transfer of WT macrophages exacerbated colitis in SNX10(-/-) mice. Our data disclose a crucial role and novel function for SNX10 in macrophage polarization.

In the United States, it is currently estimated that about 1.5 million people suffer from , causing considerable suffering, mortality and economic loss every year. Yet the cause of  is unknown, and until we understand more, prevention or cure will not be possible. There is a lot of variation in the incidence and prevalence of CD based on geographic region, environment, immigrant population, and ethnic groups. The annual incidence of CD in North America is reported to be 3.1-20.2 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 201 per 100,000 population. Based on the epidemiological, genetic and immunological data, CD is considered to be a heterogeneous disorder with multifactorial etiology in which genetics and environment interact to manifest the disease. Several genes have been studied so for with respect to CD, but thus far the strong and replicated associations have been identified with NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1 genes. The risk factors implicated with CD include smoking, low fiber- high carbohydrate diet, altered microbiome and medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CD is typically characterized by transmural inflammation of the intestine and could affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to perianal area. In terms of distribution of the disease 25% of the patients have colitis only, 25% is ileitis only and 50% have ileocolitis. The Montreal classification is based on the age at diagnosis (<16, 17-40, > 40), disease location (Ileal, colonic, Ileocolonic) and the disease behavior (nonstricturing/nonpenetrating, stricturing, penetrating). The key features for diagnosing CD comprises a combination of radiographic, endoscopic and pathological findings demonstrating focal, asymmetric, transmural or granulomatous features. Abdominal Computed tomography (CT) enterography is the most preferred first-line radiologic study used in the assessment of small bowel CD. The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis is similar to that of CT scans and also prevents exposure to ionizing radiation. Endoscopic scores are considered to be the gold standard tool to measure the activity of CD and they are used more commonly in the clinical trials to measure the efficacy of various drugs on inducing and maintaining mucosal healing. The most common scoring systems used to measure clinical disease activity include Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), HBI- Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and Lehmann score. Management of Crohn's disease has been seen as an evolving challenge owing to its widely heterogeneous manifestations, overlapping characteristics with other inflammatory disorders, often elusive extraintestinal manifestations and uncertain etiology. Therapeutic interventions are tailored to address symptomatic response and subsequent tolerance of the intervention. Chronology of treatment should favor treatment dose acute disease or "induction therapy", followed by maintenance of adequate response or remission, i.e. "maintenance therapy". The medications which are highly effective in inducing remission include steroids and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors. Medications used to maintain remission include 5-aminosalicyclic acid products, immunomodulators (Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) and TNF inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab and golimumab). Surgical interventions like bowel resection, stricturoplasty or drainage of abscess is required in up to two thirds of CD patients during their lifetime. The most common indications for surgical resection are medically refractory disease, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess not amenable to percutaneous drainage, intractable hemorrhage, dysplasia or cancer. Endoscopic recurrence in postoperative CD patients, as defined by Rutgeers score i2-i4 occur in 30-90% of the patients at the neoterminal ileum within 12 months of surgery and almost universally by 5 years. Treating CD requires a comprehensive care team including the patient, primary care provider, and gastroenterologist. In summary CD is a chronic inflammatory condition with a remitting and relapsing course primarily affecting relatively younger population with significant socioeconomic effects.Copyright © 2018 Mosby, Inc.

The present study investigated the potential role of autophagy in stress-related  in patients and animal model. The correlation between psychosocial stress and intestinal autophagy was determined in 23 patients with . Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a well-established inducer of psychosocial stress, was administrated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In  patients, the autophagy markers beclin-1, LC3-II/I ratio, Atg16L1, and Atg4B were significantly enhanced. The psychosocial stress score was positively associated with the levels of beclin-1 and the LC3II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens. In  mouse model, CRH significantly aggravated intestinal inflammation, increased Paneth cell metaplasia, and enhanced intestinal autophagy (beclin-1, Atg16L1, PIK3R4, and Atg4B upregulation; GAA, CTSD, and PPKAA1 downregulation). Additionally, the CRH-induced gut microbial dysbiosis was evidenced by a marked increase in the number of detrimental bacteria. In LPS-stimulated BMDM, CRH substantially increased M1/ polarization and thus promoted inflammation. In both  mice and LPS-treated BMDM, blockade of autophagy by chloroquine abrogated the unbeneficial effects of CRH, whereas autophagy inducer rapamycin resulted in a pronounced protective effect against  lesion. Our data demonstrate that psychosocial stress may link the enhanced intestinal autophagy by modulating gut microbiota and inflammation to aggravate . These data indicate autophagy as a promising therapeutic target for psychosocial stress-related .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26384117>Fecal pyruvate kinase is not suitable for discrimination between inflammatory bowel disease exacerbation and acute gastroenteritis.</a></h2><p>In inflammatory bowel diseases () diarrhea can be caused by exacerbation and/or infectious agents.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of TissuCol (fibrin glue), Histoacryl Flex (n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate), and Duraseal (polyethylene glycol) on colorectal anastomotic healing during experimental colitis.We first performed colectomy 7 days after 10 mg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis to validate a rat TNBS-colitis-colectomy model. Subsequently, this TNBS-colitis-colectomy model was used in 73 Wistar rats that were stratified into a colitis group (CG, no adhesive), a TissuCol group (TG), a Histoacryl group (HG), and a Duraseal group (DG). Anastomotic sealant was applied with one adhesive after constructing an end-to-end hand-sewn anastomosis. Clinical manifestations, anastomotic bursting pressure, and immunohistochemistry of macrophage type-one (M1) and type-two () was performed on postoperative day (POD)3 or POD7.TNBS-caused mucosal and submucosal colon damage and compromised anastomotic healing (i.e., abscess formation and low anastomotic bursting pressure). On POD3, higher severity of abscesses was seen in CG. Average anastomotic bursting pressure was 53.2 ± 35.5 mm Hg in CG, which was significantly lower than HG (134.4 ± 27.5 mm Hg) and DG (95.1 ± 54.3 mm Hg) but not TG (83.4 ± 46.7 mm Hg). Furthermore, a significantly higher /M1 index was found in HG. On POD7, abscesses were only seen in CG (6/9) but not in other groups; HG had the lowest severity of adhesion.We describe the first surgical  model by performing colectomy in rats with TNBS-induced colitis, which causes intra-abdominal abscess formation and compromises anastomotic healing. Anastomotic sealing with Histoacryl Flex prevents these complications in this model.

Endoscopy is the usual method employed to diagnose these condition. Another noninvasive way to assess and diagnose GI conditions are fecal biomarkers. Fecal biomarkers provide information regarding a specific disease process and are perhaps more acceptable to clinicians and patients alike because of their non-invasivity compared to endoscopy. Aim of this review was to evaluate the current status of the fecal biomarkers in clinical and research for in GI diseases. Multiple types of fecal biomarkers are discussed in this review including; markers to assess , which are released as a results of an inflammatory insults to intestinal epithelia such as antimicrobial peptides (lactoferrin) or inflammation related proteins (calprotectin). While markers related to function of digestion are primarily related to partially digested food or mucosal proteins such as abnormal amount of fecal fat α1-antitrypsin, elastase and secretary IgA.

So far, the prevalence of NAFLD in underweight individuals with and without inflammatory bowel disease () is insufficiently enlightened. In this cross-sectional age, gender and disease-matched case-control study, underweight patients (BMI<18.5 kg/) with inflammatory bowel disease (), who underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5 T/3 T with fat-saturated fast-spin-echo imaging from 10/2005-07/2018 were analysed (control-to-case-ratio 1:1, n = 130). All patients were additionally investigated for duration, history of surgery, medical treatment, laboratory values, liver and spleen diameters. On MRI, liver fat was quantified by two observers based on the relative signal loss on T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images with fat saturation compared to images without fat saturation. The prevalence of NAFLD/liver steatosis, defined as a measured intrahepatic fat content of at least 5%, was significantly higher in underweight  patients than in normal weight patients (87.6% versus 21.5%, p<0.001). Compared to the cases, the liver fat content of the controls was reduced by -0.19 units on average (-19%; 95%Cl: -0.20; -0.14). Similar results were obtained for the subgroup of non- individuals (n = 12; -0.25 units on average (-25%); 95%Cl: -0.35; -0.14). Patients with extremely low body weight (BMI <17.5 kg/) showed the highest liver fat content (+0.15 units on average (+15%) compared to underweight patients with a BMI of 17.5-18.5 kg/ (p<0.05)). Furthermore, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters. There were no indications of significant differences in disease duration, type of medications or surgery between cases and controls and also, there were no significant differences between observers or field strengths (p>0.05).

We hypothesized that anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) alpha therapy may improve dietary intake and have a beneficial influence on body composition in these patients.Our study involved 40  outpatients (33 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative colitis); 24 of these received adalimumab (160/80/40EOW) and 16 were treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, 6, and subsequently every 8 weeks). Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis, while dietary intake was recorded prior to initiating biologicals and 3 months afterwards. Body composition indexes: fat-free mass index [FFMI], body fat mass index [BFMI]) were calculated in kg/.Baseline BMI (kg/) and muscle parameters increased significantly at the end of the observational period (BMI: 23.81+/-7.19 vs. 24.52+/-7.34, p<0.001; FFMI: 17.64+/-3.00 vs. 18.14+/-3.08, p<0.001; at week 0 vs. 12, respectively). However, no significant changes were detected in the fat parameters (BFMI: 6.21+/-5.20 vs. 6.44+/-5.27, respectively). We found no significant difference between the effects of adalimumab vs. infliximab on body composition (deltaFFMI: 0.55+/-0.82 vs. 0.43+/-0.69; deltaBFMI: 0.23+/-0.85 vs. 0.21+/-1.01, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the extent of changes in parameters whether the patients were on corticosteroids (n=15) or not (n=25) at week 0 (deltaFFMI: 0.44+/-0.84 vs 0.59+/-0.72; deltaBFMI: 0.36+/-1.12 vs. 0.09+/-0.71, respectively).Our findings suggest that muscle parameters improved during the anti-TNF induction therapy, while fat parameters did not change significantly.

Therefore, alleviation of inflammation is very important to treat . Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been highlighted as new candidates for treating autoimmune disease based on their immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism and therapeutic effects of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) using THP-1 macrophages and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mice with chronic colitis. LPS-treated THP-1 cells expressed mRNA of CD11b, an M1 macrophage marker, at day 2. However, THP-1 co-cultured with ASCs expressed mRNA of CD206, CD68, CCL18, legumain, and IL-10, markers of  macrophages. In THP-1 cells co-cultured with ASCs, precursor (pro)-IL-1β, Cox-2, and NLRP3 increased dramatically compared to LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 was significantly inhibited by ASCs, but PGE2 production was highly increased in co-culture conditions of THP-1 and ASCs. IL-18 secretion was inhibited by PGE2 treatment, and PGE2 inhibited inflammasome complex (ASC/Cas-1/NLRP3) formation in THP-1 cells. In the DSS-induced chronic colitis model, ASCs ameliorated colitis by decreasing the total number of macrophages and the M1 macrophage population.

However, these issues are rarely addressed in routine care. A model of integrated psychological screening and intervention was trialled to measure prevalence, patient participation, and potential benefits to mental health and/or quality of life.During a 12-month period, 490 adult patients at an established hospital-based service were approached to complete screening instruments for anxiety, depression, general distress, quality of life and medication adherence. Disease-specific and demographic data were also collected. Patients who scored highly on screening questionnaires were offered psychological intervention (in-service or externally referred). Participants were reassessed after 12 months.Psychological screening was well accepted with 68% (N = 335) participating. Psychological care was 'needed', with 55% (N = 183) scoring highly for anxiety, depression and/or general distress. Half of those 'in need' (N = 91) accepted intervention. In those who accepted, levels of anxiety (mean at intake [M1] = 12.11 vs mean at follow-up [] = 9.59, p < 0.001), depression (M1 = 8.38 vs  = 6.42, p < 0.001), general distress (M1 = 17.99 vs  = 13.96, p < 0.001), mental health quality of life (M1 = 54.64 vs  = 59.70, p < 0.001) and overall quality of life (M1 = 57.60 vs  = 64.10, p < 0.001) each improved between intake and follow-up.

Given the antioxidant properties of P28GST, we evaluated its anti-inflammatory potential when administered locally after colitis induction in the absence of adjuvant.Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by rectal administration of TNBS, followed by two intraperitoneal injections of P28GST at day 1 and day 2. Mice were sacrificed 48h after TNBS administration and evaluated for macroscopic and histological scores, myeloperoxidase (MPO) quantification and cytokine messenger RNA expression in the colonic tissues.Both clinical and histological scores significantly decreased in mice treated with P28GST at 5 or 50μg/kg when compared to vehicle- treated mice. A significant reduction of MPO was detected in colonic tissues from P28GST-treated mice, similarly to mice treated with methylprednisolone as the reference treatment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6, mRNA as well as serum levels were down-regulated in mice colonic tissues treated with P28GST at 5 or 50μg/kg. In addition, a significant decrease of mRNA expression levels of T-bet, and ROR-γ, respective markers of Th1 and Th17 cells was observed. Whereas no significant effect was detected on Gata3 mRNA, a marker of Th2 cells, the Arg/iNOS mRNA levels significantly increased in P28GST-treated mice, suggesting the induction of  macrophages.These findings provide evidence that P28GST injected locally after colitis induction induces a potent decrease of colitis inflammation in mice, associated to downregulation of Th1/Th17 response, and induction of anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30336540>Early Detection of Colorectal Cancer: a Multi-Center Pre-Clinical Case Cohort Study for Validation of a Combined DNA Stool Test.</a></h2><p>Although colonoscopy-based screening has proven to be highly effective in detecting colorectal cancer (CRC), participation rates remain disappointing. Development of CRC is associated with a number of genetic or somatic mutations. New, non-invasive stool tests are currently being developed based on the detection of these alterations. We investigated if a non-invasive stool assay can offer sufficient sensitivity and specificity to supplement colonoscopy-based screening.We compared a combined stool assay, which incorporates fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), quantification of human DNA (hDNA) as well as detection of genetic mutations of KRAS and BRAF (Combined DNA stool assay), with commercially available FOBT and -PK tests in a multi-centric six-armed pre-clinical case cohort study. Seven hundred thirty-four patients were recruited prior to elective/screening colonoscopy or prior to surgery in case of a recent CRC diagnosis. According to clinical assessment and colonoscopy/histology results, the following groups were assigned: controls, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (), hyperplastic polyps, adenomas, and CRC. Finally, 566 out of 734 patients (77.1%) were screened for CRC and overall gut status via colonoscopy, FOBT, -PK, with combined FOBT/-PK and the Combined DNA stool assay as described here.All sensitivities and specificities are measured against histologically confirmed results by colonoscopy. Confirmed sensitivities for detecting colorectal cancer were 68% with FOBT, 83% with -PK, 90% with combined FOBT and -PK, and 85% with the Combined DNA stool assay. Specificities were 96% with FOBT, 61% with -PK, 62% with combined FOBT and -PK, and 92% with the Combined DNA stool assay in the control group with no pathological findings during colonoscopy.The Combined DNA stool assay detects CRC with a significantly higher Youden Index than the other reviewed non-invasive screening options.

Baicalin, originally isolated from the root of the Chinese herb Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and its main active ingredient, has a protective effect against inflammatory responses in several diseases. The present study investigated the effects of baicalin on macrophage polarization and its therapeutic role in . Murine peritoneal macrophages and mice with colitis were treated with baicalin. Macrophage subset distribution, M1 and  macrophage-associated mRNA expression, and interferon regulatory factor 4 and 5 (IRF4 and IRF5) expression were analyzed. siRNA transfection into mouse peritoneal macrophages was utilized to suppress IRF4. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, western blot, and real-time PCR analyses were performed. Baicalin (50μM) limited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 macrophage polarization; decreased LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-23, and IRF5 expression; and increased IL-10, arginase-1 (Arg-1), and IRF4 expression. siRNA-mediated IRF4 silencing significantly impaired baicalin activity. Furthermore, pretreatment with baicalin (100mg/kg) in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis ameliorated the severity of colitis and significantly decreased the disease activity index (baicalin group, 3.33±0.52 vs. DSS group, 5.67±1.03). Baicalin (100mg/kg) also repressed IRF5 protein expression and promoted IRF4 protein expression in the lamina propria mononuclear cells, and induced macrophage polarization to the  phenotype. In summary, our results showed that baicalin upregulates IRF4 protein expression and reverses LPS-induced macrophage subset redistribution. Thus, baicalin alleviates DSS-induced colitis by modulating macrophage polarization to the  phenotype.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The levels of Th17- and Treg-associated cytokines were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The direct effect of H. pylori extract on the polarization status of macrophages was determined in vitro.Gastric H. pylori colonization significantly ameliorated the severity of chronic DSS-induced colitis. H. pylori colonization decreased Th17 cells and mRNA levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-21 in the colon. Simultaneously, H. pylori colonization increased Treg cells and IL-10 expression. As to cytokines driving Th17 and Treg differentiation, H. pylori colonization increased TGFβ and decreased IL-6 and IL-23. Moreover, H. pylori colonization significantly increased  macrophages in the colon. In vitro, H. pylori extract promotion of  macrophage polarization was dependent on the presence of CagA.H. pylori colonization protects against chronic DSS-induced colitis via balancing Th17/Treg responses and shifting macrophages toward anti-inflammatory  phenotype. Our results strengthen the rationale for gastric H. pylori colonization affecting the immune homeostasis of the colon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559912>Can a Conversation Between Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Macrophages Solve the Crisis in the Inflamed Intestine?</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a group of chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by an exacerbated mucosal immune response. Macrophages play pivotal roles in the maintenance of gut homeostasis but they are also implicated in the pathogenesis of . They are highly plastic cells and their activation state depends on the local environment. In the healthy intestine, resident macrophages display an  phenotype characterized by inflammatory energy, while inflammatory M1 macrophages dominate in the inflamed intestinal mucosa. In this regard, modifying the balance of macrophage populations into an  phenotype has emerged as a new therapeutic approach in . Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed as a promising cell-therapy for the treatment of , considering their immunomodulatory and tissue regenerative potential. Numerous preclinical studies have shown that MSCs can induce immunomodulatory macrophages and have demonstrated that their therapeutic efficacy in experimental colitis is mediated by macrophages with an -like phenotype. However, some issues have not been clarified yet, including the importance of MSC homing to the inflamed colon and/or lymphoid organs, their optimal route of administration or whether they are effective as living or dead cells. In contrast, the mechanisms behind the effect of MSCs in human  are not known and more data are needed regarding the effect of MSCs on macrophage polarization that would support the observation reported in the experimental models. Nevertheless, MSCs have emerged as a novel method to treat  that has already been proven safe and with clinical benefits that could be administered in combination with the currently used pharmacological treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274006>Chromogranin-A Regulates Macrophage Function and the Apoptotic Pathway in Murine DSS colitis.</a></h2><p>Chromogranin-A (CHGA) is elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (), but little is known about its role in colonic inflammation.  is associated with impaired functions of macrophages and increased apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. We investigated CHGA expression in human subjects with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and the underlying mechanisms in Chga  mice. In UC, CHGA, classically activated macrophage (M1) markers, caspase-3, p53, and its associated genes were increased, while alternatively activated macrophage () markers were decreased without changes in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. CHGA correlated positively with M1 and the apoptotic pathway and negatively with . In the murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, Chga deletion reduced the disease severity and onset, pro-inflammatory mediators, M1, and p53/caspase-3 activation, while it upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines and  markers with no changes in the extrinsic apoptotic markers. Compared to Chga  , M1 and p53/caspase-3 activation in Chga  macrophages were decreased in vitro, while  markers were increased. CHGA plays a critical role during colitis through the modulation of macrophage functions via the caspase-3/p53 pathway. Strategies targeting CHGA to regulate macrophage activation and apoptosis might be developed to treat UC patients.• Chromogranin-A (CHGA) is pro-hormone and is secreted in the gut. CHGA is elevated in colitis and is associated with the disease severity. The lack of GHGA has beneficial immunomodulatory properties during the development of intestinal inflammation. The lack of CHGA regulates the plasticity of macrophages and p53/caspase activation in colitis. Functional analysis of CHGA may lead to a novel therapy for .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27768566>Development and Application of a Plant-Based Diet Scoring System for Japanese Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Plant-based diets (PBDs) are a healthy alternative to westernized diets. A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs.To develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease ().PBD scores were assigned according to the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for  were scored positively, and 8 items considered to be  risk factors were scored negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores. Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established.Plant-Based Diet score.The PBD scores differed significantly, in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 ± 9.5 and 8.2 ± 8.2, respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (χ).The PBD score is a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30024891>Genistein induces macrophage polarization and systemic cytokine to ameliorate experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Mucosal changes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (), are characterized by a prominent infiltration of inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, macrophages, T cells and neutrophils. The precise etiology of  is unknown but it involves a complex interplay of factors associated with the immune system, environment, host genotype and enteric commensal bacteria. As there is no known safe cure for , natural alternative therapeutic options without side effects are urgently needed. To this end, Soy-based foods, which have been eaten for centuries in Asian countries, have potential benefits, including lowering the incidence of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, allergic response, and autoimmune diseases. This study describes the effect of Soy isoflavons 4', 5, 7 Trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced experimental colitis. The extent and severity of disease was analyzed through body weight, histopathological analysis, cellular immune response, systemic cytokine levels, and inflammation score using a disease activity index. Genistein treatment significantly attenuated DSS-induced colitis severity and resulted in increase in body weight, colon length and reduction in inflammation score. Genistein also skews M1 macrophages towards the  phenotype. Further, gen also reduced the systemic cytokine levels as compared to vehicle control. This serves as the first detailed study towards natural soya based product that shows the polarization of M1 towards  macrophages, and reduction of systemic cytokine in part to attenuate the colitis symptoms. Thus, our work demonstrates that genistein, a soya compound, may be useful for the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580446>Combination therapy of mesenchymal stromal cells and sulfasalazine attenuates trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced colitis in the rat: The S1P pathway.</a></h2><p>Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) transplantation is a novel immunomodulatory therapeutic tool to ameliorate the symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (). The objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of combined sufasalazine and ASCs therapy in a rat model of . After induction of colitis in rats, ASCs were cultured and intraperitoneally injected (3 × 10 cells/kg) into the rats on Days 1 and 5 after inducing colitis, in conjunction with daily oral administration of low dose of sulfasalazine (30 mg/kg). The regenerative effects of combination of ASCs and sulfasalazine on ulcerative colitis were assessed by measuring body weight, colonic weight/length ratio, disease activity index, macroscopic scores, histopathological examinations, cytokine, and inflammation markers profiles. In addition, western blot analysis was used to assess the levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and apoptosis related proteins in colitis tissues. Simultaneous treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine was associated with significant amelioration of disease activity index, macroscopic and microscopic colitis scores, as well as inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Moreover, combined ASCs and sulfasalazine therapy effectively inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway, reduced the expression of Bax and prevented the loss of Bcl-2 proteins in colon tissue of the rats with TNBS-induced colitis. Furthermore, combined treatment with ASCs and sulfasalazine shifted inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  macrophages by decreasing the levels of MCP1, CXCL9 and increasing IL-10, Arg-1 levels. In conclusion, combination of ASCs with conventional  therapy is potentially a much more powerful strategy to slow the progression of colitis via reducing inflammatory and apoptotic markers than either therapy alone.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29774026>Critical Role of Alternative  Skewing in miR-155 Deletion-Mediated Protection of Colitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is associated with dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune response in the intestine. MicroRNA (miR)-155 is frequently expressed and functions in many immune cell types. Besides its function in adaptive immunity, miR-155 is a key regulator of the innate immune response in macrophages, dendritic cells, and even in epithelia cells. Although the roles of miR-155 within T and B lymphocytes in colitis have been reported, its function in innate immune cells has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model was established in wild-type (WT) and miR-155 mice. Our results showed that miR-155 deficiency in macrophages recapitulated the alleviated colitis feature of miR-155 mice and appeared to skew toward the alterative  phenotype. Notably, the predominance of  in colon can result in dampened intestinal immune cell proliferation and inhibit CD4 T cell polarization toward Th1 and Th17. Moreover, C/EBPβ and SOCS1 were demonstrated as two key functional targets in this process. We also provided evidence for use of miR-155 inhibitor to treat colitis. Collectively, the findings highlight the central role of alternative  skewing for miR-155 function in colitis and reveal that macrophages might be a main target for therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26655877>The pentacyclic triterpene Lupeol switches M1 macrophages to  and ameliorates experimental inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a chronic inflammatory disease in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Mounting evidence suggests that the predominance of the classically activated (M1) macrophages versus the alternatively activated () macrophages plays a role in the progression of . Thus, agents able to shift pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory  macrophages may be beneficial to . The pentacyclic triterpene Lup-20(29)-en-3β-ol (Lupeol), a potent anti-inflammatory natural product, has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting it is potentially able to modulate macrophage polarization, thereby beneficial to .CD4(+) monocytes were differentiated to M1 or  macrophages, which were cocultured with epithelial cell lines, T84 and Caco-2, in the absence or presence of Lupeol (10μM). Experimental colitis was induced with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), with or without oral administration of Lupeol (50mg/kg, q.d.). Cytokines were measured with Luminex kits. M1/ genes were measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Macrophage phenotypes were defined by measuring M1 and  markers with confocal microscopy. Proteins were measured with Western blotting, while cell surface markers were measured with confocal microscopy or flow cytometry. Histology was evaluated with H&E staining.Treatment of M1 macrophages with Lupeol resulted in a marked decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12, IL6, IL-1β and TNFα, and a marked increase in the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This was associated with a down-regulation of CD86, a typical marker of M1 macrophages, and an up-regulation of CD206, a typical  macrophage marker. IRF5, a transcription factor that is critically involved in M1 polarization, was down-regulated in M1 macrophages after being incubated with Lupeol, associated with a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. Coculture of epithelial cells with M1 macrophages resulted in down-regulation of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and disruption of epithelial integrity, which were blocked by Lupeol treatment of the M1 macrophages. Moreover, oral administration of Lupeol to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice resulted in mitigated intestinal inflammation and increased survival from lethal colitis, associated with decreased expression of M1-related genes and increased expression of -related genes.Lupeol ameliorates experimental inflammatory bowel disease through, at least in part, inhibiting M1 and promoting  macrophages.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
