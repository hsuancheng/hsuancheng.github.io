<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6407476>A requirement for Ca2+ in the extraction of O2-evolving Photosystem 2 preparations from the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans.</a></h2><p>Ca2+ has been shown to be essential for the retention of maximal O2-evolving activity in Photosystem 2 particles extracted by using  from Anacystis nidulans thylakoids. The effect cannot entirely be mimicked by using Mg2+. Ca2+ stimulates electron transport from diphenylcarbazide to 2,6-dichloroindophenol catalysed by lead-inhibited cation-free preparations, showing the presence of two cation-binding sites in these particles. Photosystem 2 preparations extracted in Ca2+-containing buffer show the presence of three polypeptides at mol. wt. 30000, 33000 and 36000, which are absent or much decreased in preparations extracted in Mg2+-containing buffer. The calmodulin antagonist chlorpromazine inhibits activity of the Photosystem 2 preparation, suggesting the presence of a Ca2+-binding protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10744684>Substitution of betaGlu(201) in the alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplex of the F(1)-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 increases the affinity of catalytic sites for nucleotides.</a></h2><p>In the crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F(1)-ATPase (MF(1)) (Abrahams, J. P., Leslie, A. G. W., Lutter, R., and Walker, J. E. (1994) Nature 370, 621-628), the side chain oxygen of betaThr(163) interacts directly with Mg(2+) coordinated to 5'-adenylyl beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate or ADP bound to catalytic sites of beta subunits present in closed conformations. In the unliganded beta subunit present in an open conformation, the hydroxyl of betaThr(163) is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of betaGlu(199). Substitution of betaGlu(201) (equivalent to betaGlu(199) in MF(1)) in the alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplex of the F(1)-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 with cysteine or valine increases the propensity to entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during hydrolysis of 50 microM ATP. These substitutions lower K(m3) (the Michaelis constant for trisite ATP hydrolysis) relative to that of the wild type by 25- and 10-fold, respectively. Fluorescence quenching of alpha(3)(betaE201C/Y341W)(3)gamma and alpha(3)(betaY341W)(3)gamma mutant subcomplexes showed that MgATP and MgADP bind to the third catalytic site of the double mutant with 8.4- and 4.4-fold higher affinity, respectively, than to the single mutant. These comparisons support the hypothesis that the hydrogen bond observed between the side chains of betaThr(163) and betaGlu(199) in the unliganded catalytic site in the crystal structure of MF(1) stabilizes the open conformation of the catalytic site during ATP hydrolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19396991>A light-initiated, dark oxidation of bacteriochlorophyll from reaction center particles.</a></h2><p>When reaction center particles from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides strain R26 are illuminated and then extracted with methanol, about one-third of the extracted bacteriochlorophyll slowly becomes oxidized, The oxidation does not occur under anaerobic conditions or in the absence of the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide. Alkaline conditions also prevent the reaction. A dark interval between illumination and extraction delays the onset of bacteriochlorophyll oxidation in a predictable way. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that illumination generates a reaction initiator which is fairly stable in methanol but decays with a half-life of about 4.5 min in reaction center particles after illumination ceases.</p></html>
