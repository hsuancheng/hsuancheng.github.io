<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152822> in cancer cells - Repurposing of a starvation-induced metabolic pathway?</a></h1><p>Cancer cells constantly face a fluctuating nutrient supply and interference with adaptive responses might be an effective therapeutic approach. It has been discovered that in the absence of glucose, cancer cells can synthesize crucial metabolites by expressing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, PCK1 or PCK2) using abbreviated forms of . , which in essence is the reverse pathway of glycolysis, uses lactate or amino  to feed biosynthetic pathways branching from glycolysis. PCK1 and PCK2 have been shown to be critical for the growth of certain cancers. In contrast, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), a downstream  enzyme, inhibits glycolysis and tumor growth, partly by non-enzymatic mechanisms. This review sheds light on the current knowledge of cancer cell  and its role in metabolic reprogramming, cancer cell plasticity, and tumor growth.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Metabolism encompasses the synthesis and breakdown of glucose, fatty , and amino ; the generation of energy (ATP); and oxidative phosphorylation. In cancer cells, metabolism can be commandeered to promote tumor growth and cellular proliferation. These alterations in metabolism have emerged as an additional hallmark of various cancers. In this review we focus on metabolic alterations in multiple myeloma (MM) - a malignancy of plasma cells - including derangements in glycolysis, , the tricarboxylic  cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty /amino  synthesis and degradation. Particular focus is given to metabolic alterations that contribute to myeloma cell growth, proliferation and drug resistance. Finally, novel approaches that target metabolic pathways for the treatment of MM are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166615>Glucagon up-regulates hepatic mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 through cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; inhibition of hepatic  by ginsenoside Rb1.</a></h1><p>Hepatic mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) transports pyruvate into mitochondria. This study investigated the involvement of MPC1 in hepatic glucagon response, in order to identify a possible pharmacological intervention.The correlation between hepatic glucagon response and MPC1 induction was investigated in fasted mice and primary hepatocytes. The effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on MPC1 function were observed.Glucagon challenge raised blood glucose with hepatic MPC1 induction, and inhibition of MPC induction coincided with a reduced rise in blood glucose. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) knockdown blocked glucagon-induced MPC1 expression, while CREB overexpression increased MPC1 expression. Luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and promoter mutation confirmed that CREB increased MPC1 transcription through gene promoter induction. CREB regulated transcription co-activator 2 nuclear translocation was also required for CREB to promote MPC1 induction. Glucagon shifted mitochondrial pyruvate towards carboxylation for  via the opposite regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and carboxylase with respect to MPC1 induction. MPC1 induction was necessary for glucagon to promote pyruvate-driven hepatic glucose production (HGP), but glucagon failed to influence HGP from other gluconeogenic substrates routed into the tricarboxylic  cycle, independent of MPC. Rb1 blocked cAMP signalling by inhibiting AC activity and deactivated CREB by dephosphorylation, possibly contributing to inhibiting MPC1 induction to reduce HGP.CREB transcriptionally up-regulates MPC1 to provide pyruvate for . Rb1 reduced cAMP formation which consequently reduced CREB-mediated MPC1 induction and thereby might contribute to limiting pyruvate-dependent HGP. These results suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce hyperglycaemia in diabetes.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629173>Environmental risk assessment of triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea and their toxicity to phytoplankton at environmental concentrations.</a></h1><p>Herbicides have been increasingly used worldwide and a large amount of herbicide residue eventually enters the ocean via groundwater or surface run-off every year. However, the global coastal pollution status of herbicides and their negative impact on marine life (especially phytoplankton) in natural environmental concentrations are poorly understood except for few special environments (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Our field investigation of the distribution of ten triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea of China revealed that the concentrations of triazine herbicides exceeded the "No Observed Effect Concentrations" for phytoplankton. Their total concentrations could be as high as 6.61 nmol L. Based on the concentration addition model, the toxicity of herbicide homologues is usually cumulative, and the combined toxicity of these ten triazine herbicides could cause 13.2% inhibition on the chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of a representative diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1, which corresponds roughly to the toxicity of atrazine in an equivalent concentration of 14.08 nmol L. Atrazine in this equivalent-effect concentration could greatly inhibit the growth of cells, the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and nutrient absorption of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1. Transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple metabolic pathways (Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, glycolysis/, etc.) related with photosynthesis and carbon metabolism were greatly disturbed, which might ultimately influence the primary productivity of coastal waters. Moreover, with the values of its bioaccumulation factor ranging from 69.6 to 118.9, atrazine was found to be accumulated in algal cells, which indicates that herbicide pollution might eventually affect the marine food web and even threaten the seafood safety of human beings.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of RYGB on glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and liver morphological adaption, as well as the changes in bile  signaling and expression of its target regulatory factors involved in , lipogenesis, and fatty  β oxidation.Twenty adult male T2DM rats induced by high-fat diet and a low dose of streptozotocin were randomly divided into sham and RYGB groups. The parameters of body weight, food intake, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, serum lipid profiles, and bile  level were assessed to evaluate metabolic changes. Liver sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and oil red O to assess lipid accumulation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), key regulatory factors of , lipogenesis, and fatty  β oxidation (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α)) were determined through RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.RYGB induced significant improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, along with weight loss and decreased food intake. RYGB also decreased serum TG, FFAs, and increased bile  levels. The lipid droplets in the liver were significantly decreased after RYGB. The RYGB group exhibited downregulated mRNA and protein expression levels of PEPCK, G6Pase, and SREBP-1c and upregulated expression of FXR, SHP, and PPAR-α in the liver.RYGB ameliorates glucose and lipid metabolism accompanied by weight loss and calorie restriction. The liver exhibited a marked improvement in lipid accumulation after RYGB. The bile  level, FXR, and its target transcriptional factor SHP expression were elevated. Meanwhile, our study demonstrated that the increased bile -FXR signaling, followed by the reduced hepatic , lipogenesis, and increased fatty  β oxidation may contribute to improved metabolic conditions after RYGB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890173>Precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle in Escherichia coli for efficient tyrosine production from acetate.</a></h1><p>Acetate is one of promising feedstocks owing to its cheap price and great abundance. Considering that tyrosine production is gradually shifting to microbial production method, its production from acetate can be attempted to further improve the economic feasibility of its production.Here, we engineered a previously reported strain, SCK1, for efficient production of tyrosine from acetate. Initially, the acetate uptake and gluconeogenic pathway were amplified to maximize the flux toward tyrosine. As flux distribution between glyoxylate and TCA cycles is critical for efficient precursor supplementation, the activity of the glyoxylate cycle was precisely controlled by expression of isocitrate lyase gene under different-strength promoters. Consequently, the engineered strain with optimal flux distribution produced 0.70 g/L tyrosine with 20% of the theoretical maximum yield which are 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold increased values of the parental strain.Tyrosine production from acetate requires precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle and we obtained substantial improvements in production titer and yield by synthetic promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). This is the first demonstration of tyrosine production from acetate. Our strategies would be widely applicable to the production of various chemicals from acetate in future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461616>Characterization of 3-[(Carboxymethyl)thio]picolinic : A Novel Inhibitor of Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase.</a></h1><p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) has traditionally been characterized for its role in the first committed step of . The current understanding of PEPCK's metabolic role has recently expanded to include it serving as a general mediator of tricarboxylic  cycle flux. Selective inhibition of PEPCK  and  has been achieved with 3-mercaptopicolinic  (MPA) ( ∼ 8 μM), whose mechanism of inhibition has been elucidated only recently. On the basis of crystallographic and mechanistic data of various inhibitors of PEPCK, MPA was used as the initial chemical scaffold to create a potentially more selective inhibitor, 3-[(carboxymethyl)thio]picolinic  (CMP), which has been characterized both structurally and kinetically here. These data demonstrate that CMP acts as a competitive inhibitor at the OAA/PEP binding site, with its picolinic  moiety coordinating directly with the M1 metal in the active site ( ∼ 29-55 μM). The extended carboxy tail occupies a secondary binding cleft that was previously shown could be occupied by sulfoacetate ( ∼ 82 μM) and for the first time demonstrates the simultaneous occupation of both OAA/PEP subsites by a single molecular structure. By occupying both the OAA/PEP binding subsites simultaneously, CMP and similar molecules can potentially be used as a starting point for the creation of additional selective inhibitors of PEPCK.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429109>In-depth mapping of the proteome of Tibetan pig tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) using offline high-pH reversed-phase fractionation and LC-MS/MS.</a></h1><p>In recent years, Tibetan pig breeding and meat processing have developed rapidly. However, the basic physiological and biochemical characteristics of Tibetan pork have not been systematically explored. The present study conducted a high-throughput analysis of the tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) proteome of the Tibetan pigs and performed a functional annotation and bioinformatics analysis of the identified proteins. Based on offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography fractionation and MS/MS identification, a total of 1,723 proteins were identified in the tenderloin of Tibetan pigs. Gene ontology analysis and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins involved in respiration (oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/, citric  cycle, and pyruvate metabolism) and protein synthesis and metabolism (proteasome, amino  biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and ribosomes) were significantly enriched, indicating that the energy production and protein metabolism are the most important physiological processes in Tibetan pig tenderloin. Practical applications The in-depth mapping of the tenderloin (longissimus dorsi) proteome of the Tibetan pigs gives a panoramic perspective at the protein molecular level and provides important information on the mechanisms of postmortem muscle physiology and meat quality formation. Furthermore, the development of Tibetan pork storage and processing technologies would also benefit from the characterization of the biochemical properties of Tibetan pork.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825078>Inhibiting hepatic  by chitosan lactate nanoparticles containing CRTC2 siRNA targeted by poly(ethylene glycol)-glycyrrhetinic .</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin deficiency and impaired glucose metabolism. Overexpression of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcriptional coactivator 2 (CRTC2) plays an important role in high  in patients with diabetes type II. Using RNA interference technology for silencing CRTC2 gene expression could be helpful in controlling the level of blood glucose and . In this study, we designed a siRNA delivery platform comprising blended chitosan lactate (CT) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated with glycyrrhetinic  (GA) for controlling . The nanoparticles showed spherical and smooth surface with ~ 189-nm size and + 5.1 zeta potential. Targeted nanoparticles were efficiently stable in serum and different levels of heparin media over 48 h. The gene knockdown efficiency of nanoparticles was comparable to Lipofectamine®, while they had no significant in vitro and in vivo toxicity. The in vivo therapeutic efficacy of targeted nanoparticles was also confirmed by reduced amount of fasting blood sugar in diabetic rat models. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were mostly accumulated in the liver after 2 h indicating the significant targeting ability of the prepared nanoparticles. Therefore, CT/PEG-GA nanoparticles can be considered as a potential candidate for targeted delivery of siRNA into hepatocytes in order to regulate  in diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554135>Hepatic transcriptome and proteome analyses provide new insights into the regulator mechanism of dietary avicularin in diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Many dietary flavonoids existing as glycosides in fruits and vegetables are considered bioactive food components with various potential health benefits. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the glycolysis, , and arachidonic  pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations. Taken together, our results demonstrated the protective effects of avicularin against diabetes and provided a global view about the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of avicularin by the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

C57BL/6N mice were fed with normal diet (ND), HFD (40 kcal% fat), or HFD + 0.005% (/) ED for 16 weeks. In HFD-induced obese mice, dietary ED supplementation significantly alleviated dyslipidemia and adiposity by downregulating the expression of lipogenesis-related genes in white adipose tissue (WAT), while enhancing fecal lipid excretion. ED additionally improved hepatic steatosis and decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by downregulating the expression of hepatic enzymes and the genes involved in lipogenesis and upregulating the expression of hepatic fatty  oxidation-related enzymes and genes. In addition, ED improved insulin resistance (IR) by suppressing hepatic , enhancing glucose utilization, and modulating the production and release of two incretin hormones, namely gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Taken together, the current findings indicated that ED can protect against diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disturbances, including dyslipidemia, inflammation, fatty liver disease, and IR in diet-induced obese mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115573>A 9‑lncRNA risk score system for predicting the prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus‑positive hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, and can be induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of the present study was to screen prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The RNA‑sequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100 HCC samples and 26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, the identification and functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DE‑RNAs) were analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosis‑associated lncRNAs and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the nodes in an lncRNA‑mRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051 consensus DE‑RNAs were identified. The stable modules were significantly associated with the histological grades of HCC, tumor, node and metastasis stage, pathological stage, recurrence and exposure to radiation therapy.

The lncRNA‑mRNA co‑expression network revealed lncRNA GBA3 as a positive regulator of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, an important enzyme in the metabolic pathway of . A risk score system was established based on the optimal 9 lncRNAs, which may be valuable for predicting the prognosis of patients with HBV‑positive HCC and improving understanding of mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of this disease.

This study aimed to identify the signs of hepatic metabolic programming in utero and during the juvenile phase after intrauterine undernutrition during midgestation.Fifty-three pregnant goats were assigned to the control (100% of the maintenance requirement) or restricted (60% of the maintenance requirement from day 45 to day 100 of midgestation and realimentation thereafter) group to compare hepatic energy metabolism in the fetuses (day 100 of gestation) and kids (postnatal day 90).Undernutrition increased the glucagon concentration and hepatic hexokinase activity, decreased the body weight, liver weight and hepatic expression of , , and  mRNAs, and tended to decrease the hepatic glycogen content and  mRNA level in the dams. Maternal undernutrition decreased the growth hormone (GH) and triglyceride concentrations, tended to decrease the body weight and hepatic hexokinase activity, increased the hepatic ,  and  mRNAs levels and glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and tended to increase the hepatic  and  mRNAs levels in the male fetuses. In the restricted female fetuses, the hepatic hexokinase activity and  mRNA level tended to be increased, but  mRNA expression was decreased and the , ,  and  mRNA levels tended to be decreased. Maternal undernutrition changed the hepatic metabolic profile and affected the metabolic pathway involved in amino , glycerophospholipid, bile , purine, and saccharide metabolism in the fetuses, but not the kids. Additionally, maternal undernutrition increased the concentrations of GH and cortisol, elevated the hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and tended to decrease the hepatic glycogen content in the male kids. No alterations in these variables were observed in the female kids.Maternal undernutrition affects the metabolic status in a sex- and stage-specific manner by changing the metabolic profile, expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis and enzyme activities in the liver of the fetuses. The changes in the hormone levels in the male fetuses and kids, but not the female offspring, represent a potential sign of metabolic programming.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966751>Integrated Tear Proteome and Metabolome Reveal Panels of Inflammatory-Related Molecules via Key Regulatory Pathways in Dry Eye Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a growing public health concern with a high global prevalence; however, the fundamental processes involved in its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we applied nanoscale liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS) and ultraperformance LC/Q-TOF-MS/MS technologies on tear samples obtained from 18 dry eye patients and 19 healthy controls for integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Overall, 1031 tear proteins were detected, while 190 proteins were determined to be significantly expressed in dry eye patients. Further functional analysis suggested that various biological processes were highly expressed and involved in the pathogenesis of DES, especially immune and inflammatory processes. In total, 156 named metabolites were identified, among which 34 were found to be significantly changed in dry eye patients. The results highlighted the key elements, especially inflammatory-related proteins and metabolites that played important roles in the development of DES. Further, the regulatory roles of primary pathways, including complement and coagulation cascades, glycolysis/, and amino  metabolism, were also identified as processes involved in DES.

We used a Nat1/Nat2 double knockout (KO) mouse model to demonstrate that ablation of the two Nat genes is associated with modest, intermittent alterations in respiratory exchange rate. Pyruvate tolerance tests show that double KO mice have attenuated hepatic  when maintained on a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. Absence of the two Nat genes also leads to an increase in the hepatic concentration of coenzyme A in mice fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. Our results suggest a modest involvement of NAT in energy metabolism in mice, which is consistent with the absence of major phenotypic deregulation of energy metabolism in slow human acetylators.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761631>Leucine-induced promotion of post-absorptive EAA utilization and hepatic  contributes to protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of dairy calves.</a></h1><p>The high rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of dairy calves can benefit their first lactation even lifetime milk yield. Since the rate of protein synthesis is relatively low in the post-absorptive state, the aim of this research was to determine whether leucine supplementation could increase the post-absorptive essential amino  (EAA) utilization and protein synthesis in the skeletal muscle. Ten male neonatal dairy calves (38 ± 3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the control (CON, no leucine supplementation, n = 5) or supplementation with 1.435 g leucine/L milk (LEU, n = 5). Results showed that leucine significantly increased the length and protein concentration in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle, whereas it decreased creatinine concentration and glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) activity. Compared to the control group, leucine supplementation also reduced the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity. Supplementation of leucine improved the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and substrates ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K). Supplementation of leucine resulted in increased concentrations of glucose, methionine, threonine, histidine and EAAs and decreased concentration of arginine in serum. Liver glucose concentration was higher and pyranic  was lower in LEU compared to CON. In conclusion, leucine supplementation can promote post-absorptive EAA utilization and hepatic , which contributes to protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of dairy calves.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369364>Comparative proteomic analysis of plant-pathogen interactions in resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes infected with .</a></h1><p>Poplar are important forestry species in China, but the  pathogen causes serious economic losses worldwide. To identify candidate  resistance proteins and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in poplar-pathogen interactions, proteomic responses of stem samples from resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes to  were investigated using nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with label-free quantitative analysis. We identified 588 proteins, divided into 21 biological process categories including 48 oxidoreductases, 72 hydrolytic enzymes, 80 metabolic enzymes, and 29 proteins of unknown function. Differential proteome analysis revealed large differences between resistant P. tomentosa and susceptible  Hsu ecotypes before and after inoculation. Among 102 identified proteins, 22 were highly up-regulated in the resistant genotype but down-regulated in the susceptible genotype. Proteins induced in P. tomentosa in response to B. dothidea are associated with plant defenses including oxidoreductase activity (catalase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase), photosynthesis (ATP synthase subunit alpha, ATP synthase gamma chain, photosystem I P700 chlorophyll a apoprotein A2, photosystem II CP47 chlorophyll apoprotein), carbon fixation (pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, malic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain), and /gluconeogenesis (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified 168 proteins related to metabolic pathways, 41 proteins related to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, and 36 proteins related to the biosynthesis of plant hormones, the biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from ornithine, lysine, and nicotinic , and photosynthesis in response to .

In a previous study, we showed that Sir2 is regulated by S-glutathionylation of key cysteine residues located at the catalytic domain. Mutation of these residues results in strains with increased resistance to disulfide stress. In the present study, these mutant cells were highly resistant to acetic  and had an increased chronological life span. Mutant cells had increased acetyl-CoA synthetase activity, which converts acetic  generated by yeast metabolism to acetyl.CoA. This could explain the acetic  resistance and lower levels of this toxic  in the extracellular media during aging. Increased acetyl-CoA levels would raise lipid droplets, a source of energy during aging, and fuel glyoxylate-dependent . The key enzyme of this pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1), showed increased activity in these Sir2 mutant cells during aging. Sir2 activity decreased when cells shifted to the diauxic phase in the mutant strains, compared to the WT strain. Since Pck1 is inactivated through Sir2-dependent deacetylation, the decline in Sir2 activity explained the rise in Pck1 activity. As a consequence, storage of sugars such as trehalose would increase. We conclude that extended longevity observed in the mutants was a combination of increased lipid droplets and trehalose, and decreased acetic  in the extracellular media. These results offer a deeper understanding of the redox regulation of Sir2 in acetic  resistance, which is relevant in some food and industrial biotechnology and also in the metabolism associated to calorie restriction, aging and pathologies such as diabetes.Copyright © 2019.

A hypoxic milieu of the periodontal tissue is generated under periodontitis or during orthodontic treatment, which affects the periodontal and bone remodelling process. Here, we provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of periodontal ligament cells under hypoxic conditions, aiming to reveal previously unappreciated biological changes and to help advance hypoxia-based therapeutic strategies for periodontal diseases.Human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) were characterized using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry (FACS). Successful hypoxia treatment of hPDLCs with 1% O was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Proliferation was evaluated using an MTT assay. The proteomic expression profile under hypoxia was studied with the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) approach followed by protein identification and bioinformatic analysis, and western blot verification was performed.The hPDLCs were positive for vimentin, CD73 and CD105 and negative for keratin, CD34 and CD45. After hypoxia treatment, the mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a ( was upregulated. The proliferation rate was elevated during the first 6 h but decreased from 6 h to 72 h. A total of 220 differentially expressed proteins were quantified in hPDLCs under hypoxia (1% O, 24 h), including 153 upregulated and 67 downregulated proteins, five of which were verified by western blot analysis. The Gene Ontology enriched terms included the energy metabolic process, membrane-bound organelle and vesicle, and protein binding terms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated several involved pathways, including glycolysis/, biosynthesis of amino , the HIF-1 signalling pathway, and focal adhesion. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network demonstrated the dominant role of autophagy over apoptosis under hypoxia.The proteomic profile of hPDLCs under hypoxia was mainly related to energy metabolism, autophagy, and responses to stimuli such as adhesion and inflammation. Previously unrecognized proteins including solute carrier family proteins, heat shock proteins, ubiquitination-related enzymes, collagen and S100 family proteins are involved in adaptive response to hypoxia in hPDLCs and are thus of great research interest in future work.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314991>Gadofullerene Nanoparticles Reverse Dysfunctions of Pancreas and Improve Hepatic Insulin Resistance for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treatment.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders.

Highly accumulated in the pancreas and liver, GFNPs could prominently decrease hyperglycemia, along with permanently maintaining normal blood sugar levels in T2DM mice and even stopping administration. Importantly, GFNPs reversed the pancreas islets dysfunctions by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation responses and fundamentally normalized the insulin secretory function of the pancreas islets. Mechanistically, GFNPs improved hepatic insulin resistance by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism through the activation of IRS2/PI3K/AKT signal pathways, resulting in inhibiting gluconeogenesis and increasing glycogenesis in the liver. Additionally, GFNPs relieved hepatic steatosis in the liver, ultimately maintaining systemic glucose and lipid metabolic homeostasis without obvious toxicity. Together, GFNPs reverse the dysfunctions of the pancreas and improve hepatic insulin resistance, providing a promising approach for T2DM treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30767679>Role of ketone signaling in the hepatic response to fasting.</a></h1><p>Ketosis is a metabolic adaptation to fasting, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and prolonged exercise. β-OH butyrate acts as a transcriptional regulator and at G protein-coupled receptors to modulate cellular signaling pathways in a hormone-like manner. While physiological ketosis is often adaptive, chronic hyperketonemia may contribute to the metabolic dysfunction of NAFLD. To understand how β-OH butyrate signaling affects hepatic metabolism, we compared the hepatic fasting response in control and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase II (HMGCS2) knockdown mice that are unable to elevate β-OH butyrate production. To establish that rescue of ketone metabolic/endocrine signaling would restore the normal hepatic fasting response, we gave intraperitoneal injections of β-OH butyrate (5.7 mmol/kg) to HMGCS2 knockdown and control mice every 2 h for the final 9 h of a 16-h fast. In hypoketonemic, HMGCS2 knockdown mice, fasting more robustly increased mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a protein critical for supporting fatty  oxidation and ketogenesis. In turn, exogenous β-OH butyrate administration to HMGCS2 knockdown mice decreased fasting UCP2 mRNA expression to that observed in control mice. Also supporting feedback at the transcriptional level, β-OH butyrate lowered the fasting-induced expression of HMGCS2 mRNA in control mice. β-OH butyrate also regulates the glycemic response to fasting. The fast-induced fall in serum glucose was absent in HMGCS2 knockdown mice but was restored by β-OH butyrate administration. These data propose that endogenous β-OH butyrate signaling transcriptionally regulates hepatic fatty  oxidation and ketogenesis, while modulating glucose tolerance.  Ketogenesis regulates whole body glucose metabolism and β-OH butyrate produced by the liver feeds back to inhibit hepatic β-oxidation and ketogenesis during fasting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141525>Glucose metabolism is differentially altered by choline and methionine in bovine neonatal hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Choline and methionine serve essential roles in the liver that may interact with glucose metabolism. Our objectives were to quantify glucose export, cellular glycogen, and expression of genes controlling oxidation and  in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes exposed to increasing concentrations of choline chloride (CC) and D,L-methionine (DLM) with or without fatty  (FA). Primary hepatocytes isolated from 3 Holstein calves were maintained as monolayer cultures for 24 h before treatment with CC (61, 128, 2028, 4528 μmol/L) and DLM (16, 30, 100, 300 μmol/L) with or without a 1 mmol/L FA cocktail in a factorial design. After 24 h, media was harvested to quantify glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and cells harvested to quantify glycogen, DNA, and gene expression. No interactions between CC and DLM were detected. The potential two-way interaction between CC or DLM and FA was partitioned into three contrasts when P ≤ 0.20: linear without FA, linear with FA, difference of slope. Fatty  did not affect glucose or cellular glycogen but increased pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytosolic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCKc, PEPCKm), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) expression. Increasing CC decreased glucose but increased cellular glycogen. Expression of PC and PEPCKc was increased by CC during FA treatment. Increasing DLM did not affect metabolites or PC expression, although PEPCKc was marginally decreased. Methionine did not affect G6PC, while CC had a marginal quadratic effect on G6PC. Oxidative and gluconeogenic enzymes appear to respond to FA in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes. Increased PC and PEPCKc by CC during FA treatment suggest increased gluconeogenic capacity. Changes in G6PC may have shifted glucose-6-phosphate towards cellular glycogen; however, subsequent examination of G6PC protein is needed. Unaltered PC and marginally decreased PEPCKc suggest increased oxidative capacity with DLM, although BHB export was unaltered. The differential regulation supports unique effects of CC and DLM within bovine hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768760>Deep-sea hydrothermal vent metagenome-assembled genomes provide insight into the phylum Nanoarchaeota.</a></h1><p>Ectosymbiotic Nanoarchaeota live on the surface of diverse archaeal hosts. Despite being broadly distributed in global geothermal systems, only three Nanoarchaeota have been successfully co-cultivated with their hosts, and until now no nanoarchaeotal cultures or genomes have been described from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. We recovered three nanoarchaeotal metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from deep-sea hydrothermal vent sites at the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (M10-121), Guaymas Basin (Gua-46) and the Mid-Cayman Rise (MC-1). Based on average amino  identity analysis, M10-121 is a novel species in the candidate genus Nanoclepta, while the other two MAGs represent novel genera in the Nanoarchaeota. Like previously sequenced Nanoarchaeota, each MAG encodes at least one split protein-coding gene. The MAGs also contain a mosaic of key nanoarchaeotal features, including CRISPR repeat regions and marker genes for  and archaeal flagella. MC-1 also encodes the pentose bisphosphate pathway, which may allow the nanoarchaeote to bypass several steps in glycolysis and produce ATP.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664210>Altered expression of genes involved in brain energy metabolism as adaptive responses in rats exposed to chronic variable stress; changes in cortical level of glucogenic and neuroactive amino .</a></h1><p>Brain metabolism is closely associated with neuronal activity and enables the accurate synthesis and function of neurotransmitters. Although previous studies have demonstrated that chronic stress is associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to oxidative stress and the disruption of glucose metabolism, the molecular mechanisms and cerebral  in depression have not yet been completely elucidated. In order to examine this subject, the present study evaluated changes in the expression of selected genes involved in the glycolytic pathway and the levels of glucogenic and neuroactive amino  in the brain of rats exposed to chronic variable stress. Male Wistar rats (50‑55 days old, weighing 200‑250 g) were divided into two groups: control and stressed, and the rats in the stressed group were exposed to stress conditions for 40 days. Depressive‑like states were observed and recorded by measuring the body weight and forced swim test (FST). The mRNA levels of Slc2a3 (coding GLUT3) and Tfam (activator of mitochondrial transcription and a participant in mitochondrial genome replication) were markedly increased, while a decrease in the expression of Ldhb and GAPDH was also observed. These modifications were associated with the redirection of glucose metabolism to appropriate defensive pathways under chronic stress conditions, and an increased ability to maintain mitochondrial function as potential adaptive responses. A marked reduction of glucogenic and neuroactive amino  levels indicate the support of energy metabolism by stimulation of the  pathway. The findings of the present study provide a novel insight into the molecular and biochemical events that impact the development of depression under chronic stress conditions, and they may identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30831156>Proteomic analysis of glycosomes from Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes.</a></h1><p>In Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease, the first seven steps of glycolysis are compartmentalized in glycosomes, which are authentic but specialized peroxisomes. Besides glycolysis, activity of enzymes of other metabolic processes have been reported to be present in glycosomes, such as β-oxidation of fatty , purine salvage, pentose-phosphate pathway,  and biosynthesis of ether-lipids, isoprenoids, sterols and pyrimidines. In this study, we have purified glycosomes from T. cruzi epimastigotes, collected the soluble and membrane fractions of these organelles, and separated peripheral and integral membrane proteins by NaCO treatment and osmotic shock. Proteomic analysis was performed on each of these fractions, allowing us to confirm the presence of enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways as well as identify new components of this parasite's glycosomes.Crown Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesized that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated restriction of muscle glucose availability may play a role in the increased protein catabolism during chronic stress. To test this, we generated a ubiquitous GR knockout (GRKO) zebrafish to determine the physiological consequence of glucocorticoid stimulation on muscle metabolism and growth. Adult GRKO zebrafish had higher body mass, and this corresponded to an increased protein and lipid, but not carbohydrate, content. GRKO fish were hypercortisolemic, but they elicited a higher cortisol response to an acute stressor. However, the stressor-induced increase in plasma glucose level observed in the wild type was completely abolished in the GRKO fish. Also, the muscle, but not liver, capacity for glucose uptake was enhanced in the GRKO fish, and this corresponded with a higher hexokinase activity in the mutants. Zebrafish lacking GR also showed a higher capacity for protein synthesis, including increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4B, higher expression of heat shock protein cognate 70, and total protein content. A chronic fasting stressor reduced body mass and muscle protein content in adult zebrafish, but this decrease was attenuated in the GRKO compared with the wild-type fish. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the free pool of amino  substrates used for oxidation and  were lower in the fasted GRKO fish muscle compared with the wild type. Altogether, chronic stressor-mediated GR signaling limits muscle glucose uptake, and this may play a role in protein catabolism, leading to the growth suppression in fish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703066>Metformin improves the glucose homeostasis of Wuchang bream fed high-carbohydrate diets: a dynamic study.</a></h1><p>After a 12-week feeding trial, the glucose tolerance test was performed in Megalobrama amblycephala to evaluate the effects of metformin on the metabolic responses of glycolipids. Plasma insulin peaked at 2 h, then decreased to the basal value at 8-12 h post-injection. Plasma triglyceride levels and liver glycogen contents of the control group was decreased significantly during the first 2 and 1 h, respectively. Then, they returned to basal values at 12 h. During the whole sampling period, the high-carbohydrate groups had significantly higher levels of plasma metabolites and liver glycogen than those of the control group, and metformin supplementation enhanced these changes (except insulin levels). Glucose administration lowered the transcriptions of ampk α1, ampk α2, pepck, g6pase, fbpase, cpt IA and aco, the phosphorylation of Ampk α and the activities of the gluconeogenic enzymes during the first 2-4 h, while the opposite was true of glut 2, gs, gk, pk, accα and fas. High-carbohydrate diets significantly increased the transcriptions of ampk α1, ampk α2, glut 2, gs, gk, pk, accα and fas, the phosphorylation of Ampk α and the activities of the glycolytic enzymes during the whole sampling period, while the opposite was true for the remaining indicators. Furthermore, metformin significantly upregulated the aforementioned indicators (except accα and fas) and the transcriptions of cpt IA and aco. Overall, metformin benefits the glucose homeostasis of Megalobrama amblycephala fed high-carbohydrate diets through the activation of Ampk and the stimulation of glycolysis, glycogenesis and fatty  oxidation, while depressing  and lipogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.</a></h1><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino  can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty  uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto  decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic , and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino  catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino  transaminase, branched-chain α-keto  dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino , thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino  in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino , as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino , alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino  catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino  catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric , increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric  concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696848>Diverse metabolic reactions activated during 58-hr fasting are revealed by non-targeted metabolomic analysis of human blood.</a></h1><p>During human fasting, metabolic markers, including butyrates, carnitines, and branched-chain amino , are upregulated for energy substitution through  and use of stored lipids. We performed non-targeted, accurate semiquantitative metabolomic analysis of human whole blood, plasma, and red blood cells during 34-58 hr fasting of four volunteers. During this period, 44 of ~130 metabolites increased 1.5~60-fold. Consistently fourteen were previously reported. However, we identified another 30 elevated metabolites, implicating hitherto unrecognized metabolic mechanisms induced by fasting. Metabolites in pentose phosphate pathway are abundant, probably due to demand for antioxidants, NADPH,  and anabolic metabolism. Global increases of TCA cycle-related compounds reflect enhanced mitochondrial activity in tissues during fasting. Enhanced purine/pyrimidine metabolites support RNA/protein synthesis and transcriptional reprogramming, which is promoted also by some fasting-related metabolites, possibly via epigenetic modulations. Thus diverse, pronounced metabolite increases result from greatly activated catabolism and anabolism stimulated by fasting. Anti-oxidation may be a principal response to fasting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920846>Intestinal serine protease inhibition increases FGF21 and improves metabolism in obese mice.</a></h1><p>Trypsin is the major serine protease responsible for intestinal protein digestion. An inhibitor, camostat (CS), reduced weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rats; however, the mechanisms for these are largely unknown. We reasoned that CS creates an apparent dietary protein restriction, which is known to increase hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Therefore, metabolic responses to CS and a gut-restricted CS metabolite, FOY-251, were measured in mice. Food intake, body weight, blood glucose, branched-chain amino  (LC/MS), hormone levels (ELISA), liver pathology (histology), and transcriptional changes (qRT-PCR) were measured in , lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice. In  mice, CS in chow (9-69 mg/kg) or FOY-251 (46 mg/kg) reduced food intake and body weight gain to a similar extent as pair-fed mice. CS decreased blood glucose, liver weight, and lipidosis and increased FGF21 gene transcription and plasma levels. In lean mice, CS increased liver FGF21 mRNA and plasma levels. Relative to pair feeding, FOY-251 also increased plasma FGF21 and induced liver FGF21 and integrated stress response (ISR) transcription. In DIO mice, FOY-251 (100 mg/kg po) did not alter peak glucose levels but reduced the AUC of the glucose excursion in response to an oral glucose challenge. FOY-251 increased plasma FGF21 levels. In addition to previously reported satiety-dependent (cholecystokinin-mediated) actions, intestinal trypsin inhibition engages non-satiety-related pathways in both leptin-deficient and DIO mice. This novel mechanism improves metabolism by a liver-integrated stress response and increased FGF21 expression levels in mice.  Trypsin inhibitors, including plant-based consumer products, have long been associated with metabolic improvements. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s suggested this was due to satiety hormones and caloric wasting by loss of protein and fatty  in feces. This work suggests an entirely new mechanism based on the lower amounts of digested protein available in the gut. This apparent protein reduction may cause beneficial metabolic adaptation by the intestinal-liver axis to perceived nutrient stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366319>Genome-wide association analysis of nutrient traits in the oyster Crassostrea gigas: genetic effect and interaction network.</a></h1><p>Oyster is rich in glycogen and free amino  and is called "the milk of sea". To understand the main genetic effects of these traits and the genetic networks underlying their correlation, we have conducted the whole genome resequencing with 427 oysters collected from the world-wide scale.After association analysis, 168 clustered significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified for glycogen content and 17 SNPs were verified with 288 oyster individuals in another wide populations. These were the most important candidate loci for oyster breeding. Among 24 genes in the 100-kb regions of the leading SNP loci, cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) contained a non-synonymous SNP and displayed higher expressions in high glycogen content individuals. This might enhance the  process by the transcriptionally regulating the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Also, for amino  content, 417 clustered significant SNPs were identified. After genetic network analysis, three node SNP regions were identified to be associated with glycogen, protein, and Asp content, which might explain their significant correlation.Overall, this study provides insights into the genetic correlation among complex traits, which will facilitate future oyster functional studies and breeding through molecular design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199413>Synergistic effect of sea cucumber saponins and EPA-enriched phospholipids on insulin resistance in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Sea cucumber saponins (SCS) exhibit a significant effect on ameliorating glucose and lipid disorders by inhibiting fatty  biosynthesis; however, high cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity limit their application. Eicosapentaenoic -enriched phospholipids (EPA-PL) significantly ameliorate insulin resistance and elevate the level of hepatic lipolysis, which may have a synergistic effect with SCS in alleviating obesity-related insulin resistance via multiple mechanisms. In the present study, high-fat diet-induced male C57BL/6J mice with obesity-related insulin resistance were used to evaluate the synergistic effect of SCS and EPA-PL on alleviating the insulin resistance. Results show that the combination of SCS and EPA-PL at a half dose exhibited a significant improvement on glucose intolerance and systematic insulin sensitivity than SCS or EPA-PL alone. Moreover, the half dose-combination remarkably inhibited the macrophage infiltration (F4/80) to white adipose tissue (WAT) and significantly down-regulated the level of MCP1, TNF-α and IL-6 compared with SCS and EPA-PL alone. Consequently, the combined administration not only decreased hepatic  and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis (P < 0.05), but also stimulated the glucose uptake in WAT and muscle (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, neither SCS or EPA-PL alone exhibited any effect on the glucose uptake. The combination of SCS and EPA-PL contributed to a synergistic effect on alleviating the obesity-related insulin resistance due to the amelioration of an inflammation-centric peripheral insulin response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460269>Rubrofusarin as a Dual Protein Tyrosine Phosphate 1B and Human Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitor: An in Vitro and in Silico Study.</a></h1><p>A number of nature-derived biologically active compounds comprise glycosides. In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity; however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic parameters. The patterns of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) inhibition by rubrofusarin 6--β-d-glucopyranoside (), rubrofusarin 6--β-d-gentiobioside (), rubrofusarin triglucoside (), and cassiaside B2 () were compared with the aglycone, rubrofusarin, isolated from  seeds. Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced activity (IC; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for  and >100 μM for -) than did the reference drug, ursolic  (IC; 2.29 ± 0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC value of 5.90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of . Our overall results show that glycosylation retards activity; however, it reduces toxicity. Thus,  seed as functional food and rubrofusarin as a base can be used for the development of therapeutic agents against comorbid diabetes and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002814>Human adipocytes and CD34 cells from the stromal vascular fraction of the same adipose tissue differ in their energy metabolic enzyme configuration.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue plays a role in energy storage and metabolic balance and is composed of different cell types. The metabolic activity of the tissue itself has been a matter of research for a long time, but comparative data about the energy metabolism of different cell types of human subcutaneous adipose tissue are sparse. Therefore, we compared the activity of major energy metabolic pathways of adipocytes and CD34 cells from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) separated from the same tissue. This CD34 cell fraction is enriched with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitors, as they account for the largest proportion of CD34 cells of the SVF. Adipocytes displayed significantly higher mitochondrial enzyme capacities compared to CD34 SVF-cells, as shown by the higher activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase and ß-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Inversely, the CD34 SVF-cells showed higher capacities for cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism, represented by the activity of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, the CD34 SVF-cells may ensure the provision of pentose phosphates and reduction equivalents for the replication of DNA during proliferation. The data indicate that these two cell fractions of the human adipose tissue vary in their metabolic configuration adapted to their physiological demands regarding proliferation and differentiation in vivo.Copyright © 2019.

This work aimed to assess differences in protein expression in the digestive gland of female mussels after dietary exposure to Ag NPs in autumn and spring. Mussels were fed daily with microalgae previously exposed for 24 h to 10 μg/L of PVP/PEI coated 5 nm Ag NPs. After 21 days, mussels significantly accumulated Ag in both seasons and Ag NPs were found within digestive gland cells and gills. Two-dimensional electrophoresis distinguished 104 differentially expressed protein spots in autumn and 142 in spring. Among them, chitinase like protein-3, partial and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, that are involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, carbon metabolism, glycolysis/ and the biosynthesis of amino  KEGG pathways, were overexpressed in autumn but underexpressed in spring. In autumn, pyruvate metabolism, citrate cycle, cysteine and methionine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were altered, while in spring, proteins related to the formation of phagosomes and hydrogen peroxide metabolism were differentially expressed. Overall, protein expression signatures depended on season and Ag NPs exposure, suggesting that season significantly influences responses of mussels to NP exposure.Copyright © 2019.

This study investigated the effect of ad libitum versus restrictive feeding (85% of ad libitum) on the serum metabolome and white blood cell composition in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; metric for feed efficiency). Blood samples were collected between days 33 and 37 post-hatch. While serum glucose was similar, serum uric  and cholesterol were indicative of the nutritional status and chicken's RFI, respectively. Feed restriction and RFI rank caused distinct serum metabolome profiles, whereby restrictive feeding also increased the blood lymphocyte proportion. Most importantly, 10 amino  were associated with RFI rank in birds, whereas restrictive feeding affected almost all detected lysophosphatidylcholines, with 3 being higher and 6 being lower in restrictively compared to ad libitum fed chickens. As indicated by relevance networking, isoleucine, lysine, valine, histidine, and ornithine were the most discriminant for high RFI, whereas 3 biogenic amines (carnosine, putrescine, and spermidine) and 3 diacyl-glycerophospholipids (38:4, 38:5, and 40:5) positively correlated with feed intake and body weight gain, respectively. Only for taurine, feed intake mostly explained the RFI-associated variation, whereas for most metabolites, other host physiological factors played a greater role for the RFI-associated differences, and was potentially related to insulin-signaling, phospholipase A2, and arachidonic  metabolism. Alterations in the hepatic synthesis of long-chain fatty  and the need for precursors for  due to varying energy demand may explain the marked differences in serum metabolite profiles in ad libitum and restrictively fed birds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622678>Molecular therapeutic strategies targeting pancreatic cancer induced cachexia.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic cancer (PC) induced cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality and reduced quality of life. The pathophysiology of cachexia is complex and poorly understood. Many molecular signaling pathways are involved in PC and cachexia. Though our understanding of cancer cachexia is growing, therapeutic options remain limited. Thus, further discovery and investigation of the molecular signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of cachexia can be applied to development of targeted therapies. This review focuses on three main pathophysiologic processes implicated in the development and progression of cachexia in PC, as well as their utility in the discovery of novel targeted therapies. Skeletal muscle wasting is the most prominent pathophysiologic anomaly in cachectic patients and driven by multiple regulatory pathways. Several known molecular pathways that mediate muscle wasting and cachexia include transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), myostatin and activin, IGF-1/PI3K/AKT, and JAK-STAT signaling. TGF-β antagonism in cachectic mice reduces skeletal muscle catabolism and weight loss, while improving overall survival. Myostatin/activin inhibition has a great therapeutic potential since it plays an essential role in skeletal muscle regulation. Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) leads to increased ubiquitination associated proteolysis, inhibition of myogenesis, and decreased muscle mass in PC induced cachexia. IGFBP-3 antagonism alleviates muscle cell wasting. Another component of cachexia is profound systemic inflammation driven by pro-cachectic cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon gamma (INF-γ). IL-6 antagonism has been shown to reduce inflammation, reduce skeletal muscle loss, and ameliorate cachexia. While TNF-α inhibitors are clinically available, blocking TNF-α signaling is not effective in the treatment of cancer cachexia. Blocking the synthesis or action of acute phase reactants and cytokines is a feasible therapeutic strategy, but no anti-cytokine therapies are currently approved for use in PC. Metabolic alterations such as increased energy expenditure and , insulin resistance, fat tissue browning, excessive oxidative stress, and proteolysis with amino  mobilization support tumor growth and the development of cachexia. Current innovative nutritional strategies for cachexia management include ketogenic diet, utilization of natural compounds such as silibinin, and supplementation with ω3-polyunsaturated fatty . Elevated ketone bodies exhibit an anticancer and anticachectic effect. Silibinin has been shown to inhibit growth of PC cells, induce metabolic alterations, and reduce myofiber degradation. Consumption of ω3-polyunsaturated fatty  has been shown to significantly decrease resting energy expenditure and regulate metabolic dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30746739>Biotin in metabolism, gene expression, and human disease.</a></h1><p>Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that belongs to the vitamin B complex and which is an essential nutrient of all living organisms from bacteria to man. In eukaryotic cells biotin functions as a prosthetic group of enzymes, collectively known as biotin-dependent carboxylases that catalyze key reactions in , fatty  synthesis, and amino  catabolism. Enzyme-bound biotin acts as a vector to transfer a carboxyl group between donor and acceptor molecules during carboxylation reactions. In recent years, evidence has mounted that biotin also regulates gene expression through a mechanism beyond its role as a prosthetic group of carboxylases. These activities may offer a mechanistic background to a developing literature on the action of biotin in neurological disorders. This review summarizes the role of biotin in activating carboxylases and proposed mechanisms associated with a role in gene expression and in ameliorating neurological disease.© 2019 SSIEM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360146>Screening differentially expressed proteins from co-cultured hematopoietic cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells by quantitative proteomics (SILAC) method.</a></h1><p>Bone marrow stromal cells protect hematopoietic cells and provide drug resistance by delivering bunch of variable proteins. Thus, alterations of protein expression are typically associated with cell-cell signal transduction and regulation of cellular functions.Co-culture models of bone marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic cells are often used in studies of their crosstalk. Studies of altered protein expression initiated by stromal cell/hematopoietic cell interactions are an important new trend in microenvironmental research. There has been no report to date of global quantitative proteomics analysis of crosstalk between hematopoietic cells and stromal cells. In this study, we analyzed quantitative proteomes in a co-culture system of stromal HS5 cells and hematopoietic KG1a cells, and simultaneously tracked differentially expressed proteins in two types of cells before and after co-culture by stable isotope labeling by amino  in cell culture (SILAC) method.We have shown that in co-cultured KG1a, 40 proteins (including CKAP4, LMNA, and SERPINB2) were upregulated and 64 proteins (including CD44, CD99, and NCAM1) were downregulated relative to KG1a alone. We utilized IPA analysis to discover that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was upregulated, whereas platelet activation was downregulated in co-cultured KG1a cells. Furthermore, 95 proteins (including LCP1, ARHGAP4, and UNCX) were upregulated and 209 proteins (including CAPG, FLNC, and MAP4) were downregulated in co-cultured HS5 relative to HS5 alone. The tight junction pathway was downregulated and /gluconeogenesis pathway was dysfunctional in co-cultured HS5. Most importantly, the significantly differentially expressed proteins can also be confirmed using different co-cultured cell lines.Altogether, we recommend such quantitative proteomics approach for the studies of the hematopoietic-stroma cross-talk, differentially expressed proteins and related signaling pathways identification. The differentially expressed proteins identified from this current SILAC method will provide a useful basis for ongoing studies of crosstalk between stromal cells and hematopoietic cells in co-culture systems. All these result suggested our ongoing studies can focus on the mechanisms underlying CKAP4 increase and CD44 decrease in co-cultured hematopoietic cells, and the increase of LCP1 and decrease of CAPG in co-cultured stromal cell. The proteomic profiles from the KG1a/stromal cell co-culture system give new molecular insights into the roles of these cells in MDS pathophysiology and related bone disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282100>Exposure to recurrent hypoglycemia alters hippocampal metabolism in treated streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>Exposure to recurrent hypoglycemia (RH) is common in diabetic patients receiving glucose-lowering therapies and is implicated in causing cognitive impairments. Despite the significant effect of RH on hippocampal function, the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. Our goal was to determine the effect of RH exposure on hippocampal metabolism in treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats.Hyperglycemia was corrected by insulin pellet implantation. Insulin-treated diabetic (ITD) rats were exposed to mild/moderate RH once a day for 5 consecutive days.The effect of RH on hippocampal metabolism revealed 65 significantly altered metabolites in the RH group compared with controls. Several significant differences in metabolite levels belonging to major pathways (eg, Krebs cycle, , and amino  metabolism) were discovered in RH-exposed ITD rats when compared to a control group. Key glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase were affected by RH exposure.Our results demonstrate that the exposure to RH leads to metabolomics alterations in the hippocampus of insulin-treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Understanding how RH affects hippocampal metabolism may help attenuate the adverse effects of RH on hippocampal functions.© 2019 The Authors.

However, high incidence and severity of side-effects on the structure and functions of the kidney, liver and intestine limits its clinical use. The present study tested the hypothesis that IndoM causes multi-organ toxicity by inducing oxidative stress that alters the structure of various cellular membranes, metabolism and hence functions. The effect of IndoM was determined on the enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM) and oxidative stress in the rat kideny, liver and intestine to understand the mechanism of IndoM induced toxicity. Adult male Wister rats were given IndoM (20 mg/kg) intra-peritoneally in sodium bicarbonate twice a day for 3 d. The body weights of the rats were recorded before and after experimental procedure. IndoM administration significantly increased blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase but inorganic phosphate indicating IndoM induced renal, hepatic and intestinal toxicity. Activity of lactate dehydrogenase along with glucose-6- and fructose-1, 6-bis phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADP-malic enzyme increased but malate dehydrogenase decreased in all tissues. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) significantly increased whereas the antioxidant enzymes decreased in all rat tissues studied. The results indicate that IndoM administration caused severe damage to kidney, liver and intestine by icreasing LPO, suppressing antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting oxidative metablolism. The energy dependence was shifted to anaerobic glycolysis due to mitochondrial damage supported by increased  to provide more glucose to meet energy requirements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977302>High-quality draft genome sequence of Gaiella occulta isolated from a 150 meter deep mineral water borehole and comparison with the genome sequences of other deep-branching lineages of the phylum Actinobacteria.</a></h1><p>Gaiella occulta strain F2-233 (=CECT 7815 = LMG 26412), isolated from a 150 meter deep mineral water aquifer, was deemed a candidate for high-quality draft genome sequencing because of the rare environment from which it was isolated. The draft genome sequence (QQZY00000000) of strain F2-233 is composed of approximately 3 Mb, predicted 3,119 protein-coding genes of which 2,545 were assigned putative functions. Genome analysis was done by comparison with the other deep-branching Actinobacteria neighbors Rubrobacter radiotolerans, Solirubrobacter soli and Thermoleophilum album. The genes for the tricarboxylic  cycle,  and pentose phosphate pathway, were identified in G. occulta, R. radiotolerans, S. soli and T. album genomes. Genes of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and nitrate reduction were identified in G. occulta, R. radiotolerans and S. soli, but not in the T. album genome. Alkane degradation is precluded by genome analysis in G. occulta. Genes involved in myo-inositol metabolism were found in both S. soli and G. occulta genomes.

SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic  and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic , fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic ; and decreased levels of the amino  metabolism products aspartic  and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty  synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated  and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733818>Metabolic effects of mulberry branch bark powder on diabetic mice based on GC-MS metabolomics approach.</a></h1><p>Mulberry () branch bark powder have showed effective hypoglycemic activity in our previous research. This study aims to explore the mechanism of protect effect on diabetes mice of mulberry branch bark as food supplement based on non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics' platform.Animal model of double diabetes was established with high fat diet and Streptozotocin injection. Mice were fed with mulberry branch bark powder (MBBP) for five weeks to study its therapeutic effect. The metabolite feature of diabetes model and treatment group mice were characterized using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, complemented with the biochemical evaluation, histological inspection, immunohistochemistry observations and enzyme protein detection.A panel of endogenous metabolites were revealed that are relevant to disturbed metabolic processes among groups. The serum metabolic profiles were significantly different between the model group and treatment group. The manner of MBBP treatment showed to be significantly dose dependent and 20% MBBP treatment gain a relatively greater benefit than others. The metabolic disorders in model group include enhanced activation of the sorbitol pathway and galactose metabolite, increased activities of , fatty  oxidation, proteins catabolism and attenuated activities of pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and aerobic oxidation pathways, internal synthesis of cholesterol, inositol production. MBBP treatment ameliorate these abnormal metabolize as revealed by differential metabolites comparing with that of model mice, such as decreasing the accumulation of ketone body, enhancing NADPH biosynthesis, partially reversing oxidative stress and energy metabolism disturbance.Mulberry branch bark had a re-balancing effect on the disturbed metabolic pathways in the diabetic mice. Based on the metabolic pathways network, oral administration of MBBP could ameliorate the hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia symptoms in a global scale and restore the abnormal metabolic state to a near normal level in a dose dependent pattern.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30642993>Global Analysis of Genes Essential for Francisella tularensis Schu S4 Growth  and for Fitness during Competitive Infection of Fischer 344 Rats.</a></h1><p>The highly virulent intracellular pathogen  is a Gram-negative bacterium that has a wide host range, including humans, and is the causative agent of tularemia.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of overexpression SREBP1a, a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, on the intermediary metabolism of , a glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish. Administration of chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid driving expression of the N-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP1a significantly increased SREBP1a mRNA and protein in the liver of . Overexpression of SREBP1a enhanced the hepatic expression of key genes in -gluconeogenesis (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), fatty  synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2), elongation (elongation of very long chain fatty  protein 5) and desaturation (fatty  desaturase 2) as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), leading to increased blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels.

We aimed to determine if a supplementation of a mix of fibers (inulin, resistant starch and pectin) could limit or alleviate overfeeding-induced metabolic perturbations. Twenty female minipigs were fed with a control diet (C) or an enriched fat/sucrose diet supplemented (O + F) or not (O) with fibers. Between 0 and 56 days of overfeeding, insulin (+88%), HOMA (+102%), cholesterol (+45%) and lactate (+63%) were increased, without any beneficial effect of fibers supplementation. However, fibers supplementation limited body weight gain (vs. O, -15% at D56) and the accumulation of hepatic lipids droplets induced by overfeeding. This could be explained by a decreased lipids transport potential (-50% FABP1 mRNA, O + F vs. O) inducing a down-regulation of regulatory elements of lipids metabolism / lipogenesis (-36% SREBP1c mRNA, O + F vs. O) but not to an increased oxidation (O + F not different from O and C for proteins and mRNA measured). Glucose metabolism was also differentially regulated by fibers supplementation, with an increased net hepatic release of glucose in the fasted state (diet × time effect, P<.05 at D56) that can be explained partially by a possible increased glycogen synthesis in the fed state (+82% GYS2 protein, O + F vs. O, P=.09). The direct role of short chain fatty  on  stimulation is questioned, with probably a short-term impact (D14) but no effect on a long-term (D56) basis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since its discovery in 1998, the field of PGC-1α biology has grown exponentially and a large body of research has elucidated the diverse roles of PGC-1α in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, fatty  oxidation, muscle fiber type switching, hepatic , and circadian clock regulation, etc. In addition, recent research has identified a splice variant(s) of PGC-1α in humans and rodents. The common misconception relating to PGC-1α is that it migrates at a predicted molecular weight of ~90 kDa by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. However, several recent studies have provided solid evidence that the biologically relevant molecular weight of PGC-1α is ~110 kDa. In this chapter, we describe an optimized immunoblotting protocol that is developed to detect the low abundance protein PGC-1α and its alternatively spliced isoform named NT-PGC-1α in various rodent tissues. We also describe an optimized immunoprecipitation protocol that can isolate and concentrate endogenous PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α.

The objective was to quantify gene expression of key enzymes involved in  and FA transport into the mitochondria in primary hepatocytes in response to exposure to an FA mixture mimicking what is circulating in a transition dairy cow with or without enrichment of C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 4 Holstein bull calves 3 d of age (± standard deviation 2 d) and cultured. Twenty-four hours after plating, treatments were applied to the cells for 24-h incubation. Treatments consisted of (1) control (1% BSA), (2) 0.75 mM FA cocktail (3% C14:0, 27% C16:0, 23% C18:0, 31% C18:1, 8% C18:2, and 8% C18:3 to mimic the FA profile of dairy cattle at calving), (3) 0.90 mM FA cocktail, (4) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C16:0, (5) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:0, and (6) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:1. After harvest in Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), samples were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction, purification, and reverse transcription. Abundance of mRNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of genes of interest [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, pyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase] was calculated relative to the average abundance of 2 reference genes (ribosomal protein L32 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which were the most stable out of 3 tested. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with the fixed effect of treatment and calf in the random statement. The addition of FA compared with the 1% BSA treatment increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and cytosolic PCK1. Enrichment with individual FA did not further regulate pyruvate carboxylase or PCK1 beyond that achieved by the basal profile. These results suggest that shifts in circulating FA profile within a biological range, without a difference in the total FA concentration, have minimal effects on transcriptional regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes in primary bovine hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

SCFAs may exert multiple beneficial effects on human lipid and glucose metabolism. However, their actions and underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the direct effects of propionate on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism using human HepG2 hepatocytes. Here, we demonstrate that propionate at a physiologically-relevant concentration effectively suppresses palmitate-enhanced glucose production in HepG2 cells but does not affect intracellular neutral lipid levels. Our results indicated that propionate can decline in gluconeogenesis by down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a major regulator of the hepatic glucose metabolism. Mechanistic studies also revealed that propionate-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation can be ascribed to Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the propionate receptor GPR43 prevented propionate-inducible activation of AMPK and abrogates the gluconeogenesis-inhibitory action. Thus, our data indicate that the binding of propionate to hepatic GPR43 elicits CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK through intracellular Ca increase, leading to suppression of gluconeogenesis. The present study suggests the potential efficacy of propionate in preventive and therapeutic management of diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

HPM is not normally associated with shrimp mortality, but is associated with significant growth retardation. In this study, the responses induced by EHP were investigated in hepatopancreas of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei using proteomics and metabolomics. Among differential proteins identified, several (e.g., peritrophin-44-like protein, alpha2 macroglobulin isoform 2, prophenoloxidase-activating enzymes, ferritin, Rab11A and cathepsin C) were related to pathogen infection and host immunity. Other proteomic biomarkers (i.e., farnesoic  o-methyltransferase, juvenile hormone esterase-like carboxylesterase 1 and ecdysteroid-regulated protein) resulted in a growth hormone disorder that prevented the shrimp from molting. Both proteomic KEGG pathway (e.g., "Glycolysis/" and "Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism") and metabolomic KEGG pathway (e.g., "Galactose metabolism" and "Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty ") data indicated that energy metabolism pathway was down-regulated in the hepatopancreas when infected by EHP. More importantly, the changes of hormone regulation and energy metabolism could provide much-needed insight into the underlying mechanisms of stunted growth in shrimp after EHP infection. Altogether, this study demonstrated that proteomics and metabolomics could provide an insightful view into the effects of microsporidial infection in the shrimp L. vannamei.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse palmitic  (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty  and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty  into mitochondria. PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty  analogue.

Gastrointestinal microflora is closely associated with the main factor of meat flavour, including fibre characteristics and lipid metabolism. Our method in this study involved different raising patterns within the semi free-grazing farm (FF) or indoor feeding farm (DF), the measurement of fat deposition and myofiber type by paraffin section and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the identification of microbiome and functional capacities associated with meat quality through metagenomic sequencing.Results showed that the fat area in muscle and adipose tissue and the myofiber density significantly increased in the pigs of the FF group. The relative abundance of bacteria associated with lipid metabolism, such as g_Oscillibacter, in the feces of the FF group was higher than that in DF group, and the relative abundance of some bacteria with probiotic function, including g_Lactobacillus and g_Clostridium, was lower than that in DF group. The abundance of g_Clostridium was significantly positively correlated with the intramuscular fat area, whereas health-related bacteria, such as g_Butyricicoccus, g_Eubacterium, g_Phascolarctobacterium and g_Oribacterium, was significantly negatively correlated with abdominal fat area, myofiber density and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) mRNA expression. KEGG analysis showed that pigs raised in semi free-grazing farm can activate the pathway of inosine monophosphate (IMP) biosynthesis, /gluconeogenesis and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism.Free range feeding improves meat quality by changing the fibre type, myofiber density and metabolic pathways related to flavour amino , IMP or /gluconeogenesis in muscle.

In these cells, fructose uptake and fructolysis are unregulated processes, resulting in the generation of intracellular triose phosphates proportionate to fructose intake. Triose phosphates are then processed into lactate, glucose and fatty  to serve as metabolic substrates in other cells of the body. With small oral loads, fructose is mainly metabolized in the small bowel, while with larger loads fructose reaches the portal circulation and is largely extracted by the liver. A small portion, however, escapes liver extraction and is metabolized either in the kidneys or in other tissues through yet unspecified pathways. In sedentary subjects, consumption of a fructose-rich diet for several days stimulates hepatic de novo lipogenesis, increases intrahepatic fat and blood triglyceride concentrations, and impairs insulin effects on hepatic glucose production. All these effects can be prevented when high fructose intake is associated with increased levels of physical activity. There is also evidence that, during exercise, fructose carbons are efficiently transferred to skeletal muscle as glucose and lactate to be used for energy production. Glucose and lactate formed from fructose can also contribute to the re-synthesis of muscle glycogen after exercise. We therefore propose that the deleterious health effects of fructose are tightly related to an imbalance between fructose energy intake on one hand, and whole-body energy output related to a low physical activity on the other hand.© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, a combination of proteomic and metabolomic approaches was applied to evaluate metabolic and proteomic changes of the rumen epithelium in goats fed a hay diet (Hay) or HG diet. At the metabolome level, results from principal component analysis (PCA) and PLS-DA revealed clear differences in the biochemical composition of ruminal tissue of the control (Hay) and the grain-fed groups, demonstrating the evident impact of HG feeding on metabolite profile of ruminal epithelial tissues. As compared with the Hay group, HG feeding increased the levels of eight metabolites and decreased the concentrations of seven metabolites in ruminal epithelial tissues. HG feeding mainly altered starch and sucrose metabolism, purine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis or , galactose metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism in ruminal epithelium. At the proteome level, 35 differentially expressed proteins were found in the rumen epithelium between the Hay and HG groups, with 12 upregulated and 23 downregulated proteins. The downregulated proteins were related to fatty  metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic processes and nucleoside metabolic processes, while most of upregulated proteins were involved in oxidative stress and detoxification. In general, our findings revealed that HG feeding resulted in differential proteomic and metabolomic profiles in the rumen epithelia of goats, which may contribute to better understanding how rumen epithelium adapt to HG feeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389636>Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires glyoxylate shunt and reverse methylcitrate cycle for lactate and pyruvate metabolism.</a></h1><p>Bacterial nutrition is an essential aspect of host-pathogen interaction. For the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis in humans, fatty  derived from lipid droplets are considered the major carbon source. However, many other soluble nutrients are available inside host cells and may be used as alternative carbon sources. Lactate and pyruvate are abundant in human cells and fluids, particularly during inflammation. In this work, we study Mtb metabolism of lactate and pyruvate combining classic microbial physiology with a 'multi-omics' approach consisting of transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), RNA-seq transcriptomics, proteomics and stable isotopic labelling coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. We discovered that Mtb is well adapted to use both lactate and pyruvate and that their metabolism requires , valine metabolism, the Krebs cycle, the GABA shunt, the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. The last two pathways are traditionally associated with fatty  metabolism and, unexpectedly, we found that in Mtb the methylcitrate cycle operates in reverse, to allow optimal metabolism of lactate and pyruvate. Our findings reveal a novel function for the methylcitrate cycle as a direct route for the biosynthesis of propionyl-CoA, the essential precursor for the biosynthesis of the odd-chain fatty .© 2019 The Authors.

To reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying macrovascular invasion (MaVI) in HCC, we performed an iTRAQ based proteomic study to identify notably dysregulated proteins from eight HCC patients with differential vascular invasion and further confirmed them in the other 53 HCC patients. Forty-seven proteins were found significantly down-regulated in HCC with MaVI. More importantly, 30 of them were not changed in HCC without MaVI. Gene ontology analysis of these 47 proteins shows the top three enriched biological processes are urea cycle, , and arginine biosynthetic process. We validated nine remarkably dysregulated candidates in HCC patients with MaVI by Western blot including eight down-regulated proteins (CPS1, ASS1, ASL, ARG1, BHMT, DMGDH, Annexin A6, and CES1) and one up-regulated protein (CKAP4). Furthermore, dysregulation of CPS1, ASL, and ARG1, key enzymes involved in urea cycle, together with Annexin A6 and CES1, major proteins in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and fatty  ester metabolism, was verified using immunohistochemical staining. The significant down-regulation of urea cycle generates clinically relevant proteomic signature in HCC patients with macrovascular invasion, which may provide possible insights into the molecular mechanisms of metastasis and new therapeutic targets of HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299021>Use of the microbiome in the management of children with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this review is to present recent data that defines our current understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in the development of T2DM.Recent studies focus on the physiology and molecular pathways of the gut microbiome-host interaction. Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of plant-based nonsoluble fiber bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43 to induce enteroendocrine molecules that control appetite, and to upregulate intestinal  gene expression that controls glucose regulation. "Metabolic endotexemia" reflects a state of low-grade systemic inflammation that results from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release from the gut into the systemic circulation in response to a high-fat diet. Inflammatory pathways induced by LPS, activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), and other inflammatory signaling pathways are mediators of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus.Recent scientific data support that derangements in the composition of the microbiota, termed "microbiome dysbiosis" is a factor in the development of "metabolic endotoxemia" and T2DM. Therapeutic options that target the gut microbiome in the treatment of T2DM are explored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779751>Comparative transcriptome analysis of resistant and susceptible kiwifruits in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. Actinidiae during early infection.</a></h1><p>Kiwifruit bacterial canker is a devastating disease threatening kiwifruit production. To clarify the defense mechanism in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), we observed phenotypic changes in resistant Huate (HT) and susceptible Hongyang (HY) kiwifruit varieties at 0, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 144 hour after inoculation (hai) with Psa. Brown lesions appeared in the inoculation areas 12 hai in HY shoots, and the lesion length gradually increased from 24 to 144 h. In contrast, no lesions were found in HT shoots at any time points. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed significantly more differentially expressed genes between HT and HY at 12 hai than at any other time point. According to weighted gene co-expression network analysis, five modules were notably differentially expressed between HT and HY; pathway mapping using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes database was performed for the five modules. In MEgreenyellow and MEyellow modules, pathways related to"plant-pathogen interaction", "Endocytosis", "Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism", and "Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms" were enriched, whereas in the MEblack module, pathways related to "protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum", "plant-pathogen interaction", and "Glycolysis / " were enriched. In particular, the Pti1 and RPS2 encoding effector receptors, and the NPR1, TGA, and PR1 genes involved in the salicylic  signaling pathway were significantly up-regulated in HT compared with HY. This indicates that the effector-triggered immunity response was stronger and that the salicylic  signaling pathway played a pivotal role in the Psa defense response of HT. In addition, we identified other important genes, involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and Ca2+ internal flow, which were highly expressed in HT. Taken together, these results provide important information to elucidate the defense mechanisms of kiwifruit during Psa infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945499>[Serum metabolic profile involving protective effect of "Neiguan"(PC6)-electroacupuncture preconditioning in rats with myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury].</a></h1><p>To observe the effect of "Neiguan" (PC6)-electroacupuncture (EA) preconditioning on serum metabolites in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) rats, so as to reveal its mechanism underlying improvement of ischemic myocardium from metabonomics.A total of 48 male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model, EA "Neiguan"(PC6) and EA "Hegu"(LI4) groups (＝12 rats/ group). Rats of the control group were just banded on animal boards for 30 min, once daily for 7 days. The MIRI model was established by occlusion of the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery for 40 min, followed by reperfusion for 1 h, and rats of the model group were also banded as those in the control group. Before modeling, EA (10 Hz/50 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Neiguan"(PC6) and "Hegu"(LI4) for 30 min, once daily for 7 successive days. After the treatment, serum samples were collected to be analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectroscopy. The orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to distinguish the serum differential metabolic profile of rats in different groups and identify potential biomarkers.After modeling, the ECG of model group and electroacupuncture groups showed T wave towering, and there was no obvious ST segment between R wave and T wave. The T wave decreased more than 0.2 mV after reperfusion, and there was no obvious ST segment. Compared with the control group, MIRI induced significant changes of metabolites in the serum including increase of acetoacetate , lectic , creatine, glycerol and glucose, and decrease of alanine, glutamine, glycerophosphoryl choline and phosphorylcholine. In comparison with the model group, PC6-EA preconditioning induced significant changes, including an increase of glucose, and a decrease of leucine，isoleucine, valine，3-hydroxybutyric ，lactate，acetate，acetone，acetoacetate ，pyruvic ，glutamine，creatine and glycerol. There is no significant difference in metabolic patterns between "Hegu" group and model group. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the protective effect of PC6-EA pretreatment was realized mainly by regulating pathways of glycolysis, , citric  metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, ketone body metabolism, etc.PC6-EA pretreatment has a role in regulating , pyruvate metabolism, amino metabolism, ketone body metabolism and energy metabolism in rats with MIRI, which maybe contribute to its protective effect on ischemic myocardium, but the specific metabolic pathways and mechanisms need being studied further.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30948354>Down-regulation of MicroRNA-592 in obesity contributes to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.</a></h1><p>Many studies have demonstrated that microRNAs, a class of small and non-coding RNA molecules, play an important role in the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis. In the present study, we sought to investigate the function of miR-592 in the development of obesity-associated metabolic disorders, including hyperglycemia andinsulin resistance.The expression levels of miR-592 were measured in the liver of obese mice and humans by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Loss- and gain-of function experiments were employed to explore the metabolic function of miR-592 using locked nucleic  and adenovirus in lean and obese mice, respectively. The molecular target of miR-592 was determined by western blotting and luciferase reporter assays.We found a significant decreased expression of miR-592 in the liver of obese mice and humans. Inhibition of miR-592 led to elevated blood glucose levels, enhanced  and reduced insulin sensitivity in lean mice. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of hepatic miR-592 improved metabolic disorders in obese mice. Mechanistically, we found that the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) is a direct target gene of miR-592 to mediate its metabolic functions. miR-592 was able to inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of FOXO1 by binding to its 3'-untranslated region.Our findings demonstrate that obesity-associated down-regulation of miR-592 plays an important role in the progression of metabolic diseases. Restoration of hepatic miR-592 could improve glucose and lipid metabolism in obese mice.

Recent studies have reported its cardioprotective effect in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertensive rats. Nevertheless, its beneficial role has not been investigated in the setting of GCs excess-induced insulin resistance. This study aimed to investigate the possible protective potential and the plausible mechanisms of pretreatment with PCA against GCs-induced insulin resistance, liver steatosis and vascular dysfunction. Insulin resistance was induced in male Wistar rats by a 7-day treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) (1 mg/kg/day, i.p.). PCA (50, 100 mg/kg/day, orally) was started 7 days before DEX administration and continued during the test period. PCA significantly and dose-dependently attenuated DEX-induced a) glucose intolerance (↓ AUC), b) hyperglycemia (↓ fasting blood glucose), c) impaired insulin sensitivity [↓fasting plasma insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index)] and d) dyslipidemia (↓total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). PCA mitigated DEX-induced liver steatosis with associated reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Moreover, PCA ameliorated DEX-induced vascular dysfunction and enhanced ACh-induced relaxation in aortic rings. The metabolic ameliorating effects of PCA might be attributed to the enhanced insulin signaling in soleus muscles (↑AKT phosphorylation) and mitigating  (↓ hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). The vasculoprotective effect of PCA might be related to its ability to restore normal mRNA expression of [endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4)]. PCA restored normal oxidative balance [↓ oxidant species, malondialdehyde (MDA) and (↑ antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD)]. The findings herein reveal for the first time that PCA may be taken as a supplement with GCs to limit their metabolic and vascular side effects through its hypoglycemic, insulin-sensitizing, hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

A series of ADME studies in rats, lactating goats and beef cattle was performed. 3-NOP was entirely absorbed from the GIT of rats: approximately 75% of the administered 3-NOP was eliminated as carbon dioxide via exhalation and approximately 20% were excreted via urine. 3-NOP is oxidized to 3-nitrooxypropionic  (NOPA) which is then hydrolyzed to 3-hydroxypropionic  (HPA) and inorganic nitrate, the major rat plasma metabolites. NOPA is also a plasma metabolite in beef. The metabolism of 3-NOP is fast as indicated by the negligible amounts of 3-NOP found in rat plasma 2 h after dosing. HPA is a naturally occurring metabolite. It is either metabolized into carbon dioxide and acetyl-CoA or into propanoyl-CoA, the latter serves as substrate for .  is very prominent in lactating ruminants which use propanoyl-CoA as their main carbon source. Thus, the formation of lactose from 3-NOP by lactating goats is not unexpected. Lactose was the major metabolite of 3-NOP in the aqueous phase of milk. The incorporation of 3-NOP into endogenous metabolism makes it difficult to derive a marker residue, however, conservative risk assessment could be based on the measured radioactivity in tissues.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Results showed that (-)-HCA decreased triglyceride content and lipid droplet counts, while these effects induced by (-)-HCA were reversed in chicken embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. (-)-HCA decreased malic enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty  synthase, and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c mRNA level, while increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α (PPARα) mRNA level; and the action of (-)-HCA on lipid metabolism factors had completely eliminated in embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. Chicken embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2 had eliminated the increasing of serum glucose and hepatic glycogen content induced by (-)-HCA. (-)-HCA decreased phosphofructokinase-1 and increased G6P, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase mRNA level in chicken embryos. Similarly, the effect of (-)-HCA on these key enzyme mRNA level was reversed in embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. Furthermore, (-)-HCA increased PPAR-γ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), PPARα, hepatic nuclear factor-4A, PEPCK, and CPT1A protein level, and these actions of (-)-HCA disappeared in embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. These results indicated that (-)-HCA reduced fat accumulation and accelerated  via activation of PGC-1α signaling pathway, and these effects of (-)-HCA might associate with the increasing of ALDH3A2 expression level in chicken embryos.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539192>Capsaicin Improves Glucose Tolerance and Insulin Sensitivity Through Modulation of the Gut Microbiota-Bile -FXR Axis in Type 2 Diabetic db/db Mice.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have linked dietary capsaicin (CAP) intake to improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.Type 2 diabetic db/db mice are fed a chow diet with or without CAP treatment for 8 weeks. CAP administration markedly improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity through decreasing  and increasing glycogen synthesis in the liver. Furthermore, CAP inhibits the increase in abundance of the genus Lactobacillus and its bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity compared with levels in chow-fed mice, thereby leading to the accumulation of tauro-β-muricholic  (TβMCA), a natural antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) that is involved in the regulation of BA and glucose metabolism. CAP-induced suppression of enterohepatic FXR-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signaling contributes to the increased BA pool size, followed by increases in the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and hepatic BA synthesis. Additionally, depleting gut microbiota by antibiotics administration abolishes the beneficial effects of CAP on BA metabolism and glucose homeostasis.CAP-induced improvements in BA and glucose metabolism are partially mediated by the gut microbiota-BA-enterohepatic FXR axis in db/db mice.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we show that region-specific neuronal vulnerability is a substrate-driven response in astrocytes. Glucose is low in HdhQ(150/150) animals, and astrocytes in each brain region adapt by metabolically reprogramming their mitochondria to use endogenous, non-glycolytic metabolites as an alternative fuel. Each region is characterized by distinct metabolic pools, and astrocytes adapt accordingly. The vulnerable striatum is enriched in fatty , and mitochondria reprogram by oxidizing them as an energy source but at the cost of escalating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage. The cerebellum is replete with amino , which are precursors for glucose regeneration through the pentose phosphate shunt or  pathways. ROS is not elevated, and this region sustains little damage. While mhtt expression imposes disease stress throughout the brain, sensitivity or resistance arises from an adaptive stress response, which is inherently region specific. Metabolic reprogramming may have relevance to other diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Its acute toxic effects on zebrafish and freshwater algae have been reported in our previous studies. To further investigate its chronic toxic effects to aquatic organisms, adult zebrafish were exposed for 28 days to a series of environmentally relevant boscalid concentrations in this study. Growth indicators and histopathology were determined in this study. Results indicated that boscalid inhibited the growth of zebrafish and induced damage in the kidneys and liver. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as the key pathways of energy metabolism in growth of zebrafish were also investigated. Results showed boscalid caused an increase in the activity of hexokinase (HK), the content of glycogen, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and insulin (INS) in liver and a decrease in blood glucose content and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Boscalid reduced the total content of triacylglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (TC) and the activity of fatty  synthase (FAS) and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) in the liver. Correspondingly, expression of the genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in liver and intestine was affected by boscalid, especially in the significant upregulation of G6Pase and pparα and downregulation of SGLT-1 and AMY. Results suggested that boscalid could affect carbohydrate metabolism of adult zebrafish via regulation of  and glycolysis at 0.1 mg/L. Moreover, boscalid might induce an increase in β-oxidation and a decrease in lipid synthesis at 0.01 mg/L. In conclusion, our study identified that carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are the possible biological pathways that mediate boscalid-induced developmental effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to improve salinity resistance in sesame, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive response to salinity stress.In the present study, two contrasting sesame genotypes differing in salt tolerance were used to decipher the adaptive responses to salt stress based on morphological, transcriptome and metabolome characterizations. Morphological results indicated that under salt stress, the salt-tolerant (ST) genotype has enhanced capacity to withstand salinity stress, higher seed germination rate and plant survival rate, as well as better growth rate than the salt-sensitive genotype. Transcriptome analysis revealed strongly induced salt-responsive genes in sesame mainly related to amino  metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, and oxidation-reduction process. Especially, several pathways were preferably enriched with differentially expressed genes in ST genotype, including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, glycolysis/, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism. Metabolome profiling under salt stress showed a higher accumulation degree of metabolites involved in stress tolerance in ST, and further highlighted that the amino  metabolism, and sucrose and raffinose family oligosaccharides metabolism were enhanced in ST.These findings suggest that the candidate genes and metabolites involved in crucial biological pathways may regulate salt tolerance of sesame, and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of sesame to salt stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096578>Dietary Supplementation of Vine Tea Ameliorates Glucose and Lipid Metabolic Disorder via Akt Signaling Pathway in Diabetic Rats.</a></h1><p>A traditional Chinese tea with many pharmacological effects, vine tea (VT) is considered a potential dietary supplement to improve type 2 diabetes (T2D). To investigate the effect and mechanism of VT on glucose and lipid metabolic disorders in T2D rats, Wistar rats fed a normal diet served as the normal control, while rats fed a high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2D were divided into three groups: The model group (MOD); the positive control group (MET, metformin at 200 mg/kg/d); and the VT-treated group (VT500, allowed to freely drink 500 mg/L VT). After four weeks of intervention, biochemical metrics indicated that VT significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia in T2D rats. Metabolomics research indicated that VT regulated the levels of metabolites closely related to glucose and lipid metabolism and promoted glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, VT had a significant influence on the expression of key genes involved in the Akt signaling pathway, inhibited  through the Akt/Foxo1/Pck2 signaling pathway, and reduced fatty  synthesis via the SREBP1c/Fasn signaling pathways.

These filarial nematodes have evolved an obligate mutualistic association with an intracellular bacterium, Wolbachia, a symbiont that is essential for the successful development, reproduction, and survival of adult filarial worms. Elimination of the bacteria causes adult worms to die, making Wolbachia a primary target for developing new interventional tools to combat filariases. To further explore Wolbachia as a promising indirect macrofilaricidal drug target, the essential cellular processes that define the symbiotic Wolbachia-host interactions need to be identified. Genomic analyses revealed that while filarial nematodes encode all the enzymes necessary for glycolysis, Wolbachia does not encode the genes for three glycolytic enzymes: hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. These enzymes are necessary for converting glucose into pyruvate. Wolbachia, however, has the full complement of genes required for  starting with pyruvate, and for energy metabolism via the tricarboxylic  cycle. Therefore, we hypothesized that Wolbachia might depend on host glycolysis to maintain a mutualistic association with their parasitic host. We did conditional experiments in vitro that confirmed that glycolysis and its end-product, pyruvate, sustain this symbiotic relationship. Analysis of alternative sources of pyruvate within the worm indicated that the filarial lactate dehydrogenase could also regulate the local intracellular concentration of pyruvate in proximity to Wolbachia and thus help control bacterial growth via molecular interactions with the bacteria. Lastly, we have shown that the parasite's pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that performs the last step in glycolysis, could be a potential novel anti-filarial drug target. Establishing that glycolysis is an essential component of symbiosis in filarial worms could have a broader impact on research focused on other intracellular bacteria-host interactions where the role of glycolysis in supporting intracellular survival of bacteria has been reported.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649547>Mitophagy in Hepatic Insulin Resistance: Therapeutic Potential and Concerns.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by central obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic diseases. It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty  accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased , lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty  β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty . Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty  oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty  accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30985866>Adipose tissue proteomic analysis in ketotic or healthy Holstein cows in early lactation.</a></h1><p>Ketosis is a major metabolic disorder of high-yielding dairy cows during the transition period. Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on 5 healthy and 5 ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P-values < 0.05 and fold changes >1.5 or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid and amino  metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino  and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by Western blot and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α (PDE1α), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1), 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK), were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 (PLIN1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and Regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits  and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550253>A mitochondria-targeted fatty  analogue influences hepatic glucose metabolism and reduces the plasma insulin/glucose ratio in male Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>A fatty  analogue, 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic  (1-triple TTA), was previously shown to have hypolipidemic effects in rats by targeting mitochondrial activity predominantly in liver. This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and liver carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7 liver cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and fatty  oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in , and Hnf4A, a regulator of . Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty  oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty  analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of . This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty  oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927757>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency presented with complex febrile convulsion.</a></h1><p>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism affecting  caused by FBP1 gene mutations. It could be more fatal to infants and children when glycogen reserves are insufficient. A 4-year-old girl was admitted with complex febrile convulsion. Initial laboratory results showed hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperlactatemia. Plasma amino  and urine organic  analyses showed increased levels of alanine and tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates. However, she had similar clinical features, including confusion under severe hypoglycemia, two additional times over 6 months. Correct diagnosis could not be made because of nonspecific symptoms, and mitochondrial disorder was initially suspected. Clinical exome sequencing was performed, and compound heterozygous mutations of c.960_961insG and c.490G>A (p. Ser321ValfsTer13 and p. Gly164Ser) in the FBP1 gene were identified. This is the first Korean pediatric case of FBPase deficiency that initially presented with neurologic clinical features. Despite its very low prevalence in Far-East Asian countries, FBPase deficiency should be considered in children with repeated clinical features of metabolic acidosis with hypoglycemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253511>Heterologous expression and functional analysis of the F-box protein Ucc1 from other yeast species in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in metabolic regulation. In a previous study, we reported that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when glucose is available, the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex targets citrate synthase 2 (Cit2) for proteasomal degradation, thereby suppressing the glyoxylate cycle, an anabolic pathway that replenishes the TCA cycle with succinate for the activation of . However, the roles of Ucc1 in other yeast species remain unclear. Here, we cloned orthologs of the F-box protein Ucc1 from Zygosaccharomyces bailii, an aggressive food spoilage microorganism that is the most acetic -tolerant yeast species, and Candida glabrata, an emerging fungal pathogen. These orthologs were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and their activities were tested genetically and biochemically. The results showed that Z. bailii Ucc1 rescued the ucc1Δ phenotype, suggesting the existence of a similar mechanism regulating the glyoxylate cycle in Z. bailii. By contrast, C. glabrata Ucc1 did not complement the ucc1Δ phenotype or exhibit a dominant negative effect on Ucc1. These results suggest the importance of analysing the regulatory mechanisms of glyoxylate cycle in a broad range of yeast species.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The present study used a combination of laser capture microdissection and RNAseq to characterize murine gene expression in nonsteatotic, microsteatotic, and macrosteatotic compartments collected from the same liver. The data indicate that microvesicular steatosis is intermediate to macrovesicular steatosis, showing a widespread and pronounced metabolic gene regulation of lipid export, , and de novo lipogenesis. Key enzymes, such as fatty  synthase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase as well as apolipoprotein C-III, were identified to show clear expression differences between the compartments. Furthermore, increased expression of lipid particle formation genes provided a molecular description of the fusion of microsteatotic lipid compartments to produce macrosteatotic cells with a single enlarged lipid droplet.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082125>Plasma Glucose.</a></h1><p>Glucose is a monosaccharide sugar that our bodies obtain from food and use as our principal energy source. The basic molecular form of glucose is C6H12O6. Glucose enters our body in several different forms such as fructose and galactose, which are monosaccharides and isomers of glucose. These monosaccharides can combine to form disaccharides such as lactose and sucrose. Larger polymers of glucose are the polysaccharide forms of glucose which, include starch, glycogen, and cellulose. Our bodies must break down complex sugars into glucose, fructose, and galactose for absorption and metabolism. In addition to obtaining glucose from the diet, our liver and kidneys are capable of producing glucose through a process called , and particularly, our liver and muscles can liberate glucose from glycogen stores through glycogenolysis. Within our bodies, glucose is the starting substrate for many vital processes such as glycolysis, citric  cycle, Cori cycle, glycogenesis, hexose-monophosphate (HMP) shunt, and fatty  synthesis.[1]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30725767>Physiology, Glucagon.</a></h1><p>The recognition of glucagon as a hormone followed the pioneering work of Unger reporting on its quantitation by radioimmunoassay.[1] Unger first reported the glycogenolytic, gluconeogenic and ketogenic effects of glucagon in dogs.[2] Glucagon, manufactured by the alpha cells in the pancreatic islets, stimulates glucose production through glycogenolysis and . The proglucagon gene encodes it, and the proglucagon peptide is processed by prohormone convertase-2 (PC2) to produce the 29-amino  mature peptide. Enhancement of glucagon transcription is by amino  and cyclic AMP in the pancreas and intestinal cells, and Wnt signaling in the intestine.[3] Elevated plasma concentrations of glucagon and hyperglucagonemia contribute to the hyperglycemia of diabetes. Hyperglucagonemia also occurs in other clinical conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, glucagon-producing tumors and after gastric bypass surgery.[4] In this brief review, we cover the relevant biochemistry, physiology, measurement and clinical relevance of glucagon.Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449538>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a risk factor for large-for-gestational-age birthweight.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a well-recognized hepatic manifestation of metabolic disease in adults and has been associated with the development of gestational diabetes (GDM). Hepatic insulin resistance can result in increased release of glucose (from ) and free fatty  (due to enhanced lipolysis), which can lead in turn to fetal overgrowth. However, the relationship between maternal metabolic factors (such as circulating levels of triglycerides, free fatty  [FFA], or adipokines) and excessive fetal birthweight in NAFLD has not been carefully examined. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and the subsequent risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birthweight.Singleton nondiabetic pregnant women were evaluated for the presence of fatty liver at 10-14 weeks of gestation by abdominal ultrasound. The degree of fatty liver was classified as Grade 0-3 steatosis. At the time of liver ultrasound, maternal blood was taken after fasting and measured for adiponectin and FFA. LGA was defined as birthweight >90th percentile for gestational age.A total of 623 women were included in the analysis. The frequency of LGA was 10.9% (68/623), and the frequency of NAFLD was 18.9%. The risk of LGA increased significantly in patients with Grade 2-3 steatosis in the first trimester. The relationship between Grade 2-3 steatosis and LGA remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM, and maternal serum triglyceride levels. The concentration of maternal blood adiponectin at 10-14 weeks was significantly lower in cases with LGA than non-LGA, but the maternal blood FFA concentrations were not different between the groups.The presence of Grade 2-3 steatosis on ultrasound in early pregnancy was associated with the increased risk of delivering an LGA infant, even after adjustment for multiple confounding factors including GDM.

To identify biomarkers and unravel mechanisms of AT deposition, we combined gel-based and gel-free methods and we mined the differential proteome of the longissimus thoracis from cows differing by two levels of both carcass and muscular adiposities (CMA). We identified 47 proteins with abundances that varied according to CMA. We listed 26 new candidate biomarkers of marbling and confirmed 21 proteins already proposed in the literature. Seven proteins involved in glycolysis or  were the least abundant, while 14 proteins related to oxidative metabolism, slow-type muscle or retinoic  metabolism were the most abundant in the high adiposity group. We highlighted eight proteins as differentially abundant and correlated with both CMA, thereby providing the first list of putative biomarkers of carcass adiposity. These proteins would be targeted in future studies aiming to categorize adiposity in cattle.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Metabolic composition of the human placenta could be affected by the presence of pathological states such as β-thalassemia. The aim of our study was to describe metabolic changes in chorionic villi samples of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia compared to a control group by applying a metabolomics approach.Chorionic villi samples were differentiated according to the genetic diagnosis of β-thalassemia: control (Group 1,  = 27); heterozygous (Group 2,  = 7); homozygous (Group 3,  = 7). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect the metabolic composition of the samples. Subsequently, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis was performed. The discriminant metabolites were used to identify the altered pathways.Supervised multivariate models were devised to compare the groups. The model resulting from the comparison between Group 1 and Group 3 was the most significant. Discriminant metabolites were identified, and the most altered pathways were as follows: pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), arachidonic  metabolism, glycolysis, and , suggesting the presence of an energetic shift toward the PPP and the presence of oxidative stress in β-thalassemia chorionic villi samples.The metabolomics approach identified a specific metabolic fingerprint in chorionic villi of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959128>Zbtb7c is a critical gluconeogenic transcription factor that induces glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenylpyruvate carboxykinase 1 genes expression during mice fasting.</a></h1><p> is essential for blood glucose homeostasis during fasting and is regulated by various enzymes, which are encoded by gluconeogenic genes. Those genes are controlled by various transcription factors. Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 7c (Zbtb7c, also called Kr-pok) is a BTB-POZ family transcription factor with proto-oncogenic activity. Previous findings have indicated that Zbtb7c is involved in the regulation of fatty  biosynthesis, suggesting an involvement also in primary metabolism. We found here that fasting induced Zbtb7c expression in the mouse liver and in primary liver hepatocytes. We also observed that Zbtb7c-knockout mice have decreased blood glucose levels, so we investigated whether Zbtb7c plays a role in . Indeed, differential gene expression analysis of Zbtb7c-knockout versus wild type mouse livers showed downregulated transcription of gluconeogenic genes encoding the glucose 6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1), while Zbtb7c expression upregulated these two genes, under fasting conditions. Mechanistically, we found that when complexed with histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3), Zbtb7c binds insulin response elements (IREs) within the G6pc and Pck1 promoters. Moreover, complexed Zbtb7c deacetylated forkhead box O1 (Foxo1), thereby increasing Foxo1 binding to the G6pc and Pck1 IREs, resulting in their transcriptional activation. These results demonstrate Zbtb7c to be a crucial metabolic regulator of blood glucose homeostasis, during mammalian fasting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the liver, parenchymal cells (i.e., mainly hepatocytes) utilize autophagy to provide amino , glucose, and free fatty  as sources of energy and biosynthesis functions, but also for recycling and controlling organelles such as mitochondria. Non-parenchymal cells of the liver, including endothelial cells, macrophages (Kupffer cells), and hepatic stellate cells (HSC), also employ autophagy, either for maintaining cellular homeostasis (macrophages, endothelium) or for providing energy for their activation (stellate cells). In hepatocytes, autophagy contributes to essential homeostatic functions (e.g., , glycogenolysis, fatty  oxidation), but is also implicated in diseases. For instance, storage disorders (alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease), metabolic (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), and toxic (alcohol) liver diseases may benefit from augmenting autophagy in hepatocytes. In hepatic fibrosis, autophagy has been implicated in the fibrogenic activation of HSC to collagen-producing myofibroblasts. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), autophagy may contribute to tumor surveillance as well as invasiveness, indicating a dual and stage-dependent function in cancer. As many drugs directly or indirectly modulate autophagy, it is intriguing to investigate autophagy-targeting, possibly even cell type-directed strategies for the treatment of hereditary liver diseases, NASH, fibrosis, and HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616913>Analysis of the Uterine Lumen in Fertility-Classified Heifers: I. Glucose, Prostaglandins and Lipids.</a></h1><p>Survival and growth of the bovine conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) is dependent on endometrial secretions or histotroph found in the uterine lumen. Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with glycolysis and  were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling, arachidonic  metabolism, and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main lipid class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several lipid metabolism genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty  were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

Fish were fed six practical diets with graded leucine levels ranging from 0.90 to 2.94% of dry basis for 8 weeks. The trial results showed that, compared to the control group (0.90%), optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) resulted in the up-regulation of mRNA expression related to insulin signaling pathway, including target of rapamycin (TOR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt). However, an excessive leucine level (2.94%) led to protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) overexpression and inhibited TOR, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt mRNA expressions. The protein level of TOR, S6K1, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt showed a similar result with mRNA level of these genes. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) significantly improved plasma insulin content, while high level of leucine showed an inhibiting phenomenon. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) could reduce plasma glucose by enhancing the ability of glycometabolism including improving glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), glucokinase (GK) expressions and down-regulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression. While an excessive leucine level (2.94%) resulted in high plasma glucose by inhibiting the ability of glycometabolism including lowering GLUT2 and GK expressions, and improving glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and PEPCK expressions. The relative expressions of pyruvate kinase (PK) and glycogen synthase (GS) were not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. Dietary leucine level of 1.33% could improve plasma triglyceride content (TG) by enhancing lipogenesis including improving sterol-response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) expressions compared to the control group (0.90%). Total cholesterol (TC) was not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. The present results indicate that optimal leucine level could improve glycolysis and fatty  synthesis through improving insulin sensitivity in juvenile blunt snout bream. However, excessive dietary leucine level resulted in high plasma glucose, which led to insulin resistance by inhibiting the gene expressions of insulin signaling pathway and activating -related gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089930>Metabolomic profile of diabetic retinopathy: a GC-TOFMS-based approach using vitreous and aqueous humor.</a></h1><p>To identify the potential metabolite markers in diabetic retinopathy (DR) by using gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS).GC-TOFMS spectra were acquired from vitreous and aqueous humor (AH) samples of patients with DR and non-diabetic participants. Comparative analysis was used to elucidate the distinct metabolites of DR. Metabolic pathway was employed to explicate the metabolic reprogramming pathways involved in DR. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic analyses were carried out to select and validate the biomarker metabolites and establish a therapeutic model.Comparative analysis showed a clear separation between disease and control groups. Eight differentiating metabolites from AH and 15 differentiating metabolites from vitreous were highlighted. Out of these 23 metabolites, 11 novel metabolites have not been detected previously. Pathway analysis identified nine pathways (three in AH and six in vitreous) as the major disturbed pathways associated with DR. The abnormal of , ascorbate-aldarate metabolism, valine-leucine-isoleucine biosynthesis, and arginine-proline metabolism might weigh the most in the development of DR.

Additional research efforts suggest that sustained PXR activation exacerbates the development of fatty liver disease. Additional metabolic effects of PXR activation in liver are the inhibition of fatty  oxidation and . The identification of non-toxic and selective PXR antagonists is therefore of current research interest. Inhibition of PXR should decrease adverse effects, improve therapeutic effectiveness, and advance clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, fatty liver, and diabetes.

In this study, we comparatively analyzed the bovine liver transcriptome of dairy (Polish Holstein Friesian (HF);  = 6), beef (Hereford;  = 6), and dual purpose (Polish-Red;  = 6) cattle breeds. This study identified 895, 338, and 571 significant ( < 0.01) differentially expressed (DE) gene-transcripts represented as 745, 265, and 498 hepatic DE genes through the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red breeds comparisons, respectively. By combining all breeds comparisons, 75 hepatic DE genes ( < 0.01) were identified as commonly shared among all the three breed comparisons; 70, 160, and 38 hepatic DE genes were commonly shared between the following comparisons: (i) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Hereford; (ii) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red; and (iii) Polish-HF versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red, respectively. A total of 440, 82, and 225 hepatic DE genes were uniquely observed for the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-Red versus Polish-HF comparisons, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified top-ranked enriched GO terms ( < 0.01) including 17, 16, and 31 functional groups and 151, 61, and 140 gene functions that were DE in all three breed liver transcriptome comparisons. Gene network analysis identified several potential metabolic pathways involved in glutamine family amino-, triglyceride synthesis, , p38MAPK cascade regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis (Polish-Red versus Hereford); IGF-receptor signaling, catecholamine transport, lipoprotein lipase, tyrosine kinase binding receptor (Polish-HF versus Hereford), and PGF-receptor binding, (Polish-HF versus Polish-Red).

Basal insulin during fasting inhibits hepatic  and glycogenolysis, whereas postprandial insulin peaks stimulate glycogen synthesis. The molecular consequences of chronic insulin deficiency for the liver have not been studied systematically.We analyzed liver samples of a genetically diabetic pig model (MIDY) and of wild-type (WT) littermate controls by RNA sequencing, proteomics, and targeted metabolomics/lipidomics.Cross-omics analyses revealed increased activities in amino  metabolism, oxidation of fatty , ketogenesis, and  in the MIDY samples. In particular, the concentrations of the ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) and of retinol dehydrogenase 16 (RDH16), which catalyzes the first step in retinoic  biogenesis, were highly increased. Accordingly, elevated levels of retinoic , which stimulates the expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), were measured in the MIDY samples. In contrast, pathways related to extracellular matrix and inflammation/pathogen defense response were less active than in the WT samples.The first multi-omics study of a clinically relevant diabetic large animal model revealed molecular signatures and key drivers of functional alterations of the liver in insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus.

To determine its role in the diabetic kidney, type 1 diabetic Akita mice with tubular NHE3 knockdown [Pax8-Cre; NHE3-knockout (KO) mice] were generated. NHE3-KO mice had higher urine pH, more bicarbonaturia, and compensating increases in renal mRNA expression for genes associated with generation of ammonium, bicarbonate, and glucose (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) in proximal tubules and H and ammonia secretion and glycolysis in distal tubules. This left blood pH and bicarbonate unaffected in nondiabetic and diabetic NHE3-KO versus wild-type mice but was associated with renal upregulation of proinflammatory markers. Higher renal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression in NHE3-KO mice was associated with lower Na-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2 and higher SGLT1 expression, indicating a downward tubular shift in Na and glucose reabsorption. NHE3-KO was associated with lesser kidney weight and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) independent of diabetes and prevented diabetes-associated albuminuria. NHE3-KO, however, did not attenuate hyperglycemia or prevent diabetes from increasing kidney weight and GFR. Higher renal  may explain similar hyperglycemia despite lower SGLT2 expression and higher glucosuria in diabetic NHE3-KO versus wild-type mice; stronger SGLT1 engagement could have affected kidney weight and GFR responses. Chronic kidney disease in humans is associated with reduced urinary excretion of metabolites of branched-chain amino  and the tricarboxylic  cycle, a pattern mimicked in diabetic wild-type mice. This pattern was reversed in nondiabetic NHE3-KO mice, possibly reflecting branched-chain amino  use for ammoniagenesis and tricarboxylic  cycle upregulation to support formation of ammonia, bicarbonate, and glucose in proximal tubule. NHE3-KO, however, did not prevent the diabetes-induced urinary downregulation in these metabolites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337282>A Liver-Specific Thyromimetic, VK2809, Decreases Hepatosteatosis in Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia.</a></h1><p> Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD Ia), also known as von Gierke disease, is the most common glycogen storage disorder. It is caused by the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. The accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate leads to increased glycogen and triglyceride levels in the liver. Patients with GSD Ia can develop steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and increased risk for hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. We previously showed that animal models of GSD Ia had defective autophagy and dysfunctional mitochondria. In this study, we examined the effect of VK2809, a liver-specific thyroid hormone receptor β agonist, on hepatic steatosis, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis in a mouse model of GSD Ia.  -deficient (GSD Ia) mice were treated with VK2809 or vehicle control by daily intraperitoneal injection for four days. The hepatic triglyceride and glycogen were determined by biochemical assays. Autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis were measured by Western blotting for key autophagy and mitochondrial markers.  VK2809 treatment decreased hepatic mass and triglyceride content in GSD Ia mice. VK2809 stimulated hepatic autophagic flux as evidenced by increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3B-II), decreased p62 protein levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, enhancement of protein levels of ATG5-ATG12, and increased lysosomal protein expression. VK2809 also increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1α) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (), as well as mitochondrial biogenesis to promote mitochondrial β-oxidation.  In summary, VK2809 treatment decreased hepatic triglyceride levels in GSD Ia mice through its simultaneous restoration of autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and β-oxidation of fatty .

Metabolic alterations in the liver due to fructose intake have been reported in many studies, but the effect of fructose administration on hepatic  is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of fructose administration on fasting-induced hepatic . C57BL/6J mice were administered fructose solution after 14 h of fasting and plasma insulin, glucose, free fatty , and ketone bodies were analysed. We also measured phosphorylated AKT and forkhead box O (FoxO) 1 protein levels and gene expression related to  in the liver. Furthermore, we measured glucose production from pyruvate after fructose administration. Glucose-administered mice were used as controls. Fructose administration enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in the liver, without increase of blood insulin levels. Blood free fatty  and ketone bodies concentrations were as high as those in the fasting group after fructose administration, suggesting that insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis did not occur in mice administered with fructose. Fructose also enhanced phosphorylation of FoxO1 and suppressed gluconeogenic gene expression, glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and glucose production from pyruvate. The present study suggests that acute fructose administration suppresses fasting-induced hepatic  in an insulin-independent manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552709>FOXN3 controls liver glucose metabolism by regulating gluconeogenic substrate selection.</a></h1><p>The FOXN3 gene locus is associated with fasting blood glucose levels in non-diabetic human population genetic studies. The blood glucose-modifying variation within this gene regulates the abundance of both FOXN3 protein and transcript in primary human hepatocytes, with the hyperglycemia risk allele causing increases in both FOXN3 protein and transcript. Using transgenic and knock-out zebrafish models, we showed previously that FOXN3 is a transcriptional repressor that regulates fasting blood glucose by altering liver gene expression of MYC, a  master transcriptional regulator of glucose utilization, and by modulating pancreatic α cell mass and function through an unknown mechanism. Since homozygous Foxn3 null mice die perinatally, and heterozygous carries of the null allele are smaller than wild-type siblings, we examine the metabolic effects of decreasing mouse liver Foxn3 expression in adult life, performing dynamic endocrine tests not feasible in adult zebrafish. Fasting glucose, glucagon, and insulin; and dynamic responses to glucose, insulin, pyruvate, glutamine, and glucagon were measured. Gluconeogenic and amino  catabolic gene expression was examined in livers, as well. Knocking down liver Foxn3 expression via transduction with adeno-associated virus serotype 8 particles encoding a short hairpin RNA targeting Fonx3 decreases fasting glucose and increases Myc expression, without altering fasting glucagon or fasting insulin. Liver Foxn3 knock-down confers increases glucose tolerance, has no effect on insulin tolerance or response to glucagon challenge, blunts pyruvate and glutamine tolerance, and modulates expression of amino  transporters and catabolic enzymes. We conclude that liver Foxn3 regulates substrate selection for .© 2019 The Authors.

Owing to its irreversible nature, protein degradation is a highly selective process to avoid irreparable breakdown of cellular constituents, thereby disrupting cellular stability, integrity and signalling. The majority of intracellular proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a multi-enzyme process that involves the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate protein and its recognition and degradation by the core multicomponent proteolytic complex of the UPS, the proteasome. In addition to labelling misfolded, damaged, aggregation-prone and intact but unneeded proteins for proteasomal degradation, ubiquitylation regulates a multitude of cellular processes, such as transcription, translation, endocytosis, and receptor activity and subcellular localization. In addition, the proteasome generates peptides for antigen presentation in the immune system and for further degradation by peptidases to provide amino  for protein biosynthesis and . Alterations of the UPS or of protein substrates that render them more or less susceptible to degradation are responsible for disorders associated with renal cell dysfunction. In this Review, we provide insight into the elegant and complex nature of UPS-mediated proteostasis and focus on its established and potential roles in renal cell physiology and pathophysiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714432>Systemic oscillator-driven and nutrient-responsive hormonal regulation of daily expression rhythms for gluconeogenic enzyme genes in the mouse liver.</a></h1><p> is de novo glucose synthesis from substrates such as amino  and is vital when glucose is lacking in the diurnal nutritional fluctuation. Accordingly, genes for hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes exhibit daily expression rhythms, whose detailed regulations under nutritional variations remain elusive. As a first step, we performed general systematic characterization of daily expression profiles of gluconeogenic enzyme genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), cytosolic form (Pck1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), catalytic subunit (G6pc), and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (Tat) in the mouse liver. On a standard diet fed ad libitum, mRNA levels of these genes showed robust daily rhythms with a peak or an elevation phase during the late sleep-fasting period in the diurnal feeding/fasting (wake/sleep) cycle. The rhythmicity was preserved in constant darkness, modulated with prolonged fasting, attenuated by Clock mutation, and entrained to varied photoperiods and time-restricted feedings. These results are concordant with the notion that gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of the intrinsic circadian oscillator, which is entrained by the light/dark cycle, and which in turn entrains the feeding/fasting cycle and also drives systemic signaling pathways such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. On the other hand, time-restricted feedings also showed that the ingestion schedule, when separated from the light/dark cycle, can serve as an independent entrainer to daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes. Moreover, nutritional changes dramatically modified expression profiles of the genes. In addition to prolonged fasting, a high-fat diet and a high-carbohydrate (no-protein) diet caused modification of daily expression rhythms of the genes, with characteristic changes in profiles of glucoregulatory hormones such as corticosterone, glucagon, and insulin, as well as their modulators including ghrelin, leptin, resistin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Remarkably, high-protein (60% casein or soy-protein) diets activated the gluconeogenic enzyme genes atypically during the wake-feeding period, with paradoxical up-regulation of glucagon, which frequently formed correlation networks with other humoral factors. Based on these results, we propose that daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of systemic oscillator-driven and nutrient-responsive hormones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30642338>Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli carrying the hybrid acetone-biosynthesis pathway for efficient acetone biosynthesis from acetate.</a></h1><p>The shortage of food based feedstocks has been one of the stumbling blocks in industrial biomanufacturing. The acetone bioproduction from the traditional acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation is limited by the non-specificity of products and competitive utilization of food-based substrates. Using genetically modified Escherichia coli to produce acetone as sole product from the cost-effective non-food based substrates showed great potential to overcome these problems.A novel acetone biosynthetic pathway were constructed based on genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum (thlA encoding for thiolase, adc encoding for acetoacetate decarboxylase, ctfAB encoding for coenzyme A transferase) and Escherichia coli MG1655 (atoB encoding acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, atoDA encoding for acetyl-CoA: acetoacetyl-CoA transferase subunit α and β). Among these constructs, one recombinant MG1655 derivative containing the hybrid pathway consisting of thlA, atoDA, and adc, produced the highest level of acetone from acetate. Reducing the  pathway had little effect on acetone production, while blocking the TCA cycle by knocking out the icdA gene enhanced the yield of acetone significantly. As a result, acetone concentration increased up to 113.18 mM in 24 h by the resting cell culture coupling with gas-stripping methods.An engineered E. coli strain with optimized hybrid acetone biosynthetic pathway can utilize acetate as substrate efficiently to synthesize acetone without other non-gas byproducts. It provides a potential method for industrial biomanufacturing of acetone by engineered E. coli strains from non-food based substrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321797>Proteomic Analysis Reveals Anti-Fibrotic Effects of Blue Light Photobiomodulation on Fibroblasts.</a></h1><p>This study was aimed at determining the effects of blue light photobiomodulation on primary adult mouse dermal fibroblasts (AMDFs) and the associated signaling pathways.Cultured AMDFs from adult C57BL/6 mice were irradiated by blue light from a light-emitting diode (wavelength = 463 ± 50 nm; irradiance = 5 mW/cm ; energy density = 4-8 J/cm ). The cells were analyzed using mass spectrometry for proteomics/phosphoproteomics, AlamarBlue assay for mitochondrial activity, time-lapse video for cell migration, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for gene expression, and immunofluorescence for protein expression.Proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis showed inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin and casein kinase 2 pathways, cell motility-related networks, and multiple metabolic processes, including carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino , /gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Functional analysis demonstrated inhibition of mitochondrial activities, cell migration, and mitosis. Expression of growth promoting insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibrosis-related genes, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and collagen type 1 ɑ2 chain diminished. Protein expression of α-smooth muscle actin, an important regulator of myofibroblast functions, was also suppressed.Low-level blue light exerted suppressive effects on AMDFs, including suppression of mitochondrial activity, metabolism, cell motility, proliferation, TGFβ1 levels, and collagen I production. Low-level blue light can be a potential treatment for the prevention and reduction of tissue fibrosis, such as hypertrophic scar and keloids. Lasers Surg.

With a 5-week oral administration of GXG, the levels of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated serum protein and serum insulin in T2D mice were decreased, and the glucose tolerance and the insulin sensitivity were improved. The histological analysis, the periodic -schiff staining and the immunofluorescence staining of insulin, glucagon and apoptosis showed that the hypoglycemic effect of GXG was related to the improvement of pancreatic β-cell quantity and function and the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. Western blot analysis indicated that the up-regulated IRS1-PI3K-Akt phosphorylation followed by the down-regulated FoxO1/GSK 3β phosphorylation contributed to the enhanced glycogen synthesis and the decreased  by GXG, suggesting that the response of insulin-mediated IRS1-PI3K-Akt-FoxO1/GSK 3β signaling to GXG might be the required mechanism for GXG-ameliorated development of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Goats were fasted for 24 h followed by a 9-h intravenous infusion of an AA mixture plus glucose. Milk yield was recorded and samples were taken in h 2 to 8 of the infusion period, and mammary biopsy was performed in the last hour. Treatments were graded removal of Met from the infused AA mixture to achieve Met content in the infusate of 100 (complete), 60, 30, or 0% of that in casein. Graded Met removal decreased yield of milk, milk protein, and lactose linearly and tended to decrease yield of milk fat linearly. Milk protein yield decreased to 82, 78, and 69% that of complete mixture infusion, respectively, when the 60, 30, and 0% Met infusate was infused. Circulating Met decreased linearly with graded Met removal. Arterial and venous Met decreased to 36 and 23% that of complete mixture infusion, respectively, when all Met was removed out of the mixture. Concomitant with the decreased circulating concentration was a similar increase in mammary Met affinity as reflected by the linearly increased mammary Met clearance rate. The increased affinity plus the linearly increased mammary blood flow totally offset the negative effect of decreased circulating Met concentration on mammary Met uptake. The overall result was similar mammary Met uptakes across treatments ranging from 285.9 to 339.5 μmol/h. Mammary uptakes of the other AA measured were generally not affected by treatments except for a linearly decreased Thr uptake and a trend of linearly increased Glu uptake. Consistent with the behavior of an AA mainly catabolized in the liver and mainly used for protein synthesis in peripheral tissues, mammary uptake to milk output ratios of Met measured in the present study ranged from 1.25 to 1.49 and was not affected by treatments. For the other AA measured, the ratio of Thr was linearly decreased and that of Glu was linearly increased by graded Met removal. Graded Met removal linearly elevated circulating urea N and glucose concentrations, indicating enhanced whole-body catabolism of AA and hepatic . Treatments had no significant effects on circulating insulin, growth hormone, and the other hormones and metabolites measured. Phosphorylation status of eIF4E binding protein 1 tended to decrease linearly and that of p70S6k was linearly decreased by graded Met removal, indicating depressed signal in the intracellular mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. In conclusion, results of the present study indicated that the mTORC1 pathway and whole-body AA catabolism rather than mammary uptake appeared the drivers for changes in milk protein synthesis in response to varying Met supply.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, lack of complete genome, transcriptome and proteome information limits the understanding of the biology of H. flava. Here, the total RNA of H. flava was collected separately at larvae and nymph stages and analyzed with high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. The obtained data were assembled and annotated based on the near origin species in the Nr database. The functions of the unigenes were annotated and classified by seven databases, including Nr, Nt, Pfam, KOG, Swiss-Prot, GO and KEGG. A total of 61,850,967 and 79,579,368 clean reads were obtained with a data bulk of 9.28 G and 11.94 G in larvae and nymph stages, respectively. The number of unigenes was 440,896, with 48.6% of them being matched to the Nr database and 51.4% remaining unknown. Additionally, 1,776,404 SNPs were identified in the unigenes. Differential analysis revealed 80 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 56 up-regulated genes and 24 down-regulated genes in the nymph versus larvae. qPCR confirmed 4 of the 56 up-regulated genes and 4 of the down-regulated genes. KEGG analysis of the DEGs showed that aldehyde dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase, two up-regulated unigenes in nymph versus larvae, were both matched to the top three enriched pathways: "chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation", "fatty  degradation" and "glycolysis and ". This is the first report on the whole transcriptome of H. flava at larvae and nymph stages. This study contributes to the understanding of H. flava at the gene expression level in different developmental stages and provides a theoretical basis for the development of vaccines against H. flava.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The cells were divided into five groups: control, PA, PA + Rev 100 µM, PA + Rev 50 µM, and PA + Rev 20 µM. After treatment for 24 hours, mRNA and protein expression levels of  pathway-related molecules and HDAC4 were examined. Next, HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNA-HDAC4. The cells were divided into control, PA, PA + Rev 20 µM, PA + Rev 20 µM +siRNA-HDAC4 negative control, and PA + Rev 20 µM +siRNA-HDAC4 knockdown groups to determine the expression of  pathway proteins.Compared with the control group, the  pathway-related molecules, glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), were increased, and the phosphorylation of FOXO1 decreased after PA treatment. The p-HDAC4 level decreased with the increase in HDAC4 in the nucleus and the decrease in HDAC4 in the cytoplasm in the PA group. Treatment with Rev 20 µM suppressed  and promoted HDAC4 shuttling into the cytoplasm from the nucleus. However, 100 and Rev 50 µM exerted the opposite effects. Finally, after HDAC4 knockdown, the expression levels of the key  molecules, G6PC, PCK1, and FOXO1, were increased, and p-FOXO1 was decreased, indicating that  was enhanced.A low concentration of Rev inhibited  under insulin-resistance conditions via translocation of HDAC4 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137550>Deep Insight into the Transcriptome of the Single Silk Gland of .</a></h1><p>The silk gland synthesizes and secretes a large amount of protein and stores liquid silk protein at an extremely high concentration. Interestingly, silk proteins and serine protease inhibitors are orderly arranged in the silk gland lumen and cocoon shells. Silk fiber formation and the spinning mechanism have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of seven segments of the single silk gland to characterize internal changes in the silk gland during the 5th instar of mature larvae. In total, 3121 differentially expressed genes were identified in the seven segments. Genes highly expressed in the middle silk gland (MSG) were mainly involved in unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis, fatty  metabolism, apoptosis-fly, and lysosome pathways, whereas genes highly expressed in the posterior silk gland (PSG) were mainly involved in ribosome, proteasome, citrate cycle, and glycolysis/ pathways. Thus, the MSG and PSG differ greatly in energy source use and function. Further, 773 gradually upregulated genes (from PSG to MSG) were involved in energy metabolism, silk protein synthesis, and secretion, suggesting that these genes play an important role in silk fiber formation.

The HMP shunt comprises two phases viz. oxidative and nonoxidative, which provide different intermediates for the synthesis of biomolecules like nucleotides, DNA, RNA, amino , and so forth; reducing molecules for anabolism and detoxifying the reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress. The HMP shunt is significantly important in the liver, adipose tissue, erythrocytes, adrenal glands, lactating mammary glands and testes. We have researched the articles related to the HMP pathway, its metabolites and disorders related to its metabolic abnormalities. The literature for this paper was taken typically from a personal database, the Cochrane database of systemic reviews, PubMed publications, biochemistry textbooks, and electronic journals uptil date on the hexose monophosphate shunt. The HMP shunt is a tightly controlled metabolic pathway, which is also interconnected with other metabolic pathways in the body like glycolysis, , and glucuronic  depending upon the metabolic needs of the body and depending upon the biochemical demand. The HMP shunt plays a significant role in NADPH formation and in pentose sugars that are biosynthetic precursors of nucleic  and amino . Cells can be protected from highly reactive oxygen species by NADPH  . Deficiency in the hexose monophosphate pathway is linked to numerous disorders. Furthermore, it was also reported that this metabolic pathway could act as a therapeutic target to treat different types of cancers, so treatments at the molecular level could be planned by limiting the synthesis of biomolecules required for proliferating cells provided by the HMP shunt, hence, more experiments still could be carried out to find additional discoveries.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366360>Effects of a high protein diet and liver disease in an in silico model of human ammonia metabolism.</a></h1><p>After proteolysis, the majority of released amino  from dietary protein are transported to the liver for  or to peripheral tissues where they are used for protein synthesis and eventually catabolized, producing ammonia as a byproduct. High ammonia levels in the brain are a major contributor to the decreased neural function that occurs in several pathological conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy when liver urea cycle function is compromised. Therefore, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of human ammonia metabolism. The objective of this study was to predict changes in blood ammonia levels resulting from alterations in dietary protein intake, from liver disease, or from partial loss of urea cycle function.A simple mathematical model was created using MATLAB SimBiology and data from published studies. Simulations were performed and results analyzed to determine steady state changes in ammonia levels resulting from varying dietary protein intake and varying liver enzyme activity levels to simulate liver disease. As a toxicity reference, viability was measured in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells following differentiation and ammonium chloride treatment.Results from control simulations yielded steady state blood ammonia levels within normal physiological limits. Increasing dietary protein intake by 72% resulted in a 59% increase in blood ammonia levels. Simulations of liver cirrhosis increased blood ammonia levels by 41 to 130% depending upon the level of dietary protein intake. Simulations of heterozygous individuals carrying a loss of function allele of the urea cycle carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) gene resulted in more than a tripling of blood ammonia levels (from roughly 18 to 60 μM depending on dietary protein intake). The viability of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells was decreased by 14% by the addition of a slightly higher amount of ammonium chloride (90 μM).Data from the model suggest decreasing protein consumption may be one simple strategy to decrease blood ammonia levels and minimize the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy for many liver disease patients. In addition, the model suggests subjects who are known carriers of disease-causing CPS1 alleles may benefit from monitoring blood ammonia levels and limiting the level of protein intake if ammonia levels are high.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819264>PTEN influences insulin and lipid metabolism in bovine hepatocytes in vitro.</a></h1><p>Dairy cows with fatty liver or ketosis display decreased insulin sensitivity and defects in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a well-known tumor suppressor and also a negative regulator of insulin signaling and peripheral insulin sensitivity. We investigated the hypothesis that PTEN may affect the insulin pathway-mediated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in dairy cows. Adenovirus vectors that over-express and silence PTEN were constructed, and then transfected into hepatocytes isolated from calves to investigate the effect of PTEN on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. PTEN silencing increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the expression of PI3K but decreased the phosphorylation of IRS1, which increased the phosphorylation levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Increased GSK-3β phosphorylation further up-regulated expression of the key enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6-Pase) involved in . Furthermore, the expression of SREBP-1c target gene fatty  synthase (FAS) also increased significantly. We further showed that PTEN over-expression could reverse the above results. PTEN negatively regulates the enzymes involved in hepatic  and lipid synthesis, which suggests that PTEN may be a therapeutic target for ketosis and fatty liver in dairy cows.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080489>Metabolic reprogramming involving glycolysis in the hibernating brown bear skeletal muscle.</a></h1><p>In mammals, the hibernating state is characterized by biochemical adjustments, which include metabolic rate depression and a shift in the primary fuel oxidized from carbohydrates to lipids. A number of studies of hibernating species report an upregulation of the levels and/or activity of lipid oxidizing enzymes in muscles during torpor, with a concomitant downregulation for glycolytic enzymes. However, other studies provide contrasting data about the regulation of fuel utilization in skeletal muscles during hibernation. Bears hibernate with only moderate hypothermia but with a drop in metabolic rate down to ~ 25% of basal metabolism. To gain insights into how fuel metabolism is regulated in hibernating bear skeletal muscles, we examined the vastus lateralis proteome and other changes elicited in brown bears during hibernation.We show that bear muscle metabolic reorganization is in line with a suppression of ATP turnover. Regulation of muscle enzyme expression and activity, as well as of circulating metabolite profiles, highlighted a preference for lipid substrates during hibernation, although the data suggested that muscular lipid oxidation levels decreased due to metabolic rate depression. Our data also supported maintenance of muscle glycolysis that could be fuelled from liver  and mobilization of muscle glycogen stores. During hibernation, our data also suggest that carbohydrate metabolism in bear muscle, as well as protein sparing, could be controlled, in part, by actions of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  like docosahexaenoic .Our work shows that molecular mechanisms in hibernating bear skeletal muscle, which appear consistent with a hypometabolic state, likely contribute to energy and protein savings. Maintenance of glycolysis could help to sustain muscle functionality for situations such as an unexpected exit from hibernation that would require a rapid increase in ATP production for muscle contraction. The molecular data we report here for skeletal muscles of bears hibernating at near normal body temperature represent a signature of muscle preservation despite atrophying conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307210>Ileal interposition surgery targets the hepatic TGF-β pathway, influencing  and mitochondrial bioenergetics in the UCD-T2DM rat model of diabetes.</a></h1><p>Ileal interposition (IT) is a surgical procedure that increases the delivery of incompletely digested nutrients and biliary and pancreatic secretions to the distal intestinal mucosa. Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in 2-mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1.5 mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling  TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK-mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling  PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], lipogenesis, and . Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy-demanding pathways (,  and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles.

The decrease in dry matter intake during the peripartal period results in a considerable mobilisation of body tissues (mainly fat reserves and muscle mass) to compensate for the prevailing lack of energy and nutrients. Despite the activation of adaptive mechanisms to mobilise nutrients from body tissues for maintenance and milk production, the increased metabolic load is still a risk factor for animal health. The prevalence of production diseases, particularly subclinical ketosis is high in the early lactation period. Increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations further depress , feed intake and the immune system. Despite a variety of adaptation responses to nutrient and energy deficit that exists among dairy cows, an early and non-invasive detection of developing metabolic disorders in milk samples would be useful. The frequent and regular milking process of dairy cows creates the ability to obtain samples at any stage of lactation. Routine identification of biomarkers accurately characterising the physiological status of an animal is crucial for decisive strategies. The present overview recapitulates established markers measured in milk that are associated with metabolic health of dairy cows. Specifically, measurements of milk fat, protein, lactose and urea concentrations are evaluated. Changes in the ratio of milk fat to protein may indicate an increased risk for rumen acidosis and ketosis. The costly determination of individual fatty  in milk creates barriers for grouping of fatty  into saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty . Novel approaches include the potential of mid-IR (MIR) based predictions of BHB and acetone in milk, although the latter are not directly measured, but only estimated via indirect associations of concomitantly altered milk composition during (sub)clinical ketosis. Although MIR-based ketone body concentrations in milk are not suitable to monitor the metabolic status of the individual cow, they provide an estimate of the overall herd or specific groups of animals earlier in a particular stage of lactation. Management decisions can be made earlier and animal health status improved by adjusting diet composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784600>Loss of Hepatic Oscillatory Fed microRNAs Abrogates Refed Transition and Causes Liver Dysfunctions.</a></h1><p>Inability to mediate fed-fast transitions in the liver is known to cause metabolic dysfunctions and diseases. Intuitively, a failure to inhibit futile translation of state-specific transcripts during fed-fast cycles would abrogate dynamic physiological transitions. Here, we have discovered hepatic fed microRNAs that target fasting-induced genes and are essential for a refed transition. Our findings highlight the role of these fed microRNAs in orchestrating system-level control over liver physiology and whole-body energetics. By targeting SIRT1, PGC1α, and their downstream genes, fed microRNAs regulate metabolic and mitochondrial pathways. MicroRNA expression, processing, and RISC loading oscillate during these cycles and possibly constitute an anticipatory mechanism. Fed-microRNA oscillations are deregulated during aging. Scavenging of hepatic fed microRNAs causes uncontrolled  and failure in the catabolic-to-anabolic switching upon feeding, which are hallmarks of metabolic diseases. Besides identifying mechanisms that enable efficient physiological toggling, our study highlights fed microRNAs as candidate therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Following 3 d of acclimation, cows were enrolled in 2 experimental periods (P). During P1 (3 d), cows were fed ad libitum and baseline data were collected. In P2 (8 d), cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: (1) saline-infused and pair-fed (CON-PF; i.v. sterile saline at 40 mL/h; n = 5) or (2) LPS-infused and fed ad libitum (LPS-AL; Escherichia coli O55:B5 at 0.017, 0.020, 0.026, 0.036, 0.055, 0.088, 0.148, and 0.148 µg/kg of body weight per hour for d 1 through 8, respectively; n = 6). During P2, CON-PF cows were pair-fed to LPS-AL cows to eliminate confounding effects of dissimilar nutrient intake. Blood samples were collected on d 1 and 2 of P1 and d 1, 3, 5, and 7 of P2. Following the P2 d 7 a.m. milking, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver biopsies were collected for reverse transcription quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. To assess whole-body nutrient trafficking, an i.v. glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed following the a.m. milking on P2 d 8; 4 h after the GTT, cows received an epinephrine challenge. During P2, there were no treatment differences in circulating glucose. Relative to P1, CON-PF cows had or tended to have decreased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and insulin (29 and 47%, respectively) during P2, whereas neither variable changed in LPS-AL cows, leading to an overall increase in β-hydroxybutyrate and insulin (41 and 140%, respectively) relative to CON-PF cows. Circulating nonesterified fatty  were increased from d 1 to 3 and subsequently decreased from d 3 to 7 in cows from both treatments. Blood urea nitrogen gradually decreased in CON-PF cows and increased in LPS-AL cows from d 1 to 5 of P2, resulting in an overall 25% increase in LPS-AL versus CON-PF cows. In response to the GTT, the glucose and insulin area under the curve were increased 33 and 56%, respectively, in LPS-AL compared with CON-PF cows; changes reflective of whole-body insulin resistance. However, protein abundance of insulin signaling markers within muscle, liver, and adipose tissue were similar between treatments. There were no observable treatment differences in the glucose or nonesterified fatty  response to the epinephrine challenge. No treatment differences were observed in hepatic mRNA abundance of key gluconeogenic or lipid export enzymes. In conclusion, chronic LPS exposure altered multiple parameters of basal and stimulated metabolism, but did not appear to affect the molecular machinery evaluated herein.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate liver diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic  (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance model in vitro.Insulin resistance in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating  genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic insulin resistance via preserving insulin signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Utilizing a transcriptional profiling and metabolomics approach, we compared S. aureus grown on autoclaved chicken breast (ACB) to Luria broth agar. ACB cultures demonstrated increased expression of genes associated with protein synthesis, cofactors, secondary metabolites, nitrogen and nucleotide metabolism, amino  transport, and reduced expression of general stress, lipid metabolism, and virulence genes. The ACB culture also displayed characteristics of catabolite de-repression and anaerobic growth, and increased expression of arginine biosynthesis genes (argFGH) and an arginine/ornithine antiporter gene (arcD). S. aureus synthesizes arginine from proline and the ACB culture exhibited increased expression of proline transport genes (opuBA, opuBB and putP) and increased proline accumulation. Amino  and sugar content in the ACB grown culture increased, and this was attributed to the consumption of ACB, transport of amino , and . Genes involved with biotin biosynthesis and uptake were upregulated and biotin is required for amino  catabolism. Genes encoding urease and urease activity were upregulated in ACB cultures, while urea levels were reduced. This research provides fundamental information on the response of S. aureus growing on chicken meat that could find application in future attempts to reduce the growth of S. aureus in food.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbohydrates such as D-glucose or D-galactose are degraded via the modified, branched Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway whereas growth on peptides requires the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway for . As for most hyperthermophilic Archaea an important control point is established at the level of triosephophate conversion, however, the regulation at the level of pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate conversion was not tackled so far. Here we describe the cloning, expression, purification and characterization of the pyruvate kinase (PK, SSO0981) and the phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS, SSO0883) of . The PK showed only catabolic activity [catalytic efficiency (PEP): 627.95 mMs, 70°C] with phosphoenolpyruvate as substrate and ADP as phosphate acceptor and was allosterically inhibited by ATP and isocitrate (  0.8 mM). The PEPS was reversible, however, exhibited preferred activity in the gluconeogenic direction [catalytic efficiency (pyruvate): 1.04 mMs, 70°C] and showed some inhibition by AMP and α-ketoglutarate. The gene  annotated as PEPS/pyruvate:phosphate dikinase (PPDK) revealed neither PEPS nor PPDK activity. Our studies suggest that the energy charge of the cell as well as the availability of building blocks in the citric  cycle and the carbon/nitrogen balance plays a major role in the  carbon switch. The comparison of regulatory features of well-studied hyperthermophilic Archaea reveals a close link and sophisticated coordination between the respective sugar kinases and the kinetic and regulatory properties of the enzymes at the level of PEP-pyruvate conversion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658286>Stable carbon isotope diagnostics of mammalian metabolism, a high-resolution isotomics approach using amino  carboxyl groups.</a></h1><p>The carbon isotopic compositions of amino  are increasingly measured to characterize diets and metabolic response to diets. We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino . The automated system used HPLC to separate amino  followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino . Eight mammalian keratin samples from herbivores (kudu and caribou), omnivores (humans) and carnivores (bowhead and humpback zooplanktivorous whales) were analysed with this new system. The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino  carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino  during normal metabolism. Analyses of non-essential amino  isotope profiles showed (1) consistent and general taxon-level metabolic differences between the herbivore, human and whale samples, (2) marked differences among individual humans, ruminants and whales (3) evidence for  in the wildlife samples, and (4) extensive 13C enrichment likely associated with fasting in the humpback whale sample. Future mammalian research related to the metabolism of growth, reproduction, aging and disease may benefit from using this technique. Values obtained for internationally available samples USGS42 and USGS43 (Tibetan and Indian human hair) provide a first characterization of reference materials for δ13CCARBOXYL profiles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460164>Phenylpropanoid Glycerol Glucosides Attenuate Glucose Production in Hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>An activity-guided fractionation approach revealed several phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides isolated from the bulbs of  Thunb. (Easter lily) with  inhibitory activities. The strongest activity was observed for (2)-1---coumaroyl-2--β-d-glucopyranosylglycerol (), (2)-1--caffeoyl-2--β-d-glucopyranosylglycerol (), and (2)-1--β-d-glucopyranosyl-2-coumaroylglycerol () with inhibitions of 51.2, 39.2, and 36.8%, respectively. The coumaroyl-based () and its acetylated derivative () exhibited differential inhibition activity (51.2% as compared to 3.6%), suggesting that natural acetylation decreases the hypoglycemic activity of these compounds. Direct structure-activity analysis of phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides indicated that the hydroxylation pattern of the hydroxy cinnamic  moiety and acetylation were responsible for the differences in activity. This is the first report of phenylpropanoid glycerol glucosides as a phytochemical class of hepatic glucose production inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555134>Ethanol-Induced Hepatic Insulin Resistance is Ameliorated by Methyl Ferulic  Through the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>One of the key events during the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is that alcohol inhibits the insulin signaling pathway in liver and leads to disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. Methyl ferulic  (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced liver injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced insulin resistance in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic insulin resistance in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. Insulin resistance was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM insulin for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited insulin resistance, reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic , and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of liver tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate metabolism," "glycolysis/," and "fatty  metabolism" were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and . Taken together, these findings suggested that MFA effectively ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in ALD at least partially by acting on the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783436>Butyrate stimulates hepatic  in mouse primary hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Butyrate is a major short-chain fatty  (SCFA) produced by microbial fermentation of dietary fiber in the gastrointestinal tract. Butyrate is also a well-known broad-spectrum histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Butyrate has been reported to improve energy metabolism in rodents, which is associated with its beneficial effects on skeletal muscle, brown fat tissue and pancreatic β-cells. The present study investigated the direct effect of butyrate on hepatic  in mouse primary hepatocytes and the underlying mechanism. Isolated mouse primary hepatocytes were incubated with sodium butyrate, other HDAC inhibitors and other SCFAs. Hepatic glucose production was measured and gluconeogenic gene expression was detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) was assessed by western blot analysis. The results revealed that sodium butyrate dose-dependently increased hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression in isolated mouse primary hepatocytes. Trichostatin A, a potent broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor, had the opposite effect. Similar to sodium butyrate, propionate, which is another SCFA, promoted hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression in the presence or absence of gluconeogenic substrates, which were further enhanced by cAMP. Furthermore, sodium butyrate also increased the accumulation of intracellular ATP and induced the phosphorylation of CREB in mouse hepatocytes. In conclusion, the present study suggested that butyrate stimulates hepatic  and induces gluconeogenic gene expression as a substrate and cAMP/CREB signaling activator.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice via activating insulin signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing  and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty- β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040245>Protease-Mediated Growth of Staphylococcus aureus on Host Proteins Is  Dependent.</a></h1><p> has the ability to cause infections in multiple organ systems, suggesting an ability to rapidly adapt to changing carbon and nitrogen sources. Although there is little information about the nutrients available at specific sites of infection, a mature skin abscess has been characterized as glucose depleted, indicating that peptides and free amino  are an important source of nutrients for the bacteria. Our studies have found that mutations in enzymes necessary for growth on amino , including pyruvate carboxykinase (Δ) and glutamate dehydrogenase (Δ), reduced the ability of the bacteria to proliferate within a skin abscess, suggesting that peptides and free amino  are important for  growth. Furthermore, we found that collagen, an abundant host protein that is present throughout a skin abscess, serves as a reservoir of peptides. To liberate peptides from the collagen, we identified that the host protease, MMP-9, as well as the staphylococcal proteases aureolysin and staphopain B function to cleave collagen into peptide fragments that can support  growth under nutrient-limited conditions. Moreover, the oligopeptide transporter Opp3 is the primary staphylococcal transporter responsible for peptide acquisition.

Heynh., with limited resistance to salinity. The xerohalophyte Zygophyllum xanthoxylum (Bunge) Engl. is a salt-accumulating desert plant that efficiently transports Na+ into vacuoles to manage salt and exhibits increased growth under salinity conditions, suggesting a unique transcriptional response compared with glycophytes. We used transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq to compare gene expression in roots of Z. xanthoxylum and A. thaliana under 50 mM NaCl treatments. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway analysis suggested that 50 mM NaCl was perceived as a stimulus for Z. xanthoxylum whereas a stress for A. thaliana. Exposure to 50 mM NaCl caused metabolic shifts towards  to stimulate growth of Z. xanthoxylum, but triggered defensive systems in A. thaliana. Compared with A. thaliana, a vast array of ion transporter genes was induced in Z. xanthoxylum, revealing an active strategy to uptake Na+ and nutrients from the environment. An ascorbate-glutathione scavenging system for reactive oxygen species was also crucial in Z. xanthoxylum, based on high expression of key enzyme genes. Finally, key regulatory genes for the biosynthesis pathways of abscisic  and gibberellin showed distinct expression patterns between the two species and auxin response genes were more active in Z. xanthoxylum compared with A. thaliana. Our results provide an important framework for understanding unique patterns of gene expression conferring salt resistance in Z. xanthoxylum.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181633>Comparative Proteomics Analysis of the Seedling Root Response of Drought-sensitive and Drought-tolerant Maize Varieties to Drought Stress.</a></h1><p>The growth and development of maize roots are closely related to drought tolerance. In order to clarify the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance between different maize ( L.) varieties at the protein level, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) quantitative proteomics were used for the comparative analysis of protein expression in the seedling roots of the drought-tolerant Chang 7-2 and drought-sensitive TS141 maize varieties under 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000)-simulated drought stress. We identified a total of 7723 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 1243 were significantly differentially expressed in Chang 7-2 following drought stress, 572 of which were up-regulated and 671 were down-regulated; 419 DEPs were identified in TS141, 172 of which were up-regulated and 247 were down-regulated. In Chang 7-2, the DEPs were associated with ribosome pathway, glycolysis/ pathway, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. In TS141, the DEPs were associated with metabolic pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, and starch and sucrose metabolism. Compared with TS141, the higher drought tolerance of Chang 7-2 root system was attributed to a stronger water retention capacity; the synergistic effect of antioxidant enzymes; the strengthen cell wall; the osmotic stabilization of plasma membrane proteins; the effectiveness of recycling amino ; and an improvement in the degree of lignification. The common mechanisms of the drought stress response between the two varieties included: The promotion of enzymes in the glycolysis/ pathway; cross-protection against the toxicity of aldehydes and ammonia; maintenance of the cell membrane stability. Based on the proteome sequencing information, the coding region sequences of eight DEP-related genes were analyzed at the mRNA level by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The findings of this study can inform the future breeding of drought-tolerant maize varieties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160397>Flexible Metabolism and Suppression of Latent Enzymes Are Important for  Adaptation to Diverse Environments within the Host.</a></h1><p>Bacterial metabolism is necessary for adaptation to the host microenvironment.

UPEC containing disruptions in two irreversible glycolytic steps involving 6-carbon (6-phosphofructokinase; ) and 3-carbon (pyruvate kinase; ) substrates have no fitness defect during urinary tract infection (UTI); however, both reactions are catalyzed by isozymes: 6-phosphofructokinases Pfk1 and Pfk2, encoded by  and , and pyruvate kinases Pyk II and Pyk I, encoded by  and  UPEC strains lacking one or both phosphofructokinase-encoding genes ( and ) and strains lacking one or both pyruvate kinase genes ( and ) were investigated to determine their regulatory roles in carbon flow during glycolysis by examining their fitness during UTI and  growth requirements. Loss of a single phosphofructokinase-encoding gene has no effect on fitness, while the  double mutant outcompeted the parental strain in the bladder. A defect in bladder and kidney colonization was observed with loss of , while loss of  resulted in a fitness advantage. The  mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type , suggesting that the presence of Pyk II rather than the loss of Pyk I itself is responsible for the fitness defect in the  mutant. These findings suggest that  suppresses latent enzymes to survive in the host urinary tract. Urinary tract infections are the most frequently diagnosed urologic disease, with uropathogenic  (UPEC) infections placing a significant financial burden on the health care system by generating more than two billion dollars in annual costs. This, in combination with steadily increasing antibiotic resistances to present day treatments, necessitates the discovery of new antimicrobial agents to combat these infections. By broadening our scope beyond the study of virulence properties and investigating bacterial physiology and metabolism, we gain a better understanding of how pathogens use nutrients and compete within host microenvironments, enabling us to cultivate new therapeutics to exploit and target pathogen growth requirements in a specific host environment.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354667>A Novel Two-Component System, Encoded by the s/ Genes, Affects  Morphology in Liquid Culture.</a></h1><p> are mycelial bacteria adapted to grow in soil. They have become important producers of biomolecules with medical applications, but their growth in industrial fermenters is challenged by their peculiar morphology in liquid culture: the hyphae tend to clump and grow as large pellets, which are oxygen- and nutrient-limited, grow slowly and present diminished protein production. Here, by implementing an experimental evolution strategy, a  strain, 2L12, with dispersed morphology and reduced pellet size in liquid culture and no defects in either differentiation or secondary metabolism was selected. Genome sequencing revealed a single amino  substitution in a sensor kinase, Sco5282, of unknown function to be responsible for the morphological changes. Moreover, genetic and biochemical scrutiny identified Sco5283 as the cognate response regulator and demonstrated that the acquired mutation activates this two-component system. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of the mutant strain revealed changes in expression of genes involved in central processes such as , gluconeogenesis, stress-signaling pathways, proteins secretion and cell envelope metabolism.

To fill this gap, we captured House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) from rural and urban environments and hypothesized that increased access to human refuse in urban areas may significantly alter the gut microbiome and nutritional physiology of Sparrows. While there were no significant differences in circulating triglycerides or free glycerol concentrations between populations, urban birds had significantly greater blood glucose concentrations, which suggests greater circulating glucagon concentrations, accessibility to carbohydrates, and/or higher rates of  in an urban setting. Rural birds had significantly more plasma uric , suggesting that they may metabolize more proteins or experience lower inflammation than urban birds. Rural birds also had significantly higher liver free glycerol concentrations, indicating that they metabolize more fat than urban birds. There were no significant differences in the relative abundance of gut microbial taxa at the phyla level between the two populations, but linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that urban House Sparrows were more enriched with class- and order-level microbes from the phylum Proteobacteria, which are implicated in several mammalian intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. These findings demonstrate that urbanization significantly alters the nutritional physiology and the composition of the gut microbiome of House Sparrows.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

About 450 articles (original, review,etc) been screened; 40 of them in the range of (1992-2017) were used due to their correlation to the study purpose. 28 of them were indexed by "Web of science (ISI)", 24 of them indexed by pubmed and also 29 of them were indexed by scopus data center.Phenols affect diabetes in different ways. CGA suppress hepatic  through the inhibition of G6Pase and is also an insulin sensitizer that potentiates insulin action. Curcumin reduce insulin resistance so decrease AGE's products in diabetes mellitus. Hydroxytyrosol regulates the calcium channels which plays key role in insulin secretion. Resveratrol increase the stimulation of glucose uptake and insulin secretion. CGA has similar antioxidant activity as vitamin E and ellagic  maybe is even more potent than vitamin E. curcumin inhibits lipid peroxidation and scavenge superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals. The antioxidant activity of hydroxytyrosol protects pancreatic cells from damage and death. Treatment with resveratrol significantly decreases the level of glucosylated hemoglobin.All these phytochemicals have potent antidiabetic and antioxidant effects in different ways beside their other effects like anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties in ellagic , or like anti-angiogenic and apoptogenic activities in curcumin.

However, the actual glycolipid metabolism gene expression, as well as the possible pathways that regulate glycolipid metabolism in the schistosome-infected liver, has not been extensively explored.In this study, we evaluated the dynamic expression of glycolipid metabolism-associated genes and proteins in the livers from mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum at the indicated time points using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. Then, cultures of macrophages were treated with schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) to detect the expression levels of genes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism in order to identify macrophages metabolic characteristics in response to these antigens. Furthermore, SEA-stimulated macrophages were co-cultures with hepatocytes and detected the effects of macrophages on the gene expression of hepatocytes metabolism.The expression of -related genes (Ldha, Glut4, Pkm2, Glut1, Pfkfb3, Aldoc, HK2, Pfk) in the liver were upregulated but the gluconeogenesis gene (G6pc) was downregulated during S. japonicum infection. In addition, the mRNA levels of fatty  (FA) oxidation-related genes (Ucp2, Atp5b, Pparg) in the liver were significantly upregulated; however, the FA synthesis genes (Fas, Acc, Scd1, Srebp1c) and lipid uptake gene (Cd36) were downregulated post-S. japonicum-infection. In consistence with these data, stimulation with SEA in vitro significantly enhanced the gene expression that involved in  and FA oxidation, but decreased genes related to gluconeogenesis, FA synthesis and lipid uptake in macrophages. The levels of phosphorylated AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 were increased in macrophages after SEA stimulation. Inhibition of phosphorylated AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 promoted SEA-treated macrophages to produce glucose. In addition, suppression of phosphorylated-AMPK, but not phosphorylated-AKT and phosphorylated-mTOR, induced the lipid accumulation in SEA-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, SEA-treated macrophages significantly reduced the expression of Acc mRNA in hepatocytes in vitro.These findings reveal S. japonicum infection induces dynamic changes in the expression levels of genes involved in catabolism (glucose uptake,  and fatty  oxidation) and suppressing anabolism (glycogen synthesis) in the liver, which could occur via macrophages' metabolic states, particularly those involved in the AMPK, AKT and mTORC1 pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048208>Metabolic dysfunction following weight regain compared to initial weight gain in a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model.</a></h1><p>Diet-induced weight loss and regain leads to physiological and metabolic changes, some of which are potentially harmful. However, the specific metabolic processes and dysfunctions associated with weight regain, and how they differ from initial weight gain, remain unclear. Thus, we examined the metabolic profiles of mice following weight regain compared to initial weight gain. Mice were fed a normal diet or a high-fat diet or were cycled between the two diets to alternate between obese and lean states. Liver samples were collected and hepatic metabolites were profiled using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The identified metabolites associated with weight regain were quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and lipid profiles were assessed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight MS (UPLC-QTOF-MS). In addition, changes in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gluconeogenic enzymes were investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting, respectively.

Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure metabolic intermediates derived from uniformly labeled C-glucose or [3-C]l-lactate, we investigated the contribution of PC to anaplerosis and cataplerosis in the liver cell line HepG2. Suppression of PC expression by short hairpin RNA lowered incorporation of C glucose incorporation into tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates, aspartate, glutamate and sugar derivatives, indicating impaired cataplerosis. The perturbation of these biosynthetic pathways is accompanied by a marked decrease of cell viability and proliferation. In contrast, under gluconeogenic conditions where the HepG2 cells use lactate as a carbon source, pyruvate carboxylation contributed very little to the maintenance of these metabolites. Suppression of PC did not affect the percent incorporation of C-labeled carbon from lactate into citrate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, succinate as well as aspartate and glutamate, suggesting that under gluconeogenic condition, PC does not support cataplerosis from lactate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the activities of these pathways in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both  and energy production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and  were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

Carnivorous fish are considered glucose intolerant, as they exhibit poor ability in using dietary carbohydrates. To increase the current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which metformin can improve glucose homeostasis in carnivorous fish, we addressed the effect of intraperitoneal administration of metformin, in the presence or absence of a glucose load, on metabolic rate-limiting enzymes and lipogenic factors in the liver of gilthead sea bream ( Sparus aurata). Hyperglycemia markedly upregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, PFK1) 5 h following glucose administration, while at 24 h posttreatment, it increased isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activity, a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic  cycle, and the expression of lipogenic factors (PGC1β, Lpin1, and SREBP1). Metformin counteracted glucose-dependent effects, and downregulated glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and mammalian target of rapamycin 5 h posttreatment in the absence of a glucose load, leading to decreased long-term activity of PFK1 and IDH. The results of the present study suggest that hyperglycemia enhances lipogenesis in the liver of S. aurata and that metformin may exert specific metabolic effects in fish by decreasing hepatic transdeamination and suppressing the use of amino  as gluconeogenic substrates. Our findings highlight the role of amino  metabolism in the glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758974>Differential effects of intrauterine growth restriction and a hypersinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp on metabolic pathways and insulin action in the fetal liver.</a></h1><p>Intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetal sheep have increased hepatic glucose production (HGP) that is resistant to suppression during a hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp (insulin clamp). We hypothesized that the IUGR fetal liver would have activation of metabolic and signaling pathways that support HGP and inhibition of insulin-signaling pathways. To test this, we used transcriptomic profiling with liver samples from control (CON) and IUGR fetuses receiving saline or an insulin clamp. The IUGR liver had upregulation of genes associated with /glycolysis, transcription factor regulation, and cytokine responses and downregulation of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis, amino  degradation, and detoxification pathways. During the insulin clamp, genes associated with cholesterol synthesis and innate immune response were upregulated in CON and IUGR. There were 20-fold more genes differentially expressed during the insulin clamp in IUGR versus CON. These genes were associated with proteasome activation and decreased amino  and lipid catabolism. We found increased , , and  expression and decreased  expression as molecular targets for increased HGP in IUGR. As candidate genes for resistance to insulin's suppression of HGP, expression of , , and  increased more during the insulin clamp in CON compared with IUGR. Metabolites were measured with H-nuclear magnetic resonance and support increased amino  concentrations, decreased mitochondria activity and energy state, and increased cell stress in the IUGR liver. These results demonstrate a robust response, beyond suppression of HGP, during the insulin clamp and coordinate responses in glucose, amino , and lipid metabolism in the IUGR fetus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066268>d- chiro-Inositol Ameliorates High Fat Diet-Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance via PKCε-PI3K/AKT Pathway.</a></h1><p>d- chiro-Inositol (DCI) is a biologically active component found in tartary buckwheat, which can reduce hyperglycemia and ameliorate insulin resistance. However, the mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effects of DCI remains largely unclear. This study investigated the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of DCI on hepatic  in mice fed a high fat diet and saturated palmitic -treated hepatocytes. DCI attenuated free fatty  uptake by the liver via lipid trafficking inhibition, reduced diacylglycerol deposition, and hepatic PKCε translocation. Thus, DCI could improve insulin sensitivity by suppressing hepatic . Subsequent analyses revealed that DCI decreased hepatic glucose output and the expression levels of PEPCK and G6 Pase in insulin resistant mice through PKCε-IRS/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Likewise, such effects of DCI were confirmed in HepG2 cells with palmitate-induced insulin resistance. These findings indicate a novel pathway by which DCI prevents hepatic , reduces lipid deposition, and ameliorates insulin resistance via regulation of PKCε-PI3K/AKT axis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449056>PAHSAs enhance hepatic and systemic insulin sensitivity through direct and indirect mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Palmitic  esters of hydroxy stearic  (PAHSAs) are bioactive lipids with antiinflammatory and antidiabetic effects. PAHSAs reduce ambient glycemia and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant aged chow- and high-fat diet-fed (HFD-fed) mice. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which PAHSAs improve insulin sensitivity. Both acute and chronic PAHSA treatment enhanced the action of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production (EGP) in chow- and HFD-fed mice. Moreover, chronic PAHSA treatment augmented insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle and heart in HFD-fed mice. The mechanisms by which PAHSAs enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity included direct and indirect actions involving intertissue communication between adipose tissue and liver. PAHSAs inhibited lipolysis directly in WAT explants and enhanced the action of insulin to suppress lipolysis during the clamp in vivo. Preventing the reduction of free fatty  during the clamp with Intralipid infusion reduced PAHSAs' effects on EGP in HFD-fed mice but not in chow-fed mice. Direct hepatic actions of PAHSAs may also be important, as PAHSAs inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated EGP directly in isolated hepatocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway involving Gαi protein-coupled receptors. Thus, this study advances our understanding of PAHSA biology and the physiologic mechanisms by which PAHSAs exert beneficial metabolic effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551816>BCAA Catabolic Defect Alters Glucose Metabolism in Lean Mice.</a></h1><p>Recent studies show branched-chain amino  (BCAA) catabolic pathway is defective in obese animals and humans, contributing to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes. However, in the context of obesity, various processes including the dysfunctional lipid metabolism can affect insulin sensitivity and glycemic regulation. It remains unclear how BCAA catabolic defect may exert direct impacts on glucose metabolism without the disturbance of obesity. The current study characterized the glucose metabolism in lean mice in which the genetic deletion of PP2Cm leads to moderate BCAA catabolic defect. Interestingly, compared to the wildtype control, lean PP2Cm deficient mice showed enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, lower body weight, and the preference for carbohydrate over lipids utilization. Metabolomics profiling of plasma and tissues revealed significantly different metabolic patterns in the PP2Cm deficient mice, featured by the marked alterations in glucose metabolic processes, including /glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and tricarboxylic  cycle. The metabolic changes of glucose were predominantly observed in liver but not skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue. The elevated branched-chain keto  (BCKAs) resulted from the BCAA catabolic defect may play a critical role in regulating the expression of key regulators of glucose metabolic processes and the activity of respiratory Complex II/succinate dehydrogenase in TCA cycle. Together, these results show BCAA catabolic defect significantly alters glucose metabolism in lean mice with some impacts different or even opposite from those in obese mice, highlighting the critical role of BCAA catabolism in glycemic regulation and the complex interplay between macronutrients in lean and obese animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619395>Rapid Growth and Metabolism of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli in Relation to Urine Composition.</a></h1><p>SUMMARYUropathogenic  (UPEC) strains cause a majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Since UPEC strains can become antibiotic resistant, adjunct or alternate therapies are urgently needed. UPEC strains grow extremely rapidly in patients with UTIs. Thus, this review focuses on the relation between urine composition and UPEC growth and metabolism. Compilation of urinary components from two major data sources suggests the presence of sufficient amino  and carbohydrates as energy sources and abundant phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen sources. In a mouse UTI model, mutants lacking enzymes of the tricarboxylic  cycle, , and the nonoxidative branch of the pentose cycle are less competitive than the corresponding parental strains, which is consistent with amino  as major energy sources. Other evidence suggests that carbohydrates are required energy sources. UPEC strains in urine  and  express transporters for peptides, amino , carbohydrates, and iron and genes associated with nitrogen limitation, amino  synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, and nucleotide salvage. Mouse models confirm the requirement for many, but not all, of these genes. Laboratory evolution studies suggest that rapid nutrient uptake without metabolic rewiring is sufficient to account for rapid growth. Proteins and pathways required for rapid growth should be considered potential targets for alternate or adjunct therapies.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385363>Effect of metformin on myotube BCAA catabolism.</a></h1><p>Metformin has antihyperglycemic properties and is a commonly prescribed drug for type II diabetes mellitus. Metformin functions in part by activating 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and blood glucose. Metformin also upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Several population studies have shown levels of circulating branched-chain amino  (BCAA) positively correlate with insulin resistance. Because BCAA catabolic enzyme content is regulated by PGC-1α, we hypothesized metformin may alter BCAA catabolism. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of metformin at varying concentrations on myotube metabolism and related gene and protein expression. C2C12 myotubes were treated with metformin at 30 uM (physiological) or 2 mM (supraphysiological) for up to 24 hours. Metabolic gene expression was measured via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, protein expression was measured using Western blot, and mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism were measured via oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate, respectively. Supraphysiological metformin upregulated PGC-1α mRNA expression along with related downstream targets, yet the reduced expression of electron transport chain components as well as basal and peak cell metabolism. Supraphysiological metformin also suppressed branched-chain aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) and branched-chain-alpha-keto  dehydrogenase E1a (BCKDHa) mRNA expression as well as BCAT2 protein expression and BCKDHa activity, which was accompanied by decreased Kruppel-like factor 15 protein expression. Physiological levels of metformin suppressed BCKDHa and cytochrome c oxidase mRNA expression at early time points (4-12 hours) but had no effect on any other outcomes. Together these data suggest metformin may suppress BCAA catabolic enzyme expression or activity, possibly reducing levels of circulating gluconeogenic substrates.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609623>Gymnemic  Ameliorate Hyperglycemia Through PI3K/AKT and AMPK Mediated Signaling Pathway in T2DM Rats.</a></h1><p>Gymnemic  (GA) isolated from gymnema sylvestre (Retz.) Schult has been shown to display anti-diabetic activity, however the molecular mechanisms governing these effects are unclear. In this study, GA (40, 80 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats to explore its hypoglycemic activity and underlying mechanisms of action. The results indicated that GA decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations by 26.7 %, and lowered insulin concentrations by 16.1 % after oral administration of GA at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks in T2DM rats. Our data showed that RT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that GA up-regulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthesis (GS), promoted the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), while down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthesis kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in T2DM rats. In addition, key proteins involved in AMPK-mediated  (such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)) were down-regulated in GA-treated T2DM rats. In summary, the hypoglycemic mechanisms of GA may be related to promoting insulin signal transduction and activating PI3K/Akt and AMPK-mediated signaling pathway in T2DM rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744350>Effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on metabolites, lipolysis and  in Holstein cows.</a></h1><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on metabolites, lipolysis and  in cows during the transition period.Thirty-nine Holstein dry cows were blocked and assigned randomly to three groups, fed a high energy density diet (HD, 1.62 Mcal of net energy for lactation [NEL]/kg dry matter [DM]), a medium energy density diet (MD, 1.47 Mcal NEL/kg DM), or a low energy density diet (LD, 1.30 Mcal NEL/kg DM) prepartum; they were fed the same lactation diet to 28 days in milk (DIM). All the cows were housed in a free-stall barn and fed ad libitum.The reduced energy density diets decreased the blood insulin concentration and increased nonesterified fatty  (NEFA) concentration in the prepartum period (p<0.05). They also increased the concentrations of glucose, insulin and glucagon, and decreased the concentrations of NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate during the first 2 weeks of lactation (p<0.05). The plasma urea nitrogen concentration of both prepartum and postpartum was not affected by dietary energy density (p>0.05). The dietary energy density had no effect on mRNA abundance of insulin receptors, leptin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in adipose tissue, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α in liver during the transition period (p>0.05). The HD cows had higher mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase at 3 DIM compared with the MD cows and LD cows (p = 0.001). The mRNA abundance of hepatic pyruvate carboxykinase at 3 DIM tended to be increased by the reduced energy density of the close-up diets (p = 0.08).The reduced energy density diet prepartum was effective in controlling adipose tissue mobilization and improving the capacity of hepatic  postpartum.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613531>Biotin Deficiency.</a></h1><p>Biotin (vitamin H or vitamin B7) is a B-complex vitamin that acts as an essential coenzyme for five carboxylases: pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and coenzyme for acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2.[1][2][3][4] These carboxylases help in several chemical processes in the cell, including , amino  metabolism, and fatty  synthesis.[1][3] The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine recommends a daily dietary intake of 30 mcg/day, for the maintenance of good health.

However, the main inhibitors (, furans and phenols) ubiquitous in lignocellulose hydrolysates strictly limit the conversion efficiency. Thus, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of lignocellulose hydrolysate inhibitors to identify key industrial bottlenecks that undermine efficient biofuel production. The recently developed omics strategy for intracellular metabolites and protein quantification now allow for the in-depth mapping of strain metabolism and thereby enable the resolution of the underlying mechanisms.The toxicity of the main inhibitors in lignocellulose hydrolysates against  and ABE production was systematically investigated, and the changes in intracellular metabolism were analyzed by metabolomics and proteomics. The toxicity of the main lignocellulose hydrolysate inhibitors at the same dose was ranked as follows: formic  > phenol > furfural. Metabolomic analysis based on weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed that the three inhibitors triggered the stringent response of . Proteomic analysis based on peptide mass spectrometry (MS) supported the above results and provided more comprehensive conclusions.

The ability of Antarctic sea-ice diatoms to survive this prolonged darkness relies on their metabolic capability. This study is the first to examine the proteome of a prominent sea-ice diatom in response to extended darkness, focusing on the protein-level mechanisms of dark survival. The Antarctic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus was grown under continuous light or darkness for 120 d. The whole cell proteome was quantitatively analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS to investigate metabolic changes that occur during sustained darkness and during recovery under illumination. Enzymes of metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in respiratory processes, tricarboxylic  cycle, glycolysis, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the urea cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain became more abundant in the dark. Within the plastid, carbon fixation halted while the upper sections of the glycolysis,  and pentose phosphate pathways became less active. We have discovered how F. cylindrus utilises an ancient alternative metabolic mechanism that enables its capacity for long-term dark survival.

Either insulin deficiency or insulin resistance may cause diabetes. Insulin deficiency causes type 1 diabetes and diabetes associated with total pancreatectomy. Glucagon produces insulin resistance. Glucagon-induced insulin resistance promotes type 2 diabetes and diabetes associated with glucagonoma. Further, glucagon-induced insulin resistance aggravates the metabolic consequences of the insulin-deficient state. A major metabolic effect of insulin is the accumulation of glucose as glycogen in the liver. Glucagon opposes hepatic insulin action and enhances the rate of , increasing hepatic glucose output. In order to support , glucagon promotes skeletal muscle wasting to supply amino  as gluconeogenic precursors. Glucagon promotes hepatic fatty  oxidation to supply energy required to sustain . Hepatic fatty  oxidation generates β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (ketogenesis). Prospective studies reveal that elevated glucagon secretion at baseline occurs in healthy subjects who develop impaired glucose tolerance at follow-up compared with subjects who maintain normal glucose tolerance, suggesting a relationship between elevated glucagon secretion and development of impaired glucose tolerance. Prospective studies have identified animal protein consumption as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Animal protein intake activates glucagon secretion inducing sustained elevations in plasma glucagon. Glucagon is a major hormone that causes insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is an established cardiovascular risk factor additionally to its pathogenic role in diabetes.

In this context, understanding the biology of feed efficiency (FE) in beef cattle allows the development of markers for identification and selection of best animals for animal production. Thus, 98 young Nellore bulls were evaluated for FE and at the end of the experiment liver samples from six High Feed Efficient (HFE) and six Low Feed Efficient (LFE) animals were collected for protein extraction, digestion and analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Data were analyzed for differential abundant proteins (DAPs), protein networks, and functional enrichment. Serum endotoxin was also quantified. We found 42 DAPs and 3 protein networks significantly related to FE. The main pathways associated with FE were: microbial metabolism; biosynthesis of fatty , amino  and vitamins; glycolysis/; xenobiotic metabolism and; antigen processing and presentation. Serum endotoxins were significantly higher in LFE animals supporting the results.

Migratory birds such as geese have a high tolerance of massive energy intake and exhibit little pathological development. Domesticated goose breeds, derivatives of the wild greyleg goose (Anser anser) or swan goose (Anser cygnoides), have high tolerance of energy intake resembling their ancestor species. Thus, goose is potentially a model species to study mechanisms associated with adipogenesis.Phenotypically, goose liver exhibited higher fat accumulation than adipose tissues during fattening (liver increased by 3.35 fold than 1.65 fold in adipose), showing a priority of fat accumulation in liver. We found the number of differentially expressed genes in liver (13.97%) was nearly twice the number of that in adipose (6.60%). These differentially expressed genes in liver function in several important lipid metabolism pathways, immune response, regulation of cancer, while in adipose, terms closely related to protein binding,  were enriched. Typically, genes like MDH2 and SCD, which have key roles in glycolysis and fatty  metabolism, had higher fold change in liver than in adipose tissues. Three hundred two differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs involved in regulation of metabolism in liver were also identified. For example, lncRNA XLOC_292762, which was 5.7 kb downstream of FERMT2, a gene involved phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate binding, was significantly down-regulated after the high-intake feeding period. Further investigation of documented obesity-related orthologous genes in goose suggested that understanding the evolutionary split from mammals in adipogenesis will make goose fatty liver a better resource for future research.Our research reveals that goose uses liver as the major tissue to regulate a distinct lipid synthesis and degradation flux and the dynamic expression network analyses showed numerous layers of positive responses to both massive energy intake and possible pathological development.

Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on 5 healthy and 5 ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P < 0.05 and fold changes >1.5 or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino  metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino , and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

We found that AAI inhibited amino  metabolism in mouse testicular cells, impeded the uptake and oxidative decomposition of fatty , prevented normal glucose uptake by testicular cells, which inhibited glycolysis and , affected the mitochondrial tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, which impaired the ATP energy supply, decreased the number of spermatogenic cells and sperm in the testes, induced changes in the mitochondrial state of spermatogonial cells, and ultimately led to physiological and pathological changes in the testes.

Three isonitrogenous (46% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipid) experimental diets were designed, with 100% fish oil (FO), 50% fish oil and 50% soybean oil (FS) and 100% soybean oil (SO), respectively. After a 12-week growth trial, the results showed that compared with FO group, contents n-6 PUFAs increased while the n-3 PUFAs decreased significantly both in liver and muscle in FS and SO groups. Concentrations of blood glucose, leptin, free fatty  and total triglyceride reached the highest values in SO group, while blood insulin showed no significant difference among all groups. The gene expressions of insulin receptor substrate-2, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty  synthetase, and lipoprotein lipase increased, and the insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphotidylinsositol-3-kinase (PI3K), hexokinase, glycogen synthetase and glucose transporter 2 in liver decreased significantly in SO group. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) also decreased significantly in this group. These results suggested that high level of dietary soybean oil depressed PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and then affected glucose and lipid metabolism by glycolysis, , glucose transportation, glycogenesis and lipogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It has been reported that the composition of the gut microbiota differs in obese and lean subjects, suggesting that microbiota dysbiosis can contribute to changes in body weight. However, the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota participates in energy homeostasis are unclear. Gut microbiota can be modulated positively or negatively by different lifestyle and dietary factors. Interestingly, complex interactions between genetic background, gut microbiota, and diet have also been reported concerning the risk of developing obesity and metabolic syndrome features. Moreover, microbial metabolites can induce epigenetic modifications (i.e., changes in DNA methylation and micro-RNA expression), with potential implications for health status and susceptibility to obesity. Also, microbial products, such as short-chain fatty  or membrane proteins, may affect host metabolism by regulating appetite, lipogenesis, , inflammation, and other functions. Metabolomic approaches are being used to identify new postbiotics with biological activity in the host, allowing discovery of new targets and tools for incorporation into personalized therapies. This review summarizes the current understanding of the relations between the human gut microbiota and the onset and development of obesity. These scientific insights are paving the way to understanding the complex relation between obesity and microbiota. Among novel approaches, prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiome transplantation could be useful to restore gut dysbiosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279633>A H NMR based study of hemolymph metabonomics in different resistant silkworms, Bombyx mori (Lepidotera), after BmNPV inoculation.</a></h1><p>Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a primary silkworm pathogen, and the molecular mechanism of silkworm defense to BmNPV infection is still unclear. Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of energy, plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose metabolism plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino  (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and tyrosine was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The glycolysis and  pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection. Moreover, the levels of other metabolites related to fat metabolism, transamination, energy metabolism, and glycometabolism, such as glycine, threonine, glutamine, and glutamate, were unstable in the two silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. Thus, our study provides an overview of the metabolic response of the silkworm in response to BmNPV infection, which lays the foundation for clarifying the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Common CO-containing gas atmospheres for poultry meat packaging are either nearly O-free or high O MAPs. In this work, we compared spoilage microbiota of skinless chicken breast in CO/O (30/70%) and CO/N (30/70%) MAP, which are culturable with conventional methods and identified isolates by MALDI-TOF MS. These data were compared to metatranscriptome sequencing enabling a culture-independent overview on the composition of microbiota at species level. While typical MAP meat spoilers were confirmed in the transcriptomic approach, we also found high numbers of transcripts mapping to Photobacterium spp. sequences in these samples. As photobacteria were recently shown to occur in different MAP and vacuum packaged meats, we used the respective part of the metatranscriptomic data for prediction of Photobacterium spp. major metabolic routes in situ, upon growth in MAP poultry meat. It is predicted that they employ similar metabolism in both atmospheres: In the lack of carbohydrates upon meat spoilage, the pyruvate pool is filled via glycerol originating from lipolysis and amino  conversions. From the pyruvate pool,  is fed enabling cell wall biosynthesis and growth as well as catabolism to lactate and other metabolites, or anaplerosis towards the citric  cycle. Production is predicted of several biogenic amines including tyramine and cadaverine, enabling generation of proton motive force. Taken together, photobacteria express metabolic pathways upon growth on meat, which should lead to compounds overlapping with those of known potent meat spoilers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The liver, being the key metabolic organ, plays a major role in handling NEB. Dairy animals handling high lactation demands are better models to understand the liver adaptive mechanisms during this phase. Therefore, we analyzed the liver transcriptome of dairy buffaloes during early postpartum. Liver biopsies were performed on three lactating buffaloes on the 15th and the 30th days of early postpartum and three heifers (controls) at the diestrous stage. Paired-end Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) identified 509 significantly differentially expressed genes (SDE) in the liver among the three groups. The SDE with log2 fold change > 3 and the unique SDE revealed the promotion of immune suppression (e.g., TCR), apoptosis (e.g., CCDC103), PGF2α synthesis, fat accumulation (e.g., BGLAP) and liver regeneration (e.g., FGF10) pathways, and the downregulation of antigen presentation (e.g., BOLA-DQA) on the 15th day of lactation. Consistently upregulated genes on the 15th and 30th days of early postpartum indicated the promotion of immune tolerance (e.g., IFITM3), medium and long-chain fatty ' oxidation (e.g., ACSM3), and lipid accumulation (e.g., INSIG1). However, consistently downregulated genes during early postpartum showed immunosuppression, the downregulation of  from amino  (e.g., DDO), and the biosynthesis of taurine (e.g., CSAD) and unsaturated fatty  (e.g., SCD). Functional annotation and network analyses also indicated the promotion of immune tolerance, fat accumulation and decreased  from amino , and estrogen metabolism on the 15th day of lactation. Overall, the liver showed immune tolerance as an adaptive mechanism during early postpartum of buffaloes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826550>Dietary arachidonic  decreases the expression of transcripts related to adipocyte development and chronic inflammation in the adipose tissue of juvenile grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella.</a></h1><p>Overdevelopment of adipose tissue in cultured fish is one of the biggest issues plaguing current aquaculture industry, leading to unhealthy status of fishes and production losses. Diet supplemented with 0.30% arachidonic  (ARA) has been found to reduce adipogenesis and inflammation in grass carp, but the potential mechanism is not comprehensively understood. To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA. Finally, dietary ARA also decreased the expression of transcripts annotated with glucose transportation, glycolysis and . Overall, our results demonstrate that dietary ARA has a fat reducing role, and tends to retard adipocyte development and attenuate chronic inflammation based on these adipose transcript expression results in grass carp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is a ubiquitous source of energy for every organism in the world and is essential to fuel both aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration. Glucose often enters the body in isometric forms such as galactose and fructose (monosaccharides), lactose and sucrose (disaccharides), or starch (polysaccharide). Our body stores excess glucose as glycogen (a polymer of glucose) which become liberated in times of fasting. Glucose is also derivable from products of fat and protein break-down through the process of . Considering how vital glucose is for homeostasis, it is no surprise that there are a plethora of sources for it.  Once glucose is in the body, it travels through the blood and to energy-requiring tissues. There, glucose is broken down in a series of biochemical reactions releasing energy in the form of ATP. The ATP derived from these processes is used to fuel virtually every energy-requiring process in the body. In eukaryotes, most energy derives from aerobic (oxygen-requiring) processes which start with a molecule of glucose. The glucose is broken down first through the anaerobic process of glycolysis, leading to the production of some ATP and pyruvate end-product. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate converts to lactate through reduction. In aerobic conditions, the pyruvate can enter the citric  cycle to yield energy-rich electron carriers which help produce ATP at the electron transport chain (ETC).[1]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936838>The Autophagic Flux Inhibitor Bafilomycine A1 Affects the Expression of Intermediary Metabolism-Related Genes in Trout Hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process of cellular self-eating which emerged these last years as a major adaptive metabolic response to various stresses such as fasting, hypoxia, or environmental pollutants. However, surprisingly very few data is currently available on its role in fish species which are directly exposed to frequent environmental perturbations. Here, we report that the treatment of fasted trout hepatocytes with the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycine A1 lowered the mRNA levels of many of the -related genes and increased those of genes involved in intracellular lipid stores. Concurrently, intracellular free amino  levels dropped and the expression of the main genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress exhibited a sharp increase in autophagy inhibited cells.

The effects on hepatic glucogenetic and lipogenic gene expression, systemic metabolism and pathological changes were then determined.In T2DM rats, SIK1 expression was reduced in the liver. Overexpression of SIK1 improved hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and fatty liver, reduced the expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), pS577 SIK1, sterol regulatory element binding-protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty  synthase (FAS), and increased the expression of SIK1, pT182 SIK1 and pS171 CRTC2 in diabetic rat livers with the suppression of  and lipid deposition.SIK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the livers of HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats, where it suppresses hepatic  and lipogenesis by regulating the SIK1/CRTC2 and SIK1/SREBP-1c signalling pathways.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or  in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

The challenge is to identify the metabolic pathways affected by the excessive consumption of these dietary components when they are consumed in excess, to unravel the molecular mechanisms leading to metabolic pathologies and identify novel therapeutic targets to manage them. Mechanistic (mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as one of the key molecular nodes that integrate extracellular signals, such as energy status and nutrient availability, to trigger cell responses that could lead to the above-mentioned diseases through the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. By activating mTOR signalling, excessive consumption of simple sugars (such as fructose and glucose), could modulate hepatic , lipogenesis and fatty  uptake and catabolism and thus lipid deposition in the liver.

After that, a 10-week feeding trial with two different dietary carbohydrate levels (15% and 21%, respectively) was conducted to analyze the function of foxo1 in glucose metabolism in vivo. Results showed that the foxo1 was identified as 2176 bp (base pair) with a 2025 bp open reading frame, which encoded 675 amino . Sequence analysis showed that foxo1 of turbot was highly homologous to most of fishes. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that the highest expression of foxo1 was in liver. After in vitro analysis, foxo1-specific small interfering RNA (sifoxo1) treatment significantly decreased the expressions of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (cpepck) and glucose-6-phosphatase1(g6pase1) in primary hepatocytes. Expression of mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (mpepck) was not significantly inhibited. In contrast, the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase2 (g6pase2) increased significantly. After the in vivo study (feeding trial), with the decreased expression of foxo1 in turbot due to high dietary carbohydrate level (21%), the expression of g6pase2 was significantly upregulated. However, the expression of glucokinase (gk) was not changed significantly. These increased the level of blood glucose and hepatic glycogen. In conclusion, data from both in vitro (primary hepatocytes) and in vivo (feeding trial) showed that downregulated foxo1 in turbot could not result in significant depression of  and activation of glycolysis. This could be one of the reasons why intake of high level of carbohydrate resulted in prolonged hyperglycemia in turbot.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Lysine acetylation is one of the most important reversible post-translational modifications and plays a vital regulatory role in various cellular processes. However, current information on the extent and function of lysine acetylation and aflatoxin biosynthesis in A. flavus is limited. Here, a global acetylome analysis of A. flavus was performed by peptide pre-fractionation, pan-acetylation antibody enrichment and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 1313 high-confidence acetylation sites in 727 acetylated proteins were identified in A. flavus. These acetylation proteins are widely involved in glycolysis/, pentose phosphate pathway, citric  cycle and aflatoxin biosynthesis. AflO (O-methyltransferase), a key enzyme in aflatoxin biosynthesis, was found to be acetylated at K241 and K384. Deletion of aflO not only impaired conidial and sclerotial developments, but also dramatically suppressed aflatoxin production and pathogenicity of A. flavus. Further site-specific mutations showed that lysine acetylation of AflO could also result in defects in development, aflatoxin production and pathogenicity, suggesting that acetylation plays a vital role in the regulation of the enzymatic activity of AflO in A. flavus.

As befitting fish of their tropical origin, their distribution, and culture practices are highly affected by low temperatures. In this study, we used genetic and genomic methodologies to reveal pathways involved in the response and tolerance of blue tilapia () to low temperature stress. Cold tolerance was characterized in 66 families of blue tilapia. Fish from cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive families were sampled at 24 and 12°C, and the transcriptional responses to low-temperature exposure were measured in the gills and liver by high-throughput mRNA sequencing. Four hundred and ninety four genes displayed a similar temperature-dependent expression in both tolerant and sensitive fish and in the two tissues, representing the core molecular response to low temperature exposure. KEGG pathway analysis of these genes revealed down-regulation of focal-adhesion and other cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, and up-regulation of proteasome and various intra-cellular proteolytic activities. Differential responses between cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive fish were found with genes and pathways that were up-regulated in one group and down-regulated in the other. This reverse response was characterized by genes involved in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis/ in the gills and biosynthesis of amino- in the liver, with low temperature down-regulation in tolerant fish and up-regulation in sensitive fish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967137>The CIMP-high phenotype is associated with energy metabolism alterations in colon adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is found in 15-20% of malignant colorectal tumors and is characterized by strong CpG hypermethylation over the genome. The molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not still fully understood. The development of CIMP is followed by global gene expression alterations and metabolic changes. In particular, CIMP-low colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), predominantly corresponded to consensus molecular subtype 3 (CMS3, "Metabolic") subgroup according to COAD molecular classification, is associated with elevated expression of genes participating in metabolic pathways.We performed bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project for CIMP-high and non-CIMP COAD samples with DESeq2, clusterProfiler, and topGO R packages. Obtained results were validated on a set of fourteen COAD samples with matched morphologically normal tissues using quantitative PCR (qPCR).Upregulation of multiple genes involved in glycolysis and related processes (ENO2, PFKP, HK3, PKM, ENO1, HK2, PGAM1, GAPDH, ALDOA, GPI, TPI1, and HK1) was revealed in CIMP-high tumors compared to non-CIMP ones. Most remarkably, the expression of the PKLR gene, encoding for pyruvate kinase participating in , was decreased approximately 20-fold. Up to 8-fold decrease in the expression of OGDHL gene involved in tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle was observed in CIMP-high tumors. Using qPCR, we confirmed the increase (4-fold) in the ENO2 expression and decrease (2-fold) in the OGDHL mRNA level on a set of COAD samples.We demonstrated the association between CIMP-high status and the energy metabolism changes at the transcriptomic level in colorectal adenocarcinoma against the background of immune pathway activation. Differential methylation of at least nine CpG sites in OGDHL promoter region as well as decreased OGDHL mRNA level can potentially serve as an additional biomarker of the CIMP-high status in COAD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668392>Yangonin protects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through farnesoid X receptor.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently evolving as the most common liver disease worldwide. Dyslipidemia, pathoglycemia and insulin resistance are the major risk factors for the development of NAFLD. To date, no effective drug therapies for this condition have been approved.The present study was to investigate the protective effects of yangonin, a kavalactone isolated from Kava, against NAFLD and further elucidate the mechanisms in vivo and in vitro.A high-fat diet (HFD) induced mouse NAFLD model was used with or without yangonin treatment.The body weight, relative liver weight and serum biochemical indicators were measured. H&E and Oil Red O staining were used to identify the amelioration of the liver histopathological changes. Serum and hepatic triglyceride, free fatty  and total cholesterol were analyzed. siRNA, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to clarify the mechanisms underlying yangonin protection.Yangonin had obvious protective effects against NAFLD via farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation. Through FXR activation, yangonin attenuated lipid accumulation in the liver via inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis-related protein including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty  synthetase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Besides, yangonin promoted lipid metabolism through an induction in genes required for lipoprotein lipolysis and fatty  β-oxidation. Furthermore, yangonin modulated blood glucose homeostasis through regulation of -related gene phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and glycogen synthesis-related gene glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDase). Also, yangonin increased insulin sensitivity through upregulating phosphorylation of insulin responsive substrate 1, 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2). Then, in vivo and in vitro evidence further demonstrated the involvement of FXR activation in yangonin hepatoprotection.Yangonin protects against NAFLD due to its activation of FXR signalling to inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and , and to promote lipid metabolism and glycogen synthesis, as well as insulin sensitivity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

It belongs to the C1QTNF (complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein) family, which has a variety of members with high amino  sequence homology and overlapping functions. Concentration of adiponectin in blood is inversely correlated with body fat percentage and cardiac risk factors like blood pressure and CRP (C-reactive protein) level. Studies have identified the existence of a cardiac adiponectin system. However, little is known about the role of this system in the pathogenesis of autoimmune myocarditis. Thus, we have studied the involvement of adiponectin in the development of this autoimmune disorder in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM).Adiponectin knockout (ko) and wild type (wt) mice were immunized with cardiac troponin I (cTnI) to induce an EAM. To determine the severity of myocardial damage, inflammation and fibrosis were scored after HE and Afog staining and high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) level was measured. To detect if changes in specific inflammatory cell numbers could be observed between the genotypes, we performed immunohistochemical staining to detect T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages. The level of the humoral immune response was determined through the measurement of cTnI-specific serum IgG autoantibodies. Relative mRNA expression of different cytokines, C1QTNF family members and adiponectin receptors in the heart tissue was analyzed with qPCR.Animals immunized with cTnI developed autoimmune myocarditis with a significant deterioration of cardiac parameters compared to the corresponding control group. The adiponectin ko group immunized with cTnI showed a tendency towards increased inflammation, fibrosis, heart-to-body-weight ratio, infiltration pattern of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages, hsTnT concentration, humoral immune response and mRNA expression of interleukin 6 in the heart tissue and decreased weight gain compared to the wt group immunized with cTnI. However, the difference to the wt group treated with cTnI was not significant. The analysis of cardiac mRNA expression of adiponectin receptors and four C1QTNF family members, most suitable for fulfilling the functions of adiponectin in adiponectin ko mice, did not show any significant differences between adiponectin ko and wt group at all.Our study reveals that the absence of adiponectin did not lead to a significantly increased impairment of cardiac function and was also unlikely to be compensated by its receptors or other C1QTNF family members in the murine model of EAM. Here, other synergistic or redundant effects might play a role and must be investigated in further studies to understand the role and function of adiponectin in autoimmune myocarditis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the current study a proteomic analysis of oxidized proteins (ox) was performed on the brain and liver of Nile tilapia exposed to WAF obtained from relevant environmental loads (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 g/L) of Maya CO. Results have shown that oxidation of specific proteins was a newly discovered organ-dependent process able to disrupt key functions in Nile tilapia. In control fish, enzymes involved on aerobic metabolism (liver aldehyde dehydrogenase and brain dihydrofolate reductase) and liver tryptophan--tRNA ligase were oxidized. In WAF-treated liver specimens, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), β-galactosidase (β-GAL) and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP-9) were detected in oxidized form. oxDPP-9 could be favorable by reducing the risk associated with altered glucose metabolism, the opposite effects elicited by oxFBA and oxβ-GAL. oxTrypsin showed a clear adverse effect by reducing probably the hepatocyte capacity to achieve proteolysis of oxidized proteins as well as for performing the proper digestive function. Additionally, enzyme implicated in purine metabolism adenosine (deaminase) was oxidized. Cerebral enzymes of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (COX IV, COX5B), of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis (β-N-acetylhexosaminidase), involved in catecholamines degradation (catechol O-methyltransferase), and microtubule cytoskeleton (stathmin) were oxidized in WAF-treated specimens. This response suggests, in the brain, an adverse scenario for the mitochondrial respiration process and for ATP provision as for ischemia/reoxygenation challenges.

Here, a recently hypothesized metabolic role for these hormones is tested on European sea bass treated with: (i) teleost PTHrP(1-34), (ii) PTHrP(1-34) and anti-STC1 serum (pro-PTHrP groups), (iii) a PTHrP antagonist PTHrP(7-34) or (iv) PTHrP(7-34) and STC1 (pro-STC1 groups). Livers were analysed using untargeted metabolic profiling based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) spectroscopy. Concentrations of branched-chain amino  (BCAA), alanine, glutamine and glutamate increased in pro-STC1 groups suggesting their mobilization from the muscle to the liver for degradation and  from alanine and glutamine. In addition, only STC1 treatment decreased the concentrations of succinate, fumarate and acetate, indicating slowing of the citric  cycle. In the pro-PTHrP groups the concentrations of glucose, erythritol and lactate decreased, indicative of  from lactate. Taurine, trimethylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide and carnitine changed in opposite directions in the pro-STC1 versus the pro-PTHrP groups, suggesting opposite effects, with STC1 stimulating lipogenesis and PTHrP activating lipolysis/β-oxidation of fatty .

In the present study, we treated mice with high-cholesterol diets following exposure to acute hypoxic stress and evaluated the effects of the diets on whole-body, liver glucose, and liver fat metabolism. For rapid cholesterol liver uptake, 6-week-old male C57BL/J6 mice were fed with high-cholesterol/cholic  (CH) diet for 6 weeks and then were exposed to gradual oxygen level reduction for 1 h and hypoxia at 7% oxygen for additional 1 hour using a hypoxic chamber. Animals were than sacrificed, and metabolic markers were evaluated. Hypoxic treatment had a strong hypoglycemic effect that was completely blunted by CH treatment. Decreases in  and glycogenolysis as well as an increase in ketone body formation were observed. Such changes indicate a metabolic shift from glucose to fat utilization due to activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase/AMPK axis in the CH-treated animals. Increased ketogenesis was also observed in vitro in hepatocytes after cholesterol treatment. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that cholesterol contributes to metabolic shift and adaptation to hypoxia in vivo and in vitro through induction of HIF-1 and iNOS expression.Copyright © 2019 Naama Miron and Oren Tirosh.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389908>Response of Liver Metabolic Pathways to Ketogenic Diet and Exercise Are Not Additive.</a></h1><p>Studies suggest ketogenic diets (KDs) produce favorable outcomes (health and exercise performance); however, most rodent studies have used a low protein KD, which does not reflect the normal-to-high protein KDs used by humans. Liver has an important role in ketoadaptation due to its involvement in  and ketogenesis. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that exercise training (ExTr) while consuming a normal protein KD (NPKD) would induce additive/synergistic responses in liver metabolic pathways.Lean, healthy male C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-fat control diet (15.9% kcal protein, 11.9% kcal fat, 72.2% kcal carbohydrate) or carbohydrate-deficient NPKD (16.1% protein, 83.9% kcal fat) for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks on the diet, half were subjected to 3-week treadmill ExTr (5day/week, 60min/day, moderate-vigorous intensity). Upon conclusion, metabolic and endocrine outcomes related to substrate metabolism were tested in liver and pancreas.NPKD-fed mice had higher circulating β-hydroxybutyrate and maintained glucose at rest and during exercise. Liver of NPKD-fed mice had lower pyruvate utilization and greater ketogenic potential as evidenced by higher oxidative rates to catabolize lipids (mitochondrial and peroxisomal) and ketogenic amino  (leucine). ExTr had higher expression of the gluconeogenic gene, Pck1, but lower hepatic glycogen, pyruvate oxidation, incomplete fat oxidation, and total pancreas area. Interaction effects between the NPKD and ExTr were observed for intrahepatic triglycerides, as well as genes involved in , ketogenesis, mitochondrial fat oxidation, and peroxisomal markers; however, none were additive/synergistic. Rather, in each instance the interaction effects showed the NPKD and ExTr opposed each other.A NPKD and ExTr independently induce shifts in hepatic metabolic pathways, but changes do not seem to be additive/synergistic in healthy mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836234>Synthesis of 5-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-one's aryl Schiff base derivatives and investigation of carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterase (AChE, BuChE) inhibitory properties.</a></h1><p>Carbonic anhydrase enzymes (EC 4.2.1.1, CAs) are metalloenzyme families that catalyze the rapid conversion of HO and CO to HCO and H.

Metabolomic signatures represent the pathophysiological phenotype of diseases. Recent studies in gut microbiota and metabolomics analysis revealed the dramatic role of microbiome in psychoneurological system diseases, but still, the mechanisms underlying gut microbiome-host interaction remain unclear.Male Wistar rats were s.c. injection of ACTH fragment 1-24 for 14 days to induce treatment-resistant depression. Depression-related behavioral tests, analysis of serum monoamine neurotransmitters and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones were determined for assessment of ACTH-induced depression rat model. A gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer based urinary metabolomic signatures integrated 16S rRNA sequence analysis based gut microbial profiling was performed, as well as Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis was used to manifest the covariation between the differential urinary metabolites and gut microbiota of genus level.Chronic injection of ACTH-induced depression-like phenotype (increased immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test) was accompanied by peripheral serotonin down-regulation and HPA axis overactivation (ACTH and corticosterone up-regulation). Urinary metabolomics analysis indicated that pyruvic , L-threonine, mannitol, D-gluconic , 4-hydroxybenzoic , D-arabitol, myo-inositol and ascorbic  levels were reduced in ACTH-treated rats' urine, while hippurate level was elevated. In addition, microbial community profiling revealed bacterial enrichment (e.g. Ruminococcus, Klebsiella) and reduction (e.g. Akkermansia, Lactobacillus) in the ACTH-induced depression rat model. Correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were closely relevant to metabolites myo-inositol and hippurate, which were included in host inositol phosphate metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis.Depression rat model induced by ACTH is associated with disturbance of pyruvate metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and  or gluconeogenesis, as well as changes in microbial community structure. Gut microbiota may participate in the mediation of systemic metabolomic changes in ACTH-induced depression model.

Metabolic surgery is the most effective treatment for selected patients with diabetes and/or obesity. When compared to intensive medical therapy and lifestyle intervention, metabolic surgery has shown superiority in achieving glycemic improvement, reducing number of medications and cardiovascular risk factors, which translates in long-term benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying diabetes improvement after metabolic surgery have not yet been clearly understood but englobe a complex interaction among improvements in beta cell function and insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, intestinal , changes in glucose utilization, and absorption by the gut and changes in the secretory pattern and morphology of adipose tissue. These are achieved through different mediators which include an enhancement in gut hormones release, especially, glucagon-like peptide 1, changes in bile  circulation, gut microbiome, and glucose transporters expression. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive appraisal of what is known so far to better understand the mechanisms through which metabolic surgery improves glycemic control facilitating future research in the field.Copyright © 2019 Pérez-Pevida, Escalada, Miras and Frühbeck.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30858895>Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth ameliorate type II diabetic mellitus in Goto-Kakizaki rats.</a></h1><p>By 2030, diabetes mellitus (DM) will be the 7th leading cause of death worldwide. Type 2 DM (T2DM) is the most common type of DM and is characterized by insulin resistance and defective β-cell secretory function. Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are favorable seed cells for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based therapy due to their higher proliferation rates and easier access to retrieval. Currently, no study has revealed the therapeutic efficiency of MSCs for T2DM in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. Hence, we aimed to explore the effect of SHED on T2DM in GK rats.We investigated the effects of SHED on the progression of T2DM in GK rats. SHED and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were injected via the tail vein. Body weight, fasting blood glucose and non-fasting blood glucose were measured before and after administration. At 8 weeks after injection, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (IPITTs) and insulin release tests (IRTs) were performed. Additionally, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, periodic -Schiff (PAS) staining and double-label immunofluorescence staining were used to explore the pathological changes in pancreatic islets and the liver. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to detect SHED engraftment in the liver. Additionally, real-time PCR and western blotting were used to explore glycogen synthesis, glycolysis and  in the liver.At 8 weeks after SHED injection, T2DM was dramatically attenuated, including hyperglycemia, IPGTT and IRT. Additionally, histological analysis showed that SHED injection improved pancreatic islet and liver damage. Real-time PCR analysis showed that SHED significantly reversed the diabetic-induced increase of G-6-Pase, Pck1 and PK; and significantly reversed the diabetic-induced decrease of GSK3β, GLUT2, and PFKL. In addition, western blotting demonstrated that SHED significantly reversed the diabetic-induced increase of G-6-Pase and reversed the diabetic-induced decrease of GLUT2, GSK3β and PFKM.Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth offers a potentially effective therapeutic modality for ameliorating T2DM, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, pancreatic islets and liver damage, and decreased glycogen synthesis, inhibited glycolysis and increased  in the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954075>Influences of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c silencing on glucose production in HepG2 cells treated with free fatty .</a></h1><p>Elevation of exogenous free fatty  (FFA) level leads to insulin resistance (IR) in liver, IR is manifested by elevated hepatic glucose production.

Metformin is thought to exert its primary antidiabetic action through the suppression of hepatic glucose production. In addition, the discovery that metformin inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1 has placed energy metabolism and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at the centre of its proposed mechanism of action. However, the role of AMPK has been challenged and might only account for indirect changes in hepatic insulin sensitivity. Various mechanisms involving alterations in cellular energy charge, AMP-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 and modulation of the cellular redox state through direct inhibition of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been proposed for the acute inhibition of  by metformin. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin could improve obesity-induced meta-inflammation via direct and indirect effects on tissue-resident immune cells in metabolic organs (that is, adipose tissue, the gastrointestinal tract and the liver). Furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract also has a major role in metformin action through modulation of glucose-lowering hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 and the intestinal bile  pool and alterations in gut microbiota composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541119>2-Aminoadipic  (2-AAA) as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in childhood obesity.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance is an important clinical feature of metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and type 2 diabetes. Increased adipose energy storage in obesity promote insulin resistance and other metabolic adverse effects. To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between 2-aminoadipic  (2-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory 2-AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher 2-AAA levels, and the baseline 2-AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after 2 years. To validate the relationship between 2-AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in 2-AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in 2-AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the 2-AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related insulin resistance. Excess 2-AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal . Our results demonstrate that 2-AAA is associated with adipogenesis and insulin resistance. In this regard, 2-AAA could be a potential biomarker of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779918>Vaccarin ameliorates insulin resistance and steatosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Destructive glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver is a crucial characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), eventually leading to insulin resistance and subsequent hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Vaccarin is an active flavonoid glycoside associated with various biological functions, but its effects on glucose and lipid metabolic disorder in T2DM are still unclear. In this study, glucosamine (GlcN) and free fatty  (FFAs, oleate/palmitate, 2:1 ratio) were applied to mimic insulin resistance and lipid deposition in HepG2 cells, respectively. Type 2 diabetic mice were induced using a high-fat diet (HFD) together with streptozotocin (STZ). GlcN stimulation was found to upregulate glucose production and  but downregulate glycogen synthesis and phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in HepG2 cells, abnormal changes that were reversed by vaccarin. Furthermore, lipid accumulation was enhanced, but AMPK was inactivated in FFAs-exposed HepG2 cells, issues that were rectified by vaccarin treatment. These ameliorative effects of vaccarin on insulin resistance and steatosis were eliminated by AMPK inhibitor Compound C. In type 2 diabetic mice, chronic vaccarin administration decreased fasting blood glucose and lipid levels in both serum and the liver, and improved insulin sensitivity and steatosis in the liver. Taken together, these results suggest that vaccarin attenuates insulin resistance and steatosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019.

Both compounds affect energy transduction in isolated mitochondria and the present study aimed at characterizing the actions of these two compounds on liver metabolism and their cellular distribution in the isolated perfused rat liver. 2,4-D, but not picloram, increased glycolysis in the range from 10 to 400 μM. The redox potential of the cytosolic NAD-NADH couple was also increased by 2,4-D. Both compounds inhibited lactate . Inhibitions by 2,4-D and picloram were incomplete, reaching maximally 46% and 23%, respectively. Both compounds diminished the cellular ATP levels. No synergism between the actions of 2,4-D and picloram was detected. Biotransformations of 2,4-D and picloram were slow, but their distributions occurred at high rates and were concentrative. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that 2,4-D presented low affinity for the hydrophobic lipid bilayers, the opposite occurring with picloram. Inhibition of energy metabolism is possibly a relevant component of the toxicity of 2,4-D and of the commercial product Tordon. Furthermore, the interactions of 2,4-D with the membrane lipid bilayer can be highly destructive and might equally be related to its cellular toxicity at high concentrations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Discovered in the late 1940s but abandoned in the 1970s, polymyxins (i.e., polymyxin B and colistin) have been revived as the last-line therapy against Gram-negative "superbugs," including MDR A. baumannii. Worryingly, resistance to polymyxins in A. baumannii has been increasingly reported, urging the development of novel antimicrobial therapies to rescue this last-line class of antibiotics. In the present study, we integrated genome-scale metabolic modeling with multiomics data to elucidate the mechanisms of cellular responses to colistin treatment in A. baumannii. A genome-scale metabolic model, ATCC19606, was constructed for strain ATCC 19606 based on the literature and genome annotation, containing 897 genes, 1,270 reactions, and 1,180 metabolites. After extensive curation, prediction of growth on 190 carbon sources using ATCC19606 achieved an overall accuracy of 84.3% compared to Biolog experimental results. Prediction of gene essentiality reached a high accuracy of 86.1% and 82.7% compared to two transposon mutant libraries of AB5075 and ATCC 17978, respectively. Further integrative modeling with our correlative transcriptomics and metabolomics data deciphered the complex regulation on metabolic responses to colistin treatment, including (i) upregulated fluxes through , the pentose phosphate pathway, and amino  and nucleotide biosynthesis; (ii) downregulated TCA cycle and peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biogenesis; and (iii) altered fluxes over respiratory chain. Our results elucidated the interplay of multiple metabolic pathways under colistin treatment in A. baumannii and provide key mechanistic insights into optimizing polymyxin combination therapy.  Combating antimicrobial resistance has been highlighted as a critical global health priority. Due to the drying drug discovery pipeline, polymyxins have been employed as the last-line therapy against Gram-negative "superbugs"; however, the detailed mechanisms of antibacterial killing remain largely unclear, hampering the improvement of polymyxin therapy. Our integrative modeling using the constructed genome-scale metabolic model ATCC19606 and the correlative multiomics data provide the fundamental understanding of the complex metabolic responses to polymyxin treatment in A. baumannii at the systems level. The model ATCC19606 may have a significant potential in antimicrobial systems pharmacology research in A. baumannii.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124166>Cis-9, Trans-11 Conjugated Linoleic  Reduces Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Expression and Hepatic Glucose Production in HepG2 Cells.</a></h1><p>Dysregulated hepatic  is a hallmark of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although existing drugs have been proven to improve , achieving this objective with functional food is of interest, especially using conjugated linoleic  (CLA) found in dairy products. Both cis-9, trans-11 (c9,t11) and trans-10, cis-12 (t10,c12) isomers of CLA were tested in human (HepG2) and rat (H4IIE) hepatocytes for their potential effects on . The hepatocytes exposed for 24 h with 20 μM of c9,t11-CLA had attenuated the  in both HepG2 and H4IIE by 62.5% and 80.1%, respectively. In contrast, t10,c12-CLA had no effect. Of note, in HepG2 cells, the exposure of c9,t11-CLA decreased the transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) by 87.7%, and glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) by 38.0%, while t10,c12-CLA increased the expression of G6PC, suggesting the isomer-specific effects of CLA on hepatic glucose production. In HepG2, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, rosiglitazone, reduced the glucose production by 72.9%. However, co-administration of c9,t11-CLA and rosiglitazone neither exacerbated nor attenuated the efficacy of rosiglitazone to inhibit glucose production; meanwhile, t10,c12-CLA abrogated the efficacy of rosiglitazone. Paradoxically, PPARγ antagonist GW 9662 also led to 70.2% reduction of glucose production and near undetectable PCK1 expression by abrogating CLA actions. Together, while the precise mechanisms by which CLA isomers modulate hepatic  directly or via PPAR warrant further investigation, our findings establish that c9,t11-CLA suppresses  by decreasing PEPCK on hepatocytes.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30604460>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathway to preserve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Previous works indicated that the stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is no clear evident on the effect of the regulation of ER stress by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the prevention of NAFLD.HepG2 cells were treated with thapsigargin (Tg) or palmitic  (PA). We analysed ACE2 expression using Western-blotting analyses. ER stress-related proteins were detected in ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice by immunofluorescence or Western-blotting analyses. In ACE2-overexpression HepG2 cells, the triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and glycogen content were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins (ACCα, SREBP-1c, FAS, and LXRα), enzymes for  (PEPCK, G6Pase, and IRS2), and IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway were analysed by Western-blotting analyses.ACE2 was significantly increased in Tg/PA-induced cultured hepatocytes. Additionally, ACE2 knockout mice displayed elevated levels of ER stress, while Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice showed reduced ER stress in liver. Furthermore, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress, accompanied by decreased TG content, increased intracellular glycogen, and downregulated expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins and enzymes for  in Tg/PA-induced hepatocytes. As a consequence of anti-ER stress, the activation of ACE2 led to improved glucose and lipid metabolism through the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway.This is the first time documented that ACE2 had a notable alleviating role in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism via the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt-mediated pathway. This study may further provide insight into a novel underlying mechanism and a strategy for treating NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520653>Identification of differentially expressed genes and networks related to hepatic lipid dysfunction.</a></h1><p>A range of chemical exposures that resulted in the specific pathology of hepatic lipid dysfunction in rats were selected from DrugMatrix, a publicly available toxicogenomic database. Raw microarray data collected from these exposures were further analyzed using bioinformatic tools to generate a differentially expressed genes (DEGs) dataset associated with hepatic lipid dysfunction. Further analysis of the DEGs dataset resulted in 324 upregulated genes, and 275 genes that were down regulated. Meanwhile, 36 genes were either up regulated or down regulated in different chemical treatments. All identified genes were uploaded in the web application for Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) for gene ontology enrichments and to identify Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways. Some of the identified pathways included glycolysis/, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. The same DEGs dataset was also analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA identified several pathways including PXR/RXR activation, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, and xenobiotic metabolism signaling. Furthermore, the generated DEGs lists were uploaded into NCATS BioPlanet platform. Some of the identified pathways were related to fatty  omega oxidation, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, and adipogenesis. The enrichment and clarification of the pathways and biological networks obtained from the DEGs dataset provide prior knowledge on the underlying biological key events and molecular mechanisms for the computational development of putative adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for hepatic lipid dysfunction as a precursor to hepatic steatosis.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522044>Comparative metatranscriptomic profiling and microRNA sequencing to reveal active metabolic pathways associated with a dinoflagellate bloom.</a></h1><p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased as a result of global climate and environmental changes, exerting increasing impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, coastal economy, and human health. Despite great research efforts, our understanding on the drivers of HABs is still limited in part because HAB species' physiology is difficult to probe in situ. Here, we used molecular ecological analyses to characterize a dinoflagellate bloom at Xiamen Harbor, China. Prorocentrum donghaiense was identified as the culprit, which nutrient bioassays showed were not nutrient-limited. Metatranscriptome profiling revealed that P. donghaiense highly expressed genes related to N- and P-nutrient uptake, phagotrophy, energy metabolism (photosynthesis, oxidative phophorylation, and rhodopsin) and carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis/, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate) during the bloom. Many genes in P. donghaiense were up-regulated at night, including phagotrophy and environmental communication genes, and showed active expression in mitosis. Eight microbial defense genes were up-regulated in the bloom compared with previously analyzed laboratory cultures. Furthermore, 76 P. donghaiense microRNA were identified from the bloom, and their target genes exhibited marked differences in amino  metabolism between the bloom and cultures and the potential of up-regulated antibiotic and cell communication capabilities. These findings, consistent with and complementary to recent reports, reveal major metabolic processes in P. donghaiense potentially important for bloom formation and provide a gene repertoire for developing bloom markers in future research.Copyright © 2018.

To unravel the mitochondrial contribution to tissue-specific physiology, we performed a systematic comparison of the mitochondrial proteome and lipidome of mice and assessed the consequences hereof for respiration. Liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial protein composition was studied by data-independent ultra-high-performance (UHP)LC-MS/MS-proteomics, and lipid profiles were compared by UHPLC-MS/MS lipidomics. Mitochondrial function was investigated by high-resolution respirometry in samples from mice and humans. Enzymes of pyruvate oxidation as well as several subunits of complex I, III, and ATP synthase were more abundant in muscle mitochondria. Muscle mitochondria were enriched in cardiolipins associated with higher oxidative phosphorylation capacity and flexibility, in particular CL(18:2) and 22:6-containing cardiolipins. In contrast, protein equipment of liver mitochondria indicated a shuttling of complex I substrates toward  and ketogenesis and a higher preference for electron transfer via the flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase pathway. Concordantly, muscle and liver mitochondria showed distinct respiratory substrate preferences. Muscle respired significantly more on the complex I substrates pyruvate and glutamate, whereas in liver maximal respiration was supported by complex II substrate succinate. This was a consistent finding in mouse liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria and human samples. Muscle mitochondria are tailored to produce ATP with a high capacity for complex I-linked substrates. Liver mitochondria are more connected to biosynthetic pathways, preferring fatty  and succinate for oxidation. The physiologic diversity of mitochondria may help to understand tissue-specific disease pathologies and to develop therapies targeting mitochondrial function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652719>Peroxiredoxin 6 Down-Regulation Induces Metabolic Remodeling and Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells.</a></h1><p>Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only member of 1-Cys subfamily of peroxiredoxins in human cells. It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione metabolism, pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty  metabolism, biosynthesis of aminoacids, and Glycolysis/. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase-2 (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase-2 (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017036>Metabolomics Profiling of Visceral Adipose Tissue: Results From MESA and the NEO Study.</a></h1><p>Background Identifying associations between serum metabolites and visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) could provide novel biomarkers of VAT and insights into the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. We aimed to discover and replicate metabolites reflecting pathways related to VAT . Methods and Results Associations between fasting serum metabolites and VAT area (by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed with cross-sectional linear regression of individual-level data from participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; discovery, N=1103) and the NEO (Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity) study (replication, N=2537). Untargeted H nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics profiling of serum was performed in MESA, and metabolites were replicated in the NEO study using targeted H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A total of 30 590 metabolomic spectral variables were evaluated. After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity, glucose/lipid-lowering medication, and body mass index, 2104 variables representing 24 nonlipid and 49 lipid/lipoprotein subclass metabolites remained significantly associated with VAT ( P=4.88×10-1.16×10). These included conventional metabolites, amino , acetylglycoproteins, intermediates of glucose and hepatic metabolism, organic , and subclasses of apolipoproteins, cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. Metabolites mapped to 31 biochemical pathways, including amino  substrate use/metabolism and glycolysis/. In the replication cohort, acetylglycoproteins, branched-chain amino , lactate, glutamine (inversely), and atherogenic lipids remained associated with VAT ( P=1.90×10-8.46×10), with most associations remaining after additional adjustment for surrogates of VAT (glucose level, waist circumference, and serum triglycerides), reflecting novel independent associations. Conclusions We identified and replicated a metabolite panel associated with VAT in 2 community-based cohorts. These findings persisted after adjustment for body mass index and appear to define a metabolic signature of visceral adiposity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30910597>Farnesoid X receptor: An important factor in blood glucose regulation.</a></h1><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a transcription factor that can be activated by bile  as well as influenced bile  metabolism. β-cell bile  metabolism is mediated by FXR and closely related to the regulation of blood glucose (BG).

Although plasma metabolite profiles are increasingly investigated for their potential to detect liver injury earlier than current clinical markers, their utility may be compromised because such profiles are affected by the nutritional state and the physiological state of the animal, and by contributions from extrahepatic sources. To tease apart the contributions of liver and non-liver sources to alterations in plasma metabolite profiles, here we sought to computationally isolate the plasma metabolite changes originating in the liver during short-term fasting. We used a constraint-based metabolic modeling approach to integrate central carbon fluxes measured in our study, and physiological flux boundary conditions gathered from the literature, into a genome-scale model of rat liver metabolism. We then measured plasma metabolite profiles in rats fasted for 5-7 or 10-13 h to test our model predictions. Our computational model accounted for two-thirds of the observed directions of change (an increase or decrease) in plasma metabolites, indicating their origin in the liver. Specifically, our work suggests that changes in plasma lipid metabolites, which are reliably predicted by our liver metabolism model, are key features of short-term fasting. Our approach provides a mechanistic model for identifying plasma metabolite changes originating in the liver.</p></html>
