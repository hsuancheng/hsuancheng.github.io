This was followed by major advances in passive immunotherapy 75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of  and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663720>Rational design of a rigid fluorophore-molecular rotor-based probe for high signal-to-background ratio detection of sulfur dioxide in viscous system.</a></h2><p>Many viscous microenvironments exist in living systems. For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in diabetes, hypertension, , tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in mitochondria and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651976>Early effects of Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and -fluorouracil on neuronal morphology and hippocampal-dependent behavior in a murine model.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women. Fortunately, BC survival rates have increased since the implementation of adjuvant chemotherapy leading to a growing population of survivors. However, chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments (CICIs) affect up to 75% of BC survivors and may be driven by  and oxidative stress. CICIs can persist 20 years and hinder survivors' quality of life (QOL). To identify early effects of CMF administration in mice, we chose to evaluate adult female mice at 2-weeks post-chemotherapy. Mice received weekly IP administration of CMF (or saline) for 4 weeks, completed behavioral testing, and were sacrificed 2-weeks following their final CMF injection. Behavioral results indicated long-term memory (LTM) impairments post-chemotherapy, but did not reveal short-term memory (STM) deficits. Dendritic morphology and spine data found increases in overall spine density within CA1 basal and CA3 basal dendrites, but no changes in DG, CA1 apical, or CA3 apical dendrites. Further analysis revealed decreases in arborization across the hippocampus (DG, CA1 apical and basal, CA3 apical and basal). These physiological changes within the hippocampus correlate with our behavioral data indicating LTM impairments following CMF administration in female mice 2-weeks post-chemotherapy. Hippocampal cytokine analysis identified decreases in IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-10, and TNFα levels.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.

The rats in normal feeding group were given a free diet (27 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder), and the rats in protein-malnutrition group were given a low protein diet (27 g/d, containing % protein fodder). The rats in energy-malnutrition group were given a low energy diet (9 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder). After 4 weeks of continuous feeding, 8 rats from each group were sacrificed for malnutrition evaluation. The weights of body, thymus and spleen were measured. The percentages of spleen T lymphocyte subsets and M1 macrophage were determined by flow cytometry. Plasma interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The remaining 28 rats in each group were collected for cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to reproduce the sepsis model, 20 rats of which were used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the other 8 rats were sacrificed at 8 hours after CLP. The levels of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were determined by ELISA, and the percentage of spleen M1 macrophages was determined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in liver tissue were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 and IL-6 in rats after CLP.(1) After 4 weeks of feeding, the rats in the normal feeding group and protein-malnutrition group gained weight, while those in the energy-malnutrition group lost 25% of their initial body weight. The weights of body, thymus and spleen in the protein-malnutrition group and the energy-malnutrition group were significantly lower than those in the normal feeding group. Compared with the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group, the percentages of spleen CD3T lymphocytes, CD4T lymphocytes, M1 macrophages and plasma IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the energy-malnutrition group [CD3T lymphocytes percentage: (52.1±3.7)% vs. (46.9±3.9)%, (44.±2.2)%; CD4T lymphocyte percentages: (35.0±3.6)% vs. (26.3±2.2)%, (25.1±2.3)%; M1 macrophage percentages: (8.7±2.0)% vs. (3.2±1.3)%, (4.2±1.1)%; IL-6 (ng/L): 129.4±16.2 vs. 48.1±10.0, 53.0±8.3, all P < 0.05]. (2) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 7 days after CLP showed: all rats in the energy-malnutrition group died, and the 7-day cumulative survival rate was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group [0% (0/20) vs. 35% (7/20), 55% (11/20), both P < 0.05]. The mortality of the normal feeding group was 65%, which was consistent with moderate CLP mortality, indicating that the CLP model was successfully prepared. After CLP, the plasma IL-6 level in the protein-malnutrition group was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group [IL-6 (ng/L): 154.6±34.7 vs. 233.4±41.2, P < 0.05]. Compared with the normal feeding group, the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in liver and plasma IL-6 levels in the energy-malnutrition group were significantly increased [TF mRNA (2): 4.±2.2 vs. 1.1±0.7, PAI-1 mRNA (2): 3.3±1.8 vs. 1.3±0.9, IL-6 (ng/L): 382.7±118.2 vs. 233.4±41.2, all P < 0.05], the percentage of M1 macrophages in spleen was significantly lowered [(8.9±2.4)% vs. (15.2±.4)%, P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in plasma IL-10 level among all the groups. Correlation analysis showed that the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in the liver of rats after CLP were positively correlated with plasma IL-6 level (r = 0.644, r = 0.574, both P < 0.01).Long-term sustained stress (starvation) leads to sustained chronic inflammatory state, and stimulated the release of related inflammatory factors and activation of the coagulation system after infection. And the inflammatory factors in sepsis rats without sustained stress protein malnutrition were significantly reduced.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650328>Successful elevation of circulating acetate and propionate by dietary modulation does not alter T-regulatory cell or cytokine profiles in healthy humans: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Increased circulating concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) achieved by ingestion of high-fibre diets is associated with anti-inflammatory effects through promotion of FoxP3+ regulatory T(reg) cells in mouse models. This study aimed to determine whether similar increments in blood SCFA levels can be achieved in humans and whether these are associated with similar immune modulatory effects.In a pilot single-blinded, randomised, controlled cross-over study in ten healthy subjects, the effects were determined of high- (39 g/day) and low-fibre (18 g/day) intake (all food provided) on SCFA (gas chromatography), proportions of Treg cells (flow cytometry) and a panel of cytokines (multiplex methodology) measured in peripheral blood at day  of each diet.Actual fibre intake differed between the diets by 19 [16-21] g/day (P< 0.001). Median [range] total plasma SCFA levels with high-fibre intake were 174. [104.8-249.] µmol/L, which were greater than those associated with low-fibre intake at 59.0 [26.-79.9] (P < 0.001). Differences were significantly different for both acetate and propionate. The frequencies of total CD4 T cells and T-regulatory cells, and concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different between the dietary interventions.Plasma SCFA levels can be modulated by altering dietary fibre consumption in healthy individuals with increments similar to those achieved in murine studies. Five days of diet intervention did not result in changes in regulatory T-cell proportions and cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood, and may require longer duration of dietary change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668884>[Causes, diagnosis and treatments of circulatory shocks].</a></h2><p>Shock states are the leading causes of intensive care admission and are nowadays associated with high morbidity and mortality. They are driven by a complex physiopathology and most frequently a multifactorial mechanism. They can be separated in whether a decrease of oxygen delivery (quantitative shock) or an abnormal cell distribution of cardiac output (distributive shock). Septic, cardiogenic and hypovolemic shocks represent more than 80% of shock etiologies. Clinical presentation is mostly characterized by frequent arterial hypotension and sign of poor clinical perfusion. Hyperlactatemia occurs in most of shock states. The diagnostic of shock or earlier reversible "pre-shock" states is urgent in order to initiate adequate therapy. Therefore, orientation and therapies must be discussed with intensive care physiologists in a multidisciplinary approach. Etiologic investigation and correction is a primary concern. Hemodynamic and respiratory support reflect another part of initial therapy toward normalization of cell oxygenation. Fluid resuscitation is the corner stone part of initial therapy of any form of shock. Vasoconstrictive drugs or inotropic support still often remain necessary. The primary goal of initial resuscitation should be not only to restore blood arterial pressure but also to improve clinical perfusion markers. On the biological side, decrease of lactate concentration is associated with better outcome.Copyright © 2019 Société Nationale Française de Médecine Interne (SNFMI). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although metformin is a well-known antidiabetic drug, it also confers protection against a series of diseases through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, whether metformin affects PM-induced adverse health effects has not been investigated. In this study, we exposed wild-type (WT) and AMPKα2 mice to PM every other day via intratracheal instillation for 4 weeks. After PM exposure, the AMPKα2 mice developed more severe lung injury and cardiac dysfunction than were developed in the WT mice; however the administration of metformin was effective in attenuating PM-induced lung injury and cardiac dysfunction in both the WT and AMPKα2 mice. In the PM-exposed mice, metformin treatment resulted in reduced systemic and pulmonary , preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, suppressed induction of pulmonary and myocardial fibrosis and oxidative stress, and increased levels of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, pretreatment with metformin significantly attenuated PM-induced cell death and oxidative stress in control and AMPKα2-depleted BEAS-2B and H9C2 cells, and was associated with preserved expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes. These data support the notion that metformin protects against PM-induced adverse health effects through a pathway that appears independent of AMPKα2. Our findings suggest that metformin may also be a novel drug for therapies that treat air pollution associated disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We used US EPA RadNet data measuring ambient gamma radiation attached to PM adjusted for background radiation, and estimated in-home gamma radiation exposures using the ratio of in-home-to-ambient sulfur in PM. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to determine associations between moving averages of PM gamma activities through the week before phlebotomy with these biomarkers. We explored ambient and indoor PM, black carbon (BC), and NO as confounders.Ambient and indoor PM gamma activities measured as energy spectra classes 3 through 9 were positively associated with CRP and IL-6. For example, averaged from phlebotomy day through previous 6 days, each IQR increase in indoor PM gamma activity for each spectra class, was associated with an CRP increase ranging from 7.45% (95%CI: 2.77, 12.4) to 13.4% (95%CI: .82, 21.4) and for ambient exposures were associated with an increase of 8.75% (95%CI: -0.57, 18.95) to 14.8% (95%CI: 4., 26.0). Indoor exposures were associated with IL-6 increase of 3.56% (95%CI: 0.31, 6.91) to 6.46% (95%CI:1.33, 11.85) and ambient exposures were associated with an increase of 0.03% (95%CI: -6.37, 6.87) to 3.50% (95%CI: -3.15, 10.61). There were no positive associations with sVCAM-1. Sensitivity analyses using two-pollutant models showed similar effects.Our results demonstrate that short-term exposures to environmental PM gamma radiation activities were associated with systemic  in COPD patients.Copyright © 2019.

As platelet count decreases with liver damage, we hypothesized that COP-NLR could indicate both  and hepatic reserve in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was conducted to clarify the prognostic significance of preoperative COP-NLR in patients with HCC.We enrolled 176 patients with histologically-proven HCC who underwent initial curative hepatectomy. Patients were assigned one point each for low platelet count (<15×10/μl) or for high NLR (≥2.0), for hepatic-COP-NLR scores (h-COP-NLR) of 0, 1 or 2.Five-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 74.±9%, and 62.2%±9.3% for score 0, 63.6±.4% and 50.3%±.6% for score 1, and 45.2±8.8% and 40.6±8.7% for score 2, respectively, and significantly differed (OS: p=0.01; RFS: p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, h-COP-NLR was an independent risk factor for tumor recurrence (HR=1.39, p=0.03) and death (HR=1.71, p=0.02).h-COP-NLR was an independent predictor for prognosis of HCC patients after hepatic resection.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

They are often characterized by marked genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, complicating diagnostic work in clinical practice and molecular diagnosis.To develop and evaluate a next-generation sequencing panel targeting genes causing neuroinflammation or mimicking neuroinflammation.Cohort study in which a total of 257 genes associated with monogenic neuroinflammation and/or cerebral vasculopathy, including monogenic noninflammatory diseases mimicking these entities, were selected. A customized enrichment capture array, the neuroinflammation gene panel (NIP), was created. Targeted high-coverage sequencing was applied to DNA samples taken from eligible patients referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, United Kingdom, between January 1, 2017, and January 30, 2019, because of onset of disease early in life, family history, and/or complex neuroinflammatory phenotypes.The main outcome was the percentage of individuals with definitive molecular diagnoses, variant classification, and clinical phenotyping of patients with pathogenic variants identified using the NIP panel. The NIP panel was initially validated in 16 patients with known genetic diagnoses.The NIP was both sensitive (95%) and specific (100%) for detection of known mutations, including gene deletions, copy number variants, small insertions and deletions, and somatic mosaicism with allele fraction as low as 3%. Prospective testing of 60 patients (30 [50%] male; median [range] age, 9.8 [0.8-20] years) presenting with heterogeneous neuroinflammatory phenotypes revealed at least 1 class  (clearly pathogenic) variant in 9 of 60 patients (15%); 18 of 60 patients (30%) had at least 1 class 4 (likely pathogenic) variant. Overall, a definitive molecular diagnosis was established in 12 of 60 patients (20%).The NIP was associated with molecular diagnosis in this cohort and complemented routine laboratory and radiological workup of patients with neuroinflammation. Unexpected genotype-phenotype associations in patients with pathogenic variants deviating from the classic phenotype were identified. Obtaining an accurate molecular diagnosis in a timely fashion informed patient management, including successful targeted treatment in some instances and early institution of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in others.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671079>Maresin-1 Inhibits Oxidative Stress and  and Promotes Apoptosis in a Mouse Model of Caerulein-Induced Acute Pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the effects of maresin-1 (MaR1) in a mouse model of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty C57BL/6 mice with caerulein-induced AP were divided into the untreated control group (N=10), the untreated AP model group (N=10), the MaR1-treated (low-dose, 0.1 μg) AP model group (N=10), the MaR1-treated (middle-dose, 0. μg) AP model group (N=10), and the MaR1-treated (high-dose, 1 μg) AP model group (N=10). Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) measured serum levels of amylase, lipase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and IL-6 and mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) were measured. Histology of the pancreas included measurement of acinar cell apoptosis using the terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. Western blot measured Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, and phospho-NF-kappaB p65, and apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9. RESULTS Following treatment with MaR1, serum levels of amylase, lipase, TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, and IL-6 decreased, MDA and protein carbonyl levels decreased, SOD and the GSH/GSSG ratio increased in a dose-dependent manner. In the MaR1-treated AP mice,  of the pancreas and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis, Bcl-2 expression, and expression of TLR4, MyD88, and p-NF-kappaB p65 were reduced, but Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9 expression increased.

In this article, we review the current state of knowledge and findings of studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in rats and mice. The six main areas covered in this review include: I) nature of particulate matter and toxicity mechanisms, II) systemic , III) heart rate and heart rate variability, IV) histopathological effects, V) atherosclerosis, VI) thrombosis, and VI) myocardial infarction. This review showed that animal model studies have been successful to bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying PM-induced cardiovascular diseases. However, there are some areas that the exact mechanisms are still unclear. In conclusion, investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in vivo or interpreting the results should attempt to justify the role of different PM compositions, which may vastly affect the overall cytotoxicity of particles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cell viability was determined using 3-(4,- Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the IC50 values of PPIs were measured. The most sensitive cell line A375 was used for further investigation. The cytotoxic effects of LANSO on these cells were assessed using Annexin-V Propidium Iodide (AV-PI) flow cytometry. As of action mechanism; anti-inflammatory effects of each PPIs and PPIs-DOXO combination therapy on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were assessed.Dose and time dependence cytotoxic activity of PPIs on human cancer cell lines were founded. Unlike DOXO; All PPIs had a selective cytotoxic effect in the normal fibroblasts. Unlike the equipotent OMP and ESOM; LANSO was the most potent drug with IC50 values at 72h of 99, 217, 272, 208, 181μM against A375, A549, CACO-2, MCF-7, and PANC-1, respectively. AV-PI flow cytometry revealed dose-dependent apoptotic effects of LANSO alone and substantially enhanced in DOXO-co-treatments. Interestingly unlike ESOM and OMP, LANSO proved more effective than indomethacin in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. None of the tested compounds, as well as indomethacin, exerted any cytotoxicity against RAW 264.7 macrophages. PPIs-DOXO lacked potential synergistic combination antiinflammation therapies.This study provides evidence that PPIs induce a direct and differential cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell line by the induction of the apoptosis.

A special role in the development of neuropathologies is assigned to the interaction of the nervous and the immune systems. Microglia are the cells of the immune system that function as resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) and are involved in the development of CNS, as well as in homeostatic interactions. Impaired microglia can contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. With the help of genome editing technologies, the main paradigms in the development and functions of microglia have been addressed. At the same time, an understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of microglia in normal and pathological conditions is necessary to create an effective therapy aimed at treating various neurological diseases.

Hence, detrusor instability, and subsequently bladder overactivity, may lead to undesirable outcomes including incontinence. Multiple mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of detrusor overactivity including  and oxidative stress. Herein, we tested the possibility that CoQ10 may have a potential therapeutic role in detrusor overactivity.Forty adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 100-150 g were used in the present study. Rats were divided (10/group) into control (receiving vehicles), monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated (receiving  mg/kg MSG daily for 15 consecutive days), MSG + OO-treated (receiving concomitantly  mg/kg MSG and olive oil for 15 consecutive days), MSG + CoQ10-treated (receiving concomitantly  mg/kg MSG and 100 mg/kg CoQ10 daily for 15 consecutive days) groups.MSG resulted in significant increase in bladder weight and sensitised the bladder smooth muscles to acetylcholine. MSG has also resulted in significant increase in bladder TNF-α, IL-6, malondialdehyde, nerve growth factor and connexion 43, with significant decrease in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. Olive oil had no effect on MSG induced alterations of different parameters. Treatment with CoQ10 has resulted in a significant restoration of all the altered parameters.Taken together, our results suggest that CoQ10 antagonizes the deleterious effects of MSG on detrusor activity.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence immunity and  systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life.

Radiographic damage was assessed by the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS). A change of 2 mSASSS units in 2 years was defined as progression. The characteristics of the study group such as demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment history were collected.There were 350 patients in the study. The mean mSASSS increased from 9.3 (15.8) units at baseline to 17.7 (21.7) units by the 6th year. Change in mSASSS scores between the 0 to 2, 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 years were 1.23 (2.68), 1.47 (2.86), and 1.52 (3.7) units respectively. Overall 24.3% of the group progressed in 2 years' time. Male sex (HR 2.46, 95%CI 1.05, .76), presence of baseline damage (HR 7.98, 95%CI 3.98, 16), increased inflammatory markers (logCRP; HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.07, 1.70) and TNFi use (HR 0.82, 95%CI 0.70, 0.96) were predictive of radiographic progression. There was a 20% reduction in the rate of progression with TNFi.Male sex, presence of baseline damage, active disease state and higher inflammatory markers confer a high-risk group for disease progression. Treatment with TNFi showed a disease modifying effect by slowing the rate of radiographic progression.© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667579>In vitro evaluation of Naltrexone HCl 1% Topical Cream in XemaTop™ for psoriasis.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis is a multifactorial skin disease involving abnormal cell proliferation and ; an efficacious topical treatment is yet to be identified. A formulation containing 1% Naltrexone HCl in XemaTop™ base was compounded, characterized and evaluated in vitro as a possible treatment for psoriasis. A three-dimensional psoriasis tissue model was exposed to the formulation for 2 or  days and analyzed for the level of markers of cellular proliferation, and inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Using immunohistochemical staining, the level of Ki67 protein significantly decreased in the drug-treated tissues. Western blot analysis showed 86% and 53% down-regulation of other proliferation markers PCNA and CYCLIN D1, respectively, after -day exposure. The pro-survival Wnt/β-catenin pathway was compromised as indicated by 57% decrease in the level of β-CATENIN and down-regulation of its down-stream targets including CYCLIN D1 (decreased by 53%), c-MYC (63%), c-JUN (92%) and MET (96%) proteins. Likewise, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was significantly inhibited by 1% Naltrexone HCl in XemaTop™, suggesting protein synthesis was affected. The production of IL-6 was inhibited by 70% in drug-treated tissues. These results suggest that the compounded drug is efficacious in down-regulating molecular markers associated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Low-dose Naltrexone in XemaTop™ was stable within 180 days when stored under refrigerated or ambient conditions. These results provide a basis for a clinical evaluation of 1% Naltrexone HCl in XemaTop™ in psoriasis patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670005>Distinct inflammatory mediator patterns in young black and white adults: The African-predict study.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the early stages of cardiovascular disease development, including hypertension. Since global reports reflect a higher hypertension prevalence in black than white populations, we hypothesise the involvement of specific inflammatory mediators. We therefore compared a detailed range of 22 inflammatory mediators between young black and white adults, and determined the relationship with blood pressure.We included 1197 adults (20-30 years; 50% black; 52% female) with detailed ambulatory blood pressures. Blood samples were analysed for 22 inflammatory mediators. For pro-inflammatory mediators, the black adults had higher C-reactive protein, interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant, macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (all p ≤ 0.008), but lower interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17A, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (all p ≤ 0.048). For anti-inflammatory mediators the black group consistently had lower levels (IL-, IL-10 and IL-13 (all p ≤ 0.012)), resulting in generally higher pro-to-anti-inflammatory ratios in black than white adults (p ≤ 0.001). In mediators with pro- and anti-inflammatory functions, the black group had lower granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-6 (both p ≤ 0.010). These patterns were confirmed after adjustment for age, sex and waist circumference, or when stratifying by hypertensive status, sex and socio-economic status. Multi-variable adjusted regression analyses and factor analysis yielded no relationship between inflammatory mediators and blood pressure in this young healthy population.Black and white ethnic groups each consistently presented with unique inflammatory mediator patterns regardless of blood pressure, sex or social class. No association with blood pressure was seen in either of the groups.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The importance of ER in current era of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with cryoballoon ablation (CBA) and contact-force catheter radiofrequency ablation (cfRFA) has not been clearly reported. In addition, it is not known whether there are differences between types of ablation energy used during PVI.Study population was drawn from a prospective multicenter database of AF ablation. Consecutive patients undergoing first-time ablation with PVI alone, using either second-generation CBA or cfRFA catheters were included. Patients were followed at 0., 3, 6, and 12 months to assess recurrence. Predictors of late recurrence (LR), defined as recurrence outside the blanking period, were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Freedom from LR was calculated and compared between two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.Study cohort included 300 patients (1:1 CBA:RFA, age 63.6 ± 10.3 years, 67% male). There were no baseline characteristic differences between the CBA and cfRFA groups. ER occurred in 23.3% and 16.7% of patients in the CBA and cfRFA groups, respectively (p = 0.149). One-year freedom from LR was similar for both groups (72.7% CBA vs. 78% cfRFA, p = 0.287). Fifty-two patients (25 CBA and 27 cfRFA) underwent repeat ablation and no difference in durability of PVI was found. ER was the only common independent predictor of LR for either group and for the entire cohort (HR 2.3).In our series of AF ablation using second-generation cryoballoon and contact-force RFA catheters, recurrence in the "blanking period" is seen in 20% and remains predictive of late recurrence irrespective of the energy used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650316>Dose-dependent green tea effect on decrease of  in human oral gingival epithelial keratinocytes: in vitro study.</a></h2><p>This in vitro study aimed to analyze the anti-inflammatory and wound healing potential of green tea extract (GTE) in human gingival epithelial keratinocytes (HGEK) treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS).A cell viability assay was conducted using MTT to determine nontoxic levels of GTE on immortalized HGEK. Cells were concomitantly treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) and GTE (1 mg/ml, 2. mg/ml,  mg/ml, and 10 mg/ml) to assess . Gene expression levels of inflammatory markers IL-β1, IL-6, and TNFα were measured by RT-PCR and their protein production was assessed by ELISA. The scratch wound healing assay was used to investigate the effects of different concentrations of GTE on cell migration. We also explored the effect of GTE on the induction of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the cells with or without LPS.GTE at concentrations of 2. mg/ml,  mg/ml, and 10 mg/ml significantly enhanced cell viability (p < 0.05). And IL-β1, IL-6, and TNFα gene expression presented up to 10-fold decrease compared with LPS-treated cells, which was also similarly found on the protein levels. At the same concentrations, cell migration increased.The mechanism results showed that GTE produced the anti-inflammatory response by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and increasing the level of anti-oxidant protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).GTE may be potentially used as oral rinse anti-inflammatory drug for treatment and prevention of oral inflammatory diseases, which is shown here by the ability to reduce the  and increase in cell migration in a dose-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666100>Pharmacological and chemogenetic orexin/hypocretin intervention ameliorates Hipp-dependent memory impairment in the A53T mice model of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD), classically defined as a progressive motor disorder accompanied with dopaminergic neuron loss and presence of Lewy bodies, is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. PD also has various non-classical symptoms, including cognitive impairments. In addition,  and astrogliosis are recognized as an integral part of PD pathology. The hippocampus (Hipp) is a brain region involved in cognition and memory, and the neuropeptide orexin has been shown to enhance learning and memory. Previous studies show impairments in Hipp-dependent memory in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease (A53T mice), and we hypothesized that increasing orexin tone will reverse this. To test this, we subjected 3, , and 7-month old A53T mice to a Barnes maze and a contextual object recognition test to determine Hipp dependent memory.  and astrogliosis markers in the Hipp were assessed by immuno-fluorescence densitometry. The data show that early cognitive impairment is coupled with an increase in expression of inflammatory and astrogliosis markers. Next, in two separate experiments, mice were given intra-hippocampal injections of orexin or chemogenetic viral injections of an orexin neuron specific Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD). For the pharmacological approach mice were intracranially treated with orexin A, whereas the chemogenetic approach utilized clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Both pharmacological orexin A intervention as well as chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons ameliorated Hipp-dependent early memory impairment observed in A53T mice. This study implicates orexin in PD-associated cognitive impairment and suggests that exogenous orexin treatment and/or manipulation of endogenous orexin levels may be a potential strategy for addressing early cognitive loss in PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660940>Anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of the extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents isolated from Luehea ochrophylla Mart.</a></h2><p>Stem bark of Luehea ochrophylla (L. ochrophylla) is used by the traditional Brazilian medicine for treatment of rheumatic diseases and tumors. This study aimed to investigate inhibition of acute and chronic inflammations and cytotoxic activity of extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds from L. ochrophylla.Hexane (HE) and ethanol (EE) extracts obtained from stem bark of L. ochrophylla were submitted to chromatographic fractionation. In order to test acute , experimental model of impact injury was used, followed by transdermal application of gels using phonophoresis. Histological analysis was based on scores assigned by the capacity of decreasing the lesion. To evaluate the effect EE and fractions on cell proliferation, human lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and analyzed using flow cytometry. Proliferation was measured using VPD 450 staining and the calculated proliferative index (PI). The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT colorimetric method against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HCT-116, and Vero cells. GraphPad Prism Version  was used for statistical analysis.HE and EE provided friedelin, β-friedelinol, lupeol, mixture of lupeol and pseudotaraxasterol, β-sitosterol, betulinic acid, mixture of lupeol and taraxasterol, (-)-epicatechin, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and (+)-epicatechin-(4β-8)-epicatechin. HE, ethyl acetate fraction (AF), betulinic acid, and β-sitosterol promoted regeneration of muscle fibers caused by muscle injury. AF significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the lymphocyte proliferation index (1.36 for cultures stimulated with PHA, 0.7 for untreated cultures and 0.12 for cultures stimulated with PHA and treated with AF 25 μg/mL and AF 50 μg/mL, respectively). β-Sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside exhibited high cytotoxic activity (IC = 1.279 μg/mL) against HCT-116 cell line.These results suggest that extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla decreases inflammatory processes generated by muscle injury. The anti-inflammatory activity may be justified by high inhibition of T cell proliferation. These extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla may be useful as a therapeutic agent against rheumatic diseases. Moreover, chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla show potent cytotoxic activity against colon and rectal carcinomas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650868>Exploratory studies with NX-13: oral toxicity and pharmacokinetics in rodents of an orally active, gut-restricted first-in-class therapeutic for IBD that targets NLRX1.</a></h2><p>Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat containing X1 (NLRX1) is an emerging therapeutic target for a spectrum of human diseases. NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower  and therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0. h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner. These experiments suggest that NX-13 is safe and well-tolerated in rats given oral doses as high as 1000 mg/kg with a favorable gastrointestinal localized pharmacokinetic profile, confirming NX-13 as a promising therapeutic for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663508>Transient protein accumulation at the center of the T cell antigen-presenting cell interface drives efficient IL-2 secretion.</a></h2><p>Supramolecular signaling assemblies are of interest for their unique signaling properties. A µm scale signaling assembly, the central supramolecular signaling cluster (cSMAC), forms at the center of the interface of T cells activated by antigen-presenting cells. We have determined that it is composed of multiple complexes of a supramolecular volume of up to 0. µm and associated with extensive membrane undulations. To determine cSMAC function, we have systematically manipulated the localization of three adaptor proteins, LAT, SLP-76, and Grb2. cSMAC localization varied between the adaptors and was diminished upon blockade of the costimulatory receptor CD28 and deficiency of the signal amplifying kinase Itk. Reconstitution of cSMAC localization restored IL-2 secretion which is a key T cell effector function as dependent on reconstitution dynamics. Our data suggest that the cSMAC enhances early signaling by facilitating signaling interactions and attenuates signaling thereafter through sequestration of a more limited set of signaling intermediates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667008>Modelling Macular Edema: The Effect of IL-6 and IL-6R Blockade on Human Blood-Retinal Barrier Integrity In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Macular edema (ME) is a leading cause of visual loss in a range of retinal diseases and despite the use of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, its successful treatment remains a major clinical challenge. Based on the indirect clinical evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key additional candidate mediator of ME, we interrogated the effect of IL-6 on blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity in vitro.Human retinal pigment epithelial cell (ARPE-19) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) monolayers were used to mimic the outer and inner BRB, respectively. Their paracellular permeability was assessed by measuring the passive permeation of 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran across confluent cells in the presence of IL-6. Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) then was measured and the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 was assessed by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy.Treatment with IL-6 for 48 hours significantly increased the diffusion rate of FITC-dextran, decreased TEER, and disrupted the distribution of ZO-1 in ARPE-19 cells, which constitutively express the IL-6 transmembrane receptor, and this was reversed with IL-6R blockade. In contrast, IL-6 did not affect the paracellular permeability, TEER, or ZO-1 distribution in HRMECs.These in vitro data support the hypothesis that IL-6 reversibly disrupts the integrity of ARPE-19 cells, but it does not affect HRMECs.IL-6 is a candidate therapeutic target in the treatment of outer BRB driven ME.Copyright 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661479>[Mouse Models of Sepsis and Septic Shock].</a></h2><p>An extensive network of regulation of systemic  makes development of a reproducible experimental model of sepsis a complex task.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence and the diagnostic value of anti-AQP4 antibodies in Tunisian patients with such inflammatory neurological conditions.During 3years, 170 consecutive serum samples of Tunisian patients with CNS inflammatory disorders and optico-spinal involvement were tested in our laboratory for anti-AQP4 antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence on transfected cells.The global seroprevalence of anti-AQP4 in our study was 4.1% (7 cases/170). The diagnosis of NMOSD was made for the 7 seropositive patients and for 2 seronegative patients, which leads to a seroprevalence of 77.7% in our NMOSD subgroup. The detection of anti-AQP4 allowed the diagnosis of NMOSD in 4 patients with incomplete clinical presentation and  patients with positive antinuclear antibodies. In one case, seropositivity was detected in a second sample, one year after an initial seronegativity.NMOSD seem to represent a rare etiology of optic neuritis and/or myelitis in Tunisian patients. Despite its low global seroprevalence in our study population, anti-AQP4 appears to be a very clinically relevant marker for NMOSD diagnosis. Repeating the screening in case of initial negativity could be interesting in clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, 20/59 (34%) of cases 1 occurred within the first three months after the index surgery. In addition, cases 1 were less likely to have fever (27%, 16/59 versus 58%, 54/93; p=0.001) or wound  (39%, 23/59 versus 72%, 67/93; p<0.001). Moreover, 24/59 (40%) of cases 1 presented with polymicrobial infections, and staphylococcal pathogens accounted for 22/24 (92%) of the co-infections. By comparing and contrasting the two multivariate risk models (cases 1 versus controls and cases 2 versus controls), the following factors associated with C. acnes SIAI development were identified: age <54 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-.58, p=0.03), a body mass index <22 kg/m (aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.17-.29, p=0.02), and thoracic instrumentation (aOR: 16.1, 95% CI: 7.57-37.0, p<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Future therapeutic and prophylactic studies on C. acnes SIAI should focus on young, thin patients who undergo spinal instrumentation procedures involving the thoracic spine.Copyright © 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

This condition may lead to kidney fibrosis with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation. Inhibition of chronic effects of kidney I/R injury may provide effective strategies for treating AKI and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is recognized as a powerful antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in many conditions. However, the effect of CGA on kidney I/R injury has not been elucidated yet. Kidney I/R injury was performed on male Swiss background mice (I/R group,  = , 3-4 months, 30-40 g) which underwent bilateral renal pedicles clamping for 30 minutes and then were euthanized on day three after operation. Three groups of I/R were treated with 3 different doses of CGA intraperitoneally for 2 days: 3. (I/R + CGA1 group), 7 (I/R + CGA2 group), and 14 (I/R + CGA3 group) mg/kg of body weight. Tubular injury was quantified based on Periodic Acid-Schiff staining, while reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of TGF-1, vimentin, SOD-1, TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB and MCP-1. Immunohistochemical staining was done to quantify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myofibroblast (-SMA), SOD-1 and macrophage (CD68) number. Kidney I/R demonstrated tubular injury and increased inflammatory mediator expression, macrophage number, and myofibroblast expansion. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed lower tubular injury with higher epithelial cell proliferation in CGA-treated groups compared to the I/R group. RT-PCR also revealed significantly lower TGF-1 and vimentin mRNA expressions with higher SOD-1 mRNA expression. CGA-treated groups also demonstrated a significantly lower macrophage and myofibroblast number compared to the I/R group. These findings associated with lower mRNA expression of TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MCP-1 as inflammatory mediators in CGA groups. I/R + CGA3 represented the highest amelioration effect among other CGA-treated groups.

Hence, PVA/PEI solutions were electrospun at different PVA/PEI mass ratios of 100/0, 85/15, 75/25, and 65/35. SEM observations illustrated the diameters of 125-161 nm for collected fibers. FTIR and DSC characterizations were utilized to examine microstructural changes of fibers. In-vitro drug release revealed that the amount of drug loaded in PVA/PEI fibers increased by enhancing PEI content due to abundant amine terminated groups as well as hollow interior between branches. The maximum concentration of released drug equal to 130.69 mg/L was achieved for PVA/PEI (75/25) fibers which is about 2. times higher than drug-loaded PVA fibers. An increase of 34% in drug release characteristic of fibrous structure comparing to as-cast film was also obtained at 24 h of immersion time. The decreased release rate of ibuprofen was shown for drug-loaded PVA and PVA/PEI fibers heat-treated at 140 °C and 120 °C, respectively. By assessing drug release mechanism through so-called Peppas kinetic model, it was found that heat treatment changed release mechanism from swelling-controlled to diffusion-controlled for drug-loaded PVA/PEI fibers. Overall, ibuprofen-loaded PVA/PEI fibrous membrane presents a substantial potential for drug delivery systems with anti- and analgesic-eluting applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657332>[Effects of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (CORM-2) on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats.140 healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into sham operation (Sham) group, model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, inactivated carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (iCORM) pretreatment group, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group by random number table, with 28 rats in each group. The rat sepsis model was reproduced by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The rats in the Sham group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of normal saline (NS). The rats in the CORM-2 and iCORM-2 pretreatment groups were injected intraperitoneally with 8 mg/kg CORM-2 or iCORM-2 at 1 hour before LPS injection, respectively, and those in the DMSO group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of DMSO, but the rats in the Sham group and the model group were not treated after injection of NS or LPS. Twenty rats were randomly selected from each group to observe 10-day survival rate. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the remaining 8 rats at 12 hours after modeling, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) were calculated to evaluate heart function. The blood of the inferior vena cava was harvested, then serum myocardial troponin I (cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then the rats were sacrificed, and the myocardial tissues were harvested, the pathological morphology and ultrastructure of myocardium were observed.(1) Survival rates: all rats in the Sham group survived; compared with the Sham group, the survival rates of the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were significantly decreased at 10 days [10% (2/20), 70% (14/20), 25% (/20), 15% (3/20) vs. 100% (20/20), all P < 0.01]. However, the 10-day survival rate in the CORM-2 pretreatment group was significantly higher than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group (all P < 0.01). (2) Cardiac function: compared with the Sham group, LVEF and LVFS in the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were significantly decreased, and left ventricular dilatation was obvious, indicating myocardial dysfunction in rats. However, LVEF and LVFS in the CORM-2 pretreatment group were significantly higher than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group, and DMSO control group [LVEF: 0.760±0.029 vs. 0.634±0.021, 0.629±0.066, 0.673±0.023; LVFS: (39.32±2.38)% vs. (29.75±1.52)%, (29.61±4.15)%, (32.43±1.66)%, all P < 0.05], and the left ventricular dilatation in the septic rats was attenuated. (3) Myocardial injury markers: compared with the Sham group, serum cTnI and BNP levels were significantly higher in the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group. However, the levels of cTnI and BNP in the CORM-2 pretreatment group were significantly lower than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group [cTnI (ng/L): 3 283.54±803.50 vs. 6 449.18±1 105.10,  919.21±1 068.27, 6 349.80±1 153.08; BNP (ng/L): 3 456.62±905.85 vs. 6 070.18±1 287.62,  581.13±1 161.17,  974.89±988.89, all P < 0.05]. (4) Myocardial histopathological observation: optical microscope showed that the pathological changes in myocardial tissue of the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were severe. Transmission electron microscopy showed mitochondrial swelling, and some vacuoles changed. But the myocardial pathological morphology and mitochondrial ultrastructural integrity of the CORM-2 pretreatment group were significantly better than other groups of sepsis.CORM-2 can attenuate myocardial dysfunction and improve survival rate of septic rats, especially to protect myocardial mitochondrial integrity in sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657327>[Epidemiological comparison between the new and the old diagnostic criteria for sepsis: a retrospective cohort study based on the database of Beijing Public Health Information System].</a></h2><p>To describe and compare the epidemiology of Sepsis-1 and Sepsis-3 in Yuetan Subdistrict of Beijing, and to estimate the incidence of Sepsis-3 in China.A population-based cohort study was conducted.

According to the clinical data of these patients, patients with Sepsis-1 and Sepsis-3 were enrolled in this analysis and the demographic characteristics of them were compared. Incidence and in-hospital mortality was calculated. Logistic regression method was used to analyze the risk factors of sepsis.Compared with non-septic patients with infections, patients with Sepsis-1 or Sepsis-3 were more likely to be male, older, had more comorbidities and lower body mass index (BMI), had more lower respiratory tract infections, more intra-abdominal infections and more blood flow infections, but had fewer urogenital tract infections, fewer upper respiratory tract infections, fewer gastrointestinal infections and fewer skin and soft tissue infections, and had pure prognosis with longer length of hospital stay [days, Sepsis-1 compared with non-Sepsis-1: 18 (10, 34) vs. 14 (9, 22), Sepsis-3 compared with non-Sepsis-3: 20 (11, 39) vs. 14 (9, 25)] and higher mortality [Sepsis-1 compared with non-Sepsis-1: 20.6% (353/1 716) vs. 2.% (44/1 733), Sepsis-3 compared with non-Sepsis-3: 32.0% (299/935) vs. 3.9% (98/2 514), all P < 0.01]. Logistic regression analysis showed that male, elder (age ≥ 65 years old), low BMI, bed-rest state, and combined with cerebrovascular disease and hematological malignancies were risk factors for Sepsis-1 [all odds ratio (OR) > 1, all P < 0.05], while the male, elder (age ≥ 65 years old), low BMI, bed-rest state, and combined with cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic immune disease, malignant diseases of blood system and dementia were risk factors for Sepsis-3 (all OR > 1, all P < 0.05).

In particular, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a public health problem along with the increase of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. Based on this fact, our study goaled to synthesize newly hybrid drugs containing heterocyclic rings incorporated to steroid moiety and to examine the potential antitumor activity of the newly designed heterosteroid derivatives against HCC induced in animal model. Several heterocyclic steroids were synthesized 2-7 and confirmed via the analytical and spectral data (IR, 1H NMR13C NMR and Mass spectroscopy). Compounds 3, 4, and  were chosen to be investigated as anticancer agents in HCC rat model by means of validated biomarkers (alfa -fetoprotein, endoglin, lipocali-2 and heat shock protein-70). Following administration of compounds 3, 4 or , availability of the active tumor marker molecules was significantly dropped and a substantial decrease of the angiogenic and inflammatory mediators was also evident. These findings were supported by the histological examination of liver tissue. Taken together, this study indicates the potential anticancer activity of the newly synthesized heterosteroid derivatives against HCC in vivo. The antitumor activity of these compounds was likely attributable to modulating some signal transduction pathways involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673534>Endogenously increased n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice do not protect from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Possible reasons for the NAFLD epidemic in industrialized countries are the high intake of pro-inflammatory n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) and low consumption of healthy n-3 PUFAs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 PUFAs may have the potential to alleviate chronic liver disease. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effect of increased n-3 PUFA tissue levels in fat-1 transgenic mice on progressive NASH.Disease was induced in mice by streptozotocin and high fat diet (STZ/HFD) resulting in NASH. NAFLD in 6 and 8 weeks old wild type and fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice was analyzed. Unlike all other mammals, fat-1 transgenic mice ubiquitously express an n-3 fatty acid desaturase, which converts n-6 to n-3 PUFAs, leading to increased n-3 and decreased n-6 PUFA tissue contents.Liver damage, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatic lipid accumulation and  were significantly reduced in fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice in the early (6 weeks) but not late (8 weeks) phase of NASH. Simultaneously, mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake and storage ( and , respectively) was significantly down-regulated in 6 week old but not 8 week old fat-1 transgenic STZ/HFD treated mice.Endogenously elevated n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice transiently delay the onset of STZ/HFD induced NASH but failed to efficiently protect from NASH development.2019 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

Subclinical atherosclerosis was evaluated with EFT by transthoracic echocardiography and cIMT by ultrasonography. Inflammatory markers including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hsCRP, and lipid profile were recorded. Also, atherogenic indices were calculated: Castelli risk index I and II (TG/HDL-c and LDL-c/HDL-c, respectively), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP; logarithm TG/HDL-c), non-HDL-c (TG-HDL-c), and atherogenic coefficient (AC; non-HDL-c/HDL-c).EFT was significantly higher in the CD group (0.49±0.10 vs. 0.49±0.09; p-value: 0.02). Although cIMT was higher in the patient group, it did not reach statistical significance (0.51±0.08, 0.47±0.08; p-value: 0.10). HDL cholesterol level was found to be significantly lower (42.0±8.8 vs. 50.0±13.7; p-value: 0.01), and the plasma atherogenic index was found to be significantly higher in the patient group (0.98±0.50 vs. 0.62±0.64; p-value: 0.02). hsCRP (3.51±3.18 vs. 1.92±1.40; p-value: 0.02) and ESR (17.2±12.8 with 9.7±3.1; p-value: 0.01) were found to be significantly higher in the CD group.

International guidelines (GINA 2019) have included the use of tiotropium bromide for chronic treatment of the most severe and frequently exacerbated asthma in patients ≥6 years old, who do not have good response to inhaled corticosteroids.To explore the role of tiotropium and its effect on PDCD5 level in a mouse model of chronic asthma.We divided 12 female mice into 2 groups: untreated asthma ( = 6) and tiotropium-treated asthma ( = 6). The impact of tiotropium was assessed by histology of lung tissue and morphometry. Pulmonary function was tested by using pressure sensors. The number of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was detected. Levels of PDCD5, active caspase-3, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2 (ChRM2) and M3 (ChRM3) were examined.Tiotropium treatment significantly reduced airway  and remodeling in asthmatic mice and intensified the lung function. PDCD5 level was reduced with tiotropium ( < 0.05). Moreover, active caspase-3 level was decreased with tiotropium ( < 0.001), and ChRM3 level was increased.Tiotropium treatment may alleviate the pathological changes with asthma by regulating apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 Juan Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668464>Structural and clinical impact of anti-allergy agents: An overview.</a></h2><p>Allergic disorders are markedly rising in industrialized countries. The identification of compounds that trigger the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent allergic reaction remain the means to improve the quality of life by limiting patient's exposure to critical allergens. Information concerning the treatment and onset of allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and bronchial asthma has been provided by the research over the past decade. Recent studies also indicated that allergic  is associated closely with their exacerbation and progression and indeed is the basic pathophysiology of allergic diseases. As a result of immunological and molecular biological studies our understanding of the mechanism of allergic  with regard to therapeutic agents has improved. While much effort has been paid to developing a new anti-allergic agent, the allergic disease has yet to be completely conquered. The more extensive research will allow the development of new therapeutics to combat allergic diseases. Currently, with respect to mechanism of action anti-allergy drugs are classified into five types including histamine H antagonists, leukotriene antagonists, Th cytokine inhibitors, thromboxane A inhibitors and mediator-release inhibitors. The use of two or more anti-allergy agents together is not acknowledged at present, but this will be the subject of research in the future because with different mechanisms of action anti-allergy agents used at the same time will theoretically increase their effects. This review article focuses on anti-allergy agents highlighting their applications, clinical trials and recent advancement on drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The associations between prediagnostic total WCC and its subtypes and risk of all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality were assessed. The role of WCC related with smoking and BMI on mortality was further explored. Multivariate Cox regression models were performed to estimate the HR and 95% CI.After an average follow-up of 15.8 years, a total of 936 death cases were identified (466 cancer; 179 CVD; 291 other causes). Statistically significant graded associations between total WCC, and counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils and risk of total mortality were observed. These associations were more apparent in current smokers. Strong associations for all-cause mortality or cancer mortality were observed in subjects with BMI ≥25 kg/m, ever smoking and elevated WCC (HR 3.92, 95% CI 2.76 to .57; HR 3.93, 95% CI 2.30 to 6.72). WCC partly mediated the associations between smoking or BMI and all-cause mortality.Prediagnostic WCC and its subtypes are associated with all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality risk.

It is a symptom of many chronic diseases, including cancer, liver failure, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and there is as yet no effective treatment. While the mechanisms underlying cachexia are complex, it is often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). Human placental extract (HPE) is a source of numerous biologically active molecules and has been used clinically to treat chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and other chronic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of HPE in an Ang II-induced cachexia model in mice. HPE treatment preserved both fat mass and lean body mass and suppressed weight loss in the cachexia model, though food intake was unaffected. Ang II infusion also caused cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. HPE suppressed these effects as well as Ang II-induced cardiac expression of genes related to heart failure and cardiac remodeling. HPE also reversed Ang II-induced downregulation of mitochondria-related molecules and suppressed cardiac  and oxidative stress. HPE administration may thus be an effective approach to the treatment of cachexia, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653948>Comparing modes of delivery of a combination of ion channel inhibitors for limiting secondary degeneration following partial optic nerve transection.</a></h2><p>Injury to the central nervous system is exacerbated by secondary degeneration. Previous research has shown that a combination of orally and locally administered ion channel inhibitors following partial optic nerve injury protects the myelin sheath and preserves function in the ventral optic nerve, vulnerable to secondary degeneration. However, local administration is often not clinically appropriate. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of systemic and local delivery of the ion channel inhibitor combination of lomerizine, brilliant blue G (BBG) and YM872, which inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels, P2X receptors and Ca permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy--methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors respectively. Following a partial optic nerve transection, adult female PVG rats were treated with BBG and YM872 delivered via osmotic mini pump directly to the injury site, or via intraperitoneal injection, both alongside oral administration of lomerizine. Myelin structure was preserved with both delivery modes of the ion channel inhibitor combination. However, there was no effect of treatment on , either peripherally or at the injury site, or on the density of oligodendroglial cells. Taken together, the data indicate that even at lower concentrations, the combinatorial treatment may be preserving myelin structure, and that systemic and local delivery are comparable at improving outcomes following neurotrauma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669424>EFFECTS OF PHONOPHORESIS WITH IBUPROFEN ASSOCIATED WITH GOLD NANOPARTICLES IN ANIMAL MODEL OF TRAUMATIC MUSCLE INJURY.</a></h2><p>The repair process consists of molecular and cellular events that can be accelerated by specific therapies.

Was used 80 male wistar rats divided into eight groups: Sham; Muscle injury (MI); MI + therapeutic pulsed ultrasound (TPU); MI + Ibuprofen (IBU); MI + GNPs; MI + TPU+ IBU; MI + TPU + GNPs and MI + TPU + IBU + GNPs. The lesion in the gastrocnemius was performed by a single direct trauma impact on the injured press. The animals were treated with pulsed ultrasound and the gel with gold nanoparticles and/or ibuprofen. The treatment was applied daily for  days and the first session was 12 hours after the muscle injury. The gastrocnemius muscle was surgically removed for analyzes biochemical, molecular and histological. In the analyzes only the MI + TPU + IBU + GNPs group showed a reduction in TNF-a and IL-1 levels, with a concomitant increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the analysis of oxidative stress, only the MI + TPU + IBU + GNPs group presented a reversal of the condition when compared to the MI group. In the histological analysis, the MI group presented a large cell infiltrate and a centralized nucleus and only the MI + TPU + IBU + GNPs group showed a structural improvement, also in the pain results the MI + TPU + IBU + GNPs showed a significant difference in comparison to the MI group (p<0.01). We believe that the effects of phonophoresis with anti-inflammatory drugs associated with gold nanoparticles may potentiate the reduction of the inflammatory response and regulate the cellular redox state.Copyright © 2019.

However, the biochemical linkage between the cysteine proteolytic activity of Makes Caterpillars Floppy-like (MCF) effector and its cellular effects remains unknown. In this study, we identify the host cell factors that activate in vivo and in vitro MCF autoprocessing as ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) and ADP-ribosylation Factor 3 (ARF3). Autoprocessing activity is enhanced when ARF1 is in its active (GTP-bound) form compared to the inactive (GDP-bound) form. Subsequent to auto-cleavage, MCF is acetylated on its exposed N-terminal glycine residue. Acetylation apparently does not dictate subcellular localization, as MCF is found localized throughout the cell. However, the cleaved form of MCF gains the ability to bind to the specialized lipid phosphatidylinositol -phosphate enriched in Golgi and other membranes necessary for endocytic trafficking, suggesting a fraction of MCF may be subcellular localized. Traditional thin-section electron microscopy, high-resolution cryoAPEX localization, and fluorescent microscopy show that MCF causes Golgi dispersal resulting in extensive vesiculation. In addition, host mitochondria are disrupted and fragmented. Mass spectrometry analysis found no reproducible modifications of ARF1 suggesting ARF1 is not post-translationally modified by MCF. Further, catalytically active MCF does not stably associate with ARF1. Our data indicate that ARF1 is a cross-kingdom activator of MCF, but also that MCF may mediate cytotoxicity by directly targeting another yet to be identified protein. This study begins to elucidate the biochemical activity of this important domain and gives insight into how it may promote disease progression.This article is protected by copyright.

Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0. mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10. μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the  of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

All patients were treated with the same 2-week course of prednisolone acetate 1% drops four times per day. The clinical parameters evaluated were surface dimensions determined by slitlamp biomicroscopy, cross-sectional dimensions determined by AS-OCT, and symptom scores determined by patient surveys. Pretreatment and 1-month posttreatment values were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Patients were followed up to 1 year after treatment.Twenty-two eyes from 22 patients (4 men and 18 women) with an average age of 37.7±8.8 (range, 27-57) years and an average duration of symptoms of 22 (range, -60) days were included. The average follow-up period was 14.7±0.8 (range, 12-22) months. Mean pretreatment horizontal length, vertical length, conjunctival thickness, and cross-sectional area were 2.4±0.69 mm, 2.0±0.6 mm, 1.82±0.60 μm, and .14±2.05 mm, respectively. Mean posttreatment horizontal length, vertical length, conjunctival thickness, and area were 1.93±0. mm, 1.52±0.6 mm, 1.03±0.46 μm, and 2.33±0.83 mm, respectively. Mean pretreatment and posttreatment dry eye symptom scores were 3.27±0.77 and 1.13±0.38, respectively. The median pretreatment and posttreatment changes were statistically significant by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for horizontal length (P<0.001), vertical length (P<0.001), conjunctival thickness (P=0.003), cross-sectional area (P=0.003), and dry eye symptom scores (P<0.001).Anterior segment optical coherence tomography allows the quantification of differences in the pingueculitis measurements before and after treatment. In this retrospective study, a short course of topical steroids effectively treated the  in a sustained manner. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography demonstrated significant reduction in the thickness and cross-sectional area of the pinguecula and a conversion back to a homogeneous conjunctival stroma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667580>Association of inflammatory biomarkers with long-term outcomes after curative surgery for mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory biomarkers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are reportedly predictive of the long-term outcomes of several cancers. We evaluated their correlations with the post-surgical long-term outcomes of patients with mass-forming (MF) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).The subjects of this study were 52 patients who underwent hepatic resection for MF-ICC at our hospital. We measured the cutoff values of NLR, LMR and PLR, using receiver operating characteristic curves, and compared the survival rates of patients with high vs. those with low values. We also evaluated a prognostic scoring system based on significant inflammatory biomarkers.The cutoff values for NLR, LMR, and PLR were 1.93, 4.78, and 98, respectively. The high-NLR and low-LMR groups had significantly worse prognoses than the low-NLR and high-LMR groups. We designed a scoring system using the  score (IS) based on NLR and LMR values, stratifying patients into three groups with scores of 0, 1, or 2. The IS was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS), with -year survival rates by the IS score of 100% for 0, 61% for 1, and 32% for 2 (P = 0.011). The IS was found to be an independent predictor of OS in multivariate analysis.Our IS scoring system may predict long-term outcomes after surgery for MF-ICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655532>IFN-? stimulated dental follicle mesenchymal stem cells regulate activated lymphocyte response in rheumatoid arthritis patients in vitro.</a></h2><p>Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been investigated in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. In this study, their immunosuppressive effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of RA patients were studied.Dental Follicle Stem Cells (DFSCs) were isolated from follicle tissue in the orofacial region. Characterization and multipotency analyses were performed. Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral venous blood of RA patients (n=) and healthy individuals (n=). DFSCs were pre-incubated with IFN-? for 48 hr. PBMCs of RA patients and healthy individuals were separately cultured with or without DFSCs for 72 hours. After the culture period, lymphocyte proliferation and viability, the frequency of CD4+ CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory cells, IL-10 and TNF-? levels in the culture supernatants were measured via flow cytometry.Our results demonstrated that DFSCs suppressed proliferation of T lymphocytes by increasing the number of FoxP3 expressing CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells and suppressed lymphocyte apoptosis in RA patients. Also, DFSCs reduced TNF-? cytokine secretion and upregulated IL-10 secreting cells.Such cells could potentially be a source for future immunomodulatory treatments of RA patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657330>[Application effect of 1-hour bundle in the treatment of patients with sepsis].</a></h2><p>To investigate the implementation and application effect of 1-hour bundle in the treatment of patients with sepsis.A convenient sampling method was conducted. 102 patients with sepsis admitted to central intensive care unit (ICU) of Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2018 to February 2019 were enrolled. Thirty-five patients with 3-hour and 6-hour bundle from January to September in 2018 were served as the control group, and 67 patients who received 1-hour bundle from October 2018 to February 2019 were served as the observation group. The patients in the control group was treated with 3-hour and 6-hour bundle according to 2012 international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock; and those in the observation group were treated and nursed according to the 1-hour bundle published by Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) update 2018, and the sepsis cluster treatment medical team was established. The team members were trained in relevant knowledge and discussed the possible obstacles within the team and propose feasible measures. The implementation of the 1-hour bundle in the observation group was recorded. The general data of the patients in both groups including gender, age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), etc. were collected, and the outcome indicators (duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, 28-day mortality) were observed.In the observation group, 37 of 67 patients receiving 1-hour bundle met the target, with the overall achievement rate of 55.2% (37/67). Of the 37 eligible patients,  patients receiving 1-hour bundle met the target before the training of 1-hour bundle, accounting for only 33.3% (/15) of the 15 patients who received 1-hour bundle during the same period. With the extension of training time, the achievement rate of sepsis 1-hour bundle was gradually increased [the achievement rate at 1 week and 4 weeks of training was 40.0% (4/10) and 52.4% (11/21), respectively], and increased to 81.0% (17/21) at the end of 12 weeks training. Thirty-seven patients who received 1-hour bundle and met the criteria were enrolled and compared with the control group. There was no significant difference in gender, age, or APACHE II score between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay of the observation group were significantly shortened (days: 6.15±0.49 vs. 7.24±0.53, days: 8.21±1.49 vs. 9.51±1.92), and the 28-day mortality was decreased significantly [10.8% (4/37) vs. 31.4% (11/35)], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05).Through teamwork, discussion and improvement, the achievement rate of sepsis 1-hour bundle can be significantly improved. The use of sepsis 1-hour bundle can effectively decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, and reduce the 28-day mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648774>Rates of hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism among patients with porcelain gallbladder.</a></h2><p>Porcelain gallbladder is characterized by calcification of the gallbladder wall, possibly associated chronic  from cholelithiasis. It is unknown whether porcelain gallbladder is associated with higher rates of hypercalcemia and/or hyperparathyroidism compared to cholelithiasis without porcelain gallbladder.We searched our patient database for patients with porcelain gallbladder on imaging and patients with cholelithiasis without porcelain gallbladder. We collected data on patient age, gender, calcium levels, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and medications/comorbidities known to cause hypercalcemia.1000 patients within our database had porcelain gallbladder on imaging. Of these, 661 (245 male) had at least one serum calcium value for analysis. These patients were matched by age and gender with 6610 patients with cholelithiasis who had at least one serum calcium value. Rates of recurrent/persistent hypercalcemia were higher among patients with porcelain gallbladder at 16.8% versus 11.1% (p < 0.01).

Inter-rater agreement of discomfort scores between endoscopist, patient and SSP was investigated using Cohen's Kappa statistic. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate the effects of patient and colonoscopy factors on comfort scores.SSPs had superior comfort score agreement with patients (0.638; 'moderate agreement') than endoscopists had with the same patients (0.526; 'weak agreement'). Male patients reported lower scores than female patients (OR 0.483, OR 0.499 [95% CI 0.344 to 0.723]; p<0.001). Endoscopists reported lower scores when there was better bowel prep (OR 0.512 [95% CI 0.279 to 0.938]; p=0.030). Agreement was worse at higher levels of discomfort.There is variability in perceived comfort levels between healthcare providers and patients during screening colonoscopy, which is greater at worse levels of discomfort. Endoscopists who undertake screening colonoscopies may wish to consider both patient and healthcare provider comfort scores in order to improve patient experience while ensuring optimal quality assurance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine -20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral regional oxygen saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth weight (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included. PK data was adequately described by one-compartmental linear structural model. Dobutamine clearance (CL) was described by allometric scaling on BW with sigmoidal maturation function of postmenstrual age (PMA). The final population PK model parameter mean typical value (standard error) estimates, standardised to median BW of 1618 g, were 41.2 (44.) l h for CL and .29 (0.821) l for volume of distribution, which shared a common between subject variability of 29(17.2) %. The relationship between dobutamine concentration and RVO/LVEF was described by linear model, between concentration and LVO/HR/MAP/cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction by sigmoidal E model.In postnatal transitional period PK of dobutamine was described by one-compartmental linear model, CL related to BW and PMA.

This study describes the proportion of patients with CAP and afebrile bacteremia and identifies the clinical characteristics predicting the necessity for BCs in afebrile patients.Bacteremia rates were determined in 4349 CAP patients enrolled in the multi-national cohort study CAPNETZ and stratified by presence of fever at first patient contact. Independent predictors of bacteremia in afebrile patients were determined retrospectively using logistic regression analysis.Bacteremic pneumonia was present in 190 of 2116 (8.9%) febrile patients, 101 of 2149 (4.7%) afebrile patients and 1 of 23 (4.3%) hypothermic patients. Bacteremia rates increased with the CURB-65 score from 3.% in patients with CURB-65 score of 0 to 17.1% in patients with CURB-65 score of 4. Patients with afebrile bacteremia exhibited the highest 28-day mortality rate (9.9%). Positive pneumococcal urinary antigen test (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-8.2), C-reactive protein >200 mg/l (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-.2) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≥30 mg/dl (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-.3) were independent positive predictors and antibiotic pre-treatment (AOR 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.6) was an independent negative predictor of bacteremia in afebrile patients.A relevant proportion of patients with bacteremic CAP was afebrile. These patients had an increased mortality rate compared to patients with febrile bacteremia or non-bacteremic pneumonia.

In view of this scenario, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) promoted and supported an international collaborative study (EULAR SS Task Force) aimed at developing the first EULAR evidence and consensus-based recommendations for the management of patients with SjS with topical and systemic medications. The aim was to develop a rational therapeutic approach to SjS patients useful for healthcare professionals, physicians undergoing specialist training, medical students, the pharmaceutical industry and drug regulatory organisations following the 2014 EULAR standardised operating procedures. The Task Force (TF) included specialists in rheumatology, internal medicine, oral health, ophthalmology, gynaecology, dermatology and epidemiology, statisticians, general practitioners, nurses and patient representatives from 30 countries of the  continents. Evidence was collected from studies including primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002/2016 criteria; when no evidence was available, evidence from studies including associated SjS or patients fulfilling previous sets of criteria was considered and extrapolated. The TF endorsed the presentation of general principles for the management of patients with SjS as three overarching, general consensus-based recommendations and 12 specific recommendations that form a logical sequence, starting with the management of the central triplet of symptoms (dryness, fatigue and pain) followed by the management of systemic disease. The recommendations address the use of topical oral (saliva substitutes) and ocular (artificial tear drops, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical corticosteroids, topical CyA, serum tear drops) therapies, oral muscarinic agonists (pilocarpine, cevimeline), hydroxychloroquine, oral glucocorticoids, synthetic immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, leflunomide and mycophenolate), and biological therapies (rituximab, abatacept and belimumab). For each recommendation, levels of evidence (mostly modest) and TF agreement (mostly very high) are provided. The 2019 EULAR recommendations are based on the evidence collected in the last 16 years in the management of primary 2002 SjS patients and on discussions between a large and broadly international TF. The recommendations synthesise current thinking on SjS treatment in a set of overarching principles and recommendations. We hope that the current recommendations will be broadly applied in clinical practice and/or serve as a template for national societies to develop local recommendations.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant microbiota of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut microbiota physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral microbiota could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of microbiota to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade , cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut microbiota close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with  mg iron (2. mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2. mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7. g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.-9. months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut , iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut microbiota. There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut microbiota response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659742>Impact of active smoking on the immature platelet fraction and its relationship with the extent of coronary artery disease.</a></h2><p>Smoking represents a major cardiovascular risk factor, due to the induction of oxidative stress and low-grade, continuous,  that contribute to promoteatherothrombosis. However, the mechanisms leading to increased platelet aggregability associated with smoking are only partially defined. A potential role has been hypothesized for immature platelets, a younger and potentially more reactive fraction, previously associated to the main determinants of coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, the aim of our study was to define the impact of smoking on the immature platelet fraction (IPF) and its relationship with prevalence and extent of coronary artery disease.We enrolled a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in a single center. Significant CAD was defined as at least 1 vessel stenosis >50%, while severe CAD was defined as left main and/or three-vessel disease. IPF was measured at admission by routine blood cells count (A Sysmex XE-2100).We included in our study 2553 patients, that were divided according smoking status (active smokers: 512; non-active smokers: 2041). Smokers were younger, more frequent males, with lower rate of diabetes mellitus, previous PCI, previous CABG (p<0.001, respectively) and were in treatment less often with ARB, BB, nitrates, statins, ASA, Clopidogrel, CCB, diuretics (p<0.001, respectively) as compared to non-active smokers. Higher percentage of smokers was observed in patients with higher IPF values, and at multivariate analysis active smoking resulted an independent predictor of higher IPF (adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.59[1.03-2.45] P=0.035). Among smokers, higher IPF were associated to lower ejection fraction (p=0.034), percentage of acute coronary syndrome (p=0.002) and platelet count (p<0.001) compared to ones with lower IPF. However, the IPF (according to quartiles values) were not associated to the prevalence and extent of CAD (82.%, 80.4%, 86.1%, 80.9%, from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively,adjusted OR[95%CI]=0.98[0.79-1.23] P=0.89) and severe CAD (31%, 31.1%, 39.1%, 35.2%,from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively, adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.03[0.86-1.23] P=0.76).The present study shows an independent association between active smoking and the levels of immature platelet fraction in patients undergoing coronary angiography. However, among active smokers, IPF did not result an independent predictor of CAD or severe CAD.© 2019 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650014>A single systemic inflammatory insult causes acute motor deficits and accelerates disease progression in a mouse model of human tauopathy.</a></h2><p>Neuroinflammation, which contributes to neurodegeneration, is a consistent hallmark of dementia. Emerging evidence suggests that systemic  also contributes to disease progression.The ability of systemically administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS - 500 μg/kg) to effect acute and chronic behavioural changes in C57BL/6 and P301S tauopathy mice was assessed.

Systemic LPS treatment induced exaggerated acute sickness behaviour and motor dysfunction in P301S mice compared with wild-type controls and advanced the onset and accelerated chronic decline. LPS treatment was associated with increased tau pathology 24 hours after LPS injection and spinal cord microgliosis at the end stage.This is the first demonstration that a single systemic inflammatory episode causes exaggerated acute functional impairments and accelerates the long-term trajectory of functional decline associated with neurodegeneration in a mouse model of human tauopathy.

We hypothesize that exogenous VIP administration has a beneficial effect in NEC.NEC was induced in C57BL/6 mice by gavage feeding, hypoxia, and lipopolysaccharide administration between postnatal day (P)  and 9. There were four studied groups: Control (n = 6): Breast feeding without stress factors; Control + VIP (n = ): Breast feeding + intraperitoneal VIP injection once a day from P5 to P9; NEC (n = 9): mice exposed to NEC induction; NEC + VIP (n = 9): NEC induction + intraperitoneal VIP injection. Terminal ileum was harvested on P9. NEC severity, intestinal , (IL-6 and TNFα), and Tight junctions (Claudin-3) were evaluated.NEC severity and intestinal  were significantly decreased in NEC + VIP compared to NEC. Tight junction expression was significantly increased in NEC + VIP compared to NEC.VIP administration has a beneficial therapeutic effect in NEC by reducing  and tight junction disruption.Copyright © 2019.

In particular, omentin-1, a newly found adipokine, has been reported to exhibit anti-calcification effects  and . However, little is known about the function of endogenous adipose tissue-derived omentin-1 in arterial calcification and the detailed mechanism involved. Here, we demonstrated that global omentin-1 knockout (omentin-1) resulted in more obvious arterial calcification in /6-nephrectomy plus high phosphate diet treated (/6 NTP) mice while overexpression of omentin-1 attenuated attenuates osteoblastic differentiation and mineralisation of VSMCs  and /6 NTP-induced mice arterial calcification . Moreover, we found that omentin-1 induced AMPK and Akt activation while inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt signaling reversed the anti-calcification effect induced by omentin-1 both  and .

The class III NAD-sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is an important negative regulator of ; however, SIRT1 activity following lung transplant has not been studied. We hypothesized that SIRT1 expression is decreased in proinflammatory lymphocytes following lung transplant and that treatment with SIRT1 activators (resveratrol, curcumin) and agents that prevent NAD depletion (theophylline) upregulate SIRT1 and reduce proinflammatory cytokine expression in these cells.Intracellular proinflammatory cytokines and SIRT1 were measured in blood T, natural killer T-like cell (NKT-like), and natural killer (NK) cells from patients with BOS (n = 10), stable lung transplant patients (n = 11), and healthy aged-matched controls (n = 10). Blood was cultured in the presence of ±25 µM resveratrol, ±1 µM curcumin, ± mg/L theophylline, ±1µM prednisolone and cytokines, and SIRT1 assessed using flow cytometry.There was a loss of SIRT1 in T, NK-like, and NK cells in BOS patients compared with stable patients and controls (%CD8 SIRT1 T cells: 17 ± 10; 37 ± 10; 30 ± 10) (mean ± SEM BOS, stable, control, respectively) (P < 0.05 for all). Loss of SIRT1 was associated with increased T, NKT-like, and NK cells expressing interferon (IFN)γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α. SIRT1 expression by T cells significantly associated with FEV1 (R = 0.655, P = 0.006) and with time posttransplant (R = -0.552, P = 0.041). All treatments upregulated SIRT1 and inhibited IFNγ and TNFα production by T, NK, and NKT-like cells additively.BOS is associated with decreased SIRT1 in peripheral blood proinflammatory T, NK, and NKT-like lymphocytes following lung transplant.

Patients with high FRS had low BMD (p < 0.001). Low tertile of BMD (sHR, 1.53), BMD (sHR 1.54) and BMD (sHR 1.60) associated with increased all-cause mortality whereas no such associations were found for the trabecular bone rich sites BMD arm, leg, trunk, rib or spine. Low tertile of BMD (sHR 1.94), BMD (sHR 1.68), BMD (sHR 2.25) and BMD (sHR 2.45) associated with increased CVD mortality whereas BMD at other sites did not associate with CVD mortality.Low head and pelvis BMD, and low total BMD, as assessed by whole-body DXA, were independent predictors of increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality.

The cornerstone of eczema management is to repair and maintain skin barrier and hydration, as well as to reduce . Wet wrap therapy (WWT) is a widely used adjunct to achieve this. The conventional material used for WWT is viscose, which presents drawbacks including discomfort, high cost, and poor durability. Here, we explore the possibility of using customized nanotextile (nanopolyester) for WWT, hoping to prove that this material is non-inferior to viscose in clinical effectiveness and patient acceptance.Patients aged 0-18 years with moderate to severe eczema were randomized to receive either viscose (Tubifast™) or nanotextile for WWT. Patients were instructed to apply WWT daily overnight for 2 weeks. Patients' disease severity score (IGA, SCORAD) and quality of life (QoL) score (IDQOL/CDLQI) were measured on day 0, 7, and 14 of treatment. Patient survey was conducted to collect patients' feedback about garment use.Fifty-three children aged 7 months to 17 years were recruited (27 in Tubifast™ and 26 in nanotextile group). Patients in both groups showed significant improvement in disease severity and QoL from baseline (P < .001), and such improvement was similar in both groups. However, nanotextile garment was significantly more comfortable (2.73/10 vs .12/10, P = .001), easier to wear (2.78/10 vs .24/10, P = .003), and cooler (2.43/10 vs 3.96/10, P = .033) from patients' feedback.This study demonstrates that nanomaterial is as effective as conventional viscose in WWT, while superior in patient acceptability. Nanotextile for WWT has good potential in eczema management, especially in patients with suboptimal response to topicals alone.© 2019 The Authors.

Sterile endophthalmitis uncommonly complicates office-based IVTA injection. The authors report a new complication of IVTA depot injection at the end of PPV.Retrospective records review of all patients treated at the Cincinnati Eye Institute with PPV between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017, who developed a triad of sterile endophthalmitis, atrophic retinal breaks under the depot IVTA in the inferior retina, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Eyes with flap tears, solely superior breaks, or stretch holes from proliferative vitreoretinopathy causing RRD were excluded.Eight eyes of eight patients (four males and four females; mean age: 73.7 years) who received 4 mg or 8 mg IVTA depot at the end of PPV surgery presented at a mean of 23. days following PPV with RRD (one macula-involving, seven macula-sparing), requiring treatment with PPV in six eyes and laser retinopexy alone in two eyes. Seven eyes that underwent membrane peeling (MP) received IVT to prevent cystoid macular edema (CME) and one eye with prior MP was treated for CME. Mean vitreous  was 2+ cell at 1 week postoperatively. Two patients had documented sterile endophthalmitis within the first week requiring vitreous cultures and antibiotics injections. Visual acuity (VA) for eyes requiring PPV for RD repair declined from 20/90 preoperatively to 20/212 at 6 months postoperatively. VA for eyes amenable to laser alone improved from 20/53 to 20/35. All eyes remained attached, with the exception of one patient who refused further treatment after developing recurrent detachment from PVR.Particle-induced sterile endophthalmitis from IVTA depot at the end of PPV surgery resulted in atrophic inferior retinal breaks and RRD as a newly described entity coined "erosive retinopathy." All retinal detachment surgeries required silicone oil tamponade. Poor visual outcome at 6 months was common for eyes requiring PPV for RD repair.

We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of -oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

Forty patients were randomized in two study arms, in which bowel purgation was performed either before or after PET-MR enterography. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsies after PET-MR within 24 h. Diagnostic performance of MR morphological parameters (MRmorph), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET in detecting histological  determined by the Nancy index was compared with each other and between study arms. Correlation between PET and histological inflammatory severity was calculated.In study arm without previous bowel purgation, SUV ratio of bowel segment (relative to SUV of the liver) facilitated the highest specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared with MRmorph and DWI. Bowel cleansing led to markedly increased metabolic activity of bowel segments, resulting in significantly reduced specificity of PET compared with study arm without purgation (0.808 vs. 0.966, p = 0.007, respectively). Inter-observer concordance for assessing MRmorph was clearly increased after bowel cleansing (Cohen's κ, 0.847 vs. 0.665; p = 0.013, respectively), though diagnostic performance of MRmorph was not significantly improved. Our findings suggested that the change of metabolic status was mainly associated with the grade of neutrophil infiltrate and less dependent on chronic infiltrate.PET-MR enterography was an excellent non-invasive diagnostic method in the assessment of histological active  in ulcerative colitis without the need of previous bowel purgation.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651121>Serum zinc levels in seborrheic dermatitis: a case-control study</a></h2><p>Malassezia  colonization,  sebaceous  gland  activity,  hormones,  immune  system  defects,  environmental  factors,  and  the interactions between these factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis (SD).

Preclinical studies suggest that the host response to an injurious challenge is age-dependent. In ARDS patients, we investigated whether the association between age and mortality is mediated through age-related differences in the host response.This was a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, performed in the ICUs of two university-affiliated hospitals. The systemic host response was characterized in three predefined age-groups, based on the age-tertiles of the studied population: young (18 to 54 years, N = 209), middle-aged (55 to 67 years, N = 213), and elderly (67 years and older, N = 196). Biomarkers of , endothelial activation, and coagulation were determined in plasma obtained at the onset of ARDS. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. A mediation analysis was performed to examine whether age-related differences in biomarker levels serve as potential causal pathways mediating the association between age and mortality.Ninety-day mortality rates were 30% (63/209) in young, 37% (78/213) in middle-aged, and 43% (84/196) in elderly patients. Middle-aged and elderly patients had a higher risk of death compared to young patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1. [95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.3] and 2.1 [1.4 to 3.4], respectively). Relative to young patients, the elderly had significantly lower systemic levels of biomarkers of  and endothelial activation. Tissue plasminogen activator, a marker of coagulation, was the only biomarker that showed partial mediation (proportion of mediation, 10 [1 to 28] %).Little evidence was found that the association between age and mortality in ARDS patients is mediated through age-dependent differences in host response pathways.

In this study, a double-TRAP 5a/5b sandwich ELISA measuring 5a and 5b protein in the same sample was developed. TRAP 5a and 5b protein levels were evaluated as osteoclast differentiation/activity markers in serum and in culture, and their correlation to the resorption marker CTX-I was examined. Serum TRAP 5a and 5b concentrations in healthy men were 4.4 ± 0.6 ng/ml and 1.3 ± 0.2 ng/ml, respectively, and they correlated moderately to each other suggesting that their secretion is coupled under healthy conditions. A correlation was also observed between serum TRAP 5a and 5b with CTX-I, suggesting that both TRAP isoforms associate with osteoclast number. During osteoclast differentiation on plastic/bone, predominantly 5b increased in media/lysate from M-CSF/RANKL-stimulated CD14+ PBMCs. However, substantial levels of 5a were detected at later stages suggesting that both isoforms are secreted from differentiating OCs. More TRAP 5b was released on bone indicating a connection to osteoclast resorptive activity, and a peak in TRAP 5b/5a-ratio coincided with rapid CTX-I release. At the end of the culture period of M-CSF + RANKL-stimulated CD14+ PBMCs, there was a correlation between the secretion of TRAP 5a and 5b proteins with CTX-I. The correlation of not only 5b but also 5a with collagen degradation, both in serum and osteoclast cultures indicates that a considerable proportion of the TRAP 5a originates from osteoclasts and may reflect a hitherto undisclosed regulatory mechanism during bone resorption and bone remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655147>In-vitro and in-vivo anti-breast cancer activity of OEO (Oliveria decumbens vent essential oil) through promoting the apoptosis and immunomodulatory effects.</a></h2><p>Oliveria decumbens vent is a valuable plant in Iran, used as a vegetable.

To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of OEO on 4T1 cancer monolayer cells (2D culture) and spheroids (3D cultures), MTT (3-(4, -Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used. Fluorescence staining, various flow cytometry techniques, colorimetric assay, electrophoresis, and comet assay were performed to understand the anti-cancer mechanisms of OEO and determine the death mode in treated 4T1 cells. In animal studies, mouse mammary tumor model was established, the anti-tumor effect of OEO was investigated and ultimately by using the ELISA cytokine assay, immunostimulatory of OEO was studied.According to GC/MS analysis, thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene were identified as main components of OEO. Based on MTT assay, OEO inhibited viability in 4T1 cancer cell without any significant effect on L929 normal cells in 2D, also the anti-proliferative effects of OEO on 4T1 spheroids (3D) was significant but less extent. Our results revealed that OEO induces apoptosis through ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) disruption, caspase3 activation, and DNA damage. Evaluating the effectiveness of OEO on 4T1 tumor-challenging mice and cytokine assay confirmed anti-tumor effects of OEO and development of an immune response related to Th1 expansion.These data shed light on the apoptotic mechanisms related to OEO cytotoxicity and introduced this compound as a candidate in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019.

However, whether different signalling pathways regulate these two inflammatory factors remains unclear. The protein kinase C (PKC) family is involved in the regulation of , and our previous research showed that the activation of the PKC pathway played a key role in the LPS-induced transformation of the adenosine A receptor (AR) from anti-inflammatory activity to pro-inflammatory activity under high glutamate concentrations. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the role of PKC in the LPS-induced production of these inflammatory cytokines in mouse primary microglia. GF109203X, a specific PKC inhibitor, inhibited the LPS-induced expression of IL-1β messenger ribonucleic acid and intracellular protein in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover,  µM GF109203X prevented LPS-induced IL-1β expression but did not significantly affect LPS-induced TNF-α expression. PKC promoted IL-1β expression by regulating the activity of NF-κB but did not significantly impact the activity of ERK1/2. AR activation by CGS21680, an AR agonist, facilitated LPS-induced IL-1β expression through the PKC pathway at high glutamate concentrations but did not significantly affect LPS-induced TNF-α expression.

Implications by their presence in aquatic and soil ecosystems have been well studied and documented, but less attention has been paid on airborne microplastics (MPs). Studies concerning airborne microplastics started from 2016 and only a few (n = 13) have been published to date. Although, studies may increase in the following years, since air is very important for human survival. Microplastics have been observed in atmospheric fallouts in indoor and outdoor environments using a sampling or vacuum pump, rain sampler, and/or particulate fallout collector. Identification and quantification have been carried out by visual, spectroscopic, and spectrometric techniques. Factors such as meteorological, climatic, and anthropogenic influence the distribution and movement of airborne MP. Human exposure may be through inhalation, dermal, and open meal during fallout, with their potential biopersistence and translocation. Ingestion may cause localized  and cancer due to responses by the immune cells, especially in individuals with compromised metabolism and poor clearance mechanisms. Ecological risks involve possible contamination of the ecosystem through a dynamic relationship of MPs in soil, water, and air forming a MP contamination cycle.

Cells have well-defined different membrane-surrounded organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, etc., however, on demand they can create membrane-less organelles as stress granules, nucleoli and P bodies to cover vital functions and regulatory activities. However, the mechanism of intracellular molecule assembly into functional compartments within a living cell remains till now not fully understood. (Soft Matter 2019, 15 (6):1135-1154). In vitro and in vivo investigations unveiled that MLOs emerge after preceding liquid-liquid, liquid-gel, liquid-semi-crystalline, or liquid-crystalline phase separations. Liquid-liquid and liquid-gel MLOs form the majority of cellular phase separation events, while the occurrence of micro-sized crystals in cells was only rarely observed, however can be considered as a result of a preceding protein phase separation event. In vivo, also known and termed as in cellulo crystals, are reported since 1853 (Botanische Zeitung, 13, 881-8 821 855; CR Mem. Soc. Biol. , 450-454, 1853). In some cases, they have been linked to vital cellular functions, such as storage and detoxification. However, the occurrence of in cellulo crystals is also associated to diseases like cataract, hemoglobin C diseases etc. (Biology Chemistry De Gruyter 2018, 399 (7):751-752).

The diabetes was induced in 6-7 week-old male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. After 70 days the wounds were created on the back of the rats and then, once a day for 21 days, the dressing containing lanolin ointment, 10% of keratin scaffolds and 1mM of AWL3106 or biphalin was applied. The wounds histology were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The orientation and organization of collagen was analyzed by Masson trichome staining. The number of macrophages, blood vessels and fibroblasts were visualized by CD68, CD34 and vimentin immunoreactivity, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the wound area of AWL3106- and biphalin-treated groups was greatly reduced (up to 47% on the 7 day) in comparison with untreated diabetic groups. The immunohistochemical staining of macrophages demonstrated that AWL3106 and biphalin accelerated inflammatory progression and subsequently decreased persistent . The histological analysis showed that the structure of tissue in the groups under the study was very similar to the one of wound tissue in N-DM group. The H&E and Masson trichome staining demonstrated that the orientation and organization of collagen as well as the number and shape of blood vessels were better in 3106- and BIF-treated group than in DM group. In conclusion, the obtained data suggested that our hybrid peptides enhanced wound healing, particularly by accelerating the inflammatory phase and promoted the wound closure.

These decisions are currently based on the prevalence of trachomatous -follicular (TF), which, after MDA, correlates poorly with prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection.Impact surveys in six evaluation units (EUs) of Malawi were used as a platform to explore associations between the prevalence of TF, ocular C. trachomatis infection and anti-Pgp3 antibodies one year after the third annual round of MDA. Participants were examined for trachoma using the World Health Organization simplified grading system. Ocular swabs and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from children aged 1-9 years. Swabs were tested for C. trachomatis DNA using GeneXpert. DBS were assayed for anti-Pgp3 antibodies using ELISA. EU-level prevalence of TF in children aged 1-9 years ranged from 4.7% (95% CI 3.4-6.3) to 7.2% (95% CI .8-8.9). Prevalence of C. trachomatis infection in children ranged from 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.6) to 0.7% (95% CI 0.3-1.3) while Pgp3 seroprevalence ranged from 6.9% (95% CI .4-8.6) to 12.0% (95% CI 10.1-14.0) and increased with age.Based on current global policy, the prevalence of TF indicates that a further year of antibiotic MDA is warranted in four of six EUs yet the very low levels of infection cast doubt on the universal applicability of TF-based cut-offs for antibiotic MDA. Pgp3 seroprevalence was similar to that reported following MDA in other settings that have reached the elimination target however the predictive value of any particular level of seropositivity with respect to risk of subsequent infection recrudescence is, as yet, unknown.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671184>Selective small-molecule EPAC activators.</a></h2><p>The cellular signalling enzymes, EPAC1 and EPAC2, have emerged as key intracellular sensors of the secondary messenger cyclic 3','-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) alongside protein kinase A.

Measurements of circulating -related biomarkers may inform etiology or provide non-invasive signatures for early diagnosis. We therefore examined levels of  molecules for associations with ESCC risk. Using a case-cohort study designed within the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, we measured baseline plasma levels of 92 biomarkers using a multiplex assay in a subcohort of 410 randomly selected participants and 66 participants with incident ESCC (including 4 cases that occurred in the subcohort). ESCC hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for 2-4 quantiles of each biomarker by Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as the time metric, adjusted for sex, smoking and alcohol use. Twenty analytes were undetectable in nearly all samples. Of the remaining 72, 12 biomarkers (FGF19, ST1A1, STAMBP, AXIN1, CASP8, NT3, CD6, CDCP1, CD5, SLAMF1, OPG and CSF1) were associated with increased ESCC risk (P <0.05) with HRs per quantile 1.28-1.65. Seven biomarkers (CXCL6, CCL23, CXCL5, TGFA, CXCL1, OSM and CCL4) were inversely associated with HRs 0.57-0.72. FGF19, CASP8, STAMBP, ST1A1 and CCL-4 met statistical significance with false discovery rate correction. Associations did not differ < vs. ≥ years between blood collection and ESCC diagnosis. CASP8, STAMBP and ST1A1 were strongly correlated (p<0.05). This study expands the range of  molecules associated with the development of this highly lethal neoplasia. Correlations among these novel biomarkers suggest a possible shared pathway. These findings need replication and could further delineate ESCC's molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis.

All patients had follow-up biopsy (Bx) after treatment.33 (9.1%) patients had diagnosis of AMR. Mean follow-up was 35 ± 20 months. 28.% of patients had poor clinical progression at the last follow-up. Of the 25 patients with functional grafts, the mean serum creatinine was 1.6 ± 0.6 mg/dL for live and 2.1 ± 1.0 mg/dL for deceased transplant recipients. In diagnostic biopsies, there were 61% MTR. In follow-up Bx, after treatment, both C4d positivity and the severity of rejection had decreased while the mean chronic allograft damage index (CADI) score and transplant glomerulopathy showed an increase.With effective antibody mediated rejection (AMR) therapy, renal function parameters were significantly improved. Histologically, improvement in tubulointerstitial  may be responsible for this process.

Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from artisanal cashew nut roasting, an important economic activity worldwide, was investigated. This study focused on: i) chemical characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated (oxy-) PAHs; ii) intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); iii) genotoxic effects and time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA damage signaling, and iv) differential expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, , cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, using A549 lung cells. Among the PAHs, chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benz[a]anthracene showed the highest concentrations (7.8-10 ng/m), while benzanthrone and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant oxy-PAHs. Testing of PM extracts was based on B[a]P equivalent doses (B[a]P). IC values for viability were .7 and 3.0 nM B[a]P at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. At these low doses, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of ROS, genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) and DNA damage signaling (phosphorylation of the protein checkpoint kinase 1 - Chk1). In comparison, effects of B[a]P alone was observed at micromolar range. To our knowledge, no previous study has demonstrated an activation of pChk1, a biomarker used to estimate the carcinogenic potency of PAHs in vitro, in lung cells exposed to cashew nut roasting extracts. Sustained induction of expression of several important stress response mediators of xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), ROS and pro-inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-2, COX2), and DNA damage response (CDKN1A and DDB2) was also identified. In conclusion, our data show high potency of cashew nut roasting PM to induce cellular stress including genotoxicity, and more potently when compared to B[a]P alone. Our study provides new data that will help elucidate the toxic effects of low-levels of PAH mixtures from air PM generated by cashew nut roasting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In Experiment 1, 16 male lambs were injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) at an initial dose of 0.25, 1.25, and 2. μg/kg body weight (BW) for 9 days. Average daily gain and blood parameters were measured and clinical symptoms were recorded. In Experiment 2, 20 male lambs were injected intravenously with LPS (0 mg/kg) + Res (0 mg), LPS (2. μg /kg) + Res (0 mg, 82. mg, 165 mg, 330 mg), 4 h after LPS injection. Jugular blood was collected from each lamb to determine white blood cell (WBC) counts and the expression of inflammatory genes. In Experiment 1, all LPS-treated lambs showed clinical signs of sickness including rhinorrhea, lethargy, and shivering, and systemic inflammatory responses of increased inflammatory genes levels and cortisol concentration. The lambs had increased respiratory and heart rates and rectal temperature and decreased average daily gain and feed intake. In Experiment 2, resveratrol significantly reduced WBCs and the expression levels of several genes associated with  response (, , ) and inhibited the signaling cascades of  and MAPKs by down-regulating the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (, , , , ) induced by LPS.

Nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional regulator of several phase II antioxidant genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). In this study, it was hypothesized that Crocin may mediate antioxidant signaling pathway to protect human lung epithelial cells against CS-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress via inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and activation of Nrf2 pathway. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to 1, 2. and % cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) with or without Crocin (500 μM). After 48 h exposure, the cytotoxicity, oxidant/antioxidant parameters and the Nrf2 pathway modification were assayed. Treatment of A549 cells with all concentrations of CSE dose dependently decreased cell viability, antioxidant levels, GCL and Nrf2 gene expression, which was associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species. Crocin not only restored CSE-depleted GSH levels by enhancing GCL expression via activation of Nrf2 but also quenched the CSE-generation and release of reactive oxygen species. Crocin attenuated CSE-mediated Nrf2 modifications, thereby inducing its nuclear accumulation associated with GCL gene transcription leading to enhanced GSH levels. By inducing GSH synthesis, Crocin attenuates CSE-mediated GSH depletion and protects cells against CSE-induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway. These results may have implications in dietary modulation of natural antioxidants in treatment of pulmonary diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673422>Canada-Denmark MRI scoring system of the spine in patients with axial spondyloarthritis: updated definitions, scoring rules and inter-reader reliability in a multiple reader setting.</a></h2><p>To validate the Canada-Denmark (CANDEN) MRI scoring system for the spine in axial spondyloarthritis with updated lesion definitions.Lesion definitions in the CANDEN system were updated and illustrated by a consensus set of reference images.

Baseline clinical factors such as asthma may portend the development of pneumonitis due to pre-existing airway  prior to immunotherapy.The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a prior diagnosis of asthma is associated with an increased risk of immune-related pneumonitis in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.Patients at the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health undergoing immunotherapy were identified on an IRB-approved protocol. Clinical charts were reviewed for asthma documented in the medical records and CT scans were reviewed during and after treatment. Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of immunotherapy that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (.35%); 50% were grade 2 and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

Although the pathogenesis of dry eye has not been fully understood, the role of increased tear osmolarity has been established. There is increasing evidence that dry eye is an inflammatory disease. This article aims to investigate the potential pathogenicity of inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 in dry eye.Human conjunctival epithelial cells (HConECs) were stimulated with hyperosmolality to produce a dry eye cell model. Real-time PCR evaluated the IL-33 mRNA level, and western blotting assessed IL-33 protein expression. Clinical data (sex, age, ocular surface disease index [OSDI] score, tear film breakup time, Schirmer test, and corneal fluorescein staining [CFS]) of patients with DE were collected. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) specimens were collected to detect the protein expression of IL-33 and ST2 with western blotting. Tears were collected with Schirmer strips, and analyzed using multiplex assay kits to examine IL-33 and its downstream factors IL-4, IL-, and IL-13.The IL-33 mRNA level of the HConECs increased in the hyperosmotic state (relative 4.35-fold upregulation, p<0.001). The IL-33 protein expression of HConECs also showed higher levels in the hyperosmotic state (relative 2.22-fold upregulation, p<0.01). A total of 25 patients with dry eye and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled. There were no statistically significant differences in age and sex between the two groups. The OSDI score, tear film breakup time, Schirmer test, and ocular surface staining of the two groups were statistically significantly different. The IL-33 and ST2 protein levels were increased in patients with DE versus controls (IL-33: relative 9.25-fold upregulation, p<0.001; ST2: relative 4.35-fold upregulation, p<0.05). The concentrations of IL-33, IL-13, and IL- in tears increased in patients with DE versus controls (IL-33: 3.00-fold upregulation, p<0.0001; IL-13: 6.65-fold upregulation, p<0.0001; IL-: 16.54 -fold upregulation, p=0.01). IL-13 and IL- were statistically significantly correlated with IL-33. The level of IL-33 was positively correlated with the OSDI score and CFS, but was negatively correlated with the Schirmer I test and the tear film breakup time (TBUT). The level of IL-13 was positively correlated only with the CFS, and was negatively correlated with the Schirmer I test. The level of IL- was positively correlated with the OSDI score and CFS. We failed to detect the concentration of IL-4, as most samples were below the detection limit.The IL-33 mRNA and protein levels of HConECs increased under hyperosmolality. The IL-33 and ST2 protein levels were higher in the CIC of patients with DE, and have correlations with disease severity. Moreover, the concentrations of IL-13 and IL- released from activated type 2 helper T (Th2) cells increased in the tears of patients with DE. The IL-33/ST2 pathway might play a priming role in the regulation of  of the ocular surface.Copyright © 2019 Molecular Vision.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649436>Evaluation of peri-implant condition in periodontally compromised patients.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the profile of peri-implant tissues in periodontally compromised patients. - cross sectional study design.Fifty-eight implants were evaluated, clinically and radiographically, installed in seven individuals treated by the same team of professionals, during the years 1997 and 2005 in a private dental clinic in Vitória, ES, Brazil; that time of data collection, all implants were at least 10 years of functional loading.

For all lesions except longitudinal ulcer scars, the bowel wall thickness was significantly thicker than that of macroscopically-intact areas ( < .001). According to receiver operating characteristic curves, bowel wall thickness >4. mm was associated with CD lesions, and thickness >. mm was associated with more severe lesions.  The bowel wall thickness of CD lesions was evaluated by water-immersion ultrasonography correlated with macroscopic disease severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659586>Leonurine Hydrochloride Suppresses Inflammatory Responses and Ameliorates Cartilage Degradation in Osteoarthritis via NF-κB Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Leonurine hydrochloride (LH) has been reported to exhibit a number of biological properties such as suppression of . This study aimed to examine whether the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) could be delayed by the administration of LH in an OA model. Rat chondrocytes were treated with LH under the condition of TNF-α-induced . After that, real-time PCR and Western blotting were conducted to evaluate relative gene/protein expression levels. For the in vivo study, rats were randomly allocated to a control group (anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) surgery, treatment with saline) and LH group (ACLT surgery, treatment with LH). Articular cartilage degeneration was assessed by histological evaluation. It was found that LH significantly suppressed the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, IL-6, and ADAMTS- in cells via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, it is revealed that intra-articular injection of LH significantly ameliorated cartilage degeneration in a rat OA model. Taken together, these results indicate that LH attenuates progression of OA by inhibition of  via the NF-κB signaling pathway and represents a potential preventive therapy for OA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657024>Phase 1 study of crisaborole in Japanese healthy volunteers and patients with atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Crisaborole ointment, 2%, is a non-steroidal phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). This parallel-cohort, phase 1 study was conducted to investigate skin irritation potential and safety of crisaborole in healthy Japanese adults (cohort 1) and the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of crisaborole and metabolites AN7602 and AN8323 in Japanese adults with mild to moderate AD (cohort 2). In cohort 1, 20 healthy volunteers received single applications of crisaborole and vehicle simultaneously on separate locations under 48-h occlusion. In cohort 2, 12 patients with mild to moderate AD received crisaborole (n = 10) or vehicle (n = 2) twice daily for 8 days. Skin irritation and safety were assessed in cohort 1. Pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed in cohort 2. Skin irritation index (scale 0-400) was 40.0 for crisaborole and .0 for vehicle. No treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were reported in cohort 1. The most common TEAE in the crisaborole group in cohort 2 were application site irritation (n = 7) and application site pain (n = 4). Crisaborole was rapidly absorbed, with limited systemic exposure between days 1 and 8 that was comparable with that seen in US-based participants in previous trials. Crisaborole had higher skin irritation than vehicle under occlusion in healthy Japanese adults and had an acceptable safety profile in Japanese adults with mild to moderate AD.© 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657805>The clinical utility of three visual attention tests to distinguish adults with ADHD from normal controls.</a></h2><p>Adult patients with ADHD may go unrecognised and undiagnosed. This can result in psychosocial and functional decline.To investigate the clinical use of three objective computerised tests in the diagnosis of adult patients with ADHD.Case-control study.aged 18-65, ADHD diagnosis; exclusion criteria: visual impairments, colour vision deficiencies, acute mental illness, amnesia, and learning difficulties. ADHD was diagnosed with Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview (n=14) and were matched for gender and age against normal controls (n=30). Three computer-based tasks, Stroop test, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivity test were completed. Accuracy (%) and response time (ms) were measured. Generalized Estimating Equations method was used to analyse those repeated measurements data. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each test.Mean age of cases was 47.29 (SD 9.03), 9 males. Mean age of controls was 41.57 (SD 11.42), 13 males. Individuals with ADHD had significantly worse performances in both accuracy and response time in all the tests. The best discriminate ability was the Stroop test (accuracy and response time), followed by the Perceptual Selectivity test (response time). Comparisons of AUCs of the tests did not show any significant differences. Age had a significant effect on the Stroop and Stroop Plus tests but not in the Perceptual Selectivity test.Adults with ADHD have a longer response time and perform less accurately than controls. Thus, these data suggest that there is a use for objective visual attention tests in the diagnosis of adult ADHD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649420>No evidence for airborne transmission of  in a very high prevalence area in Lancaster County.</a></h2><p> () has been associated with acute food-borne illness, chronic low-grade , neuropsychiatric conditions and reactivation of chronic latent infection in immunocompetent hosts.

Previous studies have demonstrated that soluble RAGE (sRAGE) acts as a decoy for RAGE and protects cells against RAGE-mediated injury. The authors and other groups have reported that the expression of RAGE increases after brain ischemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and deletion of RAGE or overexpression of sRAGE improves neuronal survival. It has also been demonstrated that the plasma sRAGE level could be a predictor of the outcome after ischemic stroke. This study aimed to evaluate plasma sRAGE as a biomarker for symptomatic vasospasm (SVS) in SAH patients, as well as a rat model.The authors measured and compared plasma sRAGE levels in 27 SAH patients (7 with SVS and 20 without SVS) from day  to day 14 post-SAH. They also examined plasma sRAGE levels and expression of RAGE and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in a rat SAH model.The relative plasma sRAGE levels were significantly lower in the SVS group than in the non-SVS group of patients. A cut-off value of 0.84 for predicting SVS was considered to be appropriate for the relative plasma sRAGE levels on day 7 versus day . In the rat SAH model, plasma sRAGE levels were significantly lower than those in sham-treated rats, and the expressions of RAGE and HO-1 were enhanced in the SAH group compared with the non-SAH group.Plasma sRAGE levels can be used as a potential biomarker for predicting SVS after SAH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652997>Pharmacology Study of the Multiple Angiogenesis Inhibitor RC28-E on Anti-Fibrosis in a Chemically Induced Lung Injury Model.</a></h2><p>Disease-related injury in any organ triggers a complex cascade of cellular and molecular responses that culminate in tissue fibrosis, , and angiogenesis simultaneously. Multiple cell angiogenesis is an essential part of the tissue damage response, which is involved in fibrosis development. RC28-E is a novel recombinant dual decoy receptor lgG1 Fc-fusion protein that can block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) simultaneously. This protein has stepped into clinical trials () for the treatment of pathological neovascularization-related diseases. Here, we report on the role of RC28-E during anti-fibrosis and its potential multitarget function in regulating fibrosis.A bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis C57BL/6 mouse model was established. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and Masson staining (Masson's) were performed to evaluate the pulmonary fibrosis based on the scoring from, Ashcroft score. Fibrosis related factors and inflammatory cytokines including HYP, α-SMA, procollagen, ICAM, IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α were also determined at the protein and mRNA levels to characterize the fibrosis. Both mRNA and protein levels of VEGF, FGF, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, respectively. Pulmonary fibrosis and related cytokines were re-evaluated in vivo after 3 doses of RC28-E ( mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg, ip. Tiw × 9) in comparison with a mono-target antagonist treatment (VEGF or FGF blocking). RC28-E attenuated the activation of TGF-β induced fibroblasts in vitro. Expression levels of α-SMA and collagen I, as well as proliferation and migration, were determined with the human skin fibroblast cell line Detroit 551 and primary murine pulmonary fibroblast cells. The mechanism of RC28-E via the TGF-β/Smad pathway was also investigated.RC28-E exhibits significant anti-fibrosis effects on Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in vivo. Moreover, TGF-β induced fibroblast activation in vitro via the inhibition of the TGF-β downstream Smad pathway, thus providing potential therapeutics for clinical disease-related fibrosis-like IPF as well as chemotherapy-induced fibrosis in cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664570>Neural cell responses to wear debris from metal-on-metal total disc replacements.</a></h2><p>Total disc replacements, comprising all-metal articulations, are compromised by wear and particle production. Metallic wear debris and ions trigger a range of biological responses including , genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, hypersensitivity and pseudotumour formation, therefore we hypothesise that, due to proximity to the spinal cord, glial cells may be adversely affected.Clinically relevant cobalt chrome (CoCr) and stainless steel (SS) wear particles were generated using a six-station pin-on-plate wear simulator. The effects of metallic particles (0.-50 μm debris per cell) and metal ions on glial cell viability, cellular activity (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression) and DNA integrity were investigated in 2D and 3D culture using live/dead, immunocytochemistry and a comet assay, respectively.CoCr wear particles and ions caused significant reductions in glial cell viability in both 2D and 3D culture systems. Stainless steel particles did not affect glial cell viability or astrocyte activation. In contrast, ions released from SS caused significant reductions in glial cell viability, an effect that was especially noticeable when astrocytes were cultured in isolation without microglia. DNA damage was observed in both cell types and with both biomaterials tested. CoCr wear particles had a dose-dependent effect on astrocyte activation, measured through expression of GFAP.The results from this study suggest that microglia influence the effects that metal particles have on astrocytes, that SS ions and particles play a role in the adverse effects observed and that SS is a less toxic biomaterial than CoCr alloy for use in spinal devices.

Inflammatory reaction plays important roles in I/R-induced intestinal damage and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) has been identified as an endogenous anti-inflammatory regulator by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Our previous research has shown that the pretreatment with inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane protects intestinal I/R injury. However, whether the protection induced by sevoflurane is mediated by inhibiting intestinal inflammatory reaction via activation of PPARγ/NF-κB pathway is underdetermined. In this study, we investigated the effects of sevoflurane on intestinal inflammatory reaction during intestinal I/R and the role of PPARγ/NF-κB pathway.Rat model of intestinal I/R was used in this study. The superior mesenteric artery was clamped for 60 min followed by 120-min reperfusion. Sevoflurane at 0. minimum alveolar concentration was inhaled for 30 min before ischemic insult. GW9662, a specific PPARγ antagonist, was injected intraperitoneally before sevoflurane inhalation.Intestinal I/R caused severe intestinal mucosa histopathological injury evaluated by Chiu's scoring, induced epithelial cell apoptosis evaluated by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and activation of caspase-3, upregulated serum MOD levels, reduced protein expression of Bcl-2 and PPARγ, increased protein expression of NF-κB P65 and proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in the intestine. Sevoflurane preconditioning significantly ameliorated these changes induced by intestinal I/R. However, GW9662 partly blocked the protective effects induced by sevoflurane.Our results suggest sevoflurane-induced protection against intestinal I/R injury is partly mediated by inhibiting intestinal inflammatory reaction via activation of PPARγ/NF-κB pathway.© 2019 S.

The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672652>Serum profile of transferrin isoforms in rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological drugs.</a></h2><p>In the chronic  process in the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many alterations in the expression of plasma proteins, as well as their posttranslational modifications (including glycosylation) can occur. Taking into account the disturbances in protein glycosylation and the emerging new treatment regimens, the aim of this study was to assess the serum profile of transferrin isoforms in RA patients treated with biological drugs.The study included 20 patients (16 females and 4 males; mean age: 53.4 years; range: 24-67) with rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituximab. Serum samples were taken 3 times: before and 3 and 6 months during treatment. The isoforms of transferrin were separated by capillary electrophoresis (MINICAP electrophoretic system, Sebia, France) into five major fractions: asialo-, disialo-, trisialo-, tetrasialo- and pentasialotransferrin. The results were calculated as relative concentrations of each fraction.The median trisialotransferrin relative concentrations after 3 and 6 months treatment (4.40% and 4.10%, respectively) were significantly higher (p=0.013, p=0.009, respectively) than before treatment (3.50%). The levels of serum pentasialotransferrin were also increased 3 and 6 months following treatment (16.% and 17.7%, p=0.005 and p=0.006, respectively) as compared to those before therapy (14.%), while tetrasialotransferrin concentrations were lower (80.3% and 78.4%, p=0.009 and p=0.008, respectively) than before treatment (81.%). Trisialotransferrin relative concentration correlated with Hb (p=0.019), whereas pentasialotransferrin with PLT (p=0.036) after treatment.This study indicates that treatment with rituximab of RA patients alters the serum profile of transferrin isoforms. Tri-, tetra- and pentasialotransferrin relative concentrations measurements can be a useful tool to monitor therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Although some progress has been made in the past years, the pathogenesis of ALI is still poorly understood and the therapeutic outcome has still not been significantly improved. It is well-recognized that magnesium sulfate (MgSO) possesses potent anti- capacity. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of MgSO in lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)-induced ALI taken into account that excessive inflammatory response plays critical role in the development of ALI. In this study, Kunming mice were intravenously injected with LPS through tail vein to establish the ALI model and in parallel, A549 cells were used to establish cell model. The lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in lung tissue, lung permeability index, hematoxylin and eosin staining, cytokines in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), neutrophil counts in BALF, LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis as well as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression in both mice and A549 cells were detected. Our results demonstrated that MgSO significantly attenuated the LPS-induced ALI, oxidative stress (decreased MDA levels), and lung inflammatory response. Moreover, MgSO exerted protective effects by mitigating LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, MgSO decreased the AIF and PARP-1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Our results, taken together, demonstrated that MgSO is a potential therapeutic agent for ALI taken into consideration that MgSO is commonly used in clinical settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652794>The Exploration of Natural Compounds for Anti-Diabetes from Distinctive Species Garcinia  with Comprehensive Review of the Garcinia Family.</a></h2><p>Approximately 400 Garcinia species are distributed around the world.

Of these, 616 were seen again 3 y later for the longitudinal analysis. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) was calculated from a validated diet history questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/m2; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men.

Although a large number of irreversible-acting MAGL inhibitors have been discovered over the past years, there are only few compounds known so far which inhibit the enzyme in a reversible manner. Therefore, much effort is put into the development of novel chemical entities showing reversible inhibitory behavior, which is thought to cause less undesired side effects. To explore a wide range of chemical structures as MAGL binders, we have applied a virtual screening approach by docking small molecules into the crystal structure of human MAGL (hMAGL) and envisaged a library of 45 selected compounds which were then synthesized. Biochemical investigations included the determination of the inhibitory potency on hMAGL and two related hydrolases, i.e. human fatty acid amide hydrolase (hFAAH) and murine cholesterol esterase (mCEase). The most promising candidates from theses analyses, i.e. three ω-quinazolinonylalkyl aryl ureas bearing alkyl spacers of three to five methylene groups, exhibited IC values of 20-41 µM and reversible, detergent-insensitive behavior towards hMAGL. Among these compounds, the inhibitor 1-(3,-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)butyl)urea (96) was selected for further kinetic characterization, yielding a dissociation constant K = 15.4 µM and a mixed-type inhibition with a pronounced competitive component (α = 8.94). This mode of inhibition was further supported by a docking experiment, which suggested that the inhibitor occupies the substrate binding pocket of hMAGL.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Air pollution is a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate materials, that vary depending on their source and physicochemical features. Each material has detrimental effects on human health, but a number of experimental and clinical studies have shown a strong impact for fine particulate matter (PM2.). In particular, there is more and more evidence that PM2. exerts adverse effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, contributing substantially -- mainly through mechanisms of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and  -- to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, but also to heart failure, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we summarize knowledge on the mechanisms and magnitude of the cardiovascular adverse effects of short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly for the PM2. size fraction. We also emphasize that very recent data indicate that the global mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular disease associated with this air pollutant is dramatically greater than appreciated until now.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654734>Postnatal morphological lung development of wild type and CD26/DPP4 deficient rat pups in dependency of LPS exposure.</a></h2><p>Rodents are born with morphological immature lungs and an intact surfactant system.

LPS exposure often used to simulate perinatal infection delays lung development.A perinatal LPS rat model was used to test the hypothesis that CD26 deficiency modulates LPS-induced retardation in morphological lung development.New born Fischer CD26 positive (CD26) and deficient (CD26-) rats were exposed to LPS from postnatal day (day postpartum, dpp) 3 and . Morphological parameters of lung development were determined stereologically. Lung development was analysed in 7, 10 14 and 21day old rats.Compared to controls LPS application resulted 1) in a mild  independent of the strain, 2) in significantly lower total surface and volume of alveolar septa combined with significantly higher total volume of airspaces and alveolar size on dpp 7 in both substrains. However, compared to controls in LPS treated CD26- rats significant lower values of total septal surface and volume combined with higher values of total parenchymal airspaces and alveolar size were found until the end of classical alveolarization (dpp 14). In LPS treated CD26 rat pups the retardation was abolished already on dpp 10.In absence of CD26, LPS enhances the delay of morphological lung development. Morphological recovery was slower after the end of LPS exposure in CD26 deficient lungs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and diabetes is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type 2 diabetes.We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes.We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without diabetes at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident diabetes were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, .65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, .15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident diabetes, with an  2.81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute. Further research on BPA analogs is warranted. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5159.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650383>High fructose-containing drinking water-induced steatohepatitis in rats is prevented by the nicotinamide-mediated modulation of redox homeostasis and NADPH-producing enzymes.</a></h2><p>An imbalance in the redox state, increased levels of lipid precursors and overactivation of de novo lipogenesis determine the development of fibrosis during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We evaluated the modulation of NADPH-producing enzymes associated with the antifibrotic, antioxidant and antilipemic effects of nicotinamide (NAM) in a model of NASH induced by excess fructose consumption. Male rats were provided drinking water containing 40% fructose for 16 weeks. During the last 12 weeks of fructose administration, water containing NAM was provided to some of the rats for  h/day. The biochemical profiles and the ghrelin, leptin, lipoperoxidation and TNF-α levels in serum and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), malic enzyme (ME) and NADP-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase (IDP) levels, the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and reduced/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)) ratios, and the levels of various lipogenic and fibrotic markers in the liver were evaluated. The results showed that hepatic fibrosis induced by fructose consumption was associated with weight gain, hunger-satiety system dysregulation, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, lipoperoxidation and . Moreover, increased levels of hepatic G6PD and ME activity and expression, the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratios, and GSSG concentration and increased expression of lipogenic and fibrotic markers were detected, and these alterations were attenuated by NAM administration. Specifically, NAM diminished the activity and expression of G6PD and ME, and this effect was associated with a decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratios, increased GSH levels and decreased lipoperoxidation and , ameliorating fibrosis and NASH development. NAM reduces liver steatosis and fibrosis by regulating redox homeostasis through a G6PD- and ME-dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668807>Long non-coding RNA MEG3 regulates CSE-induced apoptosis and  via regulating miR-218 in 16HBE cells.</a></h2><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent disease worldwide, mainly caused by cigarette smoking. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) functions as the lncRNA and is upregulated in COPD patients and human bronchial epithelial cells after fine particulate matter (PM2.) treatment. However, the molecular mechanism of MEG3 in COPD remains unknown. The expression of MEG3 and miR-218 in COPD tissues and cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated 16HBE cells was detected by RT-qPCR. The effects of MEG3 and miR-218 on proliferation and apoptosis in (CSE)-treated 16HBE cells were analyzed by CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The protein levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β IL-6 and TNF-α) were detected in 16HBE cells by ELISA. MEG3 and miR-218 binding interaction was predicted by LncBase Predicted v.2 and further confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. MEG3 was upregulated in COPD tissues and inversely related to FEV1%. MEG3 was upregulated in (CSE)-treated 16HBE cells, and knockdown of MEG3 mitigated CSE-repressed proliferation and CSE-triggered apoptosis or . MiR-218 was demonstrated as a target miRNA of MEG3. MiR-218 was downregulated in COPD tissues and (CSE)-treated or MEG3 overexpressed 16HBE cells. MiR-218 overexpression attenuated CSE-blocked proliferation and CSE-induced apoptosis or . Deficiency of MEG3 counteracted CSE-blocked proliferation CSE-induced apoptotic rate and inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β IL-6 and TNF-α) levels, while introduction of anti-miR-218 reversed these effects.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to evaluate supplemental effects of dietary nucleotides on intestinal health and growth performance in newly weaned pigs. Fifty newly weaned pigs (19-d-old, 25 barrows and 25 gilts, 4.76 ± 0.42 kg BW) were individually housed and allotted to  treatments with increasing nucleotide supplementation (0, 50, 150, 250, and 500 mg/kg) based on a randomized complete block design with the initial BW and sex as blocks. Dietary nucleotides were provided from YT500 (Hinabiotech, Guangzhou, China). Pigs were fed for 21 d based on 2 phases (Phase 1: 11 d and Phase 2: 10 d) and experimental diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements suggested by NRC (2012). Feed intake and BW were recorded. Titanium oxide (0.4%) was added as an indigestible marker from d 17. Plasma collected on d 18 was used to measure tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Pigs were euthanized on d 21 to collect tissues to evaluate TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, morphology, and crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Ileal digesta were collected to measure ileal nutrient digestibility. Data were analyzed using contrasts in the MIXED procedure of SAS. Nucleotide supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADFI in phase 1. Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ADG in Phase 1, whereas increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and tended to increase (P = 0.082) ADG in overall. Increasing nucleotide supplementation changed (quadratic, P < 0.05) villus height-crypt ratio (at 247 mg/kg) and decreased (linear, P < 0.05) crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Increasing nucleotide supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) jejunal IL-6 (at 50 and 150 mg/kg) and tended to change (quadratic, P = 0.074) plasma MDA (at 231 mg/kg). Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ileal digestibility of energy and ether extract. In conclusion, nucleotide supplementation at a range of 50 to 250 mg/kg in the diets seems to be beneficial to newly weaned pigs by enhancing growth performance possibly due to reduced intestinal  and oxidative stress as well as improved intestinal villi structure and energy digestibility.© The Author(s) 2019.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and  were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after -weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and  in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed -fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the dosages of phytochemicals in the cellular and animal studies are too high to reach in humans by relevant foods or dietary supplement intake. The aims of this study were to investigate whether and how combined curcumin and luteolin synergistically inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced monocytes adhesion endothelium, a crucial step of the development of endothelial dysfunction, both in human vascular cells and mouse aortic endothelium. Our results show that combined curcumin (1 μM) and luteolin (0. μM) synergistically (combination index is 0.60) inhibited TNF-α-induced monocytes adhesion to human EA.hy926 endothelial cells while the individual chemicals did not have such effect at the selected concentrations. We also found that TNF-α-enhanced protein expressions of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB translocation were synergistically reduced by the combined curcumin and luteolin in EA.hy 926 cells while the individual chemical did not have this inhibitory effect. Consistently, 2 weeks dietary intake of combined curcumin (500 mg/kg) and luteolin (500 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice synergistically prevented TNF-α-stimulated adhesion of mouse monocytes to aortic endothelium ex vivo as well as the TNF-α-increased aortic protein expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. Therefore, combined curcumin and luteolin at physiological concentrations synergistically inhibits TNF-α-induced monocytes adhesion to endothelial cells and expressions of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 via suppressing NF-κB translocation into the nucleus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TMA serial sections were used to study the expression of inflammatory and mineralization markers (BMP-2, BMP-4, VDR, RANKL, Osteopontin, Sclerostin, β-catenin and calmodulin) by immunohistochemistry. Our data clearly demonstrated the expression of mineralization markers in atheromatic plaques. Indeed, with the exception of RANKL, all investigated markers were expressed in at least 60% of cases. Specifically, multivariate analysis displayed significant associations between both the expression of BMP-2 and the presence of unstable plaques as well as between the expression of β-catenin and the presence of stable plaques. We also found a significant inverse association between both a) the presence of hypertension and VDR and b) smoking habits and calmodulin expression. Finally, we noted a higher density of RANKL positive cells in plaques from diabetic patients as compared to non-diabetic ones and a significant positive association between hypertriglyceridemia and BMP-4 expression.Our results support the hypothesis that the process of atherosclerotic plaque calcification presents a number of similarities with the physiological processes that occur in bone, involving both osteoblasts- and osteoclasts-like arterial cells.

However, the role of eicosanoids in tuberculosis remains controversial. To investigate the specific role of LTB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, we used -lipoxygenase-deficient (-LO) mice and WT (sv129) mice inoculated intranasally with LTB (encapsulated in PLGA microspheres). We showed that deficiency of the -LO pathway was related to resistance to Mtb infection. LTB inoculation increased susceptibility to Mtb in -LO mice but not in WT mice, resulting in worsening of lung  and tissue damage. In infected WT mice, most supplementary LTB was metabolized to the inactive form 12-oxo-LTB in the lung. A high amount of PGE was detected during Mtb infection, and pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 induced a significant reduction of bacterial load and an improved innate immune response in the lungs, independently of baseline LTB levels. COX-2 inhibition with celecoxib significantly reduced PGE levels, enhanced IFN-γ production and NO release, and increased macrophage phagocytosis of Mtb. The results suggest that a balance between PGE/LTB is essential in the pathogenesis process of tuberculosis to prevent severe . Moreover, optimal levels of PGE are required to induce an effective innate response in the early phase of Mtb infection. Thus, pharmacological modulation of eicosanoid production may provide an important host-directed therapy in tuberculosis.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular and biochemical changes due to moist snuff consumption relative to smoking remain incompletely understood. We previously reported that smokers (SMK) exhibit elevated oxidative stress and  relative to moist snuff consumers (MSC) and non-tobacco consumers (NTC), based on metabolomic profiling data of saliva, plasma, and urine from MSC, SMK, and NTC. In this study, we investigated the effects of tobacco consumption on additional metabolic pathways using pathway-based analysis tools. To this end, metabolic pathway enrichment analysis and topology analysis were performed through pair-wise comparisons of global metabolomic profiles of SMK, MSC, and NTC. The analyses identified >8 significantly perturbed metabolic pathways in SMK compared with NTC and MSC in all 3 matrices. Among these differentially enriched pathways, perturbations of caffeine metabolism, energy metabolism, and arginine metabolism were mostly observed. In comparison, fewer enriched metabolic pathways were identified in MSC compared with NTC ( in plasma, none in urine and saliva). This is consistent with our transcriptomics profiling results that show no significant differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression between MSC and NTC. These findings, taken together with our previous biochemical, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analysis results, provide a better understanding of the relative changes in healthy tobacco consumers, and demonstrate that chronic cigarette smoking, relative to the use of smokeless tobacco, results in more pronounced biological changes, which could culminate in smoking-related diseases.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664621>Perioperative Blood Transfusion is Associated with Postoperative Systemic Inflammatory Response and Poorer Outcomes Following Surgery for Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated relationships between perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative systemic inflammatory response, and outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer.Data were recorded for patients (n = 544) undergoing potentially curative, elective surgery for colorectal cancer at a single center between 2012 and 2017.

EDN has proven to be a promising marker for eosinophilic  both in asthma and in wheezing symptoms in children.Here we present a novel ImmunoCAP automated immunofluorescence research assay for measurement of EDN and its potential use in diagnosis of asthmatic children.We report the analytical performance of the assay in serum, heparin- and EDTA-plasma in terms of precision, linearity, sensitivity, interfering substances and specimen handling. We also compared the EDN research assay with established methods for asthma diagnosis: fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and blood eosinophil fraction (EOS%) to demonstrate the diagnostic value of EDN in childhood asthma.The total precision (measured using percentage CV) was ≤.8% for both serum and plasma. The dilution analysis yielded linear results across the dynamic range of the assay for both serum and plasma. No notable interferences of endogenous substances were observed.The median concentration of EDN was significantly higher in the asthma group compared to the healthy controls and the EDN correlates well with EOS%.we have shown that EDN can be measured reliably and robustly with the ImmunoCAP platform in both serum and plasma samples. EDN can be used to distinguish asthmatic from healthy children and correlates well with EOS% and could be a valuable complement to both EOS% and FeNO.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653710>Imaging  in Atherosclerosis with CXCR4-directed Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT - Correlation with F-FDG PET/CT.</a></h2><p>C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is expressed on the surface of various cell types involved in atherosclerosis, with a particularly rich receptor expression on macrophages and T cells. First pilot studies with Ga-Pentixafor, a novel CXCR4-directed positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, have shown promise to non-invasively image  within atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the performance of Ga-Pentixafor PET/computed tomography (CT) for imaging atherosclerosis in comparison to F-FDG PET/CT.  Ninety-two patients (37 females and 55 males; mean age 62 ± 10 years) underwent Ga-Pentixafor and F-FDG PET/CT for staging of oncologic diseases. In these subjects, arterial wall lesions in the large arteries were identified using morphological and PET-criteria of atherosclerosis ( = 652). Tracer uptake was measured and adjusted for vascular lumen (background) signal by calculation of target-to-background ratios (TBR) by two investigators blinded to the other PET scan. On a lesion-to-lesion and patient basis, TBR of both PET tracers were compared and additionally correlated to the degree of arterial calcification as quantified in CT.  On a lesion-to-lesion basis, Ga-Pentixafor and F-FDG uptake showed a weak correlation (TBR; r = 0.28;  < 0.01). Ga-Pentixafor PET identified more lesions ( = 290; TBR ≥ 1.6,  < 0.01) and demonstrated higher uptake than F-FDG PET (1.8 ± 0. vs. 1.4 ± 0.4;  < 0.01). The degree of plaque calcification correlated negatively with both Ga-Pentixafor and F-FDG uptake (r = -0.38 vs. r = -0.31, both  < 0.00001).  CXCR4-directed imaging of the arterial wall with Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT identified more lesions as compared to F-FDG PET/CT, with only weak correlation between tracers. Further studies to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and sources of CXCR4 positivity, and to investigate the clinical utility of chemokine receptor-directed imaging of atherosclerosis are highly warranted.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667072>Exacerbation of eosinophilic COPD and pneumonia in post-treatment pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patient: A case report.</a></h2><p>Eosinophilic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a COPD phenotype with several clinical characteristics such as eosinophilic airway , more common in men and less severe COPD. Eosinophilic COPD has more exacerbations but responds well to corticosteroids and bronchodilators. We hereby report the case of a patient who came to us with shortness of breath, fever, wheezing and a cough with yellow phlegm. He had a history of smoking 4. pack-year and two episodes of pulmonary tuberculosis (the second was pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis). He was diagnosed with eosinophilic COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. Intravenous corticosteroids, bronchodilators and antibiotics were given and his condition improved after a week of hospitalisation. Smoking and pulmonary tuberculosis are risk factors for COPD. In this case, irreversible airflow obstruction is related to COPD and also pulmonary TB. There are several mechanisms that cause airway obstruction in pulmonary tuberculosis, one of which is persistent mycobacterium acting as a co-factor along with smoking and several environmental factors that cause chronic airway  and result in bronchial narrowing with or without parenchymal destruction.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675489>Environmental pollutant induced cellular injury is reflected in exosomes from placental explants.</a></h2><p>Exosomes are intercellular signaling vesicles whose cargo reflects the physiological status of the cell of their origin and can regulate gene expression in other tissues. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and bisphenols (A [BPA], Tetrabromobisphenol A [TBBPA], and 2,4,6-Tribromophenol [TBP]) are common environmental pollutants known to increase the risk for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). We hypothesized that placental exposure to these environmental pollutants causes exosome cargo changes that reflect exposure associated placental response.Full-term, C-section placenta explants were treated with PBDE congeners (47, 100, 153, 209), TBBPA, TBP or BPA for 24 h. Exosomes were isolated from media by sequential ultracentrifugation and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Exosomes were characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and Western blot. Proteomics identified differentially expressed exosomal proteins and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) determined biological functions and pathways represented by identified proteins.Regardless of treatment, placental expressed exosomes markers (PLAP, CD9, CD63, 81 and ALIX), had a size distribution between 50 and 175 nm and were present in the conditioned medium at -8 x 10 exosomes/mL. Proteomic analysis identified 2598 proteins which demonstrated that specific pollutants caused differential expression of specific proteins, including alarmin, High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1), MAPK14 (p38 MAPK) and GSK3β. IPA revealed an inhibition of pathways associated with cell survival, tissue repair and proliferation, as well as activation of cell death pathways (e.g. necrosis).Environmental exposure of placental explants did not change the quantity of exosomes or their characteristics.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a clinically available molecular imaging tool with significant potential to study pathogenesis of infections in humans. PET enables dynamic assessment of infectious processes within the same subject with high temporal and spatial resolution and obviates the need for invasive tissue sampling, which is difficult in patients and generally limited to a single time point, even in animal models. This review presents current state-of-the-art concepts on the application of molecular imaging for infectious diseases and details how PET imaging can facilitate novel insights into infectious processes, ongoing development of pathogen-specific imaging, and simultaneous  measurements of intralesional antimicrobial pharmacokinetics in multiple compartments, including privileged sites. Finally, the potential clinical applications of this promising technology are also discussed.Copyright © 2019 Gordon et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651516>Adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon relieves endotoxin-induced acute hepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin is the most abundant adipokines that plays critical roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis as well as  regulation. The half-life of adiponectin is very short and the small-molecule adiponectin receptor agonist has been synthesized recently. In the present study, the potential roles of AdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor agonist, in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-Gal)-induced acute hepatitis was explored.BALB/c mice (n = 144, male) were divided into three sets. In set 1, 32 mice were randomized into four groups: the control group, the AdipoRon group, the LPS/D-Gal group, and the AdipoRon + LPS/D-Gal group. The mice in set 1 were sacrificed after LPS/D-Gal treatment, and the plasma samples were collected for detection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). In set 2, the 32 mice were also divided into four groups similar to that of set 1. The mice were sacrificed 6 h after LPS/D-Gal injection and plasma samples and liver were collected. In set 3, 80 mice (divided into four groups, n = 20) were used for survival observation. The survival rate, plasma aminotransferases, histopathological damage were measured and compared between these four groups.AdipoRon suppressed the elevation of plasma aminotransferases (from 2106.3 ± 781.9 to 286.8 ± 133.1 U/L for alanine aminotransferase, P < 0.01; from 566. ± 243.4 to 180.1 ± 153.3 U/L for aspartate aminotransferase, P < 0.01), attenuated histopathological damage and improved the survival rate (from 10% to 60%) in mice with LPS/D-Gal-induced acute hepatitis. Additionally, AdipoRon down-regulated the production of TNF-α (from 328.6 ± 121.2 to 213.4 ± 52.2 pg/mL, P < 0.01), inhibited the activation of caspase-3 (from 2.04-fold to 1.34-fold of the control), caspase-8 (from 2.03-fold to 1.31-fold of the control), and caspase-9 (from 2.14-fold to 1.43-fold of the control), and decreased the level of cleaved caspase-3 (0.28-fold to that of the LPS/D-Gal group). The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nucleotide nick-end labeling-positive apoptotic hepatocytes in LPS/D-Gal-exposed mice also reduced.These data indicated that LPS/D-Gal-induced acute hepatitis was effectively attenuated by the adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon, implying that AdipoRon might become a new reagent for treatment of acute hepatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656245>[The Analgesic Effect of Aspirin on Inflammatory Pain in Rats is Affected by Pain Intensity and Administration Timing].</a></h2><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely known as painkillers. The analgesic action of NSAIDs is attributable to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis that occurs in response to blocking cyclooxygenase activity. The effective dose of NSAIDs can vary depending on pain intensity and administration timing; however, there are few studies on this. This study aimed to elucidate whether the analgesic effect of NSAIDs changes depending on the situation in which they are taken and we focused on the NSAID, aspirin (ASP). In a rat model of brewer's yeast-induced , pain caused by 20% w/v brewer's yeast-treatment was defined as "strong pain" and that caused by 2.% w/v was defined as "weak pain." The analgesic effect of ASP (low-dose; 44 mg/kg or high-dose; 66 mg/kg) against strong pain was dose-dependent, but that against weak pain was the same. Furthermore, we defined drug administration after 3 h of brewer's yeast-treatment as "late administration" and that after 20 min as "early administration." In the case of strong pain, the analgesic effect of "late ASP administration" was dose-dependent, but that of "early ASP administration" was the same. These results suggest that low-dose NSAIDs have an analgesic effect against weak pain or when taken early.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670282> hayata extract and its ingredient daidzin ameliorate cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis and oxidative stress through the action of antioxidation, anti-fibrosis, and anti-.</a></h2><p>We explored the therapeutic potential of intragastric administration of traditional Chinese medicine Glycine tomentella Hayata (I-Tiao-Gung [ITG]) extract and its major component Daidzin on cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis, oxidative stress, fibrosis, , and bladder hyperactivity in rats. Female Wistar rats were divided into control, CYP (200 mg/kg), CYP+ITG (1.17 g/kg/day), and CYP+Daidzin (12. mg/kg/day) groups. We measured the voiding function by the transcystometrogram and evaluated the pathology with the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson stain. We determined the bladder reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount by an ultrasensitive chemiluminescence analyzer, the expression of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) by Western blot and the expression of multiple cytokine profiles, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 through a cytokine array. ITG extract contains 1.07% of Daidzin through high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of ITG extract and Daidzin in scavenging hydrogen peroxide activity was more efficient than distilled water. CYP-induced higher urination frequency, shorter intercontraction interval, and lower maximal voiding pressure in the bladders and these symptoms were significantly ameliorated in CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. The amount of in vivo bladder ROS and the expression of 3-NT and NOX4 expressions were significantly increased in CYP group but were efficiently decreased in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. CYP-induced fibrosis, hemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration, and edema in the bladders were significantly attenuated in the CYP+ITG and CYP+Daidzin groups. These results suggested that ITG extract and its active component Daidzin effectively improved CYP-induced oxidative stress, , and fibrosis through inhibiting the MMP-8, TIMP-1, and oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673402>Isometric versus isotonic exercise for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a randomised controlled pilot study.</a></h2><p>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain. Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of exercise for GTPS. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of isometric and isotonic exercise for individuals with GTPS.This randomised controlled pilot trial recruited 30 participants with GTPS. Both programmes consisted of daily, progressive home exercise for 12 weeks with 8 individual physiotherapy sessions over the trial period. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G) and secondary outcome measures included the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10) and an 11-point Global Rating of Change Scale. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.Twenty-three participants completed the trial. After 12 weeks, mean VISA-G scores improved in both groups; 55-65 in the isometric group and 62-72 in the isotonic group. 55% of the isometric group and 58% of the isotonic group achieved a reduction in pain of at least 2 points (minimally clinically important difference (MCID)) on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 64% of the isometric group and 75% of the isotonic group had improved by at least 2 points (MCID) on the Global Rating of Change Scale.Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes appear to be effective for individuals with GTPS and should be considered in the loading management of patients with this condition.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This lack of benefit has been attributed to closure methods of the defect, with subsequent spinal cord tethering at the repair site. Hence, a regenerative patch or material with antiinflammatory and anti-scarring properties may alleviate comorbidities with improved outcomes. The authors' primary objective was therefore to compare cryopreserved human umbilical cord (HUC) versus acellular dermal matrix (ADM) patches for regenerative repair of in utero SB lesions in an animal model.In vivo studies were conducted in retinoic acid-induced SB defects in fetuses of Sprague-Dawley rats. HUC or ADM patches were sutured over the SB defects at a gestational age of 20 days. Repaired SB defect tissues were harvested after 48-52 hours. Tissue sections were immunofluorescently stained for the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, keratinocytes, meningeal cells, and astrocytes and for any associated apoptosis. In vitro meningeal or keratinocyte cell coculture experiments with the ADM and HUC patches were performed. All experiments were scored quantitatively in a blinded manner.Neutrophil counts and apoptotic cells were lower in the HUC-based repair group (n = 8) than in the ADM patch repair group (n = 7). In the HUC patch repair group, keratinocytes were present on the outer surface of the patch, meningeal cells were present on the inner surface of the patch adjacent to the neural placode, and astrocytes were noted to be absent. In the ADM patch repair group, all 3 cell types were present on both surfaces of the patch. In vitro studies showed that human meningeal cells grew preferentially on the mesenchymal side of the HUC patch, whereas keratinocytes showed tropism for the epithelial side, suggesting an inherent HUC-based cell polarity. In contrast, the ADM patch studies showed no polarity and decreased cellular infiltration.The HUC patch demonstrated reduced acute  and apoptosis together with superior organization in regenerative cellular growth when compared with the ADM patch, and is therefore likely the better patch material for in utero SB defect repair. These properties may make the HUC biomaterial useful as a "meningeal patch" during spinal cord surgeries, thereby potentially reducing tethering and improving on spinal cord function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653713>Multimodality Imaging of  and Ventricular Remodeling in Pressure Overload Heart Failure.</a></h2><p> contributes to ventricular remodeling after myocardial ischemia, but its role in non-ischemic heart failure is poorly understood. Local tissue  is difficult to assess serially during pathogenesis. While F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulates in inflammatory leukocytes which may identify  in the myocardial microenvironment, it remains unclear whether this imaging technique can isolate diffuse leukocytes in pressure overload heart failure. We aimed to evaluate the capability to serially image  with F-FDG in the early stages of pressure overload-induced heart failure, and to compare the timecourse to functional impairment assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  C57Bl6/N mice underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC,  = 22) or sham surgery ( = 12), or coronary ligation as an -positive control ( = ). MRI assessed ventricular geometry and contractile function at d2 and d8 after TAC. Immunostaining identified the extent of inflammatory leukocyte infiltration early in pressure overload. F-FDG PET scans were acquired at d3 and d7 after TAC, under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia to suppress cardiomyocyte glucose uptake.  Pressure overload evokes rapid left ventricular dilation compared to sham (end systolic volume, d2: 40.6±10.2µL vs. 23.8 ±1.7µL, p<0.001). Contractile function was similarly impaired (ejection fraction, d2: 40.9 ± 9.7% vs. 59.2 ± 4.4%, p<0.001). Severity of contractile impairment was proportional to histology-defined myocardial macrophage density at d8 (r=-0.669;  = 0.010). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging identified significantly higher F-FDG accumulation in the left ventricle of TAC compared to sham mice at d3 (10.±4.1%ID/g vs. 3.8±0.9%ID/g, p<0.001) and at d7 (7.8±3.7%ID/g vs.3.0 ±0.8%ID/g  = 0.006), though the efficiency of cardiomyocyte suppression was variable between TAC mice. The F-FDG signal correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.75,  = 0.01) and ventricle volumes (r=0.75, p<0.01). Western immunoblotting demonstrated 60% elevation of myocardial glucose transporter 4 expression in the left ventricle at d8 after TAC, indicating altered glucose metabolism.  TAC induces rapid changes in left ventricle geometry and contractile function, with a parallel modest infiltration of inflammatory macrophages. Metabolic remodeling overshadows inflammatory leukocyte signal using F-FDG PET imaging. More selective inflammatory tracers are requisite to selectively identify the diffuse local  in pressure overload.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652141>Systemic and breath biomarkers for asthma: an update.</a></h2><p>Finding suitable biomarkers to phenotype asthma, identify individuals at risk of worsening and guide treatment is highly prioritized in asthma research. We aimed to provide an analysis of currently used and upcoming biomarkers, focusing on developments published in the past 2 years.Type 2  is the most studied asthma mechanism with the most biomarkers in the pipeline. Blood eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) are those most used clinically. Recent developments include their ability to identify individuals at higher risk of exacerbations, faster decline in lung function and more likely to benefit from anti-IL- and anti-IL-4/-13 treatment. Certain patterns of urinary eicosanoid excretion also relate to type 2 . Results of recent trials investigating the use of serum periostin or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 to guide anti-IL-13 therapy were somewhat disappointing. Less is known about non-type 2  but blood neutrophils and YKL-40 may be higher in patients with evidence of non-type 2 asthma. Volatile organic compounds show promise in their ability to distinguish both eosinophilic and neutrophilic asthma.The ultimate panel of biomarkers for identification of activated inflammatory pathways and treatment strategies in asthma patients still lies in the future, particularly for non-type 2 asthma, but potential candidates are available.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654493>Characterization and modulation of microglial phenotypes in an animal model of severe sepsis.</a></h2><p>We aim to characterize the kinetics of early and late microglial phenotypes after systemic  in an animal model of severe sepsis and the effects of minocycline on these phenotypes. Rats were subjected to CLP, and some animals were treated with minocycline (10 ug/kg) by i.c.v. administration. Animals were killed 24 hours, , 10 and 30 days after sepsis induction, and serum and hippocampus were collected for subsequent analyses. Real-time PCR was performed for M1 and M2 markers. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, CCL-22 and nitrite/nitrate levels were measured. Immunofluorescence for IBA-1, CD11b and arginase was also performed. We demonstrated that early after sepsis, there was a preponderant up-regulation of M1 markers, and this was not switched to M2 phenotype markers later on. We found that up-regulation of both M1 and M2 markers co-existed up to 30 days after sepsis induction. In addition, minocycline induced a down-regulation, predominantly, of M1 markers. Our results suggest early activation of M1 microglia that is followed by an overlap of both M1 and M2 phenotypes and that the beneficial effects of minocycline on sepsis-associated brain dysfunction may be related to its effects predominantly on the M1 phenotype.© 2019 The Authors.

He underwent radiotherapy for the brain and lumbar spine metastases, plus chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed). The chemotherapy was discontinued due to vomiting and hyponatremia, and nivolumab was then administered. Eight months later, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed tracer uptake in the colon. Colonoscopy revealed a reddish multinodular polyp in the sigmoid colon. The polyp showed irregular microvessels. No colonic mucosal surface structures were observed. Colonic metastasis of the lung carcinoma was highly suspected; the polyp was therefore surgically removed. The histological analysis revealed granulation tissue and suppurative  without neoplastic changes. We diagnosed the lesion as a granulation polyp. Despite the difficulty in diagnosing these lesions due to their rarity and similarity to metastatic colon tumors, we suggest that recognizing the endoscopic features of the polyp surface may allow a preoperative diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651514>Clinical significance and influencing factors of linked color imaging technique in real-time diagnosis of active Helicobacter pylori infection.</a></h2><p>Determining the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection state during the gastroscopic process is important but still challenging. The linked color imaging (LCI) technique might emphasize the mucosal color change after H. pylori infection, which might help the diagnosis. In the present study, we aimed to compare the LCI technique with traditional white light imaging (WLI) endoscopy for diagnosing active H. pylori infection.We collected and analyzed gastroscopic images from 103 patients in our hospital from November 2017 to March 2018, including both LCI and WLI modes. All images were randomly disordered and independently evaluated by four endoscopists who were blinded to the H. pylori status of patients. In addition, the H. pylori state was determined by both rapid urease test and pathology staining. The sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value (NPV) were calculated for the detection of H. pylori infection. Moreover, the kappa value and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to evaluate the inter-observer variety by SPSS 24.0 software.Of the 103 enrolled patients, 27 of them were positive for H. pylori infection, while the 76 patients were negative. In total, 388 endoscopic images were selected, including 197 WLI and 191 LCI. The accuracy rate for H. pylori evaluation in the corpus LCI group was significantly higher than other groups (81.2% vs. 64.3%-76.%, χ = 34.852, P < 0.001). Moreover, the corpus LCI group had the optimal diagnostic power with the sensitivity of 85.41% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 76.40%-91.51%), the specificity of 79.71% (95% CI: 74.38%-84.19%), the PPV of 59.42% (95% CI: 50.72%-67.59%), and the NPV of 94.02% (95% CI: 89.95%-96.56%), respectively. The kappa values between different endoscopists were higher with LCI than with WLI (0.433-0.554 vs. 0.331-0.554). Consistently, the ICC value was also higher with LCI than with WLI (0.501 [95% CI: 0.429-0.574] vs. 0.397 [95% CI: 0.323-0.474]). We further analyzed the factors that might lead to misjudgment, revealing that active  might disturb WLI judgment (accuracy rate: 58.70% vs. 76.16%, χ = 21.373, P < 0.001). Atrophy and intestinal metaplasia might affect the accuracy of the LCI results (accuracy rate: 66.96% vs. 73.47%, χ = 2.027; 68.42% vs. 73.53%, χ = 1.594, respectively); however, without statistical significance (P = 0.154 and 0.207, respectively).The application of LCI at the corpus to identify H. pylori infection is reliable and superior to WLI.

IRAKs have been previously incriminated in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis and inhibition of IRAKs has been recently regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy for SLE.The aim of the present study was to test the association between IRAK2 rs708035 and rs3844283 with SLE.IRAK2 rs708035 and rs3844283 were genotyped by mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) in 142 SLE patients and 149 age- and gender-matched controls.The hyperfunctional IRAK2 rs708035 A allele was more frequent among SLE patients than controls (62.9% versus 54.7%, p = 0.046). IRAK2 rs3844283 C allele was present in 66.% of patients and 75.% of controls. The CC genotype was the most frequently exhibited genotype. It was carried by 45.1% of patients with SLE and 57.7% of controls. The G allele was associated with an increased risk of SLE (OR = 1.54, 95%, CI = 1.07-2.22, p = 0.017). IRAK2 rs708035 and IRAK2 rs3844283 were in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.64).

Safety (March 2017 cut-off) and efficacy, including patient-reported outcomes, were evaluated.In the double-blind phase, patients receiving sarilumab or adalimumab monotherapy showed meaningful improvements in disease activity; sarilumab was superior to adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms and physical function. Overall, 320/369 patients completing the 24-week double-blind phase entered OLE (155 switched from adalimumab; 165 continued sarilumab). Sarilumab safety profile was consistent with previous reports. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups; no unexpected safety signals emerged in the first 10 weeks postswitch. Among switch patients, improvement in disease activity was evident at OLE week 12: 47.1%/34.8% had changes ≥1.2 in Disease Activity Score (28 joints) (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate/DAS28-C-reactive protein. In switch patients achieving low disease activity (LDA: Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≤10; Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) ≤11) by OLE week 24, 70.7%/69.% sustained CDAI/SDAI LDA at both OLE weeks 36 and 48. Proportions of switch patients achieving CDAI ≤2.8 and SDAI ≤3.3 by OLE week 24 increased through OLE week 48. Improvements postswitch approached continuation-group values, including scores ≥normative values.During this OLE, there were no unexpected safety issues in patients switching from adalimumab to sarilumab monotherapy, and disease activity improved in many patients. Patients continuing sarilumab reported safety consistent with prolonged use and had sustained benefit.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Ly6G is a GPI-linked leukocyte surface Ag understood primarily as a marker of mouse neutrophils, although its full function is not known. Here, we show that Ly6G/Gr1, detected by mAbs 1A8 (anti-Ly6G) and RB6-8C5 (anti-Gr1), is detected prominently on a significant fraction of eosinophils from mouse bone marrow and bone marrow-derived culture, with fractions expressing this Ag increasing in IL--enriched microenvironments. Among our findings, we identified SiglecF Gr1 eosinophils in bone marrow from naïve, allergen-challenged and IL- transgenic mice; SiglecF Gr1 eosinophils were also prominent ex vivo in bone marrow-derived eosinophils (bmEos) in IL--enriched culture. Reducing the IL- concentration 20-fold had no impact on the rate of generation of SiglecF bmEos but did result in a marked increase in the Gr1 fraction (from 17.4 ± 2% to 30 ± 2.3%, ***P < 0.005). Reducing the IL- concentration also enhanced chemotaxis; SiglecF Gr1 bmEos were considerably more responsive to eotaxin-1 than were their SiglecF Gr1 counterparts. These results suggest that (i) IL- regulates the expression of Ly6G/Gr1, either directly or indirectly, in cells of the eosinophil lineage, (ii) eosinophils generated in response to high concentrations of IL- can be distinguished from those generated under homeostatic conditions by expression of the Ly6G/Gr1 cell surface Ag, and (iii) expression of Ly6G/Gr1 may have an impact on function, directly or indirectly, including the potential to undergo chemotaxis in response to eotaxin-1.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672142>Probable progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with immunosuppressant dose reduction following lung transplantation: a case report and literature review.</a></h2><p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rapidly developing demyelinating disease in the cerebral white matter and is often caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV). PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring immunity, could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML  years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities.A 60-year-old female developed PML  years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms.When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves  and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV. Steroid pulse therapy, which can reduce , should thus be administered in organ transplantation cases with differential diagnoses including PML-IRIS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657329>[Clinical significance of antibacterial peptide LL-37 in early diagnosis of patients with sepsis in emergency department].</a></h2><p>To discuss the clinical significance of antibacterial peptide LL-37 in the early diagnosis of patients with sepsis in emergency department.Forty patients diagnosed with sepsis in the emergency department of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College from December 2017 to March 2018 were enrolled as sepsis group. Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled contemporaneously in our hospital at medical center as healthy control group. Peripheral blood was collected immediately after diagnosis in sepsis group or during physical examination in healthy control group. The expression of antibacterial peptide LL-37 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined. The differences in antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP levels between the two groups were compared. Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, and the early individually or jointly diagnostic value of each detected index for sepsis was analyzed.The levels of antimicrobial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP in peripheral blood of sepsis group were significantly higher than those of healthy control group [LL-37 (μg/L): 1.34±0.69 vs. 0.10±0.06, PCT (μg/L): 46.67±39.51 vs. 0.03±0.02, CRP (mg/L): 129.68±49.83 vs. 3.16±2.85], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the expression of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was positively correlated with PCT and CRP levels (r = 0.835, r = 0.932, both P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of LL-37, PCT and CRP for early diagnosis of sepsis was 0.885, 0.963 and 0.983, respectively, and the AUC of combined diagnosis of the three parameters was as high as 0.994, indicating that the value of combined diagnosis of sepsis was greater than that of single diagnosis; when the combined prediction probability of the three parameters was 0.92, the sensitivity was 97.%, and the specificity was 95.0%.Antibacterial peptide LL-37 has certain clinical value in early diagnosis of patients with sepsis, which can be used as early routine monitoring indicators for patients with early sepsis when combined with PCT and CRP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657328>[Clinical investigation on the risk factors for prognosis in patients with septic shock].</a></h2><p>To study the risk factors of prognosis in patients with septic shock, and to provide a reliable evidence to evaluate severity.A retrospective analysis was conducted. The data of 185 patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Anhui Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University from March 2016 to December 2018 were enrolled. Routine blood test, blood biochemistry, blood gas analysis, myoglobin (Myo), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), blood lactic acid (Lac), procalcitonin (PCT) and ratio of C-reactive protein and albumin (CRP/ALB) of patients on the day of septic shock diagnosis were collected. Glasgow coma scale (GCS), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) as well as the time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation were recorded. The patients were divided into death group and survival group according to whether they survived or not on 28 days. According to Myo level, the patients were divided into two groups: Myo elevation group (Myo > 98 μg/L) and Myo normal group (Myo ≤ 98 μg/L). Patients with Myo elevation were divided into survival subgroup and death subgroup according to the prognosis of 28 days. The clinical data were compared among the groups, and the influencing factors of prognosis in septic shock patients were screened by multivariate Logistic regression analysis.185 patients were all enrolled in the final analysis, there were 106 deaths and 79 survivors on 28 days, 154 patients with elevated Myo and 31 patients with normal Myo. (1) Compared with the patients with septic shock in the survival group, the death group had older patients, increased qSOFA, APACHE II, MODS scores and blood Myo, Lac, PCT levels, faster heart rate, decreased GCS score, and shorter time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation. However, there was no significant difference in cTnI or CRP/Alb between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.037, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.010-1.065, P = 0.007], heart rate (OR = 1.020, 95%CI was 1.003-1.037, P = 0.023), qSOFA score (OR = 2.839, 95%CI was 1.321-6.102, P = 0.008), Myo (OR = 1.492, 95%CI was 1.088-2.045, P = 0.013), time from hospitalization to septic shock (OR = 0.938, 95%CI was 0.898-0.980, P = 0.004) and duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.936, 95%CI was 0.899-0.975, P = 0.001) were independent risk factors for prognosis in patients with septic shock. (2) Compared with Myo normal group, the Myo elevation group had higher 28-day mortality [61.0% (94/154) vs. 38.7% (12/31), χ = .259, P = 0.022]. Compared with the survival patients with elevated Myo, the death patients were older, and had higher PCT and qSOFA score, faster heart rate, lower GCS score, and shorter time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation. But there was no significant difference in CRP/Alb between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that qSOFA score (OR = 2.796, 95%CI was 1.270-6.153, P = 0.011), time from hospitalization to septic shock (OR = 0.925, 95%CI was 0.884-0.967, P = 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.931, 95%CI was 0.884-0.980, P = 0.006) were independent risk factors for the prognosis in the septic shock patients with elevated blood Myo.Age, heart rate, qSOFA score, Myo, time from hospitalization to septic shock, duration of mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for the prognosis of patients with septic shock. The 28-day mortality in patients with elevated blood Myo was significantly higher than that in those with normal blood Myo.

Upon stimulation, MCs secrete numerous newly synthesized mediators, but the mechanism of the release of chemokines is not well known. IL-33 is an "alarmin", known to augment allergic stimulation of MCs, but its effect on the release of chemokines is not well known. Stimulation of cultured human MCs (LAD2) and primary MCs (hCBMCs) by IL-33 (1-100 ng/ml) resulted in significant increased gene expression and release of the chemokines CCL5 (P < 0.0001) and CCL2 (P < 0.01). Stimulation with IL-33 (10 ng/ml) activated MAPK components, as shown by phosphorylation of p38α MAPK, JNK, and c-Jun using Western blot analysis. Inhibition of these responses by known inhibitors confirmed that CCL5 and CCL2 are regulated by p38α MAPK, JNK, and IκB-α. Gene expression and release of CCL5 and CCL2 stimulated by IL-33 were significantly inhibited by pre-treatment (10, 50, 100 μM) for 2 h with the flavonoid methoxyluteolin (3',4',,7-tetramethoxyflavone). The inhibition by methoxyluteolin (50 μM) was not mediated via MAPK inhibition as phosphorylated p38α MAPK and JNK expression were not affected. In conclusion, IL-33 plays an important role in chemokine release from human MCs and is regulated by more than one signaling pathway. The inhibitory effect of methoxyluteolin may indicate that it can be developed as a novel treatment for inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

On the basis of our prior data, mice that undergo allogeneic HCT with Tbet-knockout donors (AlloTbet) have increased lung Th17 cells and IL-17A and develop fibrosis resembling human cpGVHD. The role of IL-17A in posttransplant pulmonary fibrosis remains incompletely understood. We hypothesized that IL-17A is necessary for development of murine cpGVHD in this model.AlloTbet mice received weekly intraperitoneal anti-IL-17A or IgG (200 μg/mouse) starting 2 weeks post-HCT and were sacrificed after week . Histologic airway and parenchymal fibrosis were semiquantitatively graded in a blinded fashion. Lung cells and proteins were measured by flow cytometry, ELISA, and multicytokine assays.Anti-IL-17A modestly decreased airway and parenchymal lung fibrosis, along with a striking reduction in pulmonary neutrophilia, IL-6, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, CXCL1, and CXCL5 in AlloTbet mice. Additionally, anti-IL-17A decreased CCL2, inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, and Th17 cells.In the setting of murine AlloHCT with Tbet donors, IL-17A blockade decreases fibrotic features of cpGVHD. This may be mediated by the observed reduction in neutrophils or specific lung monocyte and macrophage populations or alternatively via a direct effect on fibroblasts. Collectively, our results further suggest that anti-IL-17A strategies could prove useful in preventing alloimmune-driven fibrotic lung diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649499>Auranofin Mediates Mitochondrial Dysregulation and Inflammatory Cell Death in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells: Implications of Retinal Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Photoreceptor degeneration occurs in various retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal barrier (oBRB) and supplies glucose, oxygen and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual function. Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an  system.A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF - 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal function, cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors.  < 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis.Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (HO↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis.The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE function and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Yumnamcha, Devi and Singh.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662783>Systematic Review of Herbal Tea (a Traditional Chinese Treatment Method) in the Therapy of Chronic Simple Pharyngitis and Preliminary Exploration about Its Medication Rules.</a></h2><p>Chronic simple pharyngitis (CSP) is a common clinical chronic respiratory  with persistent and intransigent symptoms. We analyzed the clinical data to find the evidence that herbal tea, a traditional Chinese medicine treatment in China, could improve the symptoms of CSP patients in a simple way.We systematically reviewed the clinical data of randomized controlled treatments from April 2019 and evaluated the results using the improved Jadad scale and the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. RevMan .3 software was used for chart analysis. In addition, we used Excel to conduct frequency statistics on Chinese herbs from included articles and analyze its medication rules.Among the collection of 161 articles, 6 RCTs published in Chinese journals were included in this review. The methodological quality of the treatments was low, and most of them only provide diagnostic criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were not specified, and none of the 6 RCTs used the blind method on the result evaluator. Furthermore, only one RCT evaluated the baseline level variance. For these reasons, we did not make a network meta-analysis.The traditional Chinese herbs involved in herbal tea did have ingredients to alleviate CSP symptoms. However, our research showed that the current research could not draw any credible conclusions on the curative effect of herbal tea, which indicated that the overall level of TCM clinical research needs to be improved to evaluate the efficacy of herbal tea.Copyright © 2019 Chengxian Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654757>Analgesic and antipruritic effects of oxymatrine sustained-release microgel cream in a mouse model of inflammatory itch and pain.</a></h2><p>Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a highly prevalent inflammatory and immune skin disease accompanied with persistent pruritus and pain. Oxymatrine (OMT) exhibits antipruritic and anti-inflammatory effects in squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE) induced ACD mice model, but the need for frequent administration stipulated by short half-life and low bioavailability limits clinical application.To evaluate the analgesic and antipruritic effects of OMT gel (OG), OMT sustained release microgel powder (OMP) and OMT sustained release microgel cream (OMC) in SADBE induced ACD mice, with subsequent study of the mechanism and side effects (irritation) of optimal dosage form.On day 11, the thickness of the right cheek skin of mice was measured and mice spontaneous behaviors were recorded for 1. hours. In the OMC experiment, hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining were performed on the cheek skin, and the irritation of OMC was tested on the back skin of rabbits.

Due to the unknown cause of the disease, the most common treatments of MS are targeted for the reduction of  and the repairment of CNS tissue damage, especially myelin restoration. Due to the immune protective nature of herbs, it may be useful to evaluate the impact of herbs in the diet regimen of MS patients along with their immune-mediated effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of an aqueous extract of  (Tarragon) on the treatment of EAE in C57BL/6 mice. In this experimental study, mice were divided into the following control, untreated EAE, and  treated EAE groups. EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) in female C57BL/6 mice. The symptoms of the disease and the weight of the mice were recorded daily. On day 33 after EAE induction, the mice were sacrificed and the specimens were collected. Cell proliferation and cytokine release (TGF-β, IL-17 and IL-23) from mice cultured spleen cells was measured by 3-(4,-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and ELISA respectively.

Salidroside is an important active ingredient extracted from the root of the  plant, which has been reported to have antioxidative, anti-cancer, neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects. However, the effects of salidroside on vascular  have not been clarified. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of salidroside against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced vascular  in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs), a specific cell type derived from coronary micro-vessels. Over a 24-h period, salidroside did not exert any significant cytotoxicity up to a dose of 100 µM. Additionally, salidroside decreased the expression levels of the cell adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in TNF-α-stimulated CMECs, thus suppressing monocyte-to-CMEC adhesion. Salidroside also decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) in TNF-α-induced CMECs, as well as suppressing TNF-α-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB activation. Since MAPKs and NF-κB both serve notable roles in regulating the expression of VCAM-1, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1, the present study provided a preliminary understanding of the mechanism underlying the protective effects of salidroside. Overall, salidroside alleviated vascular  by mediating MAPK and NF-κB activation in TNF-α-induced CMECs. These results indicated that salidroside may have potential applications as a therapeutic agent against vascular  and atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666337>Modified sites and functional consequences of 4-oxo-2-nonenal adducts in HDL that are elevated in familial hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>The lipid aldehyde 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) is a highly reactive protein cross-linker derived from peroxidation of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and generated together with 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Lipid peroxidation product-mediated cross-linking of proteins in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) causes HDL dysfunction and contributes to atherogenesis. Although HNE is relatively well studied, the role of ONE in atherosclerosis and in modifying HDL is unknown. Here, we found that individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) had significantly higher ONE-ketoamide (lysine) adducts in HDL (54.6 ± 33.8 pmol/mg) than healthy controls (15.3 ± .6 pmol/mg). ONE crosslinked apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) on HDL at a concentration of > 3 mol ONE per 10 mol apoA-I (0.3 eq.), which was 100-fold lower than HNE, but comparable to the potent protein crosslinker isolevuglandin. ONE-modified HDL partially inhibited HDL's ability to protect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfα) and interleukin-1β (Il-1β) gene expression in murine macrophages. At 3 eq., ONE dramatically decreased apoA-I exchange from HDL, from ~46.% to ~18.4% (P < 0.001). Surprisingly, ONE modification of HDL or apoA-I did not alter macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that Lys-12, Lys-23, Lys-96, and Lys-226 in apoA-I are modified by ONE ketoamide adducts. Compared with other dicarbonyl scavengers, pentyl-pyridoxamine (PPM) most efficaciously blocked ONE-induced protein cross-linking in HDL and also prevented HDL dysfunction in an in vitro model of . Our findings show that ONE-HDL adducts cause HDL dysfunction and are elevated in individuals with FH who have severe hypercholesterolemia.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663501>Rhinogenic Orbital  - What Has Changed over the Past 50 Years?</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to compare the incidence, diagnostics, and treatment of rhinogenic inflammatory complications over the past 50 years.Retrospective study of 292 patients of ENT department, University hospital: Group A treated from 1966 to 1995, Group B treated from 1996 to 2015.Preseptal  was the most common type (73% vs. 74%), followed by subperiosteal abscess (21% vs. 20%). Surgery was indicated in 35% vs. 37% of the patients (p = 0.434). The most commonly used surgical approach was the external route (80%) in Group A and endoscopic endonasal surgery (60%) or a combination of endoscopic surgery of the paranasal sinuses and external orbitotomy (30%) in Group B (p < 0.001). The percentage of reoperations was 13% vs. 14%. In cases of revision surgery, the orbit was always treated using the external surgical approach. Complete recovery was achieved in 92% and 98.% of the patients belonging to Group A and B, respectively (p = 0.622).Nowadays, the endoscopic endonasal approach is the most frequently used surgical technique for paranasal sinuses. The technique used to treat the orbital complication itself depends on several factors. Nowadays, the endoscopic approach is preferred. The external approach can be considered in the case of recurrent or persistent abscesses, especially if they are located in the upper or the lateral part of the orbit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674069>MAGNETIC RESONANCE ENTEROGRAPHY (MRE) FOR PREDICTING THE CLINICAL COURSE OF CROHN'S DISEASE STRICTURES.</a></h2><p>Background and aims Strictures are the commonest Crohn's disease complication but their natural history is unknown. This study aimed to characterise , predict prognosis, and understand the impact of drug therapy using Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).Patients with a stricture diagnosed on MRE over a -year period were reviewed for MRE disease extent and , clinical course, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), response to anti-TNF therapy, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalization and surgery.136 patients had 235 (77 one and 59 ≥ two) strictures.46% of patients underwent surgery after a median 6 months; median follow-up for those not requiring surgery was 41 months. Predictors of surgery: Hospitalization due to obstruction predicted subsequent surgery (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.06-.90) while anti-TNF therapy commenced at stricture diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05-0.99). MRE characteristics associated with surgery were proximal bowel dilatation ≥30mm diameter (OR, 2.98; 95% CI 1.36-6.55), stricture bowel wall thickness ≥10mm (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.11-.27), and stricture length >5cm (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.21-.43). 81% of patients with these 3 adverse MRE features required surgery versus 17% if none were present (P<0.001). Accuracy for these 3 MRE variables predicting surgery was high (AUC 0.76).MRE findings in Crohn's disease strictures are highly predictive of the disease course and the need for future surgery. MRE may also identify who would benefit from treatment intensification. Anti-TNF therapy is associated with reduced risk of surgery and appears to alter the natural history of this complication.This article is protected by copyright.

Studies have found that enhancement of autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process, may limit the pathologic progression of OA. Chloramphenicol is a potent activator of autophagy; however, the effects of chloramphenicol on articular cartilage are unknown.Using human OA knee chondrocytes in vitro, we asked, does chloramphenicol (1) activate autophagy in chondrocytes; (2) protect chondrocytes from IL-1β-induced apoptosis; and (3) reduce the expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-13 and IL-6 (markers associated with articular cartilage degradation and joint ). Using an in vivo rabbit model of OA, we asked, does an intra-articular injection of chloramphenicol in the knee (4) induce autophagy; () reduce OA severity; and (6) reduce MMP-13 expression?Human chondrocytes were extracted from 10 men with OA undergoing TKA. After treatment with 25 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL, or 100μg/mL chloramphenicol, the autophagy of chondrocytes was detected with Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, or an autophagy detection kit. There were four groups in our study: one group was untreated, one was treated with 100 μg/mL chloramphenicol, another was treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-1β, and the final group was treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-1β and 100 μg/mL of chloramphenicol. All groups were treated for 48 hours; cell apoptosis was detected with Western blotting and flow cytometry.  marker IL-6 in the cell culture supernatant was detected with an ELISA. Articular cartilage degradation-related enzyme MMP-13 was analyzed with Western blotting. A rabbit model of OA was induced by intra-articular injection of type II collagenase in 20 male 3-month-old New Zealand White rabbits' right hind leg knees; the left hind leg knees served as controls. Rabbits were treated by intra-articular injection of saline or chloramphenicol once a week for 8 weeks. Autophagy of the articular cartilage was detected with Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy. Degeneration of articular cartilage was analyzed with Safranin O-fast green staining and the semi-quantitative index Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) grading system. Degeneration of articular cartilage was evaluated using the OARSI grading system. The expression of MMP-13 in articular cartilage was detected with immunohistochemistry.Chloramphenicol activated autophagy in vitro in the chondrocytes of humans with OA and in an in vivo rabbit model of OA. Chloramphenicol inhibited IL-1-induced apoptosis (flow cytometry results with chloramphenicol, 25.33 ± 3.51%, and without chloramphenicol, 44.00 ± 3.61%, mean difference, 18.67% [95% CI 10.60 to 26.73]; p = 0.003) and the production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 (ELISA results, with chloramphenicol, 720.00 ± 96.44 pg/mL, without chloramphenicol, 966.67 ± 85.05 pg/mL; mean difference 74.24 pg/mL [95% CI 39.28 to 454.06]; p = 0.029) in chondrocytes. After chloramphenicol treatment, the severity of cartilage degradation was reduced in the treatment group (OARSI 6.80 ± 2.71) compared with the control group (12.30 ± 2.77), (mean difference .50 [95% CI 1.50 to 9.50]; p = 0.013). Furthermore, chloramphenicol treatment also decreased the production of MMP-13 in vitro and in vivo.Chloramphenicol reduced the severity of cartilage degradation in a type II collagen-induced rabbit model of OA, which may be related to induction of autophagy and inhibition of MMP-13 and IL-6.Our study suggests that an intra-articular injection of chloramphenicol may reduce degeneration of articular cartilage and that induction of autophagy may be a method for treating OA. The animal model we used was type II collagen-induced OA, which was different from idiopathic OA and post-traumatic OA. Therefore, we need to use other types of OA models (idiopathic OA or a surgically induced OA model) to further verify its effect, and the side effects of chloramphenicol also need to be considered, such as myelosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired  at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic acid-dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and , leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid metabolic genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662579>Aspirin associated with decreased rate of intracranial aneurysm growth.</a></h2><p>Aspirin has emerged as a potential agent in the prevention of rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). In this study, the authors' goal was to test if aspirin is protective against aneurysm growth in patients harboring multiple IAs ≤  mm.The authors performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database covering the period July 2009 through January 2019. Patients' data were included if the following criteria were met: 1) the patient harbored multiple IAs; 2) designated primary aneurysms were treated by surgical/endovascular means; 3) the remaining aneurysms were observed for growth; and 4) a follow-up period of at least  years after the initial treatment was available. Demographics, earlier medical history, the rupture status of designated primary aneurysms, aneurysms' angiographic features, and treatment modalities were gathered.The authors identified 146 patients harboring a total of 375 IAs. At the initial encounter, 146 aneurysms were treated and the remaining 229 aneurysms (2- mm) were observed. During the follow-up period, 24 (10.48%) of 229 aneurysms grew. All aneurysms observed to grow later underwent treatment. None of the observed aneurysms ruptured. Multivariate analysis showed that aspirin was significantly associated with a decreased rate of growth (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.63). Variables associated with an increased rate of growth included hypertension (OR 14.38, 95% CI 3.83-53.94), drug abuse (OR 11.26, 95% CI 1.21-104.65), history of polycystic kidney disease (OR 9.48, 95% CI 1.51-59.35), and subarachnoid hemorrhage at presentation (OR .91, 95% CI 1.83-19.09).In patients with multiple IAs, aspirin significantly decreased the rate of aneurysm growth over time.

The aim of this study was to investigate low-dose radiation response in hippocampus. Female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to total body irradiation with 0 (control), 0.063 Gy, 0.125 Gy or 0. Gy. Quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of hippocampus was performed after 24 months. CREB signaling and CREB-associated pathways were affected at all doses. The lower doses (0.063 Gy and 0.125 Gy) induced the CREB pathway, whereas the exposure to 0. Gy deactivated CREB. Similarly, the lowest dose (0.063 Gy) was anti-inflammatory, reducing the number of activated microglia. In contrast, induction of activated microglia and reactive astroglia was found at 0. Gy suggesting increased  and astrogliosis, respectively. The apoptotic markers BAX and cleaved CASP-3 and oxidative stress markers were increased only at the highest dose. Since activated CREB pathway plays a central role in learning and memory, these data suggest neuroprotection at the lowest dose (0.063 Gy) but neurodegeneration at 0. Gy. The response to 0.

This study aimed to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AJM300 in healthy male subjects.A total of 23 subjects were randomised to receive 240 mg (n=6), 480 mg (n=), 960 mg (n=6) of AJM300 or the corresponding placebo (n=2 per group). The study drugs were taken orally three times daily after each meal on the first day followed by a four-day washout period. Thereafter, multiple-dose administration was conducted for six consecutive days. The pharmacokinetic parameters of AJM300 and its active metabolite (HCA2969) were assessed, and total white blood cells and the differential cell count were used to determine the pharmacodynamic effects. Adverse events (AEs) were also monitored.The plasma AJM300 and HCA2969 concentration-time curves displayed a tri-phasic pattern on Day 1 (single-day administration) and Day 10 (last day of multiple dosing), whereas the concentration of HCA2969 was much higher than that of AJM300. A significant but transient increase in lymphocyte count was observed after AJM300 dosing at all dosages tested compared with the placebo. The increase was sustained over a 24-hour period only at the 960 mg dosage. In particular, a significant increase in the lymphocyte count compared to placebo (mean, 50.58%; 95% confidence intervals, 20.40-80.76) was observed at the first 960 mg dose on Day 10. Six (26.1%) subjects reported ≥1 AE, all of which were mild and resolved spontaneously.The maximal and 24-hour sustained pharmacodynamic effects were demonstrated at the 960 mg dosage after oral administration of AJM300 three times daily for six days, which was also found to be safe and well tolerated.This article is protected by copyright.

However, they are not always effective against both gastric and duodenal lesions and their use is not devoid of side effects.To explore the mechanisms mediating the clinical efficacy of STW  in gastro-duodenal lesions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), exemplified here by diclofenac, in a comparison to omeprazole.Gastro-duodenal lesions were induced in rats by oral administration of diclofenac ( mg/kg) for 6 successive days. One group was given concurrently STW  ( mL/kg) while another was given omeprazole (20 mg/kg). A day later, animals were sacrificed, stomach and duodenum excised and divided into 2 segments: One for histological examination and one for measuring inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins-1β and 10), oxidative stress enzyme (heme oxygenase-1) and apoptosis regulator (B-cell lymphoma 2).Diclofenac caused overt histological damage in both tissues, associated with parallel changes in all parameters measured. STW  and omeprazole effectively prevented these changes, but STW  superseded omeprazole in protecting against histological damage, particularly in the duodenum.The findings support the therapeutic usefulness of STW  and its superiority over omeprazole as adjuvant therapy to NSAIDs to protect against their possible gastro-duodenal side effects.©The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to evaluate perioperative factors in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) undergoing major vascular surgery to determine the likely mechanisms and predictors of PMI.This was a prospective cohort study of 133 patients undergoing major vascular surgery including open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (n = 40) and major suprainguinal or infrainguinal arterial bypasses (non-AAA; n = 93). Preoperative assessment with history, physical examination, and peripheral artery tonometry was performed in addition to plasma sampling of biomarkers associated with  and coronary plaque instability. The primary outcome was occurrence of a 30-day cardiovascular event (CVE; composite of PMI [troponin I elevation >99th percentile reference of ≥0.1 μg/L], stroke, or death).Of 133 patients, 36 patients (27%) developed a 30-day CVE after vascular surgery, and all were PMI. Patients with 30-day CVE were older (75 ± 8 years vs 69 ± 10 years, mean ± standard deviation; P = .001), had higher prevalence of hypertension (94% vs 79%; P = .01) and preoperative beta-blocker therapy (50% vs 29%; P = .02), and had longer duration of surgery (.1 ± 1.8 hours vs 4.0 ± 1.1 hours; P < .0001). Significant elevations in cystatin C, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin I, high-sensitivity troponin T, matrix metalloproteinase 3, and osteoprotegerin occurred in those who developed 30-day CVE (all P < .05). Multivariate binary logistic regression identified AAA surgery and log-transformed NT-proBNP to be independent preoperative predictors of 30-day CVE (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.81).In patients with peripheral artery disease undergoing major vascular surgery, the likely mechanism of PMI appears to be the hemodynamic stress related to the type and duration of surgery. NT-proBNP was a useful independent predictor of CVE and thus may serve as an important biomarker of cardiovascular fitness for surgery.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery.

An ICH rat model was established in the current study and 1 h following ICH induction, rats were treated with or without an miR-146a mimic. A total of 3 days following ICH induction, rat neurological score, brain water content and neuronal apoptosis were measured via flow cytometry. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β were detected via ELISA and certain biomarkers of oxidative stress, including malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, were also determined in current study. The expression of genes and proteins were detected in current study via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. MicroRNA.org software and a dual luciferase reporter assay were used to confirm the association between miR-146a and TRAF6. The results of the current study revealed that miR-146a was significantly downregulated in ICH rats, and its overexpression reduced neurological damage and brain edema, as evidenced by decreased neurological scores and brain water content. Results from further analyses demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-146a inhibited neuronal apoptosis, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and prevented oxidative stress in ICH rats. In addition, it was revealed that the upregulation of miR-146a repressed the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway in the brain tissue of ICH rats. TRAF6 was also determined to be a target of miR-146a. In conclusion, these data indicated that miR-146a protects against ICH by inhibiting  and oxidative stress.Copyright: © Qu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663504>Effect of Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy on the Serum Sialic Acid Levels in Diabetic Patients with Periodontitis.</a></h2><p>Sialic acid (SA), a family of acetylated derivatives of neuraminic acid, an acute phase reactant by itself. It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of diabetes along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal  can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ±  mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status. Periodontitis could be considered as a potential, modifiable, and independent risk factor for the development of diabetes.

The review summarizes the latest data on the role of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interferons (IFNs), in skin wound healing, including those obtained with the use of genome editing techniques and methods of reverse genetics to establish relevant animal models. The roles that proinflammatory cytokines play at various stages of skin regeneration are discussed for both normal state and systemic pathologies, such as diabetes. Promising approaches to treating poorly healing wounds are summarized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672435>Contemporary cardiovascular outcomes in Taiwanese patients undergoing endovascular therapy for symptomatic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease.</a></h2><p>To investigate contemporary cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in Taiwanese patients with symptomatic low extremity peripheral artery disease treated with endovascular therapy.An observational cohort study with up to 155 months of follow-up was conducted using a single-center registry database between July 2005 and June 2017. Long-term outcomes and predictors of future CV events were analyzed in 936 patients with 1246 affected legs.This study cohort comprised 21% claudicants and 79% critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients. Compared with claudicants, CLI patients had higher rates of medical comorbidities, tissue , and lesion complexities. During the study period, 349 patients died (130 CV deaths and 219 non-CV deaths), 306 had non-fatal CV events. The rates of -year freedom from all-cause mortality, major CV events (MACEs), and non-fatal CV events were 54.9%, 67.1%, and 56.6% respectively. For CLI patients, independent factors for all-cause mortality were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03), atrial fibrillation (OR 1.79), albumin (OR 0.62), hematocrit (OR 0.96), body mass index (OR 0.94), C-reactive protein (OR 1.18), dialysis (OR 2.16), and non-ambulance (OR 2.05). Congestive heart failure, dialysis, and non-ambulance independently predicted the MACEs (OR 2.04, 1.93, and 1.67, respectively). For claudicants, coronary artery disease (CAD) was the essential factor for all-cause mortality (OR 2.24), MACE (OR 2.76) and non-fatal CV events (OR 1.82).Long-term survival and MACE-free rates were significantly worse in CLI patients than in claudicants. Malnutrition and  were associated with long-term survival. CAD, low hematocrit, dialysis, CHF, and ambulatory status predicted future CV events.Copyright © 2019 Formosan Medical Association.

Whether COPD is a risk factor for LVDD remains largely unclear.The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine if the prevalence of the LVDD as determined by echocardiographic parameters is increased in COPD patients.We used a time-and-language-restricted search strategy resulting in identification of 4,912 studies of which 15 studies met our apriori inclusion criteria; 4,897 were excluded, such duplicates, foreign language articles were excluded. We performed a meta-analysis of standard echo parameters on the fifteen case control studies related to diastolic dysfunction. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager, version .3 (Cochrane Collaboration).A total of 15 studies with 1,403 subjects were included. There were no differences in left ventricular ejection fraction between COPD and non-COPD population. Patients with COPD had prolonged isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) (mean difference 20.84 [95% CI 12.21, 29.47]; P< 0.00001), lower E/A ratio (mean difference - 0.24 [95% CI -0.34, 00.14]; P < 0.00001), higher transmitral A wave peak velocity (Apv) (mean difference 11.71 [95% CI 4.80, 18.62]; P< 0.00001), higher E/e' ratio (mean difference 1.88 [95% CI 1.23, 2.53]; P< 0.00001), lower mitral E wave peak velocity (Epv) (mean difference -8.74 [95% CI -13.63, -3.85]; P< 0.0005), prolonged deceleration time (DT) (mean difference 50.24 [95% CI 15.60, 84,89]; P< 0.004), a higher right ventricular end diastolic diameter (RVEDD) (mean difference 8.02 [95% CI 3.45, 12.60]; P< 0.0006) compared to controls. COPD patients had a higher pulmonary arterial pressure (mean difference 10.52 [95% CI 3.98, 17.05]; P< 0.002). Differences in septal e' velocity (mean difference -2.69 [95% CI -6.07, 0.69]; P< 0.12) and in lateral e' velocity (mean difference -2.84 [95% CI .91, 0.24]; P< 0.07) trended towards significance but did not meet our cutoff for statistical significance (p < 0.05).Patients with COPD are more likely to have LVDD as established by echocardiographic parameters. Our findings are likely explainable, in part, by factors such as lung hyperinflation, chronic hypoxia, hypercapnia, systemic , increased arterial stiffness, subendocardial ischemia, as well as ventricular interdependence; all of which might contribute to the pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms of increased LVDD in the COPD population with the potential impact on developing effective therapeutic interventions for these serious disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668733>Role of Serum High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein as a Predictor of Therapeutic Response to Tadalafil in Patients With Erectile Dysfunction: A Prospective Observational Study.</a></h2><p>High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of , is known to be elevated in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). However, its role in predicting therapeutic response to phosphodiesterase- inhibitors is incompletely understood.The aim of this study was to understand the relationship among hs-CRP, mechanism of ED, and therapeutic response of ED to tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase- inhibitor.A total of 282 men (mean age 36.6 ± 12.0 years) with ED were included. All subjects underwent detailed evaluation, including estimation of a 6-item abbreviated version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6) score, penile Doppler studies, and measurement of hs-CRP. IIEF-6 scoring and hs-CRP measurement were repeated after 6 weeks of tadalafil therapy (10 mg/day). The patients were categorized into vasculogenic and nonvasculogenic ED groups based on penile Doppler findings.The main outcome measure was the therapeutic response to tadalafil, in relation to the mechanism of ED and hs-CRP levels.Vasculogenic ED was much less common (23.8% of the subjects) than non-vasculogenic ED. Subjects with vasculogenic ED were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, had more severe (mean IIEF-6 score 9.2 ± 4.6 vs 14.8 ± 4.7; P < .001) and longer duration ED, and responded less favorably to therapy (response rate 10.4% vs 75.0%; P < .001). Those showing improvement with tadalafil had lower hs-CRP at baseline (median 1. mg/L [interquartile range 0.9-2.3] vs 2.0 mg/L [interquartile range 1.1-3.1; P = .034]) and had proportionately greater reduction in its level. However, on multivariate analysis, only shorter duration of ED (P = .008), non-vasculogenic origin (P = .025), and higher IIEF-6 score at baseline (P = .013) were independent predictors of response to treatment.Serum hs-CRP is elevated in patients who are less likely to respond to vasodilator therapy but does not have an independent predictive value for this purpose.This is the largest study to evaluate the relationship among the mechanism of ED, serum hs-CRP level, and therapeutic response of ED to tadalafil. All patients underwent a penile Doppler study to characterize the type of ED. The limitations were nonrandomized nature of the study and nearly 22% dropout rate.Serum hs-CRP level is higher in vasculogenic ED compared with non-vasculogenic ED, and is associated with poorer response to tadalafil therapy. However, this association is not independent of underlying risk factors and mechanism of ED. Jamaluddin, Bansal M, Srivastava GK, et al.

Impaired transplacental transfer of influenza antibodies may reduce this protection.We conducted a cross-sectional study of influenza vaccine-naïve pregnant women recruited at delivery from Blantyre (urban, low malaria transmission) and Chikwawa (rural, high malaria transmission) in Southern Malawi. HIV-infected mothers were excluded in Chikwawa. Maternal and cord blood antibodies against circulating influenza strains A/California/7/2009, A/Victoria/361/2011, B/Brisbane/60/2008, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). We studied the impact of maternal HIV infection and placental malaria on influenza antibody levels in mother-infant pairs in Blantyre and Chikwawa, respectively.We included 454 mother-infant pairs (Blantyre, n = 253; Chikwawa, n = 201). HIV-infected mothers and their infants had lower seropositivity (HAI titer ≥1:40) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (mothers, 24.3 vs 45.4%;  = .02; infants, 24.3 vs 50.%;  = .003) and A(H3N2) (mothers, 37.8% vs 63.9%;  = .003; infants, 43.2 vs 64.8%;  = .01), whereas placental malaria had an inconsistent effect on maternal and infant seropositivity. In multivariable analyses, maternal HIV infection was associated with reduced infant seropositivity (A(H1N1)pdm09: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.79; A(H3N2): aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89). Transplacental transfer was not impaired by maternal HIV or placental malaria.Maternal HIV infection influenced maternal antibody response to influenza A virus infection, and thereby antibody levels in newborns, but did not affect transplacental antibody transfer.© The Author(s) 2019.

The MTT assay was used for cellular viability assessment. Viability of cells was observed using inverted light microscope 24, 48 and 72 h after exposure of the cells to various concentrations of TQ (1, 2., , 10, 50 and 100 μg/ml) and Cis-platinum (0., 1, 1., 2, 3, 6 and 12. μg/ml). Moreover, apoptosis was analyzed with a flow-cytometry method. The untreated cells were considered as control group.Morphological changes such as reduced cell number and increased intercellular distance and reduced cell viability in ACHN and GP-293cell lines were observed in both TQ and Cis-platinum groups; however, Cis-platinum had greater effect on ACHN cell line than GP-293 cell line. In addition, GP-293 cell line was more sensitive to TQ compared to ACHN cell line. Furthermore, TQ and Cis-platinum had apoptotic effects on both ACHN and GP-293 cell lines.Our findings demonstrated that TQ and Cis-platinum had cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on both cell lines, However, GP-293 cell line was more sensitive to TQ.

We recently demonstrated a protective role for resveratrol (RES) in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. However, the effect of RES on cardiac fibrosis and diastolic function in this model remains unclear.Cardiac remodeling was induced in mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 2-4 weeks. RES was administered at dose of  or 50 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. We found that RES administration at 50 mg/kg/day significantly attenuated TAC-induced adverse cardiac systolic and diastolic function, fibrosis, , and oxidative stress via inhibiting PTEN degradation and the downstream mediators. However, RES at  mg/kg/day had no significant effects. RES at 50 mg/kg/day also ameliorated pre-established adverse cardiac function and remodeling induced by TAC. Treatment with PTEN inhibitor VO-OHpic (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks abolished RES-mediated protective effects. Additionally, we verified the effect of RES (100 µM) on inhibition of Ang II-induced fibroblast proliferation and activation in vitro.Our findings provide new evidence that RES plays a critical role in the progression of cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction, and suggest that RES may be a promising therapeutic agent for cardiac fibrosis.

IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating  and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors. In addition, we discuss the prospects for the application of IL-33 and ST2 as diagnostic biomarkers and targets for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659856>Clinical and laboratory predictions of myocardial  as detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with systemic sclerosis: A pilot study.</a></h2><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) has high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating cardiac fibrosis from .

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon  and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Because a hemostatic agent is a foreign body, it can cause foreign body reactions, , and infections that can interfere with the wound healing process. Therefore, we should select hemostatic agents after considering their effects on wound healing. Here, we compared the effects of hemostatic agents on wound healing in a rectus abdominis muscle defect in rats.Twelve Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to creation of a 6 × 6 mm defect in the rectus abdominis muscle and divided into four groups: control group; group A, Tachosil fibrin sealant patch; group B, Surgicel Fibrillar oxidized regenerated cellulose; and group C, Surgicel Snow oxidized regenerated cellulose. For the histologic analysis, biopsies were performed on the 3rd, 7th, and 27th days.The foreign body reaction was the weakest in group A and most significant in group C. The inflammatory cell infiltration was the weakest in group A and similar in groups B and C. Muscle regeneration differed among periods. The rats in group A were the most active initially, while those in group C showed prolonged activity.Tachosil and Surgicel administration increased  via foreign body reactions, but the overall wound healing process was not significantly affected. The increased  in the Surgicel groups was due to a low pH. We recommend using Tachosil, because it results in less intense foreign body reactions than Surgicel and faster wound healing due to the fibrin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669599>Impact of dietary anthocyanins on systemic and vascular : Systematic review and meta-analysis on randomised clinical trials.</a></h2><p>Anthocyanins are natural bioactive compounds that have several health benefits.

The interactions between ILs and adaptive immunity have been long considered secondary to the effects on the innate immune system, but in recent years it has appeared more clearly that IL direct interactions with adaptive immunity are extremely important both in physiologic and pathologic immune response. In the present review we analyze the role of inflammatory ILs (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33 and IL-37) on adaptive immunity and briefly discuss the possible therapeutic perspectives of IL-blockade in adaptive immunity disorders.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654988>Total Glucosides of Paeony protects against collagen-induced mouse arthritis via inhibiting follicular helper T cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>The development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to germinal center (GC) response and autoreactive T cells, which mediate adaptive immunity and play an important role in stimulating the production of autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines by B cells and macrophages. Total Glucosides of Paeony (TGP) has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and analgesic effects and is widely used to treat RA. However, few studies investigated whether the therapeutic effect of TGP is associated with the inhibition of autoimmune response.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of TGP on RA.Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used, and TGP and paeoniflorin were intragastrically treated.DBA/1 mice were divided into  groups: control, model, positive drug (paeoniflorin) and high- and low-dose TGP group. After 21 days of intragastric administration, the pathological change,  expression and molecular mechanism of each group of mice were detected by Micro-CT, histochemical analysis, ELLSA, Western blot, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.Our study found that TGP treatment effectively improved  and joint destruction in CIA mice. It reduced the production of serum IgG2a and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including serum interleukin (IL)-21, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, TGP could suppress the frequency of germinal center B cells and Tfh cells in the spleen.TGP can not only improve symptoms, but also inhibit bone destruction. The therapeutic effect of TGP on CIA is mainly achieved by inhibiting spleen Tfh cell differentiation and GC formation through STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
