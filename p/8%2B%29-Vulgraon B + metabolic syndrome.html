Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) adversely affects posttransplant outcomes, but its risk factors in relation to cholesterol metabolism have not been fully delineated. The apolipoprotein /A1 (Apo /A1) ratio, which is associated with insulin resistance, has not been evaluated in kidney transplant recipients as a risk factor for PTDM.The objective of this study was to determine whether serum apolipoprotein profiles predict late PTDM, defined as a new onset diabetes occurring greater than 3 months posttransplant.Retrospective chart review of a prevalent population of kidney transplant recipients.Large transplant center in Ontario, Canada.We identified 1104 previously nondiabetic adults who received a kidney transplant between January 1, 1998, and December 1, 2015, and were followed at 1 transplant center.Recipients provided testing for serum apolipoprotein  (Apo ) and apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) concentrations from 2010, either at 3 months posttransplant for new transplant recipients or the next clinic visit for prevalent recipients. Late PTDM defined using Canadian Diabetes Association criteria as occurring ≥3 months posttransplant was recorded until May 1, 2016.All analyses were conducted with R, version 3.4.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Comparisons were made using Student  test, Fisher exact test or chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier methodology with the logrank test, or Cox proportional hazards analysis as appropriate. Covariates for the multivariate Cox proportional hazards models of PTDM as the outcome variable were selected based on significance of the univariate associations and biological plausibility.There were 53 incident late PTDM cases, or 1.71 cases per 100 patient-years. Incident late PTDM differed between the highest and lowest quartiles for Apo /A1 ratio, 2.47 per 100 patient-years vs 0.88 per 100 patient-years ( = .005 for difference). In multiple Cox regression analysis, first measured serum Apo /A1 concentration better predicted subsequent PTDM than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; hazard ratio [HR] = 7.80 per unit increase,  = .039 vs HR = 1.05 per unit increase,  = .774). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations also did not predict PTDM ( = .136). By contrast to Apo , Apo A1 was protective against PTDM in statin users (HR = 0.17 per unit increase,  = .016).Posttransplant diabetes mellitus cases occurring before apolipoprotein testing was implemented were not included in the analysis.Apolipoproteins  and A1 better predict late PTDM than conventional markers of cholesterol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645877>A Novel Pathogenic Variant in NAGLU (N-Acetyl-Alpha-Glucosaminidase) gene Identified by Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Followed by in Silico Analysis.</a></h2><p>Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPS IIIB) (Sanfilippo  Type ; OMIM 252920) is an autosomal recessive  disorder caused by mutations in the  gene which encode lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, involved in degradation of complex polysaccharide, heparan sulfate. The disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral difficulties and motor function retardation.In this study, targeted exome sequencing was used in consanguineous parent (mother) of a deceased child with clinical diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the candidate pathogenic variants in extended family members and segregation analysis. In silico pathogenicity assessment of detected variant using multiple computational predictive tools were performed. Computational docking using the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 6.0.1 software applied to evaluate affinity binding of altered protein for its ligand, N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine. Moreover, with I-TASSER software functional alterations between wild and mutant proteins evaluated.We identiﬁed a novel heterozygote deletion variant (c.1294-1304 del CTCTTCCCCAA, p.432LeufsX25) in the  gene. The variant was classified as pathogenic based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guideline. Computational docking with the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 6.0.1 software confirmed different affinity binding of truncated protein for its ligand. Moreover, I-TASSER software revealed structural and functional alterations of mutant proteins.This study expands the spectrum of  pathogenic variants and confirms the utility of targeted NGS sequencing in genetic diagnosis and also the utility and power of additional family information.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280506>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is Associated with Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection in Premenopausal Women Independent of .</a></h2><p>Recently, studies have found that non-alcholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with bacterial infections. Attempts to identify risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are still underway.To examine a possible association between NAFLD and rUTIs among premenopausal women.In a case-control study, 1009 hospitalized premenopausal women with a UTI during a period of 3 years were retrospectively studied. A total of 186 subjects with rUTIs and 186 controls without a history of rUTIs were included in this study. Each participant had an abdominal ultrasonogram as part of the inclusion criteria. The two groups were compared in terms of risk factors for rUTIs, such as maternal history of rUTIs, use of contraceptives, frequency of sexual intercourse, , obesity, use of probiotics, serum levels of vitamin D, and NAFLD. An rUTI was defined as three or more episodes of UTI over a period of 1 year. NAFLD was diagnosed based on abdominal ultrasonography examination.Mean age of the 372 participants was 39.7 ± 5 years. NAFLD was diagnosed in 81/186 subjects (43.5%) with rUTIs vs. 40/186 controls (21.5%), P = 0.05. Women with rUTIs were more often obese and presented with lower serum levels of vitamin D than controls. Multivariate analysis showed that NAFLD (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.0, P = 0.04) were associated with rUTIs in premenopausal women.NAFLD was associated with rUTI in premenopausal women, independent of .

Clinical phenotypes range from severe (Hurler ) to attenuated (Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes) and vary in age of onset, severity, and rate of progression. Defining the phenotype at diagnosis is essential for disease management. To date, no systematic analysis of genotype-phenotype correlation in large MPS I cohorts have been performed. Understanding genotype-phenotype is critical now that newborn screening for MPS I is being implemented. Data from 538 patients from the MPS I Registry (380 severe, 158 attenuated) who had 2 IDUA alleles identified were examined. In the 1076 alleles identified, 148 pathogenic variants were reported; of those, 75 were unique. Of the 538 genotypes, 147 (27%) were unique; 40% of patients with attenuated and 22% of patients with severe MPS I had unique genotypes. About 67.6% of severe patients had genotypes where both variants identified are predicted to severely disrupt protein/gene function and 96.1% of attenuated patients had at least one missense or intronic variant. This dataset illustrates a close genotype/phenotype correlation in MPS I but the presence of unique IDUA missense variants remains a challenge for disease prediction.© 2019 The Authors.

Obesity and low-grade chronic inflammation are frequently associated with PCOS. Recently, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR)-derived glycoprotein profiles have emerged as potential biomarkers that reflect systemic inflammation in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other pathological processes. The aim of this work is to study plasma glycoprotein profiles as /inflammatory biomarkers underlying PCOS and its association with inflammation and obesity. We used H-NMR spectroscopy to study five glycoprotein variables, namely GlycA, GlycB, and GlycF and the height-to-width (/) ratio of GlycA and GlycB, in 17 women with PCOS (9 non-obese and 8 obese), 17 control women (9 non-obese and 8 obese), and 19 healthy men (10 non-obese and 9 obese). / ratios of GlycA and GlycB, but not glycoprotein areas, were specifically associated with PCOS independently of obesity. When considered as a whole, obese subjects presented higher GlycA, GlycB, and GlycF areas and higher / GlycA and GlycB ratios than their non-obese counterparts. All glycoprotein variables were associated with hsCRP, IL-6, and TNF-α, showing different correlations among PCOS, women, and men. Our present exploratory results suggest that H-NMR-derived glycoprotein profiles might serve as novel diagnostic markers of low-grade chronic inflammation in women with PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243439>Almond Consumption and Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that eating nuts may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating almond consumption and risk factors for CVD. MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau, and previous systematic reviews were searched from 1990 through June 2017 for RCTs of ≥3 wk duration that evaluated almond compared with no almond consumption in adults who were either healthy or at risk for CVD. The most appropriate stratum was selected with an almond dose closer to 42.5 g, with a control most closely matched for macronutrient composition, energy intake, and similar intervention duration. The outcomes included risk factors for CVD. Random-effects model meta-analyses and subgroup meta-analyses were performed. Fifteen eligible trials analyzed a total of 534 subjects. Almond intervention significantly decreased total cholesterol (summary net change: -10.69 mg/dL; 95% CI: -16.75, -4.63 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (summary net change: -5.83 mg/dL; 95% CI: -9.91, -1.75 mg/dL); body weight (summary net change: -1.39 kg; 95% CI: -2.49, -0.30 kg), HDL cholesterol (summary net change: -1.26 mg/dL; 95% CI: -2.47, -0.05 mg/dL), and apolipoprotein  (apoB) (summary net change: -6.67 mg/dL; 95% CI: -12.63, -0.72 mg/dL). Triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, apolipoprotein A1, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein (a) showed no difference between almond and control in the main and subgroup analyses. Fasting blood glucose, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index significantly decreased with almond consumption of >42.5 g compared with ≤42.5 g. Almond consumption may reduce the risk of CVD by improving blood lipids and by decreasing body weight and apoB. Substantial heterogeneity in eligible studies regarding almond interventions and dosages precludes firmer conclusions.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312448>Long term management of obstructive sleep apnea and its comorbidities.</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a worldwide highly prevalent disease associated with systemic consequences, including excessive sleepiness, impairment of neurocognitive function and daytime performance, including driving ability. The long-term sequelae of OSA include and increase risk for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and  disorders that ultimately lead to premature death if untreated. To ensure optimal long-term outcomes, the assessment and management of OSA should be personalized with the involvement of the appropriate specialist. Most studies have demonstrated inmediate improvement in daytime somnolence and quality of life with CPAP and other therapies, but the effect of long-term treatment on mortality is still under debate. Currently, the long-term management of OSA should be based on a) identifying physiological or structural abnormalities that are treatable at the time of patient evaluation and ) comprehensive lifestyle interventions, especially weight-loss interventions, which are associated with improvements in OSA severity, cardiometabolic comorbidities, and quality of life. In long-term management, attention should be paid to the clinical changes related to a potential reoccurrence of OSA symptoms and it is also necessary to monitor throughout the follow up how the main associated comorbidities evolve.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314039>Effect of chrysin on changes in intestinal environment and microbiome induced by fructose-feeding in rats.</a></h2><p>Intake of fructose-containing sugars is epidemiological and experimentally linked to  (MS). We recently verified that the dietary polyphenol chrysin was able to abolish some of the  changes induced by fructose-feeding in the rat. Because the role of the intestine upon fructose-induced MS is poorly understood, we decided to investigate the influence of fructose, in vivo, on the intestinal environment and the ability of chrysin to interfere with the putative observed changes. For this, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 18 weeks as follows: (A) tap water (CONT), () tap water and chrysin (100 mg kg day) (CHRY), (C) 10% fructose in tap water (FRUCT), and (D) 10% fructose in tap water and chrysin (100 mg kg day) (FRUCT + CHRY). Our findings show that the relative expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2 mRNA were not affected by fructose-feeding and/or chrysin. In contrast, GLUT5 mRNA expression was markedly increased in fructose-fed animals, and this effect was reduced by chrysin. However, the apparent permeability to C-FRUCT was markedly and similarly decreased in FRUCT, CHRY and FRUCT + CHRY rats. Jejunal villus width and crypt depth were significantly higher in FRUCT and FRUCT + CHRYS rats, respectively. Finally, chrysin did not alter gut microbiota composition, but fructose significantly increased Lactobacillus and E. coli. Moreover, FRUCT + CHRY rats had an increase on the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. This is the first report showing that chrysin is able to interfere with the effects of fructose at the intestinal level, which may contribute to the fructose-induced MS features.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250684>Is sarcoidosis related to  and insulin resistance?</a></h2><p> To investigate the relationship between sarcoidosis and  (MetS) and insulin resistance (IR).  In our study, 47 patients with sarcoidosis who applied to our outpatient clinic and 45 healthy individuals without chronic disease were included. All patients were evaluated for MetS according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. The presence of three of the five factors defined by ATP III for MetS was accepted as a diagnosis of MetS. IR is calculated using the HOMA-IR index.  The mean age of the 47 patients with sarcoidosis was 50.7 ± 12.2 years and the mean age of the 45 control groups was 42.9 ± 14.4 years. Almost 80% of the patients were diagnosed as stage 2 sarcoidosis. Distribution of the patients according to the use of steroid is; almost half of the patients (47%) received steroid previously or recently. Patients with sarcoidosis have a 7.66 relative risk for MetS, whereas they also have a 5.48 relative risk of insulin resistance development.  This study shows that MetS is associated with increased sarcoidosis risk. MetS and IR diagnosis was higher in patients with sarcoidosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044660>In vitro and in vivo experiments of a novel intra-arterial neurovascular decompressor for treating neurovascular compression syndromes: a brief report.</a></h2><p>: Neurovascular compression syndromes (NVCS) could be cured with an intravascular device that releases compression of the root entry zone of cranial nerves by changing the course of offending vessels. The purpose of this study was to report our results of in vitro and in vivo experiments with a novel intra-arterial neurovascular decompressor (IA-NVD) for NVCS. : A nitinol-based IA-NVD was developed to release pressure applied to the root entry zone of cranial nerves by changing the course or angle of an offending vessel, which can possibly cure NVCS. We performed in vitro tests for safety and feasibility and preliminary in vivo tests up to 4 weeks for safety. : The bending stiffness of the device was similar to but slightly stronger than that of current, closed-cell intracranial stents. Hemocompatibility tests showed no significant thrombogenesis in whole blood.

However, persons-living-with-HIV (PLWH), when aging, present a high prevalence of  diseases. : Altered adiposity, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, diabetes, and their consequences are prevalent in PLWH and could be partly related to ART. : At first, personal and lifestyle factors are involved in the onset of these complications. The persistence of HIV in tissue reservoirs could synergize with some ART and enhance  disorders. Altered fat repartition, diagnosed as lipodystrophy, has been related to first-generation nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors (NRTIs) (stavudine zidovudine) and some protease inhibitors (PIs). Recently, use of some integrase-inhibitors (INSTI) resulted in weight/fat gain, which represents a worrisome unresolved situation. Lipid parameters were affected by some first-generation NRTIs, non-NRTIs (efavirenz) but also PIs boosted by ritonavir, with increased total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. Insulin resistance is common associated with abdominal obesity.

Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) constitutes a defined histological category among endometrial cancers. Laron  (LS) is a genetic type of dwarfism that results from mutation of the growth hormone receptor () gene, and is the best characterized entity under the spectrum of the congenital IGF1 deficiencies. Epidemiological studies have shown that LS patients are protected from cancer development. Recent genome-wide association studies conducted on LS-derived lymphoblastoid cells led to the identification of a series of  genes whose over-representation in this condition might be linked to cancer protection. Our analyses led to the identification of , a potential cell cycle regulator, as a new downstream target for IGF1 action. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the regulation of  gene expression by IGF1 and insulin in endometrial cancer cell lines and to assess the impact of tumor suppressor p53 on  expression and biological action. Using USC-derived cell lines expressing a wild type or a mutant p53 gene, we demonstrate that IGF1 inhibited  mRNA and protein levels in cells containing a wild type . On the other hand, IGF1 potently stimulated ZYG11A expression in mutant p53-expressing cells. Data presented here links the IGF1 and p53 signaling pathways with ZYG11A action.

The aim of the present study was to screen prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The RNA‑sequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100 HCC samples and 26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, the identification and functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DE‑RNAs) were analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosis‑associated lncRNAs and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the nodes in an lncRNA‑mRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051 consensus DE‑RNAs were identified. The stable modules were significantly associated with the histological grades of HCC, tumor, node and metastasis stage, pathological stage, recurrence and exposure to radiation therapy.

Here we established a Marc-145 cell line which could stably overexpress RACK1 to consolidate our findings. Based on the data from RT-qPCR, western blot, immunofluorescence staining, cytopathic effects and viral titer analysis, we concluded that overexpression of RACK1 could enhance the replication of PRRSV in Marc-145 cells and promote the NF-κ activation via upregulating TRAF2 expression and its phosphorylation. Marc-145 cells overexpressing RACK1exhibited severe cytopathic effects post infection with PRRSV and elevated the viral titer. Taken together, RACK1 plays an essential role for PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells and NF-κ activation. The results presented here shed more light on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PRRSV infection and its subsequent NF-κ activation. Therefore, we anticipate RACK1 as a promising target for PRRS control.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is very high globally. Recent studies have shown an association between vitamin D status with the prevalence and outcomes of several cancers that includes gastric cancer, which is a common cancer with a poor prognosis. The early diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer, in its advanced stages, is difficult and patients who are diagnosed at an advanced stage have a poor prognosis. In this review, we have summarized the recent studies investigating the association between vitamin D status and the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066762>Familial aggregation and heritability of markers of  risk, physical activity, and physical fitness in nuclear families from Muzambinho (Minas Gerais, Brazil).</a></h2><p>This study investigated the familial aggregation and heritability of markers of  risk, physical activity, and physical fitness in nuclear families from Muzambinho (Minas Gerais, Brazil).The study included members of 139 families, comprising 97 fathers (aged 40 ± 7 years), 129 mothers (35 ± 6 years), 136 sons (12 ± 4 years), and 121 daughters (12 ± 5 years). Evaluated markers included (A) body mass index, waist circumference, glycemia, and cholesterolemia, as  risk markers; () total weekly volume of physical activity, as a physical activity marker; and (C) relative muscle strength, as a physical fitness marker. Correlations between family members and heritability (h2) were estimated using the software S.A.G.E.Significant familial correlations were obtained between parents-offspring for glycemia and cholesterolemia (both ρ = 0.21, p < 0.05) and relative muscle strength (ρ = 0.23, p < 0.05), and between siblings for waist circumference, glycemia, total weekly volume of physical activity, and relative muscle strength (ρ variation 0.25 to 0.36, p < 0.05). Heritability values were significant for almost all variables (h2 variations: 20% to 57% for  risk markers, 22% for the total weekly volume of physical activity, and 50% for relative muscle strength), except for waist circumference (h2 = 15%, p = 0.059).The presence of significant correlations between family members and/or significant heritability strengthens the possible genetic and/or common familial environment influence on  risk markers, total weekly volume of physical activity, and relative muscle strength.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154934>Variants in genes of innate immunity, appetite control and energy metabolism are associated with host cardiometabolic health and gut microbiota composition.</a></h2><p>Identifying the genetic and non-genetic determinants of obesity and related cardiometabolic dysfunctions is cornerstone for their prevention, treatment, and control. While genetic variants contribute to the cardiometabolic  (CMS), non-genetic factors, such as the gut microbiota, also play key roles. Gut microbiota is intimately associated with CMS and its composition is heritable. However, associations between this microbial community and host genetics are understudied. We contribute filling this gap by genotyping 60 variants in 39 genes of three modules involved in CMS risk, measuring cardiometabolic risk factors, and characterizing gut microbiota in a cohort of 441 Colombians. We hypothesized that CMS risk variants were correlated with detrimental levels of clinical parameters and with the abundance of disease-associated microbes. We found several polymorphisms in genes of innate immunity, appetite control, and energy metabolism that were associated with  dysregulation and microbiota composition; the associations between host genetics and cardiometabolic health were independent of the participants' gut microbiota, and those between polymorphisms and gut microbes were independent of the CMS risk. Associations were also independent of the host genetic ancestry, diet and lifestyle. Most microbes explaining genetic-microbiota associations belonged to the families  and . Multiple CMS risk alleles were correlated with increased abundance of beneficial microbiota, suggesting that the phenotypic outcome of the evaluated variants might depend upon the genetic background of the studied population and its environmental context. Our results provide additional evidence that the gut microbiota is under the host genetic control and present pathways of host-microbe interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034781>Curcumin reduces renal damage associated with rhabdomyolysis by decreasing ferroptosis-mediated cell death.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury is a common complication of rhabdomyolysis. A better understanding of this  may be useful to identify novel therapeutic targets because there is no specific treatment so far. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death that is involved in renal injury. In this study, we investigated whether ferroptosis is associated with rhabdomyolysis-mediated renal damage, and we studied the therapeutic effect of curcumin, a powerful antioxidant with renoprotective properties. Induction of rhabdomyolysis in mice increased serum creatinine levels, endothelial damage, inflammatory chemokines, and cytokine expression, alteration of redox balance (increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant defenses), and tubular cell death. Treatment with curcumin initiated before or after rhabdomyolysis induction ameliorated all these pathologic and molecular alterations. Although apoptosis or receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3-mediated necroptosis were activated in rhabdomyolysis, our results suggest a key role of ferroptosis. Thus, treatment with ferrostatin 1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, improved renal function in glycerol-injected mice, whereas no beneficial effects were observed with the pan-caspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(-methyl)-fluoromethylketone or in RIPK3-deficient mice. In cultured renal tubular cells, myoglobin (Mb) induced ferroptosis-sensitive cell death that was also inhibited by curcumin. Mechanistic  studies showed that curcumin reduced Mb-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κ axis and activating the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase 1. Our findings are the first to demonstrate the involvement of ferroptosis in rhabdomyolysis-associated renal damage and its sensitivity to curcumin treatment.

Hepatic genes involved in lipid biosynthesis are controlled by combinatorial actions of multiple transcription factors that include three sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), carbohydrate responsive element binding protein, liver X receptors, and others. SREBP-1c, a seminal regulator of de novo lipogenesis, resides in the endoplasmic reticulum as a transcriptionally inert precursor and must undergo a regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) prior to its nuclear translocation as a bone fide transcription factor. The regulation of biosynthesis, turnover and actions of SREBP-1c and lipogenesis are mechanistically linked to signaling kinases, canonically induced by macronutrients and insulin.

AMPK not only elicits acute  responses but also promotes  reprogramming and adaptations in the long-term through regulation of specific transcription factors and coactivators. We performed a whole-genome transcriptome profiling in wild-type (WT) and AMPK-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary hepatocytes that had been treated with 2 distinct classes of small-molecule AMPK activators. We identified unique compound-dependent gene expression signatures and several AMPK-regulated genes, including folliculin (), which encodes the tumor suppressor FLCN. Bioinformatics analysis highlighted the lysosomal pathway and the associated transcription factor EB (TFEB) as a key transcriptional mediator responsible for AMPK responses. AMPK-induced  expression was abolished in MEFs lacking TFEB and transcription factor E3, 2 transcription factors with partially redundant function; additionally, the promoter activity of  was profoundly reduced when its putative TFEB-binding site was mutated. The AMPK-TFEB-FLCN axis is conserved across species; swimming exercise in WT zebrafish induced  expression in muscle, which was significantly reduced in AMPK-deficient zebrafish. Mechanistically, we have found that AMPK promotes dephosphorylation and nuclear localization of TFEB independently of mammalian target of rapamycin activity.

The present study was aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of serum chemerin in patients with chronic heart failure. Methods and Results We included 834 patients with chronic heart failure in a prospective cohort study and investigated the association between serum chemerin and clinical outcomes using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Patients with higher chemerin levels tended to be older and women and were more likely to experience hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipemia. Cox regression analysis showed that chemerin was a significant predictor of major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.31-2.96) after adjustment for conventional risk factors. Net reclassification and integrated discrimination improvements for major adverse cardiac events were markedly improved by addition of chemerin to the reference model. In addition, chemerin was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.21-2.73) after multivariable adjustment. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that chemerin was a prognostic indicator of major adverse cardiac events in patients with chronic heart failure and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro--type natriuretic peptide) levels above and below the median.

NURR1 expression in skeletal muscle is also sufficient to prevent hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis, by enhancing muscle glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. Furthermore, treatment of obese mice with putative NURR1 agonists increases energy expenditure, improves glucose tolerance, and confers a lean phenotype, mimicking the effects of exercise. These findings identify a key role for NURR1 in governance of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, and reveal a transcriptional link between exercise and metabolism. Our findings also identify NURR1 agonists as possible exercise mimetics with the potential to ameliorate obesity and other  abnormalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156048>Average acceleration and intensity gradient of primary school children and associations with indicators of health and well-being.</a></h2><p>Average acceleration (AvAcc) and intensity gradient (IG) have been proposed as standardised metrics describing physical activity (PA) volume and intensity, respectively.  examined hypothesised between-group PA differences in AvAcc and IG, and their associations with health and well-being indicators in children. ActiGraph GT9X wrist accelerometers were worn for 24-h·d over 7days by 145 children aged 9-10. Raw accelerations were averaged per 5-s epoch to represent AvAcc over 24-h. IG represented the relationship between log values for intensity and time. Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was estimated using youth cutpoints. BMI z-scores, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), peak oxygen uptake (VOpeak),  risk (MetS score), and well-being were assessed cross-sectionally, and 8-weeks later. Hypothesised between-group differences were consistently observed for IG only (p < .001). AvAcc was strongly correlated with MVPA ( = 0.96), while moderate correlations were observed between IG and MVPA ( = 0.50) and AvAcc ( = 0.54). IG was significantly associated with health indicators, independent of AvAcc ( < .001). AvAcc was associated with well-being, independent of IG ( < .05). IG was significantly associated with WHtR ( < .01) and MetS score ( < .05) at 8-weeks follow-up. IG is sensitive as a gauge of PA intensity that is independent of total PA volume, and which relates to important health indicators in children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222771>Effect of hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance on endocrine,  and fertility outcomes in women with polycystic ovary  undergoing ovulation induction.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance (IR) on reproductive and  disorders and fertility in women with polycystic ovary  (PCOS).This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving a total of 1000 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the modified Rotterdam criteria at 21 sites (27 hospitals). We evaluated the effects of serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR on parameters and outcomes. The main outcome measures were anthropometric, biometric and ultrasound parameters at baseline and the clinical outcomes of ovulation, conception, pregnancy, live birth and pregnancy loss.The relevant analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR and clinical characteristics showed that weight, waist and hip circumference, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, acanthosis nigricans score and menstrual period were significantly correlated with fasting insulin (FIN) and HOMA-IR. There was no significant correlation between the hirsutism score or acne score with FIN or HOMA-IR. The relevant analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR and circulating sex steroids and gonadotrophins showed that FAI was significantly correlated with FIN and HOMA-IR (r = 0.240, P < 0.001 and r = 0.191, P < 0.001, respectively). Free testosterone was significantly correlated with FIN after adjusting for the influence of age. LH and LH/FSH were not related to FIN or HOMA-IR after statistical correction for differences in BMI. The relevant analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR and  profile showed that FIN and HOMA-IR were positively associated with fasting glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, Apo , and the incidence of  and were negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein. The predictive analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR with fertility showed that the levels of FIN and HOMA-IR were related to the fertility outcome (ovulation, pregnancy, conception or live birth) in patients with PCOS. After adjustments for age, total testosterone and free testosterone, increasing serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR were significantly associated with decreased cycle ovulation, conception, pregnancy and live birth rates.Hyperinsulinaemia and IR are associated with reproductive and  disorders and can predict the fertility outcomes in PCOS patients.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287332>Characterization of responder groups to secukinumab treatment in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.</a></h2><p> Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a key cytokine involved in the development of psoriasis. Here, we characterized secukinumab treatment-responder profiles and identified baseline factors affecting response.  Pooled phase 3 data from moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients treated with secukinumab for 16 weeks (FIXTURE [], ERASURE [], and CLEAR []) were analyzed to characterize responder groups, identifying factors associated with treatment response, and to evaluate early response kinetics as a biomarker for treatment response. Etanercept and ustekinumab were evaluated as comparators.  Patients treated with secukinumab 300 mg ( = 867), ustekinumab 45/90 mg ( = 318), and etanercept 50 mg ( = 298) were evaluated. For secukinumab 300 mg, more patients were in higher responder groups than etanercept and ustekinumab. In higher response groups, fewer patients had previous systemic or biologic treatment, , hypertension, diabetes, and fewer were current smokers. Mean body weight, waist circumference, and BMI decreased as response level increased. Early onset of response (PASI50 at Week 4 or 8) correlated with sustained efficacy at Week 16.

On the other hand, the number of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) in the setting of  has been increasing worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arises in the setting of chronic hepatic inflammation and liver cirrhosis associated with NAFLD/NASH. However, the detailed clinical features of NAFLD/NASH and NAFLD/NASH-derived HCC prevalence have not yet been fully elucidated as there are two major problems in diagnosing definitive NAFLD/NASH: it is difficult to evaluate past alcoholic consumption history precisely and to obtain certain pathologic findings from all patients with fatty liver. Although previous studies clarified some of the genetic and pathophysiological aspects of NAFLD/NASH, basic knowledge of NAFLD/NASH mechanisms remains insufficient and the methods for predicting the risk of tumorigenesis and effective therapy for NAFLD/NASH are not well defined. The treatment of NAFLD/NASH comprises changes in lifestyle including eating habits and exercise leading to weight loss, and drug intake such as vitamin E. A number of new drugs for NAFLD/NASH patients have been under trial. Additional larger-scale studies are required to elucidate fully the clinical and basic landscape of NAFLD-HCC.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ is expressed in keratinocytes and is known to affect cell maturation and differentiation in addition to its role in inflammation.To study the association between PPAR-γ gene polymorphism and psoriasis vulgaris in Egyptian patients to explore if this polymorphism influenced disease risk or clinical presentation.Forty-five patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 45 age, sex and body mass index matched healthy volunteers who have no present, past or family history of psoriasis as a control group were enrolled. Selected cases included obese and nonobese participants. Detection of PPAR-γ gene polymorphism was done with restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Narrow-band ultraviolet  (NBUVB) was given for every case three times/week for 12 weeks.Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were significantly associated with cases ( = 0.01,  = 0.01, and  = 0.004, respectively) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis by 5.25, 3.65, and 3.37 folds, respectively. Heteropolymorphism was significantly associated with nonobese cases compared to obese ones ( = 0.01). Ala allele was significantly associated with obese cases ( = 0.001) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis in obese participants by 1.14 folds. Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were more prevalent among obese cases without  (MS) than obese cases with MS but without statistical significance. Percentage of decrease of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score before and after 3 months of treatment with NBUVB was higher in cases with heteropolymorphism with no significant difference between homo- and heteropolymorphism.PPAR-γ gene polymorphism is associated with and increased the risk of psoriasis and its associated obesity in Egyptian patients.

Other ENPP1-related phenotypes include pseudoxanthoma elasticum, hypophosphatemic rickets, and Cole disease. We studied four children from two Bedouin consanguineous families who presented with severe clinical phenotype including thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, hepatic, and neurologic manifestations. Initial working diagnosis included congenital infection; however, patients remained without a definitive diagnosis despite extensive workup. Consequently, we investigated a potential genetic etiology. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for affected children and their parents. Following the identification of a novel mutation in the ENPP1 gene, we characterized this novel multisystemic presentation and revised relevant imaging studies. Using WES, we identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.556G > C; p.Gly186Arg) in ENPP1 which affects a highly conserved protein domain (somatomedin B2). ENPP1-associated genetic diseases exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity depending on mutation type and location. Follow-up clinical characterization of these families allowed us to revise and detect new features of systemic calcifications, which established the diagnosis of GACI, expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with ENPP1 mutations. Our findings demonstrate that this novel ENPP1 founder mutation can cause a fatal multisystemic phenotype, mimicking severe congenital infection.

The mechanisms of MetS in orchestrating the bone remodelling process have traditionally focused on the interactions between mature osteoblasts and osteoclasts, while the role of osteocytes is unexplored. Our earlier studies demonstrated the bone-promoting effects of tocotrienol using a rat model of osteoporosis induced by MetS. This study aimed to investigate the expression of osteocyte-derived peptides in the bone of rats with MetS-induced osteoporosis treated with tocotrienol. Age-matched male Wistar rats (12-week-old;  = 42) were divided into seven experimental groups. Two groups served as the baseline and normal group, respectively. The other five groups were fed with a high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diet to induce MetS. The five groups of HCHF animals were treated with tocopherol-stripped corn oil (vehicle), annatto tocotrienol (60 and 100 mg/kg), and palm tocotrienol (60 and 100 mg/kg) starting from week 8. At the end of the study, the rats were sacrificed and their right tibias were harvested. Protein was extracted from the metaphyseal region of the proximal right tibia and levels of bone peptides, including osteoprotegerin (OPG), soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa  ligand (sRANKL), sclerostin (SOST), Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and parathyroid hormone (PTH), were measured. The vehicle-treated animals displayed higher levels of sRANKL, SOST, DKK-1, FGF-23, and PTH as compared to the normal animals. Oral supplementation of annatto and palm tocotrienol (60 and 100 mg/kg) reduced the levels of sRANKL and FGF-23 in the HCHF animals. Only 100 mg/kg annatto and palm tocotrienol lowered SOST and DKK-1 levels in the HCHF animals. In conclusion, tocotrienol exerts potential skeletal-promoting benefit by modulating the levels of osteocytes-derived bone-related peptides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030641>Circulating levels of the anti-oxidant indoleproprionic acid are associated with higher gut microbiome diversity.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome has recently emerged as an important regulator of insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. The tryptophan metabolite generated by the gut microbiome, indoleproprionic acid (IPA) has been shown to predict the onset of type 2 diabetes. IPA is a metabolite produced by gut microbes from dietary tryptophan that exhibits a high degree of inter-individual variation. The microbiome composition parameters that are associated with circulating levels of this potent anti-oxidant have however not been investigated to date in human populations. In 1018 middle-aged women from the TwinsUK cohort, we assessed the relationship between serum IPA levels and gut microbiome composition targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Microbiome alpha-diversity was positively correlated with serum indoleproprionic acid levels (Shannon Diversity: Beta[95%CI] = 0.19[0.13;0.25], P = 6.41 × 10) after adjustment for covariates. Sixteen taxa and 12 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with IPA serum levels. Among these are positive correlations with the butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the class Mollicutes and the order RF39 of the Tenericutes, and Coprococcus Negative correlations instead were observed with Eubacterium dolichum previously shown to correlate with visceral fat mass and several genera in the Lachnospiraceae family such as Blautia and Ruminococcus previously shown to correlate with obesity. Microbiome composition parameters explained ~20% of the variation in circulating levels of IPA, whereas nutritional and host genetic parameters explained only ~4%.

Increased tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α production induced by HBV and HCV leads to a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deficiency and hypoalbuminemia. Albumin mobilizes PUFAs from the liver and other tissues and thus may aid in enhancing the formation of anti-inflammatory lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory PGE2. As PUFAs exert anti-viral and anti-bacterial effects, the presence of adequate levels of PUFAs could inactivate HCV and HBV and prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis observed in cirrhosis. PUFAs, PGE1, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins suppress TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert cytoprotective effects, and modulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation to promote recovery following hepatitis, NAFLD and AFLD. Based on this evidence, it is proposed that the administration of albumin in conjunction with PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory products could be beneficial for the prevention of and recovery from NAFLD, hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. NAFLD is common in obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and , suggesting that even these diseases could be due to alterations in the metabolism of PUFAs and other bioactive lipids. Hence, PUFAs and co-factors needed for their metabolism and albumin may be of benefit in the prevention and management of HBV, HCV, alcoholic hepatitis and NAFLD, and liver cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663122>Role of regulatory miRNAs of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignant human tumors with high morbidity worldwide.

As such, many developmental disorders are caused by mutations in genes involved in the GPI biosynthesis and remodeling pathway. We describe ten unrelated families with bi-allelic mutations in PIGB, a gene that encodes phosphatidylinositol glycan class , which transfers the third mannose to the GPI. Ten different PIGB variants were found in these individuals. Flow cytometric analysis of blood cells and fibroblasts from the affected individuals showed decreased cell surface presence of GPI-anchored proteins. Most of the affected individuals have global developmental and/or intellectual delay, all had seizures, two had polymicrogyria, and four had a peripheral neuropathy. Eight children passed away before four years old. Two of them had a clinical diagnosis of DOORS  (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures), a condition that includes sensorineural deafness, shortened terminal phalanges with small finger and toenails, intellectual disability, and seizures; this condition overlaps with the severe phenotypes associated with inherited GPI deficiency. Most individuals tested showed elevated alkaline phosphatase, which is a characteristic of the inherited GPI deficiency but not DOORS . It is notable that two severely affected individuals showed 2-oxoglutaric aciduria, which can be seen in DOORS , suggesting that severe cases of inherited GPI deficiency and DOORS  might share some molecular pathway disruptions.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Although several treatment options for obesity abound, many of them have not been able to successfully reverse the existing obesity and  dysregulation. This has therefore warranted the need for either alternative therapies or diversification of the treatment approach for obesity and its comorbidity. When the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) interacts with its ligand, RAGE-ligand activates an inflammatory signaling cascade, that leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. This action has been associated with the development of obesity and its mediated  dysregulation. In view of the increasing prevalence of obesity globally and the potential threat it places on life expectancy, this article reviewed the promising potentials of targeting endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end products/soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products signaling as a treatment approach for obesity. We carried out a literature search in several electronic data bases such as: Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Medline from 1980 to 2019 to acquire the status of information concerning this.

This study was undertaken to investigate the beneficial effect of selenium in management of letrozole induced PCOS and its role in modulating mitochondrial dynamics, and its associated signals. Twenty four adult female rats were enrolled and randomly divided into four equal groups; control group received 0.5% w/v carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC); PCOS group received letrozole (1 mg/kg, daily) in 0.5% CMC for 21 days. From day 22 to day 36, after letrozole PCOS induction, the (PCOS +Metformin) group received metformin (2 mg/kg, daily) while (PCOS + sodium selenite) group received sodium selenite (0.1 mg/kg, daily). All doses were given via oral gavage. At the study end, serum hormone levels, lipid profile and HOMA-IR were assessed. Ovaries were dissected, used for histopathological evaluation, immunohistochemical detection of -cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and its associated X protein (Bax) expression, measurement of redox status, mitochondrial dynamics markers and citrate synthase (CS) activity. Furthermore Mitofusins 2 (Mfn2) and dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) mRNA expression was assessed by real time PCR. Selenium treatment of PCOS rats succeeded, comparable to metformin, to greatly improve the PCOS associated endocrine and  phenotypes and histopathological changes, mostly through modulating mitochondrial dynamics, anti-apoptotic action, alleviating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.

BS is an inherited renal tubulopathy caused by defective salt reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle, which results in persistent hypokalemic hypochloremic  alkalosis. Here we report a 10-year-old girl of a consanguineous family. She presented prenatally with severe polyhydramnios and distended bowel loops. Thereafter, she displayed failure to thrive and had recurrent admissions due to dehydration episodes associated with diarrhea, and characterized by hypokalemia, hypochloremia and  alkalosis. BS was considered her working diagnosis for several years despite negative genetic analysis of the known genes associated with BS. Whole exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous c.1652delT deleterious frameshift mutation in the SLC26A3 gene, which confirmed the diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD), a rare autosomal recessive disease that mimics biochemically BS. A review of twelve additional reported cases of CCD that were initially misdiagnosed as BS, emphasizes CCD in the differential diagnosis of BS, and highlights the clinical discrepancies between these two entities. Taken together, our report further emphasizes the typical clinical features of CCD, and the importance of next generation sequencing in the diagnosis of syndromes with genetic heterogeneity.

However, there has been few report about proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from human follicular fluid and their association with the occurrence of PCOS. Herein, we used TMT-tagged quantitative proteomic approach to identify proteomic profiles in exosomes derived from follicular fluid of PCOS patients and healthy controls. We identified 662 proteins in exosomes derived from human ovarian follicular fluid. Eighty-six differently expressed proteins (P < .05) were found between PCOS and healthy women. The alterations in the proteomic profile were related to the inflammation process, reactive oxygen species  process, cell migration and proliferation. Importantly, we observed that follicular fluid exosomes contain S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100-A9) protein. Exosome-enriched S100-A9 significantly enhanced inflammation and disrupted steroidogenesis via activation of nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signalling pathway. These data demonstrate that exosomal proteins are differentially expressed in follicular fluid during disease process, and some proteins may play important roles in the regulation of granulosa cell function.

This review aims to assess the associations between vitamin D levels and /endocrine dysregulations and to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and hormones functionality in PCOS patients. We searched in PubMed human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English between 2016 and 2019 on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on PCOS. Nine studies were included and analyzed. Vitamin D supplementation restored physiological serum 25(OH)D levels in PCOS women in all the studies included. In six studies, it significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose and brought to improvements in insulin resistance (IR) and serum fasting insulin. In addition, four studies reported decreases of serum triglycerides, while discordant data are reported as far as LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels. High-doses of vitamin D (4000 IU), compared with low-dose (1000 IU), and placebo, showed beneficial effects on total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI). Vitamin D supplementation at high doses for a period of at least 12 weeks, may lead to improvement in terms of glucose level, insulin sensitivity, hyperlipidemia, and hormonal functionality in PCOS women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223344>Insulin resistance exhibits varied  abnormalities in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis  and the combination of the two: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) related  disorders are associated with a worse prognosis of chronic hepatitis  virus (CHB) infection or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the relationships among CHB, steatosis, IR and  factors remain controversial. The study aims to evaluate the impact of insulin resistance severity on  profiles in patients with CHB, NAFLD and the coincidence of the two.We conducted a cross-sectional study between January 2011 and December 2018 that included 2768 consecutive Chinese subjects (healthy controls: 667, CHB: 970, NAFLD: 878, CHB with NAFLD: 253). IR was determined with the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).  measures included fasting serum insulin, glucose, lipid profiles and uric acid.The prevalence of IR was increased in CHB with NAFLD subjects compared with that in control subjects or subjects with CHB or NAFLD alone (41.5% vs 2.9%/11.9%/36.9%, respectively; < 0.001). Within NAFLD and CHB with NAFLD group, the frequency of , hypertension and hyperuricemia increased as the HOMA-IR category increased ( for trend < 0.05). A higher risk for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated alanine transaminase was observed with IR in the CHB with NAFLD group compared with that in the other groups, while no stepwise increase in hypertriglyceridemia was found in HOMA-IR in the CHB with NAFLD group.Insulin resistance is highly prevalent in patients with CHB combined with NAFLD, and the increased  risk, rather than hypertriglyceridemia, is driven by IR in CHB combined with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089467>Effects of Bread with  on Blood Glucose, Blood Pressure and Anthropometric Indices in Patients with .</a></h2><p> () is one of important herbal foods in traditional medicine and many studies have conducted to show the effects of this plant on several diseases. The goal of this study was the evaluation of effects of bread with  on clinical parameters such as blood glucose, blood pressure (BP) and anthropometry indices in subjects with  (MetS). A study as double-blind, cross-over, randomized clinical trial was performed in 51 MetS patients in Chalus, north region of Iran. After dividing of patients randomly in 2 groups, in phase 1, intervention group (A, n = 27) used daily a bread with  and control group (, n = 24) used the same bread but without  for 2 months. After considering of 15 day wash out period, phase 2 was began with changing of position of 2 groups. Measuring of parameters including fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) was done before and after of 2 phases. After evaluation of treatment, sequence and time effects of intervention on parameters, it is shown that consumption of this bread has not significant treatment effect (as main effect) on FBG, SBP, DBP, WC, weight, and BMI (p > 0.05). Sequence effect on FBG, weight, WC, and BMI was significant (p < 0.05), but was not on BP. Time effect was only significant for DBP. Consumption of bread with  in MetS patients has not significant effect on FBG, BP, weight, WC, and BMI.Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials Identifier: IRCT2015041821815N1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371402>The distinct phenotypic signatures of dispersal and stress in an arthropod model: from physiology to life history.</a></h2><p>Dispersing individuals are expected to encounter costs during transfer and in the novel environment, and may also have experienced stress in their natal patch. Given this, a non-random subset of the population should engage in dispersal and show divergent stress-related responses. This includes physiological shifts as expressed in the metabolome, which form a major part of responses to stress. We analyzed how  profiles and life-history traits varied between dispersers and residents of the model two-spotted spider mite , and whether and how these syndromes varied with exposure to a stressful new host plant (tomato). Regardless of the effect of host plant, we found a physiological dispersal  where, relative to residents, dispersers were characterized by lower leaf consumption and a lower concentration of several amino acids, indicating a potential dispersal-foraging trade-off. As a possible consequence of this lower food intake, dispersers also laid smaller eggs. Responses to tomato were consistent with this plant being a stressor for   , including reduced fecundity and reduced feeding. Tomato-exposed mites laid larger eggs, which we interpret as a plastic response to food stress, increasing survival to maturity. Contrary to what was expected from the costs of dispersal and from previous meta-population level studies, there was no interaction between dispersal status and host plant for any of the examined traits, meaning stress impacts were equally incurred by residents and dispersers. We thus provide novel insights into the processes shaping dispersal and the feedbacks on ecological dynamics in spatially structured populations.© 2019.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty acid (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) , the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type metabolism of FA. The IR  can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and ) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species.

These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all  pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) , 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance , 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major  disorders in diabetes mellitus.

Camk2n1 resides in genomic loci for blood pressure, left ventricle mass, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and in the spontaneously hypertensive rat model of , Camk2n1 expression is cis-regulated in left ventricle and fat and positively correlates with adiposity. Therefore, we knocked out Camk2n1 in spontaneously hypertensive rat to investigate its role in . Compared with spontaneously hypertensive rat, Camk2n1 rats had reduced cardiorenal CaMKII (Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) activity, lower blood pressure, enhanced nitric oxide bioavailability, and reduced left ventricle mass associated with altered hypertrophic networks. Camk2n1 deficiency reduced insulin resistance, visceral fat, and adipogenic capacity through the altered cell cycle and complement pathways, independent of CaMKII. In human visceral fat, CAMK2N1 expression correlated with adiposity and genomic variants that increase CAMK2N1 expression associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Importance of neurophysiological assessment in cases of  with or without hyperglycemia].</a></h2><p>Peripheral and autonomic neuropathies are one of the major complications in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Nerve lesion starts in an early stage. In patients with DM II the above-mentioned lesion starts even before glycemic dysregulation and during the  stage. In the beginning, the neuropathy may be asymptomatic; therefore, neurophysiologic examination should be conducted for its early detection so that therapeutic measures can be taken on time. Nine patients with early neuropathy were here assessed: three of them with  and fasting hyperglycemia, one with  without hyperglycemia and five with glycemic dysregulation without . All were asymptomatic and neurologic examination was unremarkable. Techniques for the detection of early neuropathy were carried out (sural/radial ratio, F-waves, H-reflex, sympathetic skin responses, cutaneous silent period and heart rate variability reflexes). Eight patients had an early cardiac autonomic neuropathy, one had a definite autonomic neuropathy. Eight patients had an early somatic neuropathy (seven with a sural/radial ratio < 0.5 and one with abnormal F-waves), and one had an asymptomatic small-fiber neuropathy (abnormal sympathetic skin responses and cutaneous silent period). Detection of early neuropathy through neurophysiology is mandatory before clinical signs and symptoms appear, during this stage, effective therapeutic measures can be warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449267>Adiposity Measures in  among Hausas in Kano, Northern Nigeria.</a></h2><p>Ethnic variations exist in the relationship of adiposity indices with  (MetS).  There are however, limited studies on the usefulness of body adiposity index (BAI) and visceral adiposity index (VAI) among Hausas of Kano, Northern Nigeria.  The aim of the study was to determine the relationship of measures of adiposity to the components of MetS in Hausas of Kano. The study included 465 (266 males and 199 females) subjects, with mean age of 34.4 years and 32.0 years for males and females respectively. Anthropometric measures were obtained using standard protocols. Visceral adiposity was estimated using sex specific VAI.  Fasting blood sample was obtained for serum analyses of lipid profiles, glucose, protein and uric acid. Pearson's correlation was used to test the association between adiposity measures with MetS indices while Student's t test was used for group comparison. The results of the study showed that the adiposity indices significantly correlate with  indices. Visceral adiposity index was superior to other adiposity measures and Waist to hip ratio was the strongest anthropometric correlate of MetS components. In conclusion, WHR is the strongest anthropometric correlate of MetS components. Body adiposity index, NC and HC are weaker adiposity tools. Visceral adiposity index is superior to all other adiposity tools.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251897>Rare P376L variant in the SR-BI gene associates with HDL dysfunction and risk of cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Scavenger receptor class  type 1 (SR-BI) encoded by SCARB1 gene serves as a multifunctional HDL receptor, facilitating the uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the liver. Recent studies have identified the association between the P376L missense mutation of the SCARB1 gene with increased serum HDL-Cholesterol level. However, the contribution of this variant to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear.We have investigated the association between the P376L polymorphism with the properties of HDL and CVD outcomes in a population sample recruited as part of the Mashhad-Stroke and Heart-Atherosclerotic-Disorders (MASHAD) cohort.Six hundred and fifteen individuals who had a median follow-up period of 7 years were recruited as part of the MASHAD cohort. Anthropometric, biochemical parameters and HDL lipid peroxidation (HDLox) were assessed. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan-real-time-PCR based method. The association of P376L-rs74830766 with cardiovascular-risk-factors and CVD events were evaluated.Carriers of the P376L variant were significantly more likely than non-carriers to develop CVD using multivariate analyses adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors defined as: age, sex, BMI, presence of diabetes, or hypertension, positive smoking habit, and total cholesterol (OR: 3.75, 95%CI: 1.76-7.98, p = 0.001). In an adjusted model, there was a two fold increase in cardiovascular endpoints among individuals who were heterozygous for the P376L variant (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.12-to 3.84, p = 0.02). Although there was no association between the presence of the P376L variant and HDL-C level, serum HDLox, measured as dysfunctional HDL, was 13% higher among carriers of the P376L variant than non-carriers.We have found that carriers of the P376L variant possessed higher HDLox and were at increased risk of CVD in a representative population-based cohort, as compared to non-carriers.Copyright © 2019.

A cross-sectional study was performed on 30,108 participants (aged 35-69 years) in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Dietary intake was assessed using a 46-item food frequency questionnaire. MetS was diagnosed according to the Joint Interim Statement Criteria of 2009, using body mass index instead of waist circumference. Factor analysis was applied to energy-adjusted intake of 21 nutrients, and three nutrient patterns were extracted: Factor 1 (fiber, potassium and vitamins pattern); Factor 2 (fats and fat-soluble vitamins pattern); and Factor 3 (saturated fatty acids, calcium and vitamin  pattern). In multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and other potential confounders, Factor 1 scores were associated with a significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) of MetS and all five components. Factor 2 scores were associated with significantly increased prevalence of MetS, obesity, and high blood pressure. Factor 3 scores were significantly associated with lower OR of MetS, high blood pressure, high serum triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol levels. Analysis of nutrient patterns may be useful to assess the overall quality of diet and its association with MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437815>A switch from high-fat to normal diet does not restore sperm quality but prevents .</a></h2><p>In recent decades, the prevalence of  diseases has concomitantly increased with a decline on fertility rates and sperm quality. High-fat diets (HFD) are seldom considered part of the problem, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects on male fertility remain poorly understood. Herein we postulated that HFD alter sperm quality. We evaluated the effects of switching from a HFD to a normal diet in early adulthood on  disease onset, testicular metabolism and sperm quality. Thirty-six male C57BL6/J mice were divided in a control group fed with standard chow; a group fed with HFD for 200 days; and a group fed with HFD for 60 days and then with standard chow (HFDt). Biometric data and whole-body metabolism were assessed. Epididymal sperm was studied for concentration, motility, viability and morphology. 1H-NMR metabolomics approach was performed on testicular extracts to trace the  changes. Diet switch reduced body weight and fat mass, preventing  onset. However, sperm viability, motility and morphology were deteriorated by HFD consumption and not restored by diet switch. HFD induced irreversible changes in pyruvate and glutamate metabolism, ethanol degradation and ammonia recycling in testis. Furthermore, HFDt changed purine and cysteine metabolism, urea cycle, and glutathione content. Overall, HFD caused irreversible changes in testicular metabolism even after switching to normal diet. HFD feeding until early adulthood decreases sperm quality, which cannot be restored by diet switch or weight loss, even when development of  is avoided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203727>Sympathetic Neural Overdrive in the Obese and Overweight State.</a></h2><p>Nerve traffic recordings (muscle sympathetic nerve traffic [MSNA]) have shown that sympathetic activation may occur in obesity. However, the small sample size of the available studies, presence of comorbidities, heterogeneity of the subjects examined represented major weaknesses not allowing to draw definite conclusions. This is the case for the overweight state. The present meta-analysis evaluated 1438 obese or overweight subjects recruited in 45 microneurographic studies. The analysis was primarily based on MSNA quantification in obesity and overweight, excluding as concomitant conditions hypertension, , and other comorbidities. Assessment was extended to the relationships of MSNA with other neuroadrenergic markers, such as plasma norepinephrine and heart rate, anthropometric variables, as body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, presence/absence of obstructive sleep apnea, and  profile. Compared with normoweights MSNA was significantly greater in overweight and more in obese individuals (37.0±4.1 versus 43.2±3.5 and 50.4±5.0 burts/100 heartbeats, P<0.01). This was the case even in the absence of obstructive sleep apnea. MSNA was significantly directly related to body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio ( r=0.41 and r=0.64, P<0.04 and <0.01, respectively), clinic blood pressure ( r=0.68, P<0.01), total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, and triglycerides ( r=0.91, r=0.94, and r=0.80, respectively, P<0.01) but unrelated to plasma insulin, glucose, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. No significant correlation was found between MSNA, heart rate, and norepinephrine. Thus, obesity and overweight are characterized by sympathetic overactivity which mirrors the severity of the clinical condition and reflects  alterations, with the exclusion of glucose/insulin profile. Neither heart rate nor norepinephrine appear to represent faithful markers of the muscle sympathetic overdrive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244336>Body mass index to predict fat mass and  severity: should it really be specific to sex, age and ethnicity?

In total, 41,403 individuals aged 20-80 years (NHANES, 1999-2014) were studied. Specific "α" were identified using the Benn formula. Various statistical approaches were performed to assess performances of the current vs the proposed-BMIs.  The proposed "α" varies from 1.2 to 2.5, after considering sex, age and ethnicity. BMIs calculated using the proposed "α" showed a similar capacity to predict TFM and MetS severity and to correctly identify obese individuals and those having MetS compared to the current BMI.  Despite sex, age and ethnicity modulating the height scaling exponent of the BMI equation, using these proposed exponents in the BMI equation didn't improve the capacity to predict TFM and MetS severity, suggesting that the current BMI remains a valid clinical tool.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464524> aqueous extract improves insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis in rodent model of fructose-induced .</a></h2><p> Fructose consumption is associated with the development of obesity and  (MetS) in human and animal models.

Autophagy plays an important role in dysfunction of endocrine and anovulation. However, the relationship between hyperandrogenism and autophagy in human granulosa cells of PCOS patients remains unclear. By collecting granulosa cells from PCOS patients and non-PCOS patients, we found that the abundance of autophagy-related genes ATG5, ATG7, BECN1 mRNA and the ratio of autophagy marker protein light chain 3B II/I (LC3 II/I) were significantly increased whereas the abundance of the autophagy substrate SQSTM1/p62 was decreased in ovarian granulosa cells from PCOS patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BECN1 mRNA abundance in human granulosa cells positively correlated with the basal level of serum total testosterone and androgen up-regulated the abundance of BECN1 mRNA and the ratio of LC3II/LC3I in a dose-dependent manner in cultured granulosa cells. These observations indicated that androgen-induced activation of autophagy may play an important role in the development of PCOS and to explore the autophagy mechanisms involved in PCOS yield new insight into the pathophysiology and therapy of the disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363171>IL-29 promoted obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk plays a critical role to regulate adipose tissue microenvironment and cause chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity. Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in  disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel  (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/M2 macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and insulin resistance in patients with  disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31448346>Can metformin stabilize PCSK9 level in stable coronary artery disease patients treated with statins?</a></h2><p>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as an important marker of cardiovascular risk and a new target for therapeutic interventions.

Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) of MetS (MetS-VLDLs) are cytotoxic to atrial myocytes in vivo and in vitro. The calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway, which is regulated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1)/ calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (Orai1)-mediated store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), is a pivotal mediator of adaptive cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that MetS-VLDLs could affect SOCE and the calcineurin-NFAT pathway. Normal-VLDL and MetS-VLDL samples were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and individuals with MetS. VLDLs were applied to HL-1 atrial myocytes for 18 h and were also injected into wild-type C57BL/6 male mouse tails three times per week for six weeks. After the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca store was depleted, SOCE was triggered upon reperfusion with 1.8 mM of Ca. SOCE was attenuated by MetS-VLDLs, along with reduced transcriptional and membranous expression of STIM1 ( = 0.025), and enhanced modification of -GlcNAcylation on STIM1 protein, while Orai1 was unaltered. The nuclear translocation and activity of calcineurin were both reduced ( < 0.05), along with the alteration of myofilament proteins in atrial tissues. These changes were absent in normal-VLDL-treated cells. Our results demonstrated that MetS-VLDLs suppressed SOCE by modulating STIM1 at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels, resulting in the inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, which resulted in the alteration of myofilament protein expression and sarcomere derangement in atrial tissues. These findings may help explain atrial myopathy in MetS. We suggest a therapeutic target on VLDLs to prevent atrial fibrillation, especially for individuals with MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456430>Epidemiology of Trigger Finger:  as a New Perspective of Associated Disease.</a></h2><p> The aim of this study was to identify the main diseases related to trigger finger.

The diet of people with MS is characterized by excessive caloric content and at the same time contains an inadequate amount of most vitamins. The most frequent in patients with MS is the deficiency (blood level) of vitamin D, E,  vitamins, carotenoids. Among patients with MS, individuals with a reduced concentration of vitamins in the blood plasma are often found. In turn, among those with a deficiency of vitamins, MS is more often found. Low concentrations of 25(OH)D in the serum are associated with an increased risk of MS. An inverse association between the concentration of the hormonal form of vitamin 1.25(OH)2D3 in the serum and the development of MC has been found. In patients with MS, the α-tocopherol concentration associated with lipids is lower than in healthy individuals, and γ-tocopherol, on the contrary, is higher. Taking high doses of one of the vitamin E homologues shifts the balance between tocopherols in the blood plasma. Sufficient supply of the body with all vitamins involved in the formation of metabolically active forms of vitamins (D, B6, PP) is a necessary condition for the exercise of these biological functions by these vitamins. The lack of vitamins is a risk factor for MS and its components. Enrichment of the diet of patients with MS should be considered as a necessary favorable background for its treatment. Since the body has functional connections between vitamins, it is advisable to use not individual vitamins, but their complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325281>Association of Serum Homocysteine, Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid Levels with .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671427>Inhibition of hypothalamic inhibitor κ  kinase β/nuclear transcription factor κ  pathway attenuates metabolism and cardiac dysfunction in type 2 diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Inflammation and oxidative stressplay important roles in energy imbalance and its complications.Recent research indicates that hypothalamic inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of  and cardiac dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that suppression of proinflammatory pathway of IKKβ/NF-κBin the hypothalamuscan improve energy balance and cardiac function in type 2 diabetic (T2D)rats.Normal rats and T2D rats received bilateral hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) infusions of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 or vehicle via osmotic minipump. phenotyping, immunohistochemical analyses, and biochemical analyses were used to investigate the outcomes of inhibition of the hypothalamic IKKβ. Echocardiography and glucometer were used for measuring cardiac function and blood glucose,respectively.

A complex , endocrinal and reproductive disorder, PCOS is one of the most common endocrinopathies in women of reproductive age today. Due to an unclear etiology, there is no single clinical definition for PCOS, contributing to a sense of confusion around the . India has one of the highest rates of PCOS in the world. Medical and social discourses on PCOS suggest the high rates are due to the failures of Westernized lifestyle and diet in women from developing countries. Taking the example of India, I argue that the lack of a clear etiology creates a discursive vacuum and that PCOS in itself is not a gendered and racialized , but the discourse on it is. Through the figure of the "new Indian woman," I address the socio-political anxieties of nationalism projected onto the female body and suggest that the discourse on PCOS in India is in reaction to a rising nationalist rhetoric. As a  that presents through "masculine" symptoms, PCOS acts a unique entryway into the intersectional issues of gender, race, sexuality, class and national identities.

The main causes of graft loss are chronic allograft dysfunction and death with functioning graft due to cardiovascular diseases.  (MetS) is common in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is common in RTRs. Studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may lead to the development of MetS apart from impairment in calcium and bone metabolism. We aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and MetS in patients with renal transplantation. One hundred forty-one RTRs were included in the study. MetS prevalence was 63.8%. Mean vitamin D level was 17.2 ± 10. 2 ng/mL. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to vitamin D level. Patients with vitamin D levels below 25 ng/mL were in group 1; those above were group 2. There were no differences regarding the presence of ; presence of diabetes mellitus; hypertension; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; waist circumference; glucose; creatinine; triglyceride; or HDL level between groups (P > .05). The area under curves (confidence interval [CI] 95%) of vitamin D level to predict MetS were 0.58 (0.48-0.68) (P > .05). We did not find any relationship between vitamin D level and MetS. This result may be related to the small sample size of our study. Investigation of this relationship with large study groups are needed to clearly determine this relationship.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were also measured, as well as their levels after oral-glucose administration. All participants underwent an assessment with: Trail Making Test A and , Stroop Test, Verbal and Categorical Fluency Test. The intensity of depressive symptoms was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We observed a positive correlation of the depression scores with the OGTT 120' and triglycerides, and a negative correlation of the depression scores with serum HDL. The higher were the insulin levels at 120 min; the more pronounced were the deficits of the verbal psychomotor speed. Higher free testosterone correlated with better verbal psychomotor speed. Androstenedione level was associated with worse scores in executive functions assessment. 17-OH-P levels positively correlated with phonology verbal fluency scores and higher plasma cortisol level at 10 p.m. correlated with worse verbal processing speed.

Molecular genetic techniques such as next generation sequencing have been very successful methods for rare variants finding with a moderate-to large effect. In this study, we characterized a large pedigree from MASHAD study in northeast Iran with coinheritance of FCHL and early-onset coronary heart disease. In this family, we used whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing to determine the disease-associated gene. We identified a novel variant in the LPL gene, leading to a substitution of an asparagine for aspartic acid at position 151.

Anthropometric parameters and blood pressure were determined and percentiles calculated for age and gender. Irisin, leptin, adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, triglycerides, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels, and physical activity were determined. Statistical tests for differences between groups, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were performed.Irisin plasma levels were significantly lower in the obese (6.08 [4.68-6.65]) and MS groups (6.46 [5.74-7.02]) compared with the normal-weight group (8.05 [7.24-8.94]) (p < 0.001). Irisin levels were not influenced by age or gender, but significant dispersion was observed in obese girls (95% CI median [2.29-6.30]). Leptin, resistin, and adipsin levels were significantly increased in the obese and MS groups. Lean-fat ratio was significantly higher in the NW group. Irisin correlated negatively with leptin (- 0.310), resistin (- 0.389), adipsin (- 0.362), BMI% (-0.472), WC% (- 0.453), BMI z-score (- 0.496), fat free mass (- 0.257), fat percentage (- 0.532), fat mass (- 0.515), triglycerides (- 0.291), the number of cardiometabolic risk factors (- 0.443) (p < 0.001); positively with lean-fat ratio (0.489) and HDL-c (0.328) (p < 0.001) and none with physical activity (< 0.001).

The small GTPase Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain 1) regulates endocytic trafficking that is critical for foam cell formation. However, it is unclear whether and how macrophage Rheb regulates atherogenesis, which are the focuses of the current study. Approach and Results: Immunofluorescence study confirmed the colocalization of Rheb in F4/80 and Mac-2 (galectin-3)-labeled lesional macrophages. Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that Rheb expression was significantly increased in atherosclerotic lesions of atherosclerosis-prone (apoE [apolipoprotein E deficient]) mice fed with Western diet. Increased Rheb expression was also observed in oxidized LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-treated macrophages. To investigate the in vivo role of macrophage Rheb, we established mature Rheb (macrophage-specific Rheb knockout) mice by crossing the Rheb floxed mice with F4/80-cre mice. Macrophage-specific knockout of Rheb in mice reduced Western diet-induced atherosclerotic lesion by 32%, accompanied with a decrease in macrophage content in plaque. Mechanistically, loss of Rheb in macrophages repressed oxidized LDL-induced lipid uptake, inflammation, and macrophage proliferation. On the contrary, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Rheb in macrophages increased oxidized LDL-induced lipid uptake and inflammation, and the stimulatory effect of Rheb was suppressed by the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor rapamycin or the PKA (protein kinase A) activator forskolin.Macrophage Rheb plays important role in Western diet-induced atherosclerosis by promoting macrophage proliferation, inflammation, and lipid uptake.

However, the three exercise groups improved similarly their V˙O2peak (4HIIT, 11%; 95% CI, 0.14-0.33; MICT, 12%; 95% CI, 0.18-0.36; and 1HIIT, 14%; 95% CI, 0.21-0.40 L·min; all P < 0.001).Our findings suggest that in sedentary individuals with MetS and low initial CRF level any aerobic training program of 16 wk with a frequency of three times per week is sufficient stimulus to raise CRF. However, the more intense but shorter 1HIIT training program is not effective on improving MetS Z score, and thus we caution its recommendation for health promotion purposes in this population.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547311>Anti- Effects of Fucoidan from  via Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Regulation of JNK, Akt, and AMPK Signaling.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have reported that dietary fiber improved  (MetS). However, the effects of fucoidans on MetS were still not clear. In this study, we evaluated the activity of fucoidan from  (FvF) on attenuating MetS and first elucidated the underlying mechanism. In vitro, FvF treatment remarkably lowered the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with the sodium palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance (IR) group. The phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was significantly decreased, while phosphorylation of protein kinase  (pAkt) level increased, compared with that of the HepG2 cells treated with PA. Thus, FvF increased glucose consumption and relieved IR via ROS-mediated JNK and Akt signaling pathways. In addition, these changes were accompanied by the activation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-ativated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream targets (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1C)), which improved lipid metabolism in IR HepG2 cells. In vivo, FvF improved hyperglycemia and decreased serum insulin level in mice with MetS. Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibition of glucose transport by in vitro (Caco-2 monolayer model), semi-in vivo (everted gut sac model) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which indicated that FvF could significantly reduce the absorption of glucose into the blood stream, thus it could improve blood-glucose levels and IR in mice with MetS. Moreover, FvF decreased serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and liver lipid accumulation, while increased the serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in mice with MetS. Therefore, FvF could be considered as a potential candidate for the treatment of MetS by alleviating IR, inhibiting glucose transportation, and regulating lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266033>Silencing of GPR82 with Interference RNA Improved  Profiles in Rats with High Fructose Intake.</a></h2><p> (MS) is a clinical condition, constituted by alterations that lead to the onset of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It has been reported that orphan G-protein-coupled receptor 82 (GPR82) participates in  processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the function of GPR82 in MS using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against this receptor. We used Wistar rats of 10-12 weeks of age fed with a high-fructose solution (70%) for 9 weeks to induce MS. Subsequently, the rats were treated with an intrajugular dose of an siRNA against GPR82 and the effects were evaluated on day 3 and 7 after administration. On day 3 the siRNA had a transient effect on decreasing blood pressure and triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which recovered to the MS control on day 7. Decreased gene expressions of GPR82 mRNA in the aorta and heart were observed on day 3; moreover, decreased gene expression was maintained in the aorta on day 7. Therefore, we conclude that the orphan receptor GPR82 participates in the development of MS induced by fructose and the silencing of this receptor could ameliorate  components.© 2019 S.

Among 350 patients (240 men and 110 women) with a mean age of 51.9 years (S.D.=13.5) MetS prevalence was 37.4%, significantly higher in female patients (63.6%) compared to male patients (25.4%). Increased waist circumference was present in 51.1%, low HDL in 50.6%, hypertension in 49.4%, hyperglycemia in 28.6% and 25.7% had hypertriglyceridemia. Except for hypertriglyceridemia, all criteria were more prevalent in female patients. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that female gender, outpatient treatment setting and the absence of substance use disorder were all significant predictors for MetS. Compared to data from the general population obtained by the 2013 National Health Survey Curaçao, this study showed significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in patients with SMI. Moreover, female patients had the highest prevalence of diabetes (28.2%), obesity (50.0%) and increased waist circumference (88.2%). This study demonstrates that African-Caribbean patients with SMI are at high-risk for MetS, especially female patients. Our data suggest to focus on modifiable lifestyle risk factors, as promoting physical activity and healthy dietary habits.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

There are no reliable and inexpensive methods to evaluate obesity. All of the anthropometric measurements used have some limitations. In 2012, Krakauer et al developed a new method, called A Body Shape Index (ABSI), to identify abdominal obesity that is derived from weight, height, and waist circumference. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of the ABSI to predict the presence of insulin resistance (IR) and  (MetS) in renal transplant recipients. A total of 155 patients were included in the study. Prevalence of IR was 17.4%, and MetS was 62.6%. ROC results demonstrated the power of all anthropometric indices to discriminate patients with and without MetS and IR in the renal transplant populations. ROC curves showed that waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) had the optimal power to discriminate MetS and IR in women. WC had higher area under curve than all other anthropometric indices to predict MetS and IR in men. WC in men and WHtR in women has higher discriminatory capacity to predict MetS and IR in renal transplant recipients. An obvious difference was observed in the optimal anthropometric measures between the 2 sexes, suggesting that sex-specific measures should be used in practice. In order to evaluate the value of ABSI in determining  risk factors, studies with larger, randomized, controlled body fat ratios are needed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we determined the effects of NAFLD and HB infection on the risk of MetS among elderly individuals.  In total, 24,500 individuals aged >65 years were enrolled; they were classified into four groups: normal individuals (N), patients with only HB infection without abnormal echogenicity (HB-alone), patients with only abnormal echogenicity or fatty liver alone (FL-alone), and patients with both HB infection and abnormal echogenicity (HB-FL).  After adjustment for age, compared with group N, men and women with NAFLD (FL-alone and HB-FL) had a significantly higher risk of MetS, whereas no significant difference was observed in the incidence of MetS between groups HB-alone and N. However, group HB-FL had a lower risk of MetS than did group FL-alone. HB infection (HB-alone and HB-FL) was associated with a lower risk of high triglycerides (TGs) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) than HB infection absence (groups N and FL-alone) in men and women. Lower risk of TG derangement was observed in group HB-alone than in group N. In addition, both men and women in group HB-FL had a lower risk of TG and FPG abnormalities than in group FL-alone, whereas a decrease in incidence of high waist circumference and blood pressure was observed only in men.  HB infection protects against MetS development, only in patients with HB infection and NAFLD, but not in normal individuals.

We show that fat mass increases with age and represents a major contributor to insulin resistance and the . We summarize the effects of age on the adipose tissue (AT), related to the abundance, distribution, cellular composition, endocrine signaling and function of the tissue. The AT is an immunological tissue, with several hallmarks of innate and adaptive immune responses. We show that in both mice and humans, the AT is heavily infiltrated by immune cells that have receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines secreted by the adipocytes and also by the immune cells that have infiltrated the AT. We also show that the AT provides an environment for the secretion of IgG antibodies with anti-self (autoimmune) reactivity. As we have previously shown, this is due to the release of self antigens following cell death due to hypoxia, as well as to the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the enzyme of class switch recombination, and the transcription factor T-bet by the resident  cells, which also express the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. We show data in support of the AT as a tertiary lymphoid organ (TLO), showing the examples of TLOs that develop within the AT, such as fat-associated lymphoid clusters and milky spots, as well as artery TLOs that develop in the adventitia areas of the aorta.© 2019 S.

Whereas different studies were able to correct hepatic defects in animal models, they focused on the most mature phenotype of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from pluripotent stem cells and needed freshly prepared cells, which limits clinical applications of HLCs. Here, we report the production of hepatic stem cells (pHSCs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in xeno-free, feeder-free, and chemically defined conditions using as extracellular matrix a recombinant laminin instead of Matrigel, an undefined animal-derived matrix. Freshly prepared and frozen pHSCs were transplanted via splenic injection in Gunn rats, the animal model for Crigler-Najjar . Following cell transplantation and daily immunosuppression treatment, bilirubinemia was significantly decreased (around 30% decrease, P < .05) and remained stable throughout the 6-month study. The transplanted pHSCs underwent maturation in vivo to restore the deficient  hepatic function (bilirubin glucuronidation by UGT1A1). In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time the differentiation of hiPSCs into pHSCs that (a) are produced using a differentiation protocol compatible with Good Manufacturing Practices, () can be frozen, and (c) are sufficient to demonstrate in vivo therapeutic efficacy to significantly lower hyperbilirubinemia in a model of inherited liver disease, despite their immature phenotype. Thus, our approach provides major advances toward future clinical applications and would facilitate cell therapy manufacturing from human pluripotent stem cells.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We previously identified the acylaminocycloalkylthiophene class of TMEM16A inhibitors, which, following medicinal chemistry, gave analog 2-bromodifluoroacetylamino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4-cyclohepta[]thiophene-3-carboxylic acid -tolylamide (TM-23) with 30 nM half-maximal inhibitory concentration. Here, we tested the efficacy of TM-23 for inhibition of GI motility in mice. In isolated murine gastric antrum, TM-23 strongly inhibited spontaneous and carbachol-stimulated rhythmic contractions. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed predicted therapeutic concentrations of TM-23 for at least 4 h following a single oral or intraperitoneal dose at 10 mg/kg. Gastric emptying, as assessed following an oral bolus of phenol red or independently by [Tc]-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scintigraphy, was reduced by TM-23 by ∼60% at 20 min. Interestingly, there was little effect of TM-23 on baseline whole-gut transit time or time to diarrhea induced by castor oil. Consequent to the delay in gastric emptying, TM-23 administration significantly reduced the elevation in blood sugar in mice following an oral but not intraperitoneal glucose load. These results provide pharmacological evidence for involvement of TMEM16A in gastric emptying and suggest the utility of TMEM16A inhibition in disorders of accelerated gastric emptying, such as dumping , and potentially for improving glucose tolerance in diabetes mellitus/ and enhancing satiety in obesity.-Cil, O., Anderson, M.

The role and underlying mechanism of chemerin in developing IR of the granulosa cells from PCOS remain unclear. Plasma, follicular fluid, and human granulosa-lutein cells (hGLs) were collected from non-PCOS and patients with PCOS with or without IR. The chemerin levels were elevated in both follicular fluid and hGL samples from patients with PCOS with IR, and the hGLs from patients with PCOS with IR showed decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose uptake capacity. Moreover, treatment of chemerin attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by decreasing phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 Tyr612, phosphorylation of protein kinase  Ser473, and membrane translocation of glucose transporter type 4 through increasing Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS1 in cultured hGLs. These effects could be abolished by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of chemokine-like receptor 1. Furthermore, insulin induced the expression of chemerin in hGLs. Our findings demonstrate a novel role of chemerin in the  dysfunction of PCOS, which suggested that chemerin and its receptor can be further implicated as potential therapeutic targets in the future treatment of PCOS.-Li, X., Zhu, Q., Wang, W., Qi, J., He, Y., Wang, Y., Lu, Y., Wu, H., Ding, Y., Sun, Y.

The goals of the present study are to further study TY001 effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and . LPS is known to disrupt circadian clock to produce toxic effects, the effects of TY001 on rhythmic alterations of serum cytokines and hepatic clock gene expressions were examined. Mice were given TY001 (30 g/L, ≈ 40 g/kg) through the drinking water for 30 days, and on the 21 day of TY001 supplementation, LPS (0.25 mg/kg, ip, daily) was given for 9 days to establish the inflammation model. Repeated LPS injections produced inflammation, impaired glucose metabolism, and suppressed the expression of circadian clock core genes Bmal1 and Clock; clock feedback gene Cry1, Cry2, Per1, and Per2; clock target gene Rev-erbα and RORα. TY001 prevented LPS-induced elevations of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 in the liver, along with improved histopathology. TY001 reduced LPS-elevated fasting blood glucose and increased LPS-reduced serum insulin levels, probably via increased glucose transporter GLUT2, enhanced insulin signaling p-Akt and p-IRS-1. Importantly, LPS-induced circadian elevations of serum TNFα and IL-1β and aberrant expression of circadian clock genes in the liver were ameliorated by TY001. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the LPS decreased Bmal1 and Clock protein in the liver, which was recovered by TY001.

In this study, effects of PSC conditioned medium (PCM) on c-MET phosphorylation (by immunocytochemistry enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) and drug response (by sulforhodamine  assay) were investigated in five primary PDAC cells. In novel 3D-spheroid co-cultures of cyan fluorescence protein (CFP)-firefly luciferase (Fluc)-expressing primary human PDAC cells and green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing immortalized PSCs, PDAC cell growth and chemosensitivity were examined by luciferase assay, while spheroids' architecture was evaluated by confocal microscopy. The highest phospho-c-MET expression was detected in PDAC5 and its subclone sorted for "stage specific embryonic antigen-4" (PDAC5 (SSEA4)). PCM of cells pre-incubated with PDAC conditioned medium, containing increased hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels, made PDAC cells significantly more resistant to gemcitabine, but not to c-MET inhibitors. Hetero-spheroids containing both PSCs and PDAC5 (SSEA4) cells were more resistant to gemcitabine compared to PDAC5 (SSEA4) homo-spheroids. However, c-MET inhibitors (tivantinib, PHA-665752 and crizotinib) were equally effective in both spheroid models. Experiments with primary human PSCs confirmed the main findings.

In young adults, additional biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), ferritin, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol were measured. Arterial stiffness was evaluated by measuring brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). The mean age was 37.8 and 65.1 years old in the young and old groups, respectively. Without adjustment, most parameters were significantly correlated with baPWV in both young and old groups. Mean baPWV was significantly different according to  (MetS) in both groups (13.1 and 12.1 m/s in the young subjects with and without MetS, respectively; 17.4 and 15.8 m/s, respectively, in the old group). After adjusting for age, sex, and hemodynamic factors, the difference in baPWV according to MetS was significant only in the old group. The relationship between most biomarkers and baPWV was influenced by  disorders such as hypertension and diabetes in old adults. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein  were significant in young group. In conclusion, the  biomarkers related to arterial stiffness were different between young and old adults.

To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that curcumin can induce preadipocyte apoptosis and inhibit adipocyte differentiation, leading to suppression of adipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300810>A trans-fatty acid-rich diet promotes liver tumorigenesis in HCV core gene transgenic mice.</a></h2><p>Excess consumption of trans-fatty acid (TFA), an unsaturated fatty acid containing trans double bonds, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and . However, little is known about the link between TFA and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite it being a frequent form of cancer in humans. In the current study, the impact of excessive dietary TFA on hepatic tumorigenesis was assessed using hepatitis C virus (HCV) core gene transgenic mice that spontaneously developed HCC. Male transgenic mice were treated for 5 months with either a control diet or an isocaloric TFA-rich diet that replaced the majority of soybean oil with shortening. The prevalence of liver tumors was significantly higher in TFA-rich diet-fed transgenic mice compared with control diet-fed transgenic mice. The TFA-rich diet significantly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activated nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NRF2), leading to high p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) expression. Furthermore, the TFA diet activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and stimulated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, synergistically up-regulating cyclin D1 and c-Myc, driving cell proliferation. Excess TFA intake also promoted fibrogenesis and ductular reaction, presumably contributing to accelerated liver tumorigenesis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that a TFA-rich diet promotes hepatic tumorigenesis, mainly due to persistent activation of NF-κ and NRF2-p62/SQSTM1 signaling, ERK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and fibrogenesis. Therefore, HCV-infected patients should avoid a TFA-rich diet to prevent liver tumor development.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Apart from the known risks of MetS in terms of cardiovascular risk and mortality, there is increasing evidence that it also leads to alteration in testicular function and fertility.To assess the presence of hypogonadism and Sertoli cell dysfunction in young adult males with MetS and correlate these parameters with different components of the MetS.Cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Endocrinology, Gauhati Medical College, a tertiary care hospital in North East India.Young adult males with MetS aged 20-40 years and age-matched healthy males who served as controls were examined clinically. Laboratory investigations done in the fasting state included blood glucose, lipid profile, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin  and total testosterone (Te). Semen was collected after 3 days abstinence and analysis done.Baseline parameters were presented as median and 'Kruskal-Wallis' test was used to compare them. Pearson test and multiple regression analysis were used to assess the correlation and association between variables.Fifty cases with MetS and 30 controls were included in the study. Subjects with MetS had significantly lower levels of total Te, FSH and inhibin . They also had significantly lower semen volume, sperm count and total as well as progressive motility. There was a significant negative correlation of waist circumference and positive correlation of inhibin  with total sperm count. A significant negative association of serum triglycerides with semen volume was also found.MetS is a state of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism as reflected by low total Te, FSH and inhibin  levels with semen abnormalities reflecting Sertoli cell dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260504>A structural equation modeling approach for the association of a healthy eating index with  and cardio- risk factors among obese individuals.</a></h2><p>Numerous studies have evaluated the association between dietary factors and cardiovascular risk among patients with chronic disease. It is worthwhile to assess these associations in a combination model rather than in an isolated form. In the current study, we aimed to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the association of adherence to a healthy eating index (HEI)-2015 with socio-demographic factors, psychological characteristics,  (MetS) and other cardio- risk factors among obese individuals.This cross-sectional study was conducted among 188 healthy obese adults (96 males and 92 females) aged 20-50 years in Tabriz. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to record dietary intake and to estimate HEI-2015. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure and biochemical measurements were evaluated according to standard protocols. Interrelationships among socio-demographic parameters and HEI with cardio- risk factors were analyzed using SEM.The results of SEM analysis revealed that HEI mediated the association between age and several cardio- risk factors including fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p < 0.05). Moreover, adherence to Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) appears to mediate association between gender and waist circumference ( = -9.78), SBP ( = -4.83), triglyceride ( = -13.01) and HDL ( = 4.31). HEI also mediated indirect negative effects of socioeconomic status on FM ( = -0.56), FFM ( = -0.25), SBP ( = -0.55) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ( = -0.3). Additionally, depression and age had indirect unfavorable effects on some insulin resistance indices such as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( = 0.07; p<0.05, for age) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (p<0.05, for age and depression) via HEI. High adherence to HEI was found to be inversely associated with MetS risk (p<0.05).Adherence to HEI-2015 seems to mediate the effect of socio-demographic parameters and mental health on cardio- risk factors as well as MetS risk. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258528>Fecal Microbial Transplantation and Its Potential Application in Cardiometabolic .</a></h2><p>Newly revealed links between inflammation, obesity, and cardiometabolic  have created opportunities to try previously unexplored therapeutic modalities in these common and life-risking disorders.

Over the last decade, evidence has accumulated that demonstrates the anti-cancer effects of an anti-diabetic drug - metformin - in endocrine malignancies. We performed a literature review utilizing the Pubmed, Medline and clinicaltrials.gov databases using the keyword "metformin" plus the following terms: "thyroid cancer," "thyroid nodules," "parathyroid," "hyperparathyroidism," "adrenal adenoma," "Cushing ," "hyperaldosteronism," "adrenocortical cancer," "neuroendocrine tumor (NET)," "pancreatic NET (pNET)," "carcinoid," "pituitary adenoma," "pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET)", "prolactinoma," "pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma." We found 37 studies describing the preclinical and clinical role of metformin in endocrine tumors. The available epidemiological data shows an association between exposure of metformin and lower incidence of thyroid cancer and pNETs in diabetic patients. Metformin treatment has been associated with better response to cancer therapy in thyroid cancer and pNETs. Preclinical evidence suggests that the primary direct mechanisms of metformin action include inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation via inhibition of both mitochondrial complex I and mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, leading to  stress. Decreased ATP production leads to an activation of a cellular energy sensor, AMPK, and subsequent downregulation of mTOR signaling pathway, which is associated with decreased cellular proliferation. We also describe several AMPK-independent mechanisms of metformin action, as well as the indirect mechanisms targeting insulin resistance. Overall, repositioning of metformin has emerged as a promising strategy for adjuvant therapy of endocrine tumors. The mechanisms of synergy between metformin and other anti-cancer agents need to be elucidated further to guide well-designed prospective trials on combination therapies in endocrine malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635056>Cross-Talk between Mitochondrial Dysfunction-Provoked Oxidative Stress and Aberrant Noncoding RNA Expression in the Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of SLE.</a></h2><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype of systemic autoimmune disease involving almost every organ. Polygenic predisposition and complicated epigenetic regulations are the upstream factors to elicit its development. Mitochondrial dysfunction-provoked oxidative stress may also play a crucial role in it. Classical epigenetic regulations of gene expression may include DNA methylation/acetylation and histone modification. Recent investigations have revealed that intracellular and extracellular (exosomal) noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), are the key molecules for post-transcriptional regulation of messenger (m)RNA expression. Oxidative and nitrosative stresses originating from mitochondrial dysfunctions could become the pathological biosignatures for increased cell apoptosis/necrosis, nonhyperglycemic , multiple neoantigen formation, and immune dysregulation in patients with SLE. Recently, many authors noted that the cross-talk between oxidative stress and ncRNAs can trigger and perpetuate autoimmune reactions in patients with SLE. Intracellular interactions between miR and lncRNAs as well as extracellular exosomal ncRNA communication to and fro between remote cells/tissues via plasma or other body fluids also occur in the body. The urinary exosomal ncRNAs can now represent biosignatures for lupus nephritis. Herein, we'll briefly review and discuss the cross-talk between excessive oxidative/nitrosative stress induced by mitochondrial dysfunction in tissues/cells and ncRNAs, as well as the prospect of antioxidant therapy in patients with SLE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172973>The implication of adipocyte ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1 transporters in  complications of obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is characterised by imbalance in lipid metabolism manifested by high concentrations of circulating triacylglycerols and total cholesterol as well as low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Abnormalities related to these lipids lead to  complications such as type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive research, it is still unclear why a subset of obese subjects develop , while others do not. The aim of our work was to assess total and plasma membrane expressions of cholesterol transport proteins: adipocyte ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), adipocyte ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1), class  scavenger receptor (SR-BI) in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese subjects with and without . To keep our preliminary study group uniform, we focused on women, who constitute the majority of bariatric patients. The study was performed on 34 patients: 24 morbidly obese women subjected to bariatric surgery, half of whom had ; and 10 lean subjects undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Total and plasma membrane expressions of cholesterol transport proteins (SR-BI, ABCA1 and ABCG1) were assessed in samples of both visceral and subcutaneous adipose and analysed in relation to other clinical and laboratory parameters. We demonstrated lower plasma membrane expressions of ABCG1 in visceral adipose tissue of obese patients with  as compared to lean ones. In addition, total ABCG1 expressions in both types of adipose tissue were lower in morbidly obese patients with  compared to those without . Plasma membrane ABCA1 expressions in visceral adipose tissue were lower in the group of morbidly obese patients without , compared to lean patients. We did not find any significant differences in SR-BI expressions. Because of ABCG1 is responsible for cholesterol efflux to HDL, reduced plasma membrane expression of ABCG1 in VAT of morbidly obese women with  may leads to a significantly decreased concentration of HDL in serum.

NRG-1 features a multitasking profile tuning regenerative, inflammatory, fibrotic, and  processes. Here, we review the activities of NRG-1 on different cell types and organs and their implication for heart failure progression and its comorbidities. Although, in general, effects of NRG-1 in heart failure are compensatory and beneficial, translation into therapies remains unaccomplished both because of the complexity of the underlying pathways and because of the challenges in the development of therapeutics (proteins, peptides, small molecules, and RNA-based therapies) for tyrosine kinase receptors.

Discordance between these parameters and LDL-c has not been evaluated in  (MetS) patients. We characterized a comprehensive lipid profile in 177 MetS patients. The 2016 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemias were used to define LDL-c targets. The atherogenic lipoprotein profile was compared in patients with LDL-c within and above the target. Only 34.4% (61) of patients had mean LDL-c levels within the guidelines and patients with LDL-c above target presented significantly elevated levels of Apolipoprotein  (ApoB), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-c) and oxidized LDL-c. In patients with LDL-c within target, 25%, 31% and 49% presented levels above the recommended range for ApoB, non-HDL-c and oxidized LDL-c, respectively. Patients presented a strong association of LDL-c and non-HDL-c (r = 0.796), ApoB (r = 0.749) and oxidized LDL-c (r = 0.452). Similarly, non-HDL-c was strongly correlated with ApoB (r = 0.857) and oxidized-LDL-c (r = 0.555). The logistic regression model evidenced higher triglycerides and HDL-c and lower ApoB as predictors of having LDL-c within target. Reliance solely on LDL-c could result in missed opportunities for CVD risk reduction. ApoB, oxidized LDL-c, and particularly non-HDL-c, could be valuable parameters to estimate the CVD risk of MetS patients and have the potential to be targeted therapeutically.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134715> and liver steatosis occur at lower body mass index in US Asian patients with chronic hepatitis .</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that ultrasound identifies significant steatosis in patients with chronic HBV (CHB). However, the relationship between CHB,  (MS) and steatosis is poorly understood. In this tertiary care, single-centre retrospective cohort study of 617 CHB patients, we examined the prevalence of MS and steatosis in a predominantly Asian US cohort. Patients were predominantly male (57%) with a mean age of 53 years, Asian (88%), on HBV therapy (64%) and had undetectable DNA (65%). 21% had MS, of which hypertension (41%), dyslipidemia (41%) and obesity (32%) were most common. Patients with MS were more likely to be older (60 vs 52 [P < 0.001]), have steatosis (40% vs 17% [P < 0.001]) and have a higher ALT (29 vs 25 [P = 0.003]). Of the 22% of patients with steatosis by ultrasound, a higher prevalence of MS (38% vs 16% [P < 0.001]) and higher ALT (31 vs 24 [P < 0.001]) was observed. Asian patients had a lower BMI than non-Asians (mean 24 vs 26 [P = 0.001]) but similar prevalence of MS risk factors and steatosis. Asian patients with a BMI between 25 and 30 and two other MS risk factors had steatosis at the same rate as patients with a BMI > 30 and at least two other MS risk factors. We found a strong association between MS, steatosis and elevated ALT in HBV patients. Asian HBV patients have lower BMI than non-Asians yet have the same prevalence of steatosis and other MS risk factors, supporting guidelines for lower BMI targets in Asians.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315213>Nutraceutical Potential of  in .</a></h2><p> L. is a well-known fruit worldwide, and its highest production occurs in tropical and subtropical regions.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which DEHP or MEHP perturbs hepatic glucose homeostasis, we compared the effect of DEHP (0-200 μM) and MEHP (0-200 μM) on glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells. In this study, we found that MEHP can induce more severe impairments in glucose homeostasis than DEHP can; these include increased hepatic gluconeogenesis via receptor substrate-1/protein kinase /fork-head box protein O1 (IRS-1/AKT/FOXO1)-mediated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) up-regulation, as well as decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis via glucokinase (GCK) inhibition and IRS-1/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-mediated glycogen synthase (GYS) inactivation. Additionally, our results demonstrated that retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), an insulin resistance-inducing factor, plays a critical role in the MEHP-induced disorder of glucose homeostasis and the dysfunction of insulin signaling transduction, whereas the deletion of RBP4 by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) significantly reversed these toxic effects. Although these should be interpreted with caution in view of limited in vivo evidence, the present study provides the first in vitro evidence for potential involvements of RBP4 in disturbance of glucose homeostasis in the MEHP-treated HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Prolonged inflammation and oxidative stress have been linked to impaired adipose tissue function and the development of the . Currently available therapies offer minimal prophylactic effects, while substantial experimental evidence supports the ameliorative effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against various  complications associated with obesity. The current review provides a comprehensive synthesis of studies published in major search engines such as PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and Google Scholar assessing the therapeutic effect of NAC against obesity associated complications. Overwhelming literature included in this review supports the ameliorative effects of NAC against such complications in both in vitro and in vivo models of obesity. In addition to attenuating an abnormal pro-inflammatory response and limiting oxidative damage, NAC could inhibit lipid accumulation by targeting adipogenic transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), and improve insulin sensitivity through augmenting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase  (AKT) pathway.

While gene expression of FGF21 is regulated by the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in the fasted state, little is known about the regulation of trafficking and secretion of FGF21. We show that mice with a mutation in the Yip1 domain family, member 6 gene (- [];   ) on a high-fat diet (HFD) have higher plasma levels of FGF21 than mice that do not carry this mutation (controls) and hepatocytes from   mice secrete more FGF21 than hepatocytes from wild-type mice. Consequently,   mice are resistant to HFD-induced features of the  and have increased lipolysis, energy expenditure, and thermogenesis, with an increase in core body temperature.   mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of FGF21 were no longer protected from diet-induced obesity. We show that YIPF6 binds FGF21 in the endoplasmic reticulum to limit its secretion and specifies packaging of FGF21 into coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles during development of obesity in mice. Levels of YIPF6 protein in human liver correlate with hepatic steatosis and correlate inversely with levels of FGF21 in serum from patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

A synchronous bilateral adrenalectomy (SBA) is effective in recovering hypercortisolism. However, specific indications for an SBA are not available. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients who underwent an SBA and to identify biomarkers able to predict the requirements of an SBA.A mono-centric and longitudinal study was conducted on 19 consecutive patients who underwent SBA for ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism between December 2003 and December 2017. This study population was compared to two control groups composed of patients cured after the resection of the ACTH secreting pituitary adenoma (Group A: 44 patients) and of the ACTH-secreting neuroendocrine tumours (Group : 8 patients).Short- or long-term SBA complications or the recurrence of hypercortisolism did not occur. A single patient experienced Nelson . Clinical features after SBA showed improvement in the glico- assessment, hypertension, bone metabolism and the occurrence of hypokalaemia and infections. The younger the age at the time of Cushing's disease diagnosis, the longer the duration of active hypercortisolism, higher values of plasmatic ACTH and Cortisol (1 month after pituitary neurosurgery) and higher values of Ki67 in pituitary adenomas were detected in this study population as compared to Group A.SBA is an effective and safe treatment for patients with unmanageable ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism.

There is growing interest in non-pharmacological methods to treat BP including a novel approach using pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF). PEMF therapy has been proposed to impact physiological function at the cellular and tissue level and one possible mechanism is through an impact on endothelial function and nitric oxide (NO) related pathways. The focus of the present study was to evaluate the effect of PEMF on BP and NO in subjects with mild to moderate .  For 12 weeks, 23 subjects underwent PEMF therapy and 21 subjects underwent sham therapy. BP was measured at rest and near the end of submaximal exercise pre- and 12 week post-therapy. Additionally, plasma NO was measured at similar time points.  The PEMF demonstrated an increase in NO after therapy ( .04) but SHAM did not ( .37). For resting BP, there were no differences in systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) or mean arterial pressure (MAP) between groups ( .05). During exercise, PEMF had a reduction in peak SBP ( .04), but not SHAM ( .57). PEMF demonstrated significant relationships between baseline SBP and change in SBP following therapy ( = -0.71,  .01) and between MAP and change in MAP following therapy ( = -0.60,  .01), but no such relationships were found in SHAM. Subjects with resting hypertension (SBP ≥140 mmHg) in PEMF (n = 11) had significant reductions in SBP, DBP and MAP when compared to SHAM with hypertension ( = 9) ( .05). In this sub-group analysis, PEMF demonstrated lowered peak SBP ( .04) at a given exercise load ( .40) but SHAM did not ( .05).  PEMF may increase plasma NO availability and improve BP at rest and during exercise. However, this beneficial effect appears to be more pronounced in subjects with existing hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523258>The glucose metabolism disorder and dyslipidemia among girls with different phenotype polycystic ovary .</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the prevalence of glucose metabolism disorder and dyslipidemia in 14-18-year-old girls with different phenotype polycystic ovary  (PCOS).This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted on 3200 high-school adolescents aged 14-18 years in Shiraz in 2010.

The neurotrophic growth factors insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are currently being investigated as potential therapeutic approaches for AD in preclinical and clinical studies. However, given that the  (MetS) and diabetes are risk factors for AD, it is unknown how associated insulin resistance (IR) in the brain may impact the effectiveness of these therapies for AD. In this report, we therefore investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of insulin and IGF-I on AD-associated pathology in the context of IR, with particular emphasis on phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key step in promoting amyloid plaque formation in AD. Both insulin and IGF-I decreased APP phosphorylation in cultured primary cortical neurons, supporting their therapeutic use in AD. Induction of IR blocked the beneficial effect of insulin and reduced the effect of IGF-I on APP dephosphorylation. These effects were mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase  (Akt) pathway, as inhibition of this pathway during IR restored the effect of IGF-I on APP dephosphorylation. Finally, we explored the translational relevance of these results in vivo by demonstrating that high fat diet fed mice, a robust model of IR and MetS, exhibited the expected increased brain APP phosphorylation. Overall, these data suggest that the beneficial therapeutic effect of insulin and IGF-I on APP phosphorylation is negatively impacted by IR, and suggest that insulin and IGF-I alone may not be appropriate therapies for AD patients with IR, MetS, or diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Emerging evidence has suggested that obesity and comorbidities might increase the risk of ARHI. However, no reviews have been published that address the role of nutritional interventions for obesity and comorbidities in the prevention of ARHI.A PubMed database search was conducted to identify the relationship between obesity and ARHI. "Obesity", "", "adipose-derived hormone", "fatty acid", and "age-related hearing impairment" were included as keywords.A total of 89 articles was analyzed with 39 articles of relevance to ARHI. A high-fat diet may induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis in the inner ear. Statins have been shown to delay the progression of ARHI by improving the lipid profile, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting endothelial inflammation. Aldosterone could exert protective effects against ARHI by upregulating the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter 1 in the cochlea. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could preserve the cochlear microcirculation by reducing dyslipidemia and inhibiting inflammation. Alpha-lipoic acid and lecithin might delay the progression of ARHI by protecting cochlear mitochondrial DNA from damage due to oxidative stress. Tea and ginseng might protect against ARHI through their anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects.Nutritional interventions for obesity and comorbidities, including a low-fat diet, supplementation with statins, aldosterone, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, alpha-lipoic acids, lecithin, tea, and ginseng, may protect against the development of ARHI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042281>Human IFT52 mutations uncover a novel role for the protein in microtubule dynamics and centrosome cohesion.</a></h2><p>Mutations in genes encoding components of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complexes have previously been associated with a spectrum of diseases collectively termed ciliopathies. Ciliopathies relate to defects in the formation or function of the cilium, a sensory or motile organelle present on the surface of most cell types. IFT52 is a key component of the IFT- complex and ensures the interaction of the two subcomplexes, IFT-B1 and IFT-B2. Here, we report novel IFT52 biallelic mutations in cases with a short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD) or a congenital anomaly of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Combining in vitro and in vivo studies in zebrafish, we showed that SRTD-associated missense mutation impairs IFT- complex assembly and IFT-B2 ciliary localization, resulting in decreased cilia length. In comparison, CAKUT-associated missense mutation has a mild pathogenicity, thus explaining the lack of skeletal defects in CAKUT case. In parallel, we demonstrated that the previously reported homozygous nonsense IFT52 mutation associated with Sensenbrenner  [Girisha et al. (2016) A homozygous nonsense variant in IFT52 is associated with a human skeletal ciliopathy. Clin. Genet., 90, 536-539] leads to exon skipping and results in a partially functional protein. Finally, our work uncovered a novel role for IFT52 in microtubule network regulation. We showed that IFT52 interacts and partially co-localized with centrin at the distal end of centrioles where it is involved in its recruitment and/or maintenance. Alteration of this function likely contributes to centriole splitting observed in Ift52-/- cells. Altogether, our findings allow a better comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation among IFT52-related cases and revealed a novel, extra-ciliary role for IFT52, i.e. disruption may contribute to pathophysiological mechanisms.© The Author(s) 2019.

The objective of this is to study the impact of burden of co-morbidities, complications, and methanol-induced brain lesions on hospital, follow-up, and total mortality.  All patients hospitalized with methanol poisoning during a mass poisoning outbreak were followed in a prospective cohort study until death or final follow-up after 6 years. The age-adjusted Charlson co-morbidity index (ACCI) score was calculated for each patient. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to calculate the adjusted hazards ratio (HR) for death. The survival was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Of 108 patients (mean age with SD 50.9 ± 2.6 years), 24 (54.4 ± 5.9 years) died during hospitalization (mean survival with SD 8 ± 4 days) and 84 (49.9 ± 3.0 years;  = .159) were discharged, including 27 with methanol-induced brain lesions. Of the discharged patients, 15 (56.3 ± 6.8 years) died during the follow-up (mean survival 37 ± 11 months) and 69 (48.5 ± 3.3 years;  = .044) survived. The hospital mortality was 22%, the follow-up mortality was 18%; the total mortality was 36%. Cardiac/respiratory arrest, acute respiratory failure, multiorgan failure , and arterial hypotension increased the HR for hospital and total (but not follow-up) mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and arterial pH (all  < .05). All patients who died in the hospital had at least one complication. A higher ACCI score was associated with greater total mortality (HR 1.22; 1.00-1.48 95% CI;  = .046). Of those who died, 35 (90%) had a moderate-to-high ACCI. The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that patients with a high ACCI had greater follow-up mortality compared to ones with low ( = .027) or moderate ( = .020) scores. For the patients who died during follow-up, cancers of different localizations were responsible for 7/15 (47%) of the deaths.  The character and number of complications affected hospital but not follow-up mortality, while the burden of co-morbidities affected follow-up mortality. Methanol-induced brain lesions did not affect follow-up mortality. Relatively high cancer mortality rate may be associated with acute exposure to  formaldehyde produced by methanol oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568476>Drivers of HIV-1 transmission: The Portuguese case.</a></h2><p>Portugal has one of the most severe HIV-1 epidemics in Western Europe.

Comparing their transmission patterns and its association with transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is important to pinpoint transmission hotspots and to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.Demographic, clinical and genomic data were collected from 3599 HIV-1 naive patients between 2001 and 2014. Sequences obtained from drug resistance testing were used for subtyping, TDR determination and transmission clusters (TC) analyses.In Portugal, transmission of subtype  was significantly associated with young males, while transmission of subtype G was associated with older heterosexuals. In Portuguese originated people, there was a decreasing trend both for prevalence of subtype G and for number of TCs in this subtype. The active TCs that were identified (i.e. clusters originated after 2008) were associated with subtype -infected males residing in Lisbon. TDR was significantly different when comparing subtypes  (10.8% [9.5-12.2]) and G (7.6% [6.4-9.0]) (p = 0.001).TC analyses shows that, in Portugal, the subtype  epidemic is active and fueled by young male patients residing in Lisbon, while transmission of subtype G is decreasing.

Underlying pathophysiology in diabetes mellitus leads to decrease in circulatory endothelial progenitor cells, resulting in diabetic macro-vascular and micro-vascular complications. Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) gamma analogues serves as an effective therapy for controlling blood sugar levels and preventing its complications. Reports of clinical trials and meta-analysis of clinical trial suggests the beneficial aspects of PPAR gamma therapy in increasing the number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. This review highlights the pleotropic effect of PPAR gamma analogs, apart from their antidiabetic action via reduction of oxidative stress, increasing expression of eNOS, reducing level of miR 22, miR 222 levels and positive modulation of rapamycin/Protein kinase /phosphoinoside3-kinase pathways, preventing the early apoptosis, enhanced mobility proliferation and transformation into mature endothelial cells.

Nine hundred and seventy six girls were selected from regions within two cities in north-eastern Iran in 2015. They were assessed with respect to: their stature and menstrual pattern, age of menstruation, severity of dysmenorrhoea, duration of their menstrual cycle and flow. 841 girls had experienced menarche. 10.5% had a short stature. There were significant differences in age, height, weight and body mass index between those who had experienced their first menstrual cycle and others ( < .001). There were weak and negative correlation between age of menarche and height percentiles (  =  -0.12,  < .001). Premenstrual , duration of menstruation cycle and bleeding period did not differ between these two groups ( > .05). We found that dysmenorrhoea was significantly influenced by height. Although the mean age at menarche was statistically significant among different statures, the range was narrow (12.2-12.7). Further studies considering environmental factors, including socioeconomic status and nutrition concurrently, are also required. Impact statement  Various menstrual characteristics, including age of menarche, severity of dysmenorrhoea and duration of menstrual period may be associated with height. But, there have been few studies on the relationship between short stature and its impact on health status and menstrual patterns in adolescents.

Therefore, an attempt to rescue EMS adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) with calystegines (polyhydroxylated alkaloids) that are endowed with strong antioxidant and antidiabetic abilities was performed.ASCs isolated from EMS horses were subsequently treated with various concentrations of total calystegines. Different parameters were then assessed using flow cytometry, confocal as well as SE microscopy, and RT-qPCR.Our results clearly demonstrated that calystegines could improve EqASC viability and proliferation and significantly reduce apoptosis, via improvement of mitochondrial potentiation and functionality, regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways, and suppression of ER stress. Furthermore, nortropanes positively upregulated GLUT4 and IRS transcripts, indicating a possible sensitizing or mimetic effect to insulin. Most interesting finding in this investigation lies in the modulatory effect of autophagy, a process that allows the maintenance of cellular homeostasis; calystegines acted as pharmacological chaperones to promote cell survival.Obtained data open new perspectives in the development of new drugs, which may improve the  dynamics of cells challenged by MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063003>Improved unhealthy lifestyle habits in patients with high cardiovascular risk: results from a structured lifestyle programme in primary care.</a></h2><p> Physical activity, healthful dietary habits, and not smoking are associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, few studies have examined how counselling to improve poor lifestyle habits might be carried out in clinical practice. In Swedish primary care, structured lifestyle counselling is still not integrated into everyday clinical practice. The aim of the present study was two-fold: (1) to describe a novel lifestyle intervention programme in primary care; and (2) to evaluate change in unhealthy lifestyle habits over 1 year in men and women with high cardiovascular risk who participated in the lifestyle intervention programme.  A single-group study with a 1-year follow-up was carried out. A total of 417 people was enrolled, median age 62 years (54% women), with either hypertension (69%), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or impaired glucose tolerance. The 1-year intervention included five counselling sessions that focused on lifestyle habits, delivered by a district nurse with postgraduate credits in diabetes care and the . All patients were offered in-depth counselling for one or more lifestyle habits when needed. Lifestyle habits were assessed by a questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Total change was assessed using a nine-factor unhealthy lifestyle habit index.  Favourable, significant changes were observed for physical activity, dietary habits, smoking, and stress over 1 year. Similar improvements were seen for both sexes and type of diagnosis.  The results support the utility of a multifactorial, structured approach to change unhealthy lifestyle habits for cardiovascular risk prevention in a primary care setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311405>Gut microbiota composition explains more variance in the host cardiometabolic risk than genetic ancestry.</a></h2><p>Cardiometabolic affections greatly contribute to the global burden of disease. The susceptibility to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes, conditions that add to the cardiometabolic  (CMS), was associated with the ancestral genetic composition and gut microbiota. Studies explicitly testing associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbes are growing. We here examined whether the host genetic ancestry was associated with gut microbiota composition, and distinguished the effects of genetic ancestry and non-genetic factors on human cardiometabolic health. We performed a cross-sectional study with 441 community-dwelling Colombian mestizos from five cities spanning the Andes, Pacific, and Caribbean coasts. We characterized the host genetic ancestry by genotyping 40 ancestry informative markers; characterized gut microbiota through 16S rRNA gene sequencing; assessed diet intake, physical activity, cigarette, and medicament consumption; and measured cardiometabolic outcomes that allowed calculating a CMS risk scale. On average, each individual of our cohort was 67 ± 6% European, 21 ± 5% Native American and 12 ± 5% African. Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear models showed that individuals with higher Native American and African ancestries had increased fasting insulin, body mass index and CMS risk, as assessed by the CMS risk scale. Furthermore, we identified 21 OTUs associated to the host genetic ancestry and 20 to cardiometabolic health. While we highlight novel associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbiota, we found that the effect of intestinal microbes was more likely to explain the variance in CMS risk scale than the contributions of European, Native American and African genetic backgrounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142378>Recommendations for the management of MPS VI: systematic evidence- and consensus-based guidance.</a></h2><p>Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VI or Maroteaux-Lamy  (253200) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency in N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase ). The heterogeneity and progressive nature of MPS VI necessitates a multidisciplinary team approach and there is a need for robust guidance to achieve optimal management. This programme was convened to develop evidence-based, expert-agreed recommendations for the general principles of management, routine monitoring requirements and the use of medical and surgical interventions in patients with MPS VI.26 international healthcare professionals from various disciplines, all with expertise in managing MPS VI, and three patient advocates formed the Steering Committee group (SC) and contributed to the development of this guidance. Members from six Patient Advocacy Groups (PAGs) acted as advisors and attended interviews to ensure representation of the patient perspective. A modified-Delphi methodology was used to demonstrate consensus among a wider group of healthcare professionals with expertise and experience managing patients with MPS VI and the manuscript has been evaluated against the validated Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument by three independent reviewers.A total of 93 guidance statements were developed covering five domains: (1) general management principles; (2) recommended routine monitoring and assessments; (3) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); (4) interventions to support respiratory and sleep disorders; (5) anaesthetics and surgical interventions. Consensus was reached on all statements after two rounds of voting. The greatest challenges faced by patients as relayed by consultation with PAGs were deficits in endurance, dexterity, hearing, vision and respiratory function. The overall guideline AGREE II assessment score obtained for the development of the guidance was 5.3/7 (where 1 represents the lowest quality and 7 represents the highest quality of guidance).This manuscript provides evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for the management of patients with MPS VI and is for use by healthcare professionals that manage the holistic care of patients with the intention to improve clinical- and patient-reported outcomes and enhance patient quality of life. It is recognised that the guidance provided represents a point in time and further research is required to address current knowledge and evidence gaps.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540029>The Paradox of Coenzyme Q in Aging.</a></h2><p>Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is an essential endogenously synthesized molecule that links different  pathways to mitochondrial energy production thanks to its location in the mitochondrial inner membrane and its redox capacity, which also provide it with the capability to work as an antioxidant. Although defects in CoQ biosynthesis in human and mouse models cause CoQ deficiency , some animals models with particular defects in the CoQ biosynthetic pathway have shown an increase in life span, a fact that has been attributed to the concept of mitohormesis. Paradoxically, CoQ levels decline in some tissues in human and rodents during aging and coenzyme Q (CoQ) supplementation has shown benefits as an anti-aging agent, especially under certain conditions associated with increased oxidative stress. Also, CoQ has shown therapeutic benefits in aging-related disorders, particularly in cardiovascular and  diseases.

Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are hallmarks of  (MetS). However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and  parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico- parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58.5 nmol/L,  = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central obesity, or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty acids, and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for insulin levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, serum SCG3 concentrations were higher in subjects with MetS and were independently associated with FPG levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434580>The Association of Red Meat Intake with Inflammation and Circulating Intermediate Biomarkers of Type 2 Diabetes Is Mediated by Central Adiposity.</a></h2><p>We explored the role of lipid accumulation products and visceral adiposity on the association between red meat consumption and markers of insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation in US adults. Data on red meat consumption, and health outcome measurements were extracted from the 2005-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Overall 16,621 participants were included in the analysis (mean age = 47.1 years, 48.3% men). Analysis of co-variance and "conceptus causal mediation" models were applied, while accounting for survey design. In adjusted models, a lower red meat consumption was significantly associated with a cardio-protective profile of IR and inflammation. Body mass index (BMI) had significant mediation effects on the associations between red meat consumption and C-reactive protein (CRP), Apolipoprotein-, fasting glucose (FBG), insulin, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) IR and β-cell function, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), triglyceride to high density lipoprotein (TG:HDL) ratio and triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index (all p < 0.05). Both waist circumference and anthropometrically predicted visceral adipose tissue (apVAT) mediated the association between red meat consumption with CRP, FBG, HbA1c, TG: HDL ratio and TyG index (all p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that adiposity, particularly the accumulation of abdominal fat, accounts for a significant proportion of the associations between red meat consumption IR and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262576>Arylsulfatases A and : From normal tissues to malignant tumors.</a></h2><p>Arylsulfatases are lysosomal enzymes with important roles in the cell metabolism.

Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (Angptl8) was recently identified as a liver and adipose tissue-released hormone that is one of the molecules involved in triglyceride metabolism. However, the regulatory mechanism of Angptl8 is largely unknown. A high fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse model, which showed high cholesterol, high triglyceride, and high insulin in the blood, revealed the upregulation of hepatic and plasma Angptl8 and the downregulation of hepatic glycine -methyltransferase (GNMT). The inverse correlation of hepatic Angptl8 and GNMT expression in the livers of HFD-fed mice was also confirmed in a publicly available microarray dataset. The mechanistic study using primary hepatocytes showed that the Angptl8 expression could be induced by insulin treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway by the specific inhibitors or the dominant-negative Akt blocked the insulin-induced Angptl8 expression. Moreover, knockout of GNMT promoted the Akt activation as well as the Angptl8 expression.

Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including  and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase  (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to lipogenesis. This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the browning of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group.

We found that p-synephrine suppressed the 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis by reducing the expression level of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which subsequently led to a reduction in the fatty acid-binding protein 4 (aP2) expression. p-Synephrine treatment markedly activated the protein kinase  (PKB/Akt) pathway and sequentially inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity. Inhibition of GSK3β activity by LiCl was found to partially ameliorate the above-mentioned effects. All these data suggested that p-synephrine exhibited the anti-adipogenic effects via the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the suppression of adipogenesis-related proteins. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Citrus aurantium often uses as herbal or dietary supplement in various countries around the world, including in Seville, Spain and South Africa. In traditional Chinese herbs, it is referred to as "Fructus aurantii immaturus," "Zhi shi," or "Zhi ke," and has been used for hundreds of years for various digestive problems. Its primary protoalkaloid, p-synephrine, exhibited lipolytic effects and energy expenditure, which has rapidly replaced ephedrine as an "ephedra-free" alternative dietary supplement. The current study firstly demonstrated the anti-adipogenic effects of p-synephrine in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which was due to the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the subsequent suppression of adipogenesis-related proteins.

The aim of this study was to compare patients with LRBA-related ALPS and LRBA-related CVID, to describe their clinical and laboratory phenotypes, and to prepare an algorithm for their diagnosis and management.Fifteen LRBA-deficient patients were identified among 31 CVID and 14 possible ALPS patients with Western blotting (WB), primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) gene, next-generation panel screening (NGS), and whole exome sequencing (WES).The median age on admission and age of diagnosis were 7 years (0.3-16.5) and 11 years (5-44), respectively. Splenomegaly was seen in 93.3% (14/15) of the patients on admission. Splenectomy was performed to 1/5. Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (93.3% (14/15)), autoimmune cytopenia (80% (12/15)), chronic diarrhea (53.3% (8/15)), lower respiratory tract infections (53.3% (8/15)), lymphoma (26.6% (4/15)), Evans  (26.6% (4/15)), and autoimmune thyroiditis (20% (3/15)) were common clinical findings and diseases. Lymphopenia (5/15), intermittant neutropenia (4/15), eosinophilia (4/15), and progressive hypogammaglobulinemia are recorded in given number of patients. Double negative T cells (TCRαβCD4CD8) were increased in 80% (8/10) of the patients.  cell percentage/numbers were low in 60% (9/15) of the patients on admission. Decreased switched memory  cells, decreased naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) Thelper (Th) cells, markedly increased effector memory/effector memory RA (TEMRA) Th were documented. Large PD1 population, increased memory, and enlarged follicular helper T cell population in the CD4 T cell compartment was seen in one of the patients. Most of the deleterious missense mutations were located in the DUF1088 and BEACH domains. Interestingly, one of the two siblings with the same homozygous LRBA defect did not have any clinical symptom. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed to 7/15 (46.6%) of the patients. Transplanted patients are alive and well after a median of 2 years (1-3). In total, one patient died from sepsis during adulthood before HSCT.Patients with LRBA deficiency may initially be diagnosed as CVID or ALPS in the clinical practice. Progressive decrease in  cells as well as IgG in ALPS-like patients and addition of IBD symptoms in the follow-up should raise the suspicion for LRBA deficiency. Decreased switched memory  cells, decreased naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) Th cells, and markedly increased effector memory/effector memory RA Th cells (TEMRA Th) cells are important for the diagnosis of the patients in addition to clinical features. Analysis of protein by either WB or flow cytometry is required when the clinicians come across especially with missense LRBA variants of uncertain significance.

A key diagnostic of the  is insulin resistance in both peripheral tissues and brain, especially in the hypothalamus. Since the anorexigenic hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) regulates food intake in part by inhibiting the excitability of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons, we hypothesized that E2 would protect against insulin resistance in NPY/AgRP neurons with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Therefore, we did whole-cell recordings and single cell qPCR in arcuate NPYGFP neurons from both female and male mice to test the efficacy of insulin with DIO. The resting membrane potential and input resistance of NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly increased in DIO versus control-diet fed males. Most notably, the efficacy of insulin to activate KATP channels in NPY/AgRP neurons was significantly attenuated, although the KATP channel opener diazoxide was fully effective in NPY/AgRP neurons from DIO males, indicating that the KATP channels were expressed and functional. In contrast, insulin was fully efficacious to activate KATP channels in DIO females, and the response was reversed by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide. However, the ability of insulin to activate KATP channels was abrogated with ovariectomy but fully restored with E2 replacement. The insulin resistance in obese males was likely mediated by an increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), protein tyrosine phosphatase  (PTP1B) and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) activity since the expression of all three mRNAs were upregulated in the obese males but not in females. As proof of principle, pre-incubation of hypothalamic slices from DIO males with the PTP1B/TCPTP inhibitor CX08005 completely rescued the effects of insulin. Therefore, E2 protects NPY/AgRP neurons in females against insulin resistance through, at least in part, attenuating phosphatase activity. The neuroprotective effects of E2 may explain sex differences in the expression of  with aging.© 2019 S.

Increased levels of specific liver enzymes in the peripheral blood are typical findings in horses diagnosed with EMS. Current management of EMS is based on caloric restriction and increased physical activity. However, new potential treatment options are arising such as the transplantation of autologous adipose stem cells (ASC). However, cytophysiological properties of ASC derived from EMS horses are impaired which strongly limits their therapeutic potential. We hypothesized, that in vitro pharmacotherapy of those cells with 5-azacytidine (AZA) and resveratrol (RES) before their clinical application can reverse the aged phenotype of those cells and improve clinical outcome of autologous therapy. A 9 year old Dutch Warmblood Horse used for driving, was presented with severe obesity, insulin resistance. After EMS diagnosis, the animal received three intravenous injections of autologous, AZA/RES treated ASCs at weekly intervals.

The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models to explore the potential connection between HCC risk and MS. Cumulative incidences were plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves.After a 45,668.0 person-year follow-up (76.0±30.8 months) of 6,564 subjects who were seropositive for hepatitis  surface antigen (HBsAg), 89 incident HCC cases were identified. MS as a whole was independently associated with a 2-fold increased HCC risk (HR, 2.25, 95%CI: 1.41-3.60) after adjusting for age (in 1-year increment), gender, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, liver cirrhosis and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels. Subjects with 3 or more factors and those with one or two factors had adjusted increased HCC risks of 2.12-fold (95%CI: 1.16-3.89) and 1.28-fold (95%CI:0.74-2.22), respectively, in comparison to those without any  factors. Central obesity and type 2 diabetes were associated with significantly increased HCC risk, whereas this association was not observed in obese subjects (95%CI: 0.73-3.44).MS as a whole, central obesity and type 2 diabetes were independently associated with increased HCC risk in a population with HBV infection in mainland China.MS may be a risk factor for HCC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358770>ER-residential Nogo- accelerates NAFLD-associated HCC mediated by  reprogramming of oxLDL lipophagy.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the  that elevates the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although alteration of lipid metabolism has been increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer cells, the deregulated  modulation of HCC cells in the NAFLD progression remains obscure. Here, we discovers an endoplasmic reticulum-residential protein, Nogo-, as a highly expressed  modulator in both murine and human NAFLD-associated HCCs, which accelerates high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet-induced  dysfunction and tumorigenicity. Mechanistically, CD36-mediated oxLDL uptake triggers CEBPβ expression to directly upregulate Nogo-, which interacts with ATG5 to promote lipophagy leading to lysophosphatidic acid-enhanced YAP oncogenic activity. This CD36-Nogo--YAP pathway consequently reprograms oxLDL metabolism and induces carcinogenetic signaling for NAFLD-associated HCCs.

Despite this evidence, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects remain unclear. The aim of our study is to clarify the effects of BPF on the lipoprotein assembly and to identify oxidative stress biomarkers correlating hyperlipidaemia and BPF-induced  changes.Male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were randomly assigned to receive a standard diet, a hypercholesterolemic diet or a hypercholesterolemic diet+BPF (20 mg/Kg/rat daily, gavage), respectively, for 90 days. Total cholesterol (tChol), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and fasting plasma glucose were evaluated at the baseline as well as at the end of the treatment. To assess the effect of BPF on the Lipid Transfer Protein System, detection of ACAT, LCAT, CETP, PON1, Apo A1 and Apo  have also been carried out. Finally, the lipid peroxidation biomarker (TBARS) and oxyLDL were also measured.BPF prevented tChol, LDL-C, TG and fasting plasma glucose enhancement and improved HDL-C. Treatment of hyperlipæmic rats with BPF significantly restored altered the serum concentration of lipemic biomarkers and the activity of ACAT, LCAT, CETP and PON1, an effect accompanied by the concomitant normalization of Apo A1 and APO  levels. In addition, TBARS levels were reduced significantly by the treatment with BPF.BPF prevents diet-induced alteration of the lipid profile in rats, counteracting oxidative stress and improving the dysregulation of the Lipid Transfer Protein System. These data add new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of BPF in the therapy of hyperlipidaemia, thus suggesting a novel approach in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154657>A case of entecavir-induced Fanconi .</a></h2><p>Acquired Fanconi  has been associated with the long-term ingestion of several nucleoside analogs used to treat chronic hepatitis  virus infection. However, the nucleoside analog entecavir has not been found to cause nephrotoxicity. We report a case of entecavir-induced Fanconi . Our patient was a 73-year-old man admitted to our hospital because of renal dysfunction. He also presented with hyperaminoaciduria, renal diabetes, phosphaturia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, and hyperchloremic  acidosis, supporting a diagnosis of Fanconi . In this case, the cause of Fanconi  was most likely entecavir, which had been administered as needed depending on his renal function for 5 years. After drug discontinuation and replacement with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate therapy once a week, the patient's kidney function recovered and electrolyte anomalies partially improved. We highlight the fact that entecavir may induce severe renal dysfunction, which can cause the development of Fanconi ; therefore, close monitoring of proximal tubular function is recommended during entecavir therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306340>How to Treat Cytomegalovirus-induced Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis in a Child With Leukemia.</a></h2><p>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a  characterized by a hyperinflammatory state due to an aberrant activation of the immune cells.

Yet, the risk of erosive esophagitis among obese individuals without obesity-related  unhealthiness, a condition referred to as "metabolically healthy obese (MHO)", remains unclear. We examined the association between body mass index (BMI) categories and the development of erosive esophagitis in a cohort of metabolically healthy individuals.We conducted a cohort study of 14,725 asymptomatic adults free of erosive esophagitis and  abnormalities, who underwent repeated health checkups including screening endoscopy. A metabolically healthy state was defined as having no  components and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance <2.5. The presence of erosive esophagitis was determined using endoscopy.During 81,385.2 person-years of follow-up, 1,865 participants developed erosive esophagitis (incidence rate, 22.9 per 1,000 person-years). The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident erosive esophagitis comparing overweight (BMI 23.0-24.9) and obese (≥25) with normal-weight participants (18.5-22.9) were 1.12 (1.00-1.25) and 1.29 (1.14-1.47), respectively.

The association between waist circumference categories and the development of erosive esophagitis was also evident.In a large cohort of strictly defined metabolically healthy men and women, the MHO phenotype was associated with an increased incidence of erosive esophagitis, providing evidence that the MHO phenotype is not protective from gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620616>Pharmacologic therapy for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis focusing on pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>The paradigm of chronic liver diseases has been shifting. Although hepatitis  and C viral infections are still the main causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the introduction of effective antiviral drugs may control or cure them in the near future. In contrast, the burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing for decades, and 25 to 30% of the general population in Korea is estimated to have NAFLD. Over 10% of NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and HCC. NASH is currently the second leading cause to be placed on the liver transplantation list in the United States. NAFLD is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and . The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and insulin resistance. The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of NASH. Many pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop new drugs for the treatment of NASH. Some of them are in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233715>Glutamine confers renoprotection by normalizing lipid and glutathione content in insulin-resistant pregnant rats.</a></h2><p>Increasing consumption of fructose is a major contributor to epidemic  (MS), and the risk of renal disorders and/or injuries remains high among individuals with MS particularly during pregnancy. Glutamine (GLT) has been demonstrated to have a modulatory effect in MS and/or insulin resistance (IR). This study investigated the effect of GLT on renal lipid accumulation and glutathione depletion induced by high fructose-enriched drink (FED) in pregnant rats and also tested the hypothesis that the renoprotective role of GLT is by suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA)/xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA) pathway.Pregnant Wistar rats weighing between 160 and 180 g were allotted into Control, GLT, FED and FED + GLT groups (6 rats/group). The groups received distilled water (vehicle, p. o.), 1 g/kg bw GLT (p.o.), 10% Fructose (w/v) and 10% Fructose (w/v) plus 1 g/kg bw GLT (p.o.) respectively, daily for 19 days.Data showed that FED caused IR, increased body weight gain, blood glucose, plasma insulin, creatinine, urea, lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, lactate production, aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase, depressed Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, sodium-potassium-ATPase activities and glutathione. These alterations were accompanied by increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway. However, the FED-induced renal injury and its correlates were normalized by GLT supplementation.The present results demonstrate that renal lipid accumulation and glutathione depletion-driven renal injury in pregnant rats is accompanied by increased activity of ADA/XO/UA pathway. The findings also suggest that GLT would confer protection against renal injury by protecting against lipid accumulation and glutathionedepletion, at least in part, through suppression of ADA/XO/UA pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Upon admission, the patient experienced bilateral upper and lower limb weakness, which aggravated. He underwent nerve conduction study and was diagnosed with axonal neuropathy. Diagnosis of diffuse large -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was accomplished via biopsy of the mass lesion, with positive laboratory tests for anti-ganglioside antibodies. Based on these results, immune-mediated DLBCL-induced polyneuropathy was suspected, and chemotherapy (R-CHOP) was immediately started. Limb weakness improved and completely resolved. After six courses of R-CHOP, no evidence of DLBCL was observed on PET/CT (i.e., complete  remission). The patient lived without DLBCL relapse or neurological symptoms after remission.

PH due to LHD is often associated with  (MetS). In 12% to 13% of cases, patients with PH due to LHD display vascular remodeling of pulmonary arteries (PAs) associated with poor prognosis. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown; PH-targeted therapies for this group are nonexistent, and the development of a new preclinical model is crucial. Among the numerous pathways dysregulated in MetS, inflammation plays also a critical role in both PH and vascular remodeling.We hypothesized that MetS and inflammation may trigger the development of vascular remodeling in group 2 PH.Using supracoronary aortic banding, we induced diastolic dysfunction in rats. Then we induced MetS by a combination of high-fat diet and olanzapine treatment. We used metformin treatment and anti-IL-6 (interleukin-6) antibodies to inhibit the IL-6 pathway. Compared with sham conditions, only supracoronary aortic banding+MetS rats developed precapillary PH, as measured by both echocardiography and right/left heart catheterization. PH in supracoronary aortic banding+MetS was associated with macrophage accumulation and increased IL-6 production in lung. PH was also associated with STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation and increased proliferation of PA smooth muscle cells, which contributes to remodeling of distal PA. We reported macrophage accumulation, increased IL-6 levels, and STAT3 activation in the lung of group 2 PH patients. In vitro, IL-6 activates STAT3 and induces human PA smooth muscle cell proliferation. Metformin treatment decreased inflammation, IL-6 levels, STAT3 activation, and human PA smooth muscle cell proliferation. In vivo, in the supracoronary aortic banding+MetS animals, reducing IL-6, either by anti-IL-6 antibody or metformin treatment, reversed pulmonary vascular remodeling and improve PH due to LHD.We developed a new preclinical model of group 2 PH by combining MetS with LHD. We showed that MetS exacerbates group 2 PH. We provided evidence for the importance of the IL-6-STAT3 pathway in our experimental model of group 2 PH and human patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332392>Gut microbiota-bile acid-interleukin-22 axis orchestrates polycystic ovary .</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries, and is often accompanied by insulin resistance. The mechanism of ovulatory dysfunction and insulin resistance in PCOS remains elusive, thus limiting the development of therapeutics. Improved  health is associated with a relatively high microbiota gene content and increased microbial diversity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on the regulation of PCOS-associated ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance. Here, we report that Bacteroides vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut microbiota of individuals with PCOS, accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid levels. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from women with PCOS or . vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian functions, insulin resistance, altered bile acid metabolism, reduced interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS. This study suggests that modifying the gut microbiota, altering bile acid metabolism and/or increasing IL-22 levels may be of value for the treatment of PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653028>Noninvasive and Convenient Screening of  Using the Controlled Attenuation Parameter Technology: An Evaluation Based on Self-Paid Health Examination Participants.</a></h2><p>There is a medical need for an easy, fast, and non-invasive method for  (MetS) screening.

FibroScan can assess the level of liver fibrosis by using a liver stiffness score, and the level of liver steatosis by using the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. The logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve were applied to select significant predictors and assess their predictability. A final model that included all significant predictors that are found by univariate analysis, and a convenient model that excluded all invasive parameters were created.Of 1983 participants, 13.6% had a physical status that fulfilled MetS criteria. The results showed that the CAP score solely could achieve an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (0.76-0.82) in predicting MetS, and the AUC can be improved to 0.88 (0.85-0.90) in the final model. An AUC of 0.85 (0.83-0.88) in predicting MetS was obtained in the convenient model, which includes only 4 parameters (CAP score, gender, age, and BMI). A panel of predictability indices (the ranges of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio: 0.78-0.89, 0.66-0.82, 2.64-4.47, and 0.17-0.26) concerning gender- and BMI-specific CAP cut-off values (range: 191.65-564.95) were presented for practical reference.Two prediction systems were proposed for identifying individuals with a physical status that fulfilled the MetS criteria, and a panel of predictability indices was presented for practical reference. Both systems had moderate predictive performance.

This study aimed to assess the relationship between morphometric measurements of body condition and  hormone concentrations in ponies, with and without a neck crest or generalised obesity. Twenty-six ponies were assigned a body condition score (BCS) and cresty neck score (CNS). Height, girth, and neck measurements were taken. An oral glucose test (OGT; 0.75g dextrose/kg BW) was performed and blood samples collected prior to and 2 hours post dosing. Basal blood samples were analysed for blood glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride and leptin, and plasma HMW adiponectin concentrations. Post-prandial samples were analysed for serum insulin concentration. The ponies were grouped as having a) a normal to fleshy body status (BCS ≤7 and CNS ≤2; n = 10); ) having a high CNS, but without generalised obesity (BCS ≤7 and CNS ≥3; n = 11), or c) being obese (BCS ≥8 and CNS ≥1; n = 5). Responses to the OGT indicated that both normal and insulin-dysregulated ponies were included in the cohort. Post-prandial serum insulin was positively associated with CNS (P<0.035) and ponies with a CNS ≥ 3 had 5 times greater odds of being insulin-dysregulated. The high CNS group had a greater insulin response to the OGT than those in the normal/fleshy group (P = 0.006), whereas obese ponies did not differ from the other two groups. Basal HMW adiponectin was negatively correlated with post-prandial insulin concentrations (r = -0.5, P = 0.009), as well as being decreased in the group with a high CNS, compared to the obese group (P = 0.05). Cresty neck score was more predictive of insulin dysregulation than BCS, and this may be relevant to the diagnosis of EMS.

This study aimed to investigate the potential role of 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning for the quantitative assessment of SSc-related active ILD.18F-FDG PET/CT scans and high resolution CT scans of eight SSc patients, including five with ILD, were analysed. For comparison, reference groups were included: eight SLE patients and four primary Sjögren's  (pSS) patients, all without ILD. A total of 22 regions of interest were drawn in each patient at apical, medial and dorsobasal lung levels. 18F-FDG uptake was measured as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) in each region of interest. Subsequently, basal/apical (/A) and medial/apical (M/A) ratios were calculated at patient level (/A-p and M/A-p) and at tissue level (/A-t and M/A-t).SUVmean values in dorsobasal ROIs and /A-p ratios were increased in SSc with ILD compared with SSc without ILD (P = 0.04 and P = 0.07, respectively), SLE (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively) and pSS (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively). Increased uptake in the dorsobasal lungs and increased /A-t ratios corresponded to both ground glass and reticulation on high resolution CT.Semi-quantitative assessment of 18F-FDG PET/CT is able to distinguish ILD from non-affected lung tissue in SSc, suggesting that it may be used as a new biomarker for SSc-ILD disease activity.© The Author(s) 2019.

The effect of MetS on clinical outcome in patients with cerebrovascular disease remains largely unknown because conflicting results have been published. This study aimed to determine the influence of MetS on the occurrence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).All patients who underwent CEA between June 2003 and December 2014 in two tertiary academic referral centres in The Netherlands were included. MetS was defined if three or more of the following criteria were present: hypertension, obesity, high fasting serum blood glucose, high serum triglycerides, or low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of ipsilateral restenosis after index surgery. The secondary outcome measure was (all cause) mortality during follow up. For the primary analysis, missing data were multiply imputed using multivariable imputation by chained equations. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to perform an adjusted analysis on the multiply imputed data sets.A total of 1668 CEA procedures (in 1577 patients) were performed. The presence or absence of MetS could not be determined in 263 patients because of missing data. There was no significant difference in freedom from restenosis in the MetS group vs. the no-MetS group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.23; p = .10) or in all cause mortality (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.94-1.54; p = .14).This study shows that MetS does not predict restenosis after CEA. Also, the presence of MetS did not influence patient survival negatively.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier .V.

The favorable  effects of this diet were assessed in non-pregnant population but its impact during pregnancy remains to be evaluated.A retrospective cohort study comparing two groups. Group A comprised of women with singleton low-risk pregnancy adherent to paleolithic diet throughout gestation (n = 37). Group  comprised low risk pregnant women on a regular diet (n = 39). Women were excluded if they had low adherence to diet, started paleolithic diet during pregnancy, and had pre-gestational diabetes mellitus or other types of  such as pre gestational hyperlipidemia, hypertension or BMI > 35. Blood indices such as Glucose challenge test scores, hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSH levels were compared. Other pregnancy factors such as maternal weight gain, rest days during gestation and pregnancy complications such as IUGR, GDM or preeclampsia were compared. Lastly, obstetrical outcomes such as mode of delivery and complications such as high-grade tears, as well as neonatal factors such as birth weight and pH were compared between the two groups.General maternal characteristics such as age, BMI and parity were comparable between the two groups. Women who maintained a paleolithic diet had a significant decrease in glucose challenge test scores (95.8 mg/dL vs. 123.1 mg/dL, p < 0.01) and increase in hemoglobin levels (12.1 g/dL vs. 11.05 g/dL p < 0.01) and Ferritin (32.1 vs 21.3 mg/mL, p = 0.03) compared to women maintaining regular diet. Maternal pregnancy weight gain was also slightly decreased in group A (9.3Kg vs. 10.8 kg, p = 0.03). Birthweights were lower in group A (3098 g Vs.3275 g, p = 0.046) with no difference in adverse neonatal outcomes. We found no differences in other pregnancy complications or labor outcomes such as mode of delivery, shoulder dystocia or high grade perineal tears.Paleolithic diet maintained during pregnancy may have a beneficial effect on the glucose tolerance. It also may increase iron stores and hemoglobin levels. Neonates of women maintaining paleolithic diet are slightly lighter but appropriate for gestational age with no difference in neonatal outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The links between glucose deregulation and eventual mortal cardiac diseases are still being investigated. However, several reports have implicated elevated uric acid (UA) in the progression of  disorders especially during high-fructose diet. Also, butyrate (BUT) a short-chain fatty acid is being identified with intriguing therapeutic potentials in  disorders. We therefore hypothesized that high-fat diet-induced glucose deregulation and cardiac tissue damage are associated with elevated UA and attenuated by BUT in female rats. Twenty-four 10-week-old female Wistar rats with weights ranging from 135 to 150 g were treated with normal rat chow and distilled water (po) or sodium butyrate (200 mg/kg; po) or high-fat diet and distilled water (po) or high-fat diet and sodium butyrate. Treatments lasted for 6 weeks. Results showed that high-fat diet caused glucose dysmetabolism, elevated plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), corticosterone, malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma and cardiac UA, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). High-fat diet also led to depressed reduced glutathione (GSH). Histological analysis of cardiac tissue showed cellular infarction, infiltration, and fibrosis in high-fat diet-fed rats. However, all these effects were ameliorated by BUT treatment. The findings here showed that high-fat diet resulted in glucose dysmetabolism and cardiac tissue damage through a UA-dependent mechanism and that BUT can protect against high-fat diet-induced cardiometabolic disorders through UA suppression and augmentation of glutathione antioxidant defenses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199182>Dairy foods and health: an umbrella review of observational studies.</a></h2><p>Evidence on consumption of dairy foods and human health is contradictory. This study aimed to summarize the level of evidence of dairy consumption on various health outcomes. A systematic search for meta-analyses was performed: study design, dose-response relationship, heterogeneity and agreement of results over time, and identification of potential confounding factors were considered to assess the level of evidence. Convincing and probable evidence of decreased risk of colorectal cancer, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, elevated blood pressure and fatal stroke, respectively, was found for total dairy consumption; possible decreased risk of breast cancer, , stroke and type-2 diabetes, and increased risk of prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease was also found. Similar, yet not entirely consistent evidence for individual dairy products was reported. Among potential confounding factors, geographical localisation and fat content of dairy have been detected. In conclusions, dairy may be part of a healthy diet; however, additional studies exploring confounding factors are needed to ascertain the potential detrimental effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336134>Lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera protect against lithocholic acid-induced cholestasis by pregnane X receptor activation in mice.</a></h2><p>Cholestasis is a clinical  caused by toxic bile acid retention that will lead to serious liver diseases. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA) are the only two FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. Thus, there is a clear need to develop new therapeutic approaches for cholestasis. Here, anti-cholestasis effects of the lignans from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Schisandra sphenanthera, were investigated as well as the involved mechanisms.Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 9 groups including the control group, LCA group, LCA with specific lignan treatment of Schisandrin A (SinA), Schisandrin  (SinB), Schisandrin C (SinC), Schisandrol A (SolA), Schisandrol  (SolB), Schisantherin A (StnA) and Schisantherin  (StnB), respectively. Mice were treated with each drug (qd) for 7 days, while the administration of lithocholic acid (LCA) (bid) was launched from the 4th day. Twelve hours after the last LCA injection, mice were sacrificed and samples were collected. Serum biochemical measurement and histological analysis were conducted. Metabolomics analysis of serum, liver, intestine and feces were performed to study the  profile of bile acids. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the hepatic expression of genes and proteins related to bile acid homeostasis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to investigate the transactivation effect of lignans on human pregnane X receptor (hPXR). RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect induction effects of lignans on hPXR-targeted genes in HepG2 cells.Lignans including SinA, SinB, SinC, SolA, SolB, StnA, StnB were found to significantly protect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, as evidenced by significant decrease in liver necrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. More importantly, serum total bile acids (TBA) and total bilirubin (Tbili) were also significantly reduced. Metabolomics analysis revealed these lignans accelerated the metabolism of bile acids and increased the bile acid efflux from liver into the intestine or feces. Gene analysis revealed these lignans induced the hepatic expressions of PXR-target genes such as Cyp3a11 and Ugt1a1. Luciferase reporter gene assays illustrated that these bioactive lignans can activate hPXR. Additionally, they can all upregulate hPXR-regulate genes such as CYP3A4, UGT1A1 and OATP2.These results clearly demonstrated the lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera exert hepatoprotective effects against LCA-induced cholestasis by activation of PXR. These lignans may provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of cholestatic liver injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

However, consumption of dairy is decreasing and moving away from the advised level in many countries and the potential benefits of milk and dairy products for health have come under question. This, in spite that numerous studies report health benefits associated with dairy consumption. The present supplement aims to assess and summarize scientific evidence regarding the impact of dairy intake on health and all-cause mortality, and on the prevention of diverse chronic diseases, mainly from meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There seem to positive associations between moderate maternal milk intake during pregnancy and infant birth weight, length and bone mineral content during childhood. Moreover, consumption of dairy products in older subjects may reduce the risk of frailty and decrease the risk for sarcopenia. The highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with total osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture risk; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture was found. Analysis of the differences between high and low dairy consumption and for dose-response found no association between dairy product consumption and risk of all-cause mortality. Total and low-fat dairy consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing  and current evidence supports that consumption of dairy does not adversely affect the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and may even have a subtle protective effect. Moreover, evidence has been provided of an inverse association between the consumption of dairy products and ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Also, the evidence suggests that dairy consumption, particularly low-fat dairy and yogurt is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Likewise, moderate compared with medium consumption of dairy is associated lower risk for colorectal and bladder cancer and has no association with prostate cancer. Finally, consumption of milk or dairy products did not show a proinflammatory effect on healthy subjects, overweight/obese individuals, or individuals with other  abnormalities, and fortification of dairy products with phytosterols and ω-3 fatty acids seems to be a good approach to improve cardiometabolic risk biomarkers. In conclusion, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the present supplement support adequate milk consumption at various stages of life and in the prevention/control of various noncommunicable chronic diseases.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p></html>
