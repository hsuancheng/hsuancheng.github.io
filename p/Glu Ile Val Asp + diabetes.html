The current study is aimed at understanding the role of executioner caspase 6 on lamin A integrity in islet β-cells under duress of glucotoxic (20 mM glucose; 24 h) and diabetic conditions. Under glucotoxic conditions, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and metabolic cell viability were significantly attenuated in INS-1 832/13 cells. Further, exposure of normal human islets, rat islets and INS-1 832/13 cells to glucotoxic conditions leads to caspase 6 activation and lamin A degradation, which is also observed in islets from the Zucker diabetic fatty rat, a model for type 2  (T2D), and in islets from a human donor with T2D. Z-----fluoromethylketone, a specific inhibitor of caspase 6, markedly attenuated high glucose-induced caspase 6 activation and lamin A degradation, confirming that caspase 6 mediates lamin A degradation under high glucose exposure conditions. Moreover, Z-----fluoromethylketone, a known caspase 3 inhibitor, significantly inhibited high glucose-induced caspase 6 activation and lamin A degradation, suggesting that activation of caspase 3 might be upstream to caspase 6 activation in the islet β-cell under glucotoxic conditions. Lastly, we report expression of ZMPSTE24, a zinc metallopeptidase involved in the processing of prelamin A to mature lamin A, in INS-1 832/13 cells and human islets; was unaffected by high glucose. We conclude that caspases 3 and 6 could contribute to alterations in the integrity of nuclear lamins leading to metabolic dysregulation and failure of the islet β-cell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711271>Identification of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides from mare whey protein hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity is a promising strategy for treatment of type 2 . In the current study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identiﬁed from mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained by papain. The results showed that all the mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained at various hydrolysis durations possessed more potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared with intact whey protein. The 4-h hydrolysates showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.18 mg/mL. The 2 novel peptides from 4-h hydrolysate fractions separated by successive chromatographic steps were characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The novel peptides Asn-Leu----Leu-Arg and Thr-Gln-Met------Met--Lys-Phe-Arg, which corresponded to β-lactoglobulin 1 f(71-77) and β-lactoglobulin 1 f(143-155), demonstrated DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 86.34 and 69.84 μM, respectively. The DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the 2 peptides was retained or even improved after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro. Our findings indicate that mare whey protein-derived peptides may possess potential as functional food ingredients in the management of type 2 .Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Akt (protein kinase B) is a crucial signaling mediator for insulin. In the present study we examined the posttranslational mechanisms by which short-term (<6-h) exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to TNF-alpha decreases Akt levels. TNF-alpha treatment both increased the ubiquitination of Akt and decreased its protein level. The decrease in protein was associated with the presence of an (immunoreactive) Akt fragment after TNF-alpha treatment, indicative of Akt cleavage. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-(O-Me)-fluoromethyl ketone markedly suppressed these effects of TNF-alpha. The caspase-6 inhibitor Z--(OMe)--(OMe)-CH(2)F potently suppressed Akt ubiquitination, degradation, and fragment formation, whereas the proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO modestly attenuated the decline in Akt levels. Exposure to TNF-alpha also enhanced the association of Akt with an E3 ligase activity. Adipocytes preexposed to TNF-alpha for 5 h and then stimulated with insulin for 30 min exhibited decreased levels of Akt, phosphorylated Akt, as well as phosphorylated Mdm2, which is a known direct substrate of Akt, and glucose uptake. Caspase inhibition attenuated these inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha. Collectively, our results suggest that TNF-alpha induces the caspase-dependent degradation of Akt via the cleavage and ubiquitination of Akt, which results in its degradation through the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the caspase- and proteasome-mediated degradation of Akt due to TNF-alpha exposure leads to impaired Akt-dependent insulin signaling in adipocytes. These findings expand the mechanism by which TNF-alpha impairs insulin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12803541>Gamma III-crystallin is the primary target of glycation in the bovine lens incubated under physiological conditions.</a></h2><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for the way in which glucose and its metabolites cause cataract, retinopathy and other complications of , the most convincing being glycation. Glycation, the reaction of sugars with free amino groups of proteins, is one of a variety of non-enzymic post-translational modifications. The aim of the present study was to identify some of the most reactive proteins in the lens when incubated under physiological conditions. Fresh intact bovine lenses were incubated with [14C]glucose in a conventional tissue-culture medium with added antibiotics. After 3 and 6 days of incubation, the water-soluble proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions were separated by using a sugar affinity column (Affi-Gel 601). Then the radioactive fractions were identified on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the whole bovine lenses were incubated with 10 mM fructose and glucose for 3 and 6 days. The glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions in parallel with the radioactive fractions were separated by affinity chromatography, and were identified further by amino-acid sequencing. A progressive uptake of radioactive label showed that the majority of proteins incorporating both glucose and fructose were water-soluble fractions. Chromatography and SDS/polyacrylamide gel results showed that alpha- and gamma-crystallin and some proteins of a mean molecular mass of 36-37 kDa incorporated sugars early during incubation. After 6 days of incubation, more crystallins were glycated compared with 3 days, in particular beta-crystallin. Affinity-chromatography results indicated that proteins with subunit masses of 36 kDa and 20 kDa were possibly radiolabelled at an early stage. The purified glycated proteins following incubation with both glucose and fructose, which corresponded to 20 kDa and 36 kDa bands on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of both 20 kDa bands were Gly-Lys--Thr, characteristic of gamma-crystallins, but the N-termini of both 36 kDa bands were blocked. Further sequencing after digestion of 36 kDa bands with trypsin and running on HPLC revealed that the glucose sample gave the peptide sequences as Gly--Tyr-Pro--Tyr-Gln-Gln and Tyr--Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg, which match with bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin. The peptide sequence Tyr--Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg is only present in the published sequence of bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin and not in any other type of gamma-crystallin. The fructose sample gave the peptide sequences -Thr-Phe-Tyr---Arg, Arg-Gly--Tyr-Pro--Tyr-Gln-Gln-Trp, Gln-Tyr-Leu-Leu-Arg and ---Leu-Tyr, which all matched with bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. The sequence ---Leu-Tyr only appears in the sequence of bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. gammaIII-Crystallin is the most susceptible lens protein to glycation. The primary target of glucose is gammaIIIb-crystallin, whereas that of fructose is gammaIIIa-crystallin. The early glycation of gammaIII-crystallin by glucose and fructose could result in structural alterations, leading to aggregation of crystallin and eventually cataract formation.</p></html>
