Endotoxins are now well recognized as an important factor implicated in the onset and maintain of this inflammatory state during fat digestion in high-fat diet. As a preventive strategy, lipid formulation could be optimized to limit these phenomena, notably regarding fatty  profile and PL emulsifier content. Little is known about soybean polar lipid (SPL) consumption associated to oils rich in saturated FA vs. anti-inflammatory omega-3 FA such as α- on  and metabolic endotoxemia. We then investigated in mice the effect of different synthetic diets enriched with two different oils, palm oil or flaxseed oil and containing or devoid of SPL on adipose tissue  and endotoxin receptors. In both groups containing SPL, adipose tissue (WAT) increased compared with groups devoid of SPL and an induction of MCP-1 and LBP was observed in WAT. However, only the high-fat diet in which flaxseed oil was associated with SPL resulted in both higher WAT  and higher circulating sCD14 in plasma. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LPS transporters LBP and sCD14 and adipose tissue  can be modulated by SPL in high fat diets differing in oil composition. Notably high-flaxseed oil diet exerts a beneficial metabolic impact, however blunted by PL addition. Our study suggests that nutritional strategies can be envisaged by optimizing dietary lipid sources in manufactured products, including fats/oils and polar lipid emulsifiers, in order to limit the inflammatory impact of palatable foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

One theory reported an increase in endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF) as a predisposing factor. This work explored the effect of evening primrose oil (EPO), a source of prostaglandin E1, and forskolin (a cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulator) against the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib in mice. Lipopolysaccharide mouse model of endotoxemia was used to induce an upregulation of TF activity. Male mice received celecoxib (25 mg/kg), celecoxib plus EPO, or celecoxib plus forskolin for 4 weeks and then subjected to a prothrombotic challenge in the form of an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide. Results showed an increase in plasma TF activity, endothelial TF expression, and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) but lower antithrombin III (ATIII) level in mice that received celecoxib in comparison to those that received the vehicle. Adding EPO or forskolin to celecoxib regimen significantly decreased the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib. A positive correlation (r = 0.8501) was found between TF activity and TAT. Co-administration of EPO or forskolin decreased the activity of TF and mitigated the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib. Therefore, these combinations may have the utility to abrogate the prothrombotic adverse effect of celecoxib in clinical setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129737> is modulated by quantity and quality of dietary fat in older adults.</a></h1><p>Aging is an important determinant of the rate of atherosclerosis development, mainly through low-grade inflammation. Diet, and particularly its fat content, modulates the inflammatory response in fasting and postprandial states.We aimed to study the effects of dietary fat on  in healthy older adults.Twenty healthy older adults were randomized to three diets, lasting three-weeks each, using a crossover design: 1. A Mediterranean diet enriched in MUFA with virgin olive oil. 2. An SFA-rich diet. 3. A low-fat high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-3 PUFA (α- of plant origin) (CHO-PUFA diet). At the end of each period, after a 12-h fast, the subjects received a meal with a composition similar to the dietary period just completed. We determined the fasting and the postprandial plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP).In the fasting state, we observed lower LPS plasma levels after the consumption of the CHO-PUFA diet (P=0.046) in comparison with the consumption of the Med and SFA-rich diets. In the postprandial measurements, we observed a statistically significant increase in plasma levels of LPS (P=0.044) and a decrease in LBP (P=0.003) after the intake of the CHO-PUFA meal, whereas no postprandial changes were observed after the ingestion of the Med and SFA-rich meals.Our results, together with those obtained in a previous study, support the concept that the consumption of the Med Diet, in contrast to a low-fat PUFA diet, constitutes a more suitable dietary lifestyle for preventing the development of atherosclerosis in a population at risk, such as older adults.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Less is known about the effects of plant-derived n-3 PUFA, α- (ALA, 18:3n-3) and stearidonic  (SDA 18:4n-3), or n-6 PUFA linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) and arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6), especially in combination with an inflammatory stimulus, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), at a dose intended to mimic obesity-associated low-grade inflammation. To study this, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 100 μmol/L of various n-3 or n-6 PUFA with or without 10 ng/mL LPS for up to 24 h. AA in the presence of LPS synergistically increased (p < 0.05) pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion and gene expression, as well as COX-2 and TLR2 gene expression at 6 and/or 24 h, suggesting their potential roles in the synergistic effects of AA and LPS. Plant-derived fatty acids ALA, SDA, and LA did not differentially affect adipokine gene expression or secretion, whereas LPS-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1β expression and MCP-1 secretion was decreased (p < 0.05) by EPA, DHA, and/or EPA+DHA (50 μmol/L each) compared with LPS alone. Only DHA increased (p < 0.05) gene expression of the n-3 PUFA receptor GPR120 and simultaneously decreased LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB activation compared with control. Our findings emphasize that specific fatty acids within the n-3 or n-6 PUFA class warrant consideration in the development of nutritional strategies to improve obesity-associated inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935107>Essential Fatty Acids Linoleic  and α- Sex-Dependently Regulate Glucose Homeostasis in Obesity.</a></h1><p>To assess the associations of dietary linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in a population-based cohort and further explore the mechanism of action in a high-fat-diet (HFD) induced obese (DIO) mouse model.The occurrence of T2D among 15 100 Chinese adults from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, 1997-2011) were followed up for a median of 14 years. The relations of ALA and LA intakes with T2D risk were modified by BMI, with significant associations restricted to obese/overweight subjects. Among them, relative risks (95% confidence intervals) comparing extreme quartiles of intakes were 0.55 (0.32-0.93) in men and 0.53 (0.34-0.85) in women for ALA, while 0.71 (0.41-1.16) in men and 0.56 (0.36-0.89) in women for LA. DIO mice were fed with LA- or ALA-enriched HFD (0.2% wt wt ) for 15 weeks and then significant sex-dependent changes of gut microbiota were detected. , systematic and adipose inflammation were relieved in ALA-fed male and LA-fed female mice.Long-term intake of LA (for women) and ALA may have a protective effect on T2D development for obese/overweight subjects through sex-specific gut microbiota modulation and gut-adipose axis.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

High-fat diets have been implicated in reduced gut microbiota richness, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and several changes at family, genus and species levels. Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and conjugated  fatty acids share important pathways of immune system activation/inhibition with gut microbes, modulating obesogenic and proinflammatory profiles. Mechanisms that link dietary fat, gut microbiota and obesity are mediated by increased intestinal permeability, systemic endotoxemia, and the activity of the endocannabinoid system. Although the probiotic therapy could be a complementary strategy to improve gut microbiota composition, it did not show permanent effects to treat fat-induced dysbiosis. Based upon evidence to date, we believe that high-fat diets and SFA consumption should be avoided, and MUFA and omega-3 PUFA intake should be encouraged in order to regulate gut microbiota and , promoting body weight/fat control.</p></html>
