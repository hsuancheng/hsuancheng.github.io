The mainstay of treatment is a specialized very-low-fat diet. Even adhering to the diet, some patients may experience high triglycerides and pancreatitis. There currently are no comprehensive dietary guidelines.To report best practices and develop comprehensive dietary guidelines for nutrition therapy in patients with FCS.Registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) convened to develop this report based on experience treating patients with FCS and a review of current literature on the topic. One author provided a patient perspective of living with FCS.This report provides guidelines and rationales for nutrition therapy associated with FCS across the life span. The top global guidelines are to (1) limit fat to <15 to 20 g per day (<10%-15% of total daily energy intake); (2) meet recommendations for essential fatty acids: α- and linoleic ; (3) choose complex carbohydrate foods while limiting simple and refined carbohydrate foods; (4) supplement with fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and medium-chain triglyceride oil, as needed; (5) adjust calories for weight management. Recommended foods include vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean protein foods, fruits in limited amounts, and fat-free milk products without added sugars. Foods to avoid include alcohol and products high in sugar.These patient-centered nutrition guidelines provide guidance to help patients adhere to the recommended diet and optimize nutritional needs.Copyright © 2018 National Lipid Association.

The effect of milled flaxseed and storage (-20 °C for 1 and 6 months) of banana and cinnamon muffins on sensory attribute intensities, selected physical properties, bioactive concentrations, and acceptability by two groups - clinical trial participants and consumers - was investigated.The addition of flax increased flax aroma and flavor, sour aroma, and cohesiveness of mass and brown color, and decreased sweet aroma and flavor, banana and cinnamon aroma and flavor, springiness and mouth dryness.  and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were significantly increased when flax was increased from 20 to 30 g. Clinical trial participants generally found the muffins more acceptable than the consumers. Consumers reported significantly decreased acceptability when flax at any level was added to muffins, with 30 g the least acceptable.Muffins with 20 g flaxseed generally had higher mean acceptability values compared to muffins with 30 g. Neither flavoring nor storage at -20 °C for 6 months appreciably changed muffin attributes or acceptability. Future work will optimize the ingredients as well as the amount of flax needed to provide the required amount of bioactive to positively affect LDL cholesterol level and to produce acceptable muffins. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27260465>A conjugated fatty  present at high levels in bitter melon seed favorably affects lipid metabolism in hepatocytes by increasing NAD(+)/NADH ratio and activating PPARα, AMPK and SIRT1 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>α-Eleostearic  (α-ESA), or the cis-9, trans-11, trans-13 isomer of conjugated , is a special fatty  present at high levels in bitter melon seed oil. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of α-ESA on hepatic lipid metabolism. Using H4IIEC3 hepatoma cell line, we showed that α-ESA significantly lowered intracellular triglyceride accumulation compared to α- (LN), used as a fatty  control, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effects of α-ESA on enzyme activities and mRNA profiles in H4IIEC3 cells suggested that enhanced fatty  oxidation and lowered lipogenesis were involved in α-ESA-mediated triglyceride lowering effects. In addition, α-ESA triggered AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation without altering sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein levels. When cells were treated with vehicle control (VC), LN alone (LN; 100μmol/L) or in combination with α-ESA (LN+α-ESA; 75+25μmol/L) for 24h, acetylation of forkhead box protein O1 was decreased, while the NAD(+)/NADH ratio, mRNA levels of NAMPT and PTGR1 and enzyme activity of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase were increased by LN+α-ESA treatment compared to treatment with LN alone, suggesting that α-ESA activates SIRT1 by increasing NAD(+) synthesis and NAD(P)H consumption. The antisteatosis effect of α-ESA was confirmed in mice treated with a high-sucrose diet supplemented with 1% α-ESA for 5weeks. We conclude that α-ESA favorably affects hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing cellular NAD(+)/NADH ratio and activating PPARα, AMPK and SIRT1 signaling pathways.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The Australian Eating Survey (AES) Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was adapted to include foods with cardio-protective properties (CVD-AES). The aims were to estimate dietary fatty  (FA) intakes derived from the CVD-AES and AES and compare them with red blood cell (RBC) membrane FA content.Dietary intake was measured using the semi-quantitative 120-item AES and 177-item CVD-AES. Nutrient intakes were calculated using AUSNUT 2011-2013. Fasting RBC membrane FAs were assessed using gas chromatography. Extent of agreement between intakes estimated by AES or CVD-AES and RBC membrane composition (% of total FAs) for linoleic  (LA),  (ALA), eicosapentanoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients, adjusted linear regressions and Kappa statistics.Data from 39 participants (72% female, 59.3±11.1 years) indicate stronger positive correlations between RBC membrane FAs and CVD-AES dietary estimates compared with the AES. Significant (P<0.05) moderate-strong correlations were found between CVD-AES FAs and FA proportions in RBC membranes for EPA (r=0.62), DHA (r=0.53) and DPA (r=0.42), with a moderate correlation for LA (r=0.39) and no correlation with ALA. Significant moderate correlations were found with the AES for DHA (r=0.39), but not for LA, ALA, EPA or DPA.The CVD-AES provides a more accurate estimate of long chain FA intakes in hyperlipidaemic adults, compared with AES estimates. This indicates that a CVD-specific FFQ should be used when evaluating FA intakes in this population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26047766>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</a></h2><p>& aims: Few clinical trials have addressed the potential benefits of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). We evaluated the effects of supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs from flaxseed and fish oils in patients with biopsy-proven .Patients received three capsules daily, each containing 0.315 g of omega-3 PUFAs (64%  [ALA], 16% eicosapentaenoic [EPA], and 21% docosahexaenoic [DHA] acids; n-3 group, n = 27) or mineral oil (placebo group, n = 23). Liver biopsies were evaluated histopathologically by the  activity score (NAS). Plasma levels of omega-3 PUFAs were assessed as a marker of intake at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Secondary endpoints included changes in plasma biochemical markers of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and liver function at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment.At baseline, NAS was comparable between the groups (p = 0.98). After intervention with omega-3 PUFAs, plasma ALA and EPA levels increased (p ≤ 0.05). However in the placebo group, we also observed increased EPA and DHA (p ≤ 0.05), suggesting an off-protocol intake of PUFAs. NAS improvement/stabilization was correlated with increased ALA in the n-3 group (p = 0.02) and with increased EPA (p = 0.04) and DHA (p = 0.05) in the placebo group. Triglycerides were reduced after 3 months in the n-3 group compared to baseline (p = 0.01).In  patients, the supplementation of omega-3 PUFA from flaxseed and fish oils significantly impacts on plasma lipid profile of patients with . Plasma increase of these PUFAs was associated with better liver histology. (ID 01992809).Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The main goal of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the perilla oil rich in  (ALA) against  and gain a deep insight into its potential mechanisms. Rats were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFD) supplement with perilla oil (POH) for 16 weeks. Routine blood biochemical tests and histological staining illustrated that the perilla oil administration improved HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, reduced hepatic steatosis, and inhibited hepatic inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. Perilla oil also increased fecal bile  and cholesterol excretion. Hepatic RNA-Seq analysis found that the long time perilla oil supplement notably modified the gene expression involved in cholesterol metabolism. Our results implicate that, after long-term high level dietary cholesterol feeding, rat liver endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and cholesterol-rich low density lipoprotein uptake was significantly inhibited, and perilla oil did not modulate expression of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis but did increase cholesterol removed from hepatocytes by conversion to bile acids and increased fecal cholesterol excretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246731>A common variant in ARHGEF10 alters delta-6 desaturase activity and influence susceptibility to hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>Numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with fatty  desaturase activities have been previously identified within the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster, which encodes delta-5 (D5D) and delta-6 (D6D) desaturases, respectively.We aimed at further characterizing the genetic variability associated with D5D and D6D activities on a genome-wide scale.We conducted a genome-wide association study of D5D and D6D activities in a cohort of 141 individuals from the greater Quebec City metropolitan area using the Illumina HumanOmni5-Quad BeadChip. Estimates of D5D and D6D activities were computed using product-to-precursor fatty  ratios, arachidonic  (AA)/dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) for D5D, and DGLA/linoleic  (LA) for D6D. Levels of fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography in plasma phospholipids.We identified 24 previously reported SNPs associated with fatty  levels and desaturase activities as significantly associated with D5D activity within the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster (lead SNP rs174566/A>G). Furthermore, we identified 5 novel loci potentially associated with D5D activity at chromosomes 1, 6, 4, 8 and 19. A novel SNP associated with D6D activity and mapped to the ARHGEF10 locus (rs2280885/A>G) was identified, with carriers of the rare allele showing a significant increase in D6D activity and plasma triglyceride levels. After multiple testing correction by permutation, only rs174566 and rs2280885 remained significantly associated to D5D and D6D activity estimates, respectively.These results confirm previous genetic associations within the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster with D5D activity. A novel genetic variation associated with higher D6D activity within the ARHGEF10 gene is potentially altering plasma triglyceride levels.Copyright © 2017 National Lipid Association.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance, and is usually accompanied by hypertension, , atherosclerosis (i.e., the metabolic syndrome, or syndrome X), and polycystic ovarian disease. This study aimed to investigate the effect of GPSO on T2DM hepatic lipid metabolism and the underlying mechanism involving level of protein expression. In the experiment, the model of T2DM was established. Kunming male mice were fed with a high-fat diet and injected with streptozocin, in which the exploration of detailed mechanism in the therapy of T2DM was targeted. The results showed that the ability of oral glucose tolerance was improved in the GPSO group. Biochemical indices also revealed that GPSO had a positive effect on hypoglycemic activity, suggesting that GPSO could promote the expression of glucose transporter 4 in liver and skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507616>Fatty  and cholesterol profiles and hypocholesterolemic, atherogenic, and thrombogenic indices of table eggs in the retail market.</a></h2><p>Eggs are an important source of food due to its favorable effects on human health derived from the protein, fats, minerals, vitamins and bioactive components. We studied the effects of source of eggs in the retail market on fatty acids, lipid profiles and antioxidant status in eggs.Eggs from four sources named A, B, C, and D in the retail market were collected to determine fatty , total lipid, and cholesterol profiles; hypocholesterolemic, atherogenic and thrombotic indices; antioxidant status (e.g., of malondialdehyde); and total antioxidant capacity in the whole edible parts of eggs (albumen + yolk) and egg yolk. Samples were collected four times and pooled over times to represent 5 and 10 samples per source for determinations of fatty acids and determinations of lipid profiles and antioxidant status, respectively.Fatty , total lipid, and cholesterol profiles; hypocholesterolemic, atherogenic and thrombotic indices; presence of malondialdehyde; and total antioxidant capacity in the whole edible parts of eggs and egg yolk showed significant differences (P ≥ 0.05) among different sources of eggs in retail market. Source D showed higher levels of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and linoleic and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA)/polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) ratio but lower levels of MUFA and , arachidonic, eicosapentaeonic (EPA), decohexaenoic (DHA), and total ω9 fatty acids and lower unsaturated fatty acids (UFA)/SFA ratio. Similar trend was shown in fatty acids profiles of the whole edible parts of eggs. On the other hand, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), LDL/high density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, and atherogenic and thrombogenic indices and total antioxidant capacity of source D were significantly higher than those of other source, but levels of hypocholesterolemic index, and malondialdehyde levels were lower for source D.Eggs in the retail market in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia, from May to August 2015 showed a different pattern of fatty  and cholesterol profiles; hypocholesterolemic, atherogenic, and thrombogenic indices; and antioxidant status, which might reflect the nutritional and husbandry practice of laying hens.

We investigated both the independent and combined effects of exercise training and ALA consumption in obese Zucker rats, aiming to determine the potential for additive improvements in cardiovascular function. ALA and exercise training independently improved cardiac output, end-diastolic volume, left ventricular fibrosis and mean blood pressure following a 4 week intervention. Combining ALA and endurance exercise yielded greater improvements in these parameters, independent of changes in markers of oxidative stress or endogenous anti-oxidants. We postulate that divergent mechanisms of action may explain these changes: ALA increases peripheral vasodilation, and exercise training stimulates angiogenesis.Although α- (ALA) and endurance exercise training independently attenuate -related cardiovascular derangements, there is a paucity of information pertaining to their mechanisms of action and efficacy when combined as a preventative therapeutic approach. Therefore, we used obese Zucker rats to investigate the independent and combined effects of these interventions on cardiovascular disease. Specifically, animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control diet-sedentary, ALA supplemented-sedentary, control diet-exercise trained or ALA supplemented-exercise trained. Following a 4 week intervention, although the independent and combined effects of ALA and exercise reduced (P < 0.05) the serum free/esterified cholesterol ratio, only the ALA supplemented-exercise trained animals displayed a reduction in the content of both serum free and esterified cholesterol. Moreover, although ALA and endurance training individually increased cardiac output, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume, as well as reduced left ventricle fibrosis, mean blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, these responses were all greater following the combined intervention (ALA supplemented-exercise trained). These effects occurred independent of changes in oxidative phosphorylation proteins, markers of oxidative stress or endogenous anti-oxidant capacity. We propose that the beneficial effects of a combined intervention occur as a result of divergent mechanisms of action elicited by ALA and endurance exercise because only exercise training increased the capillary content in the left ventricle and skeletal muscle, and tended to decrease protein carbonylation in the left ventricle (P = 0.06). Taken together, our data indicate that combining ALA and endurance exercise provides additional improvements in cardiovascular disease risk reduction compared to singular interventions in the obese Zucker rat.© 2017 The Authors.

Positive effects of diet, polyenic fatty acids, statins and fibrates.]</a></h2><p>Inhibition of hydrolysis of palmitic and oleic triglycedires (TG) in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), slow formation of active apoВ-100 conformation, blockade of апоЕ/В-100 ligand formation in VLDL and their reduced uptake by insulin-dependent cells cause hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). Palmitic and oleic VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty acids (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA. It seems highly unlikely that the xeobiotics statins, fibrates and probucol produce pleiotropic biological effects in vivo. These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins. It is reasonable to suggest that all preparations which act according to the same algorithm activate TG hydrolysis in VLDL and normalize cellular uptake of PFA in linoleic and  LDL via apoВ-100 endocytosis. Atherosclerosis is a syndrome of cellular deficiency of essential polyenic FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294699>Chia Oil-Enriched Restructured Pork Effects on Oxidative and Inflammatory Status of Aged Rats Fed High Cholesterol/High Fat Diets.</a></h2><p>Chia oil has the highest recognized α- (ALA) content. ALA is associated with beneficial changes in plasma lipids and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Present article aims to analyze the effect of Chia oil-enriched restructured pork (RP) on aged rats in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () model. Groups of six male Wistar rats (1-year old) were fed the experimental diets: control RP diet (C) noncholesterol high saturated; cholesterol-enriched high-saturated fat/high-cholesterol control RP diet (HC) with added cholesterol and cholic ; and Chia oil- or Hydroxytyrosol RP cholesterol-enriched high-saturated fat/high cholesterol (CHIA and HxT). Total cholesterol, hepatosomatic index, Nrf2, antioxidant, and inflammation markers were determined. CHIA reduced the hypercholesterolemic effect by lowering levels similar to C; also, ameliorated redox index. CHIA, despite high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content, reduced thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and induced the lowest SOD protein synthesis but not a reduction on its activity. Chia oil activated the Nrf2 to arrest the pro-oxidative response to cholesterol and aging. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) system was lower in HxT than in CHIA, suggesting its antiatherogenic activity and related protective effect against high PUFA. Increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was partially blocked by CHIA. Chia oil has the ability to prevent oxidative damage and modify the inflammatory response, suggesting adequate regulation of the antioxidant system. Results stress the importance of incorporating ALA into the diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802571>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids improve endothelial function in humans at risk for atherosclerosis: A review.</a></h2><p>Epidemiology studies and clinical trials show that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can prevent atherosclerotic morbidity and evidence suggests this may be mediated by improving endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by reduced vasodilation and a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic state, and is an early pathological event in the development of atherosclerosis. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a gold standard for assessing endothelial dysfunction, is a predictor of future cardiovascular events and coronary heart disease risk. Notably, risk factors for endothelial dysfunction include classic risk factors for atherosclerosis: Elevated lipids, diabetes, hypertension, elevated BMI, cigarette smoking, and metabolic syndrome. In this paper, we review the ability of n-3 PUFAs to improve endothelial dysfunction in individuals with classic risk factors for atherosclerosis, but lacking diagnosed atherosclerotic disease, with the goal of identifying those individuals that might gain the most vasoprotection from n-3 PUFA supplements. We include trials using eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or  (ALA) alone, or EPA+DHA; and assessing endothelial function by FMD, forearm blood flow, or peripheral arterial tonometry. We found that n-3 PUFAs improved endothelial dysfunction in 16 of 17 studies in individuals with , elevated BMI, metabolic syndrome, or that smoked cigarettes, but only in 2 of 5 studies in diabetics. Further, these trials showed that use of EPA+DHA consistently improve endothelial dysfunction; ALA-enriched diets appear promising; but use of EPA or DHA alone requires further study. We conclude that individuals with , elevated BMI, metabolic syndrome, or that smoke could derive vaosprotective benefits from EPA+DHA supplementation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The beneficial effect of whole grain dietary flaxseed was evaluated experimentally in high cholesterol diet (HCD)-fed Wistar albino rats.Male Wistar albino rats (200 g) were divided into four groups of 12 rats each. Group I rats kept as control and given basal rat chew diet, Group II as positive control for induction of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis by addition of 1% cholesterol and 15% saturated edible oil to the 1000 g of standard rat chew diet (HCD), Group III rats fed with whole grain flaxseed powder at 7.5 g/kg of rat/day in the standard rat chew diet and kept as flaxseed control, and Group IV rats supplemented with flaxseed at 7.5 g/kg of rat/day along with HCD and maintained for 90 days.Group II rats revealed significantly (p<0.05) higher total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very LDL-C and significantly (p<0.05) reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), whereas tissue antioxidants such as catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S transferase (GST) were significantly (p<0.05) reduced, and lipid peroxidation products of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) level were nonsignificantly (p<0.05) increased in the heart and liver tissues. Flaxseeds supplementation along with HCD significantly ameliorated the serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C along with cellular antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, SOD, GPx, GR, GST, and non-significant amelioration of TBARS in the heart and liver tissues compared to Group II rats. Majority of the histopathologically initiated atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and fatty change in the liver of Group II were not observed in the flaxseed supplemented Group IV; however, interestingly proliferation of endothelial cells with new vascular channel formation in the liver and in between cardiac muscle fibers was observed in Group I and Group IV rats.The present study established the hypercholesterolemia with initiated atherosclerotic lesion in the aorta but unable to establish the atheromatous plaque in the aorta. Flaxseed supplementation along with HCD showed significant antihypercholesterolemic effect and ameliorated the changes of initiated atherosclerosis in the aorta.

Chemical analysis revealed that PSO was characterized by an uncommon high portion of - (>38%), fairly low ratio of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (0.69), and much higher content of -tocopherol than various conventional seed oils.  assay indicated that PSO is a more potent scavenger of free radicals than extra virgin olive oil. Moderate intake of PSO exhibited obvious protection against various oxidative damages such as tetrachloromethane-induced acute liver injury in mice and diet-induced  in rats. The changes in the key indicators of oxidative injury and fatty  composition in the liver caused by PSO administration were measured, and the results demonstrated that antioxidant properties of PSO are closely related to their characteristic chemical composition.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the acute and short-term effects of walnut intake on changes in microvascular function and the relationship of these effects to plasma epoxides, the cytochrome-P450-derived metabolites of fatty acids. Thirty-eight hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women were randomized to 4 weeks of 5 g or 40 g of daily walnut intake. All outcomes were measured after an overnight fast and 4 h after walnut intake. Microvascular function, assessed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI), was the primary outcome measure, with serum lipids and plasma epoxides as secondary measures. Compared to 5 g of daily walnut intake, consuming 40 g/d of walnuts for 4 weeks increased the RHI and Framingham RHI. Total cholesterol and low- and high-density cholesterol did not significantly change after walnut intake. The change in RHI after 4 weeks of walnut intake was associated with the change in the sum of plasma epoxides (r=0.65, P=.002) but not with the change in the sum of plasma hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. Of the individual plasma epoxides, arachidonic--derived 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic  was most strongly associated with the change in microvascular function (r=0.72, P<.001). These data support the concept that the intake of walnut-derived fatty acids can favorably affect plasma epoxide production, resulting in improved microvascular function.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

CONSUMPTION ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN HUMANS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.</a></h2><p>chia is a seed rich in such nutrients as proteins, n-3 fatty acids and especially  (ALA), minerals, fibers and antioxidants. Efforts have been made to assess whether human consumption of chia can reduce cardiovascular risk factors; however, it has not been established as effective and the findings of the few studies to have looked into the matter are inconsistent.to systematize the findings of studies assessing the effect the consumption of chia seed, either milled or whole, has in the prevention/control of cardiovascular risk factors in humans.this is a systematic literature review (SLR) with no meta-analysis. The articles scrutinizedwere identified in the electronic databases Lilacs, Medline (Pub- Med version), Cochrane, Scielo, Scopus, and Web of Science under the keywords"dyslipidemia" or "dislipidemia", "" or "hiperlipidemia", "obesity" or "obesidade", "salvia"or"salviahispanica", "Lamiaceae" or "chia", "hypertension" or "hipertensão", "hypertrygliceridemia" or "hipertrigliceridemia", and "riscocardiovascular" or "cardiovascularrisk." We chose for our selection English-, Portuguese- or Spanish-language articles about clinical trials on humans and published within the last ten years. The biases of risk analysis were carried out considering 6 of the 8 criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.seven studies (n = 200) fit our inclusion criteria. Of the chosen clinical trials, only one was not randomized. Five of the studies were blind experiments. Two of the studies were acute trials, both of them randomized. Of the chia seed interventions, one study showed a significant drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and inflammatory markers, yet there was no change in body mass, lipid profile or blood sugar. In four of the studies reviewed there was a significant spike in ALA and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), with no significant change to other parameters. In the acute trials, post-prandial blood sugar was significantly lower. Only one study showed a significant drop in triglycerides (TG), body mass and inflammatory markers; however, the chia seed in that case was mixed with other foods. Most of the studies showed unclear or low risk of bias. Two studies showed a high risk of bias because not all the pre-specified primary outcomes were reported in the findings.most of the studies did not demonstrate statistically significant results in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors are insufficient, and the studies included in this review present numerous limitations. Further research is hence needed.Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014. Published by AULA MEDICA.

To investigate its antihyperlipidemic effect, a crude lipophilic extract and the composing compounds were isolated and fractioned from the petroleum ether extract of aerial parts of  using column chromatography on silica gel. The anti- effect was studied in a rat model of acute , which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (), palmitic  (), oleic  (), linoleic  (),  () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic  were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute  model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and  (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively). These compounds (i.e., chamazulene, acetylenes (E)-2, and ) were considered to be responsible for the bioactive antihyperlipidemic effect. In conclusion, the crude lipid extract of Artemisia integrifolia L could be used as a potential treatment to avert .

We have developed an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS) method for comprehensive profiling and quantification of FAHFAs. Through optimization of the chromatographic conditions, most FAHFA isomers can be efficiently separated and quantified in 29 min with excellent peak shape and good robustness. UPLC coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS was used for identification of FAHFAs based on the high-resolution m/z values and the fragmentation rules. Sixty-four FAHFAs, belonging to 17 different families, were identified in white adipose tissue (WAT) of golden hamsters. Nine of the 17 FAHFA family members were newly discovered in this work, and linoleic  and  were newly found fatty  moieties of FAHFAs. The total number of FAHFAs identified from WAT in this work is far larger than that in any previously reported work. The parameters (precursor ions, product ions, and collision energy) of the 64 FAHFAs identified in golden hamster WAT by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS were further used in UPLC coupled with triple-quadrupole (QQQ) MS for quantification in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Finally, this newly developed UPLC/QQQ-MS method was used for the quantification of FAHFAs in hamster WAT attached to epididymis, kidney, intestine, and inguen to explore the disturbance of the levels of WAT FAHFAs in the pathological state of . The regulation effects of fenofibrate on the levels of WAT FAHFAs were also investigated. The results show that fenofibrate therapy can increase the concentration of FAHFAs in WAT.

They are unlikely capable to manifest pleiotropic effect. It is feasible to evaluate effect of statins by stages: a) initially a specific inhibition of synthesis of cholesterol alcohol; b) further indirect activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density; c) nonspecific activation of cells' receptor absorption of palmitic and oleic lipoproteins of very low density and then d) linoleic and  lipoproteins of low density with all polyenoic fatty acids. On balance, statins activate absorption ofpolyenoic fatty acids by cells. Just they manifest physiological, specific pleiotropic effect. The statins inhibit synthesis of pool of cholesterol alcohol-lipoproteins of very low density condensed between phosphatidylcholines in polar mono-layer phosphatidylcholines+cholesterol alcohol on surface oftriglycerides. The low permeability of mono-layer separates substrate-triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density and post-heparin lipoprotein lipase in hydrophilic blood plasma. The higher is ratio cholesterol alcohol/phosphatidylcholines in mono-layer of lipoproteins of very low density the slower is lipolysis, formation of ligand lipoproteins of very low density and their absorption by cells under apoB-100-endocytosis. The statins normalize hyperlipemia by force of a) activation of absorption oflipoproteins of very low density by insulin-depended cells and b) activation of absorption of lipoproteins of low density by all cells, increasing of bio-availability of polyenoic fatty acids, activation of apoB-100-endocytosis. The limitation in food of content of palmitic saturated fatty  and increasing of content of ω-3 polyenoic fatty acids improve "bio-availability" of polyenoic fatty acids and their absorption by cells and also decreases cholesterol alcohol/phosphatidylcholines and biological pleiotropic effect of essential polyenoic fatty acids. According our opinion, atherosclerosis is intracellular deficiency of polyenoic fatty acids. The value of cholesterol alcohol-lipoproteins of low density is equimolar to content of lipoproteins of low density in blood which under low bio-availability can't to absorb cells byforce of apoB-100-endocytosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26671157>Correlation between the serum eicosapentanoic -to-arachidonic  ratio and the severity of cerebral white matter hyperintensities in older adults with memory disorder.</a></h2><p>The relationships of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), to stroke and cardiovascular events have been studied extensively. The present study was undertaken to analyze the relationships of the severity of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) to the blood polyunsaturated fatty acids level and the ratio of serum EPA level to the serum arachidonic  (AA) level (EPA/AA ratio) among older adults.A total of 150 patients underwent diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging and blood sampling under the fasting state. In regard to WMH, the periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The serum docosahexaenoic , EPA, AA, dihomo-γ- and EPA/AA ratio were compared in relation to the grade of severity of WMH. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis was carried out with age, sex and atherosclerosis risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, , smoking status) as the covariables, serum polyunsaturated fatty acids level as an independent variable and Fazekas grade as the dependent variable.A rise of the periventricular hyperintensities grade was associated with a significant reduction of the mean EPA level (P < 0.05) and EPA/AA ratio (P < 0.05). The multiple regression analysis identified a significant negative correlation between the periventricular hyperintensities grade and the serum EPA/AA ratio (β = -0.215, P < 0.05).These results suggest that the serum EPA/AA ratio have an important role in the formation and progression of WMH.© 2015 Japan Geriatrics Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743332>Effect of Increasing Doses of Linoleic and α- Acids on High-Fructose and High-Fat Diet Induced Metabolic Syndrome in Rats.</a></h2><p>Doses and ratio of linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) preventing metabolic syndrome (MS) were investigated.

Perilla oil (PO) is a vegetable oil rich in α- (ALA), an n-3 PUFA. In this study, antiatherogenic effects and related mechanisms of PO were investigated in atherosclerotic mice. Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice (male, n = 27) were fed high-cholesterol and high-fat diets containing 10 % w/w lard (LD), PO, or sunflower oil (SO) for 10 weeks. Plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations reduced in the PO and SO groups compared to the concentrations in the LD group (P < 0.05). The PO group showed reduced fatty streak lesion size at the aortic sinus (P < 0.05) compared to the sizes in the LD and SO groups. A morphometric analysis showed enhancement of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the PO group compared to that in the LD group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, aortic protein expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 was diminished in the PO group compared to that in the LD and SO groups (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that PO inhibited the development of aortic atherosclerosis by improving the plasma lipid profile, regulating nitric oxide synthase, and suppressing the vascular inflammatory response in the aorta of ApoE KO mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856006>Comparative effects of plant oils on the cerebral hemorrhage in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>Since oils and fats can induce metabolic syndrome, leading to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, the present study was performed to find out whether the plant oils affect the cerebral hemorrhage in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) rats.From 47 days of age, male SHR-SP rats were given drinking water containing 1% NaCl to induce hypertension, and simultaneously fed semi-purified diets containing 10% perilla oil, canola oil, or shortening. The onset time of convulsion following cerebral hemorrhage was recorded, and the areas of hemorrhage and infarction were analyzed in the stroke brains.In comparison with 58-day survival of SHR-SP rats during feeding NaCl alone, perilla oil extended the survival time to 68.5 days, whereas canola oil shortened it to 45.7 days. Feeding perilla oil greatly reduced the total volume of cerebral hemorrhage from 17.27% in the control group to 4.53%, while shortening increased the lesions to 21.23%. In a microscopic analysis, perilla oil also markedly decreased the hemorrhagic and infarction lesions to 1/10 of those in control rats, in contrast to an exacerbating effect of shortening. In blood analyses, perilla oil reduced blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins which were increased in SHR-SP, but canola oil further increased them and markedly lowered platelet counts.Perilla oil delayed and attenuated cerebral hemorrhage by improving  in hypertensive stroke animals, in contrast to the aggravating potential of canola oil and shortening. It is suggested that perilla oil should be the first choice oil for improving metabolic syndrome in hypertensive persons at risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28363723>Regulation of PCSK9 by nutraceuticals.</a></h2><p>PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) is a liver secretory enzyme that regulates plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels through modulation of LDL receptor (LDLR) density on the surface of hepatocytes. Inhibition of PCSK9 using monoclonal antibodies can efficiently lower plasma LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a). PCSK9 inhibition is also an effective adjunct to statin therapy; however, the cost-effectiveness of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors is under question. Nutraceuticals offer a safe and cost-effective option for PCSK9 inhibition. Several nutraceuticals have been reported to modulate PCSK9 levels and exert LDL-lowering activity. Mechanistically, those nutraceuticals that inhibit PCSK9 through a SREBP (sterol-responsive element binding protein)-independent pathway can be more effective in lowering plasma LDL-C levels compared with those inhibiting PCSK9 through the SREBP pathway.

Fatty  desaturase 1 gene (FADS1) polymorphisms and dietary PUFA intake are both established determinants of circulating PUFA proportions.We explored the joint effects of FADS1 polymorphisms and dietary PUFA intake on circulating PUFA proportions.We studied 2288 participants from a nested case-control study of coronary artery disease among participants who provided blood samples in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Dietary PUFA intake was obtained from semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaires. FADS1 rs174546 was genotyped by using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform, and circulating PUFA proportions were measured with gas-liquid chromatography. Linear regression models were used to examine the associations between rs174546 and circulating proportions of each fatty . Gene-diet interactions were tested by including a cross-product term of dietary intake of each PUFA by rs174546 genotype in the linear regression models.After adjustment for sex and ancestry, each copy of the C allele of rs174546 was associated with higher circulating proportions of arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and lower proportions of linoleic  and α-. The magnitude of positive association between higher consumption of dietary EPA or DHA and circulating proportions of EPA increased with each copy of the rs174546_T allele (P-interaction = 0.01 and 0.007, respectively). Each 1-SD increment in EPA intake was associated with an average 3.7% increase in circulating EPA proportions among participants with the rs174546_CC genotype and an average 7.8% increase among participants with the TT genotype.Carriers of the T allele at FADS1 rs174546 may need higher doses of dietary EPA and DHA to achieve the same circulating proportions of EPA as carriers of the C allele.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of the classical KD using a 2:1 ratio of fat to protein plus net carbohydrates, which is lower than the ratios of 3:1 or 4:1 typically used in classical KD for intractable pediatric epilepsy.In this prospective study, cooking oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty  or omega 3 fatty acids, such as olive oil, camellia oil, linseed oil, grape seed oil, and/or perilla oil were used to formulate a classical KD with a 2:1 ratio for infants and children diagnosed with medically intractable epilepsy from April 2002 to April 2018. Subjects received the diet for at least 3 months. The efficacy of the diet was analyzed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, and at > 3 years. Tolerability during the period of diet administration was analyzed by medical records and parental reports.Sixty-three subjects, 29 males and 34 females, were enrolled from April 2002 to April 2018. The median age at diet initiation was 2 years 11 months. The median duration of adherence to the diet was 1 year 2 months. The seizure-free rate was 14%, 16%, 17%, 14%, and 14% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months', and at > 3 years' follow-up, respectively. A greater than 50% seizure reduction was achieved in 52%, 43%, 40%, 33%, and 30% of subjects at each time point. The dietary compliance rate was 100%, 70%, 60%, 35%, and 27% at each follow-up time point. The reasons for discontinuation of the KD were the lack of further improvement in seizure frequency, seizure freedom achieved, food refusal, , and poor parental compliance in 38%, 11%, 5%, 2%, and 2% of subjects, respectively. Gastrointestinal discomfort was the most common adverse effect.The classical KD with a 2:1 ratio showed clinical effectiveness and tolerability in intractable pediatric epilepsy after long-term follow-up.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Rats were fed experimental diets supplemented with 0 or 2 g/kg sesamin (1:1 mixture of sesamin and episesamin) and containing 100 g/kg of palm oil (saturated fat), safflower oil rich in linoleic , or oil of evening primrose origin containing 43% GLA (GLA oil) for 18 days. In rats fed sesamin-free diets, GLA oil, compared with other oils, increased the activity and mRNA levels of various enzymes involved in fatty  oxidation, except for some instances. Sesamin greatly increased these parameters, and the enhancing effects of sesamin on peroxisomal fatty  oxidation rate and acyl-CoA oxidase, enoyl-CoA hydratase and acyl-CoA thioesterase activities were more exaggerated in rats fed GLA oil than in the animals fed other oils. The combination of sesamin and GLA oil also synergistically increased the mRNA levels of some peroxisomal fatty  oxidation enzymes and of several enzymes involved in fatty  metabolism located in other cell organelles. In the groups fed sesamin-free diets, GLA oil, compared with other oils, markedly reduced the activity and mRNA levels of various lipogenic enzymes. Sesamin reduced all these parameters, except for malic enzyme, in rats fed palm and safflower oils, but the effects were attenuated in the animals fed GLA oil. These changes by sesamin and fat type accompanied profound alterations in serum lipid levels. This may be ascribable to the changes in apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

With the recent incorporation of new lipid emulsions into the Canadian and American market, the clinician responsible for prescribing these lipids should be educated regarding the different fatty  (FA) profiles of these lipids, as well as their metabolic and functional effects.New IVLEs contain a mix of soybean oil and olive oil, or a mix of soybean oil, coconut oil, olive oil and fish oil. These new lipid emulsions provide less essential fatty acids (FAs) (linoleic and  acids) than in pure soybean oil, yet incorporation of fish oil into an IVLE may decrease the amount of essential FAs required. Fish oil is a treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, and therefore, IVLEs that include fish oil may decrease serum triglycerides. Historical perspective is that fish oil can be associated with increased bleeding time. Evidence suggests that there is no association between fish oil and increased bleeding in patients, even those who are using anticoagulants. New IVLEs provide less vitamin K than soybean oil alone.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of genetically modified flaxseed (W86) rich in phenylpropanoid compounds and hydrolysable tannin in high cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis rabbit models compared to parental cultivar Linola.Twenty-Eight White New Zealand white rabbits aged 6 months were randomly divided into four groups, control group, high cholesterol group (10 g/kg), Linola flaxseed group (100 g/kg) and W86 flaxseed group (100 g/kg). The rabbits were fed a normal diet or a high cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Levels of blood lipids, hematological values, total antioxidative status and superoxide dismutase activity in serum were determined. Moreover, body weight and feed intake were measured after sixth and tenth weeks. After each stage of the experiment atherogenic indexes (non-HDL-C/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and atherogenic index of plasma) was calculated.The intake of a dyslipidaemic diet negatively influenced lipid profile in rabbits at the 10 weeks of feeding. W86 flaxseed significantly decreased total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TG serum levels in cholesterolemic rabbits compared with parental Linola after 10 weeks. Atherogenic indexes decreased over time with a significant difference between the diets and they were the best for W86 flaxseed. Similarly, the experimental addition of W86 significantly decreased atherogenic predictors such as heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and the mean platelet volume-to-lymphocyte ratio. In rabbits, W86 flaxseed increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidative status compared to Linola.Results of the presented study suggest that the addition of W86 flaxseed alleviate serum lipid changes in high cholesterolemic diet-administered rabbits. W86 flaxseed significantly reduced atherogenic indexes, as compared with the Linola and indicate that W86 flaxseed more effectively red CVD risk factors during hypercholesterolemia.

The present pilot study aimed to explore the impact of HSO supplementation on the serum lipid profile and fatty  (FA) composition of red blood cells (RBCs) in children and adolescents with primary . A randomized, 8 week long, parallel dietary intervention study was performed. Thirty-six hyperlipidemic probands (6-16 years) on diet therapy were randomized into two groups: the HSO group, receiving 3 g of HSO providing 1.4 g of LA and 0.7 g/day of ALA, and the control group. Both groups received specific dietary guidelines. Before and after the intervention, blood samples were collected and the serum lipid profile, FA composition of RBCs and omega-3-index were analyzed. Eight weeks of supplementation with HSO significantly (p < .01) reduced the RBC content of total saturated and monounsaturated FAs (-5.02 ± 7.94% and - 2.12 ± 2.23%, respectively), increased the levels of total n-3 and n-6 PUFAs (+1.57 ± 1.96% and + 5.39 ± 7.18%, respectively) and the omega-3 index (+1.18 ± 1.42%), but failed to affect the serum lipid profile compared to the control group. In conclusion, our findings seem to support the contribution of HSO supplementation in improving the RBC phospholipid composition and omega-3 index, while no effect was observed regarding modulation of the lipid profile.

However, whether these metabolic effects of PUFA on intestine are mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) remains to be elucidated. To determine the effects of α- (ALA) on intestinal fatty  (FA) metabolism and whether these effects were affected by AMPK deletion, mice deficient in the catalytic subunit of AMPKα1 or AMPKα2 and wild-type (WT) mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF) or HF supplemented with ALA (HF-A). The results showed that ALA supplementation decreased serum TAG content in WT mice. ALA also increased mRNA expression of genes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 4A10 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4a) involved in intestinal lipid oxidation and mRNA expression of TAG synthesis-related genes (monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases 1 and 2) in WT mice. Consistent with these, expression levels of phosphorylated AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 were also increased in WT mice after ALA addition. However, in the absence of either AMPKα1 or AMPKα2, ALA supplementation failed to increase intestinal lipid oxidation. In addition, no significant effects of either diet (HF and HF-A) or genotype (WT, AMPKα1(-/-) and AMPKα2(-/-)) on FA uptake in the intestine and faecal TAG output were observed. Our results suggest that AMPK is indispensable for the effects of ALA on intestinal lipid oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30358922>Perilla Oil Supplementation Improves Hypertriglyceridemia and Gut Dysbiosis in Diabetic KKAy Mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to examine whether perilla oil supplementation improves glucolipid metabolism and modulates gut microbiota in diabetic KKAy mice.The successfully established diabetic KKAy mice are randomized into four groups: diabetic model (DM), low-dose perilla oil (LPO), middle-dose perilla oil (MPO), and high-dose perilla oil (HPO). C57BL/6J mice are fed a chow diet as normal control (NC). At the end of 12 weeks, mice are euthanized and glucolipid indications are analyzed. Gut microbiota analysis is carried out based on the sequencing results on V4 region of 16S rRNA. Although serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, abundance-based coverage estimator, and shannon are unchanged, serum triglyceride significantly decreases in LPO compared with DM. The histopathological changes of hepatocellular macrovesicular steatosis and adipocyte hypertrophy are ameliorated by perilla oil supplementation. Blautia is significantly decreased in LPO, MPO, and HPO, compared with DM. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis shows NC and LPO are relatively coherent.These findings indicate that dietary supplementation with perilla oil can improve hypertriglyceridemia and gut dysbiosis in diabetic KKAy mice, which can be associated with potential benefits to human health.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
