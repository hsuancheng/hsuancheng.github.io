In this study, an SAFL driven anoxic denitrification sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was established, the mechanism of organics utilization was characterized and the refractory dissolved organic matters (rDOM) was identified. Denitrification could rapidly proceed with the presence of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) initially, while the denitrification rate largely decreased after the VFAs depleted. A great deal of rDOM, which was hard to be utilized by denitrifying microorganism, was found in the effluent. A prolonged hydraulic retention time (HRT) led to the further transformation of particles and colloids to smaller colloids and soluble organics. Extended HRT promoted the degradation of soluble microbial by-product (SMP), but had minor effect on the removal of humic-like, and fulvic acid-like substances. The characterization of the effluent demonstrated the building blocks, were dominated in the rDOM (43.79%-48.78%), followed by high molecular  protein (HMW-PN) (13.37%-17.39%), HMW polysaccharide (HMW-) (12.84%-.9%), low molecular  (LMW) neutrals (11.28%-13.65%), and hydrophobic dissolved organic carbon (HO-DOC) (8.%-12.62%). Moreover, it was found that the building blocks were relatively easy to be degraded with the extension of HRTs, followed by LMW-, LMW-PN, LMW neutrals, HMW-PN, and HMW-. However, further extended HRT >24 h could not improve the removal of building blocks, LMW- and LMW neutrals. This study, for the first time, provided insights into the transformation of organic matters produced by SAFL in a denitrification system and acted as a guide for the subsequent advanced treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagnostic criteria for cancer-associated  loss grading (WLG) (Grades  to 4) [1] have been validated and are recommended in oncology nutrition clinical practice guidelines [2-3]. The aim was to determine the prevalence using WLG in HNC patients and determine the extent to which reduced dietary intake (DI) explained variation of WLG.A population-based cohort of HNC patients (N = 1756) in northern Alberta, Canada included consecutive new patients, 2004-2016. At referral to the regional cancer center  history and DI categories were collected. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) identified predictors of  loss (WL) severity. Overall survival (OS) in relation to WL Grade and DI was determined by multivariable Cox proportional hazard.WL was absent in 42.9% and the remainder had Grade 1 (18%), Grade 2 (14.7%), Grade 3 (.9%) and Grade 4 (8.5%) WL. Independent predictors of WLG in adjusted MLR model, included stage (P < .000), performance status () (P < .000) and DI categories (P < .000); sex, age and disease site were not significant. Compared to "normal food in normal amount" adjusted Odds Ratio for WL Grade 4 was 4. (2.1-7.5) "normal food, but less than normal amount"; 25.2 (10.7-59.1) "little solid food"; 51.8 (10.5-255.3) "very little of anything"; 42.4 (11.-163.) "only liquids"; 25.9 (7.1-94.3) "only nutritional supplements". In the Cox model controlled for age, sex, cancer stage and site and , both WLG ((P < .000) and DI categories (P = .003) independently predicted OS.Data from this population cohort provide a benchmark for prevalence of cancer associated WL severity at diagnosis. Patient reported DI categories are strong predictors of WL and prognostic for OS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

How to obtain the high efficiency of singlet oxygen generation under low 980 nm radiation dosage still remains a challenge. A highly efficient nanophotosensitizer, denoted as UCNPs-ZnPc, was constructed for photodynamic therapy, which is based on near infrared (NIR) light upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) and Zn(II)-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) photosensitizer (). The high (1)O2 production efficiency came from the enhancement of the 660 nm upconversion emission of NaYF4:Yb(3+), Er(3+) UCNP with 25% Yb(3+) doping, covalent assemblage of UCNP and ZnPc which significantly shortened the distance and enhanced the energy transfer between the two. The high (1)O2 production led to a secure and efficient PDT treatment, as evidenced by the in vivo test where UCNPs-ZnPc of 50 mg per kg body  was locally injected into the liver tumor in mice, a low 980 nm radiation dose of 351 J/cm(2) (.39 W/cm(2)) and short irradiation duration of  min were sufficient to perform image-guided PDT and caused the liver tumor inhibitory ratio of approximately 80.1%. Histological analysis revealed no pathological changes and inflammatory response in heart, lung, kidney, liver or spleen.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A 10-year follow-up study.</a></h1><p>In established acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with major complications (i.e. heart failure), overweight/obese patients usually have a survival advantage. To what extent this is irrespective of other characteristics remains inconclusive. The role of body mass index (BMI) in ACS prognosis (fatal/recurrent non-fatal cardiac episodes) and background potential interactions were evaluated.In 2006-2009, 1000 consecutive patients, hospitalized at First Cardiology Clinic of Athens with a diagnosis of ACS were enrolled in the study. All patients were classified according to heart failure phenotypes. One-month, 1-, 2- and 10-year follow-up examinations were performed (75% participation rate).Overweight was defined as 25≤BMI≤29.9kg/m2 and obesity as BMI >29.9kg/m2.BMI status and 10-year ACS prognosis followed a J-shape association (p=.009). Overweight patients had significantly better ACS prognosis than their normal- counterparts (OR=.45, 95% CI (.23, .90)). Significant interactions were observed between sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle parameters and BMI on 10-year ACS prognosis (all  for interaction≤10%); the aforementioned paradoxical association was retained only in patients who: were female (OR=.37, 95% CI (.16, .82)); were aged ≤65 years (OR=.25, 95% CI (.09, .69)), HFrEF (OR=.35, 95% CI (.13, .89)); were hypercholesterolemic (OR=.23, 95% CI (.07, .81)); had no hypertension (OR=.31, 95% CI (.12, .82)) or diabetes mellitus (OR=.29, 95% CI (.09, .95)); had moderate/high adherence to a Mediterranean diet (OR=.43, 95% CI (.22, .86)); and were physically active (OR=.37, 95% CI (., .88)).Although the overweight paradox was observed in the 10-year ACS prognosis of heart failure patients, this paradoxical association was not the case for all.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although protective vaccines are available for meningitis, they are not effective against MenX. An efficacious, monovalent conjugate vaccine was designed against MenX and a fed-batch fermentation process was developed. The MenX polysaccharide () was purified and yield estimated to be -fold higher than the reported elsewhere. Structure of MenX polysaccharide was confirmed by (1)H, (13)C NMR spectroscopy analysis. Molecular  of  was found to be 310 kDa using HPLC-SEC coupled to refractive index (RI) detector. The MenX-Tetanus toxoid (TT) monovalent conjugate proved to be highly immunogenic in mice, and the bactericidal titers of MenX-TT conjugate were 10-fold higher than native . Increasing the dose of MenX-TT conjugate from .5 μg to 1. μg induced an 8-fold higher antibody titer as well as serum bactericidal titer. The current work suggests that the MenX-TT conjugate is a candidate vaccine against meningitis caused by Meningococcal group X strains.Copyright © 2013 The International Alliance for Biological Standardization.

The atherogenicity was determined using fatty acid profiles. We also determined the physical properties (melting/crystallization profiles, solid fat content, polymorphism, and microstructure) of SLs and the textural properties of margarines made with the SLs. The SLs from the 50:30:20 and 60:25: blends had atherogenic indices similar to or lower than those of the commercial trans (CTMF) and similar to the trans-free margarine fats (CTFMF). SLs from the blends with PKO contained a wide range of fatty acids (C6-C20) and had more beta' than beta polymorphs. Margarines made with SLs from 50:30:20 and 60:25: blends possessed similar hardness, adhesiveness, or cohesiveness to margarines made with CTMF and CTFMF, respectively. Therefore, CO//PKO-based SLs were suitable for formulating trans-free margarines with low atherogenicity and desirable textural properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27287203>Intravenous Prenatal Nicotine Exposure Alters METH-Induced Hyperactivity, Conditioned Hyperactivity, and BDNF in Adult Rat Offspring.</a></h1><p>In the USA, approximately % of women smoke tobacco cigarettes during pregnancy. In utero tobacco smoke exposure produces somatic growth deficits like intrauterine growth restriction and low birth  in offspring, but it can also negatively influence neurodevelopmental outcomes in later stages of life, such as an increased incidence of obesity and drug abuse. Animal models demonstrate that prenatal nicotine (PN) alters the development of the mesocorticolimbic system, which is important for organizing goal-directed behavior. In the present study, we determined whether intravenous (IV) PN altered the initiation and/or expression of methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor sensitization as a measure of mesocorticolimbic function in adult rat offspring. We also determined whether PN and/or METH exposure altered protein levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the nucleus accumbens, the dorsal striatum, and the prefrontal cortex of adult offspring. BDNF was of interest because of its role in the development and maintenance of the mesocorticolimbic pathway and its ability to modulate neural processes that contribute to drug abuse, such as sensitization of the dopamine system. Dams were injected with IV nicotine (.05 mg/kg/injection) or saline, 3×/day on gestational days 8-21. Testing was conducted when offspring reached adulthood (around postnatal day 90). Following 3 once daily habituation sessions the animals received a saline injection and baseline locomotor activity was measured. PN and prenatal saline ()-exposed offspring then received 10 once daily injections of METH (.3 mg/kg) to induce locomotor sensitization. The animals received a METH injection (.3 mg/kg) to assess the expression of sensitization following a 14-day period of no injections. A day later, all animals were injected with saline and conditioned hyperactivity was assessed. Brain tissue was harvested 24 h later. PN animals habituated more slowly to the activity chambers compared to  controls. PN rats treated with METH showed significant enhancement of locomotor behavior compared to  rats following acute and repeated injections; however, PN did not produce differential initiation or expression of behavioral sensitization. METH produced conditioned hyperactivity, and PN rats exhibited a greater conditioned response of hyperactivity relative to controls. PN and METH exposure produced changes in BDNF protein levels in all three regions, and complex interactions were observed between these two factors. Logistic regression revealed that BDNF protein levels, throughout the mesocorticolimbic system, significantly predicted the difference in the conditioned hyperactive response of the animals: both correlations were significant, but the predicted relationship between BDNF and context-elicited activity was stronger in the PN (r = .67) compared to the  rats (r = .42). These findings indicate that low-dose PN exposure produces long-term changes in activity and enhanced sensitivity to the locomotor effects of METH. The enhanced METH-induced contextual conditioning shown by the PN animals suggests that offspring of in utero tobacco smoke exposure have greater susceptibility to learn about drug-related conditional stimuli, such as the context. The PN-induced alterations in mesocorticolimbic BDNF protein lend further support for the hypothesis that maternal smoking during pregnancy produces alterations in neuronal plasticity that contribute to drug abuse vulnerability. The current findings demonstrate that these changes are persistent into adulthood.© 2016 S.

We hypothesized this could increase desflurane consumption to such an extent that agent consumption might become higher than with a conventional anesthesia machine (Anesthesia Delivery Unit [ADU®], GE, Helsinki, Finland) used with a previously derived desflurane-O₂-N₂O administration schedule that allows early FGF reduction.Thirty-four ASA  I or II patients undergoing plastic, urologic, or gynecologic surgery received desflurane in O₂/N₂O. In the ADU group (n = 24), an initial 3 min high FGF of O₂ and N₂O (2 and 4 L.min-1, respectively) was used, followed by .3 L.min-1 O2 + .4 L.min-1 N₂O. The desflurane vaporizer setting (FD) was 6.5% for the first  min, and 5.5% during the next 25 min. In the Zeus group (n = 10), the Zeus® was used in automated closed circuit anesthesia mode with a selected end-expired (FA) desflurane target of 4.6%, and O₂/N₂O as the carrier gases with a target inspired O₂% of 30%. Desflurane FA and consumption during the first 40 min were compared using repeated measures one-way ANOVA.Age and  did not differ between the groups (P > .05), but patients in the Zeus group were taller (P = .04). In the Zeus group, the desflurane FA was lower during the first 3 min (P < .05), identical at 4 min (P > .05), and slightly higher after 4 min (P < .05). Desflurane consumption was higher in the Zeus group at all times, a difference that persisted after correcting for the small difference in FA between the two groups.Agent consumption with an automated closed-circuit anesthesia machine is higher than with a conventional anesthesia machine when the latter is used with a specific vaporizer-FGF sequence. Agent consumption during automated delivery might be further reduced by optimizing the algorithm(s) that manages the initial FGF or by tolerating some N₂ in the circuit to minimize the need for intermittent flushing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406049>Prevalence and correlates of physical activity among children and adolescents: a cross-sectional population-based study of a rural city in Japan.</a></h1><p>Although moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has multiple health benefits, current participation in recommended MVPA level and its determinants among Japanese children and adolescents remain unclear. Therefore, this cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of meeting recommended MVPA level and its correlates among Japanese children and adolescents.Using the Japanese version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey questionnaire, we confirmed the prevalence of meeting recommended MVPA level in all primary schools () and junior high schools (JHS) in Unnan City, Japan.

We hypothesized that ketamine produces adequate and comparable sedation conditions for dislocated large joint reduction when compared to etomidate and results in fewer adverse events.This Institutional Review Board approved prospective trial compared a convenience sample of subjects, who were randomized to receive either ketamine or etomidate for  to facilitate reduction of large joint dislocations. Following informed consent, subjects were assigned via a computer-generated algorithm to receive either etomidate (.1 mg/kg) or ketamine (.5 mg/kg) intravenously; if  was not sufficient, subjects received repeat doses of etomidate or ketamine until adequate  was achieved. The protocol's primary endpoint was a successful reduction of dislocated, large joints. Secondary endpoints included alteration in blood pressure, vomiting, recovery agitation, hypersalivation, laryngospasm, myoclonus, hypoxia, airway assistance with chin lift or jaw thrust, bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, utilization of additional doses of ketamine or etomidate, and recovery time from sedation.Total enrollment was eighty subjects, 46 in the ketamine cohort and 34 in the etomidate cohort. The two  groups were comparable in terms of gender, age, and . There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of large joint dislocation reduction between the ketamine and etomidate cohorts (46/46, 100%; 32/34, 94.1%; P - .1). Shoulder, hip, and ankle joints account for the majority of joint reductions in this trial. Titration of  was necessary for almost half of each cohort as evidenced by the utilization of additional dosages of the sedative agents: ketamine (22/46, 47.8%) and etomidate (14/34, 41.2%; P - .56). Among secondary outcome variables, significant differences between ketamine and etomidate cohorts were myoclonus (1/46, 2.2%, /33, 45.5%; P - .0001), assisted ventilation with airway manipulation (3/45, 6.7%; 9/33, 27.3%; P - .01), and pulsoximetry desaturation < 90% (/46; 7/34, 20.6%; P - .002). There was no significant difference in recovery time from  between the ketamine and etomidate cohorts (11 min vs. 10 min; P - .69).Ketamine produces  conditions for successful large joint dislocation reduction that are adequate and comparable to etomidate. The increased likelihood of myoclonus, of the requirement for airway assistance, and of hypoxia observed with etomidate suggest potential benefits with the utilization of ketamine for  for dislocated large joint reduction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561196>Usefulness of the prognostic score for donor safety in living donor liver transplantation.</a></h1><p>This study sought to determine whether a prognostic score is a useful indicator of donor safety using 13 consecutive donors enrolled for liver transplantation. The donor operations were right hepatic lobectomies (n = 10) and left hepatic lobectomies (n = 3). The postoperative maximal level of serum total bilirubin was used to assess the magnitude of surgical stress. Variables such as donor age, percentage of liver resection (PLR), indocyanine green -minute retention rate (ICGR15), operative blood loss, operation time, prognostic score and graft  were evaluated as predictors of the magnitude of surgical stress. The PLR and prognostic score () were calculated according to the following formulae: PLR (%) = 100*Graft  (g)/standard liver volume of the donor (mL);  = -84.6 + .933*PLR (%) +1.11*ICGR15 (%) +.999*age (years); Standard liver volume (mL) = 706.2*body surface area (m2) + 2.39. No serious complications occurred after the donor operations. Maximal bilirubin ranged from 1.9 to 10.9 mg/dL. There were no mortalities, although there were two morbidities, bile leakage and prolonged liver dysfunction. Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia was observed in two donors and in one Gilbert's syndrome donor. Linear regression analysis of each variable indicated poor correlations between those variables and maximal bilirubin. However, close correlations were seen between maximal bilirubin and both donor age and  except for the three patients who showed postoperative hyperbilirubinemia. In these uneventful donors, statistical formulae were obtained as follows: maximal bilirubin (PMB) = .271 + .056*donor age (correlation coefficient .612, P < .008), PMB = 1.541 + .059* (correlation coefficient .597, P < .009).

However, less is known about its effect on laying hen performance. Therefore, 6 diets were formulated to produce differing ratios (:100, 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, and 100:) of semi-purified wheat starch (rapidly digested) and pea starch (; slowly digested). Each diet was fed to 120 conventionally caged Lohmann LSL lite hens in groups of 12, from 27 to 46 wk of age, and its effects on performance and feather covering were assessed. Data were analyzed by regression analysis, and the significance level was chosen at P ≤ .05. Hen-day egg production (HDP) was high (97.05%) and unaffected by  concentration for  to 10 wk of the trial, followed by a quadratic-shaped HDP, with an estimated maximum at 67%  concentration, for the 10 to 20 wk period of the trial. Overall ( to 20 wk), HDP increased linearly with . No effect on egg weight was found (average weight = 59.6±2.1 g), but eggshells were thickest at the 55%  concentration. Body weight gain was affected by  concentration and maximized at 49% . Body weight uniformity and mortality were not affected by dietary treatment. Feed intake increased linearly with  from 102 to 109 g/hen/d, while feed: egg mass ratio was minimal at 26% . Using a scale from 1 to 4 per body part (neck, wings, back, vent and breast), only neck feather cover increased linearly with , from 3. (% ) to 3.2/4 (100% ). However, back and total feather coverage showed a trend (P = .054 and P = .079 respectively) to increase linearly with  as well (from 3.7 to 3.9/4 and .6 to 16.6/20, respectively). In summary, feeding  at low to intermediate concentrations improved laying hen performance. Further research should focus on the mechanisms involved in this effect.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18719653>-specific health-related quality of life in adolescents with extreme obesity.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this multisite study were to: (i) examine differences by gender and race on generic and - specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adolescents with extreme obesity (BMI > or = 40 kg/m(2)) and (ii) explore HRQOL differences based on treatment pursued (behavioral vs. bariatric surgery). Study participants included 145 obese adolescents (mean age = .3 years; 68% female; 46% black; mean BMI = 50.6) referred to pediatric  management programs. Participants completed generic (PedsQL) and -specific (Impact of  on Quality of Life-Kids (IWQOL-Kids)) HRQOL measures. Generic and -specific measures indicated global (e.g., all domains) HRQOL impairment and significant differences by race. Physical, emotional, and social scores of the PedsQL ( < .01) and the physical comfort and body esteem scores of the IWQOL-Kids ( < .001) were significantly higher for black compared to white adolescents with extreme obesity. Extremely obese adolescents pursuing bariatric surgery reported similar HRQOL to adolescents pursuing behavioral treatment (n = 30 matched pairs). HRQOL did not differ for extremely obese adolescents based on type of treatment sought, but race/ethnicity should be considered when characterizing these youth. Although racial differences in adolescent body image/esteem have been reported, it is unknown why black adolescents with extreme obesity would report less impact of  on their physical functioning.

Exclusion criteria were: left ventricular dysfunction, left-sided valvular heart disease, other right-sided structural heart disease, chronic hypertension, substance addiction, and incomplete follow-up. Pregnancies were divided into three groups: absent or mild PI, moderate PI, and severe PI. A generalized linear model with normal dependent variable distribution was built and the parameter estimation made with Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) to take into account repeated mother in data. Variables such as gestational age at birth, maternal age, smoking, and body mass index were tested with bivariate analyses to assess their effect on BW. Only gestational age remained in the adjusted model.A total of 45 patients were included (33 TOF and 12 ) and 97 pregnancies were reported: 22 miscarriages (22.7%) ( TOF, 7 ) and 75 successful pregnancies (57 TOF, 18 ). The patients were divided into three groups: 1) absent or mild PI, 2) moderate PI, and 3) severe PI groups, which comprised, respectively, 29 ( TOF, 4 ), 20 (10 TOF, 1 ), and 26 successful pregnancies (8 TOF, 7 ). Using three levels of PI (absent or mild, moderate, and severe), the unadjusted model showed a significant effect of level of PI on BW (p = .0118), as well as the adjusted model (p = .0263) with gestational age as a covariate. The estimated mean newborn's BW was 3055.8 g in the severe PI group, 3151. g in the moderate PI group, and 3376.4 g in the absent or mild group when adjusted for gestational age. Hence, we estimated that the mean newborn's BW is 321 g lower in the severe PI group compared with absent or mild PI group ((CI: 572.3; -68.9), p = .0087).Pregnancy is usually well tolerated in repaired TOF and corrected . Severe PI either from repaired TOF or  is at higher risk of lower newborn's BW. Special attention must be paid to the severity of PI.

Pressure Support () can be used as an adjunct to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) to partially unload the spontaneous breaths.To evaluate the effects of two levels of  as an adjunct to SIMV on gas exchange and breathing effort during an acute reduction in SIMV rate in preterm infants.In all,  infants (birth  793 +/- 217 g, gestational age 26.4 +/- 1.5 weeks, postnatal age  +/- 16 days). Ventilatory support consisted of SIMV with peak inspiratory pressure (PTP) 16.3 +/- 1.3 cmH(2)O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 4.3 +/- .6 cmH(2)O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) .26 +/- .06. Infants were studied during four 30-minute periods: Two baseline SIMV periods and two periods of SIMV plus , in random order. During SIMV + , SIMV rate was lowered by 10 breaths per minute (b/minute) and  was set at 3 and 6 cmH(2)O (SIMV+PS3 and SIMV + PS6, respectively).SIMV rate was reduced during SIMV +  from 21.4 +/- 6.6 to 11.4 +/- 6.6 b/minute.

Despite early dietetic intervention some children fail to grow optimally. We report growth from birth to 2 years in a cohort of children diagnosed with CF by NBS and identify the variables that influence future growth.One hundred forty-four children were diagnosed with CF by the West Midlands Regional NBS laboratory between November 2007 and October 2014. All anthropometric measurements and microbiology results from the first 2 years were collated as was demographic and CF screening data. Classification modelling was used to identify the key variables in determining future growth.Complete data were available on 129 children. 113 (88%) were pancreatic insufficient (PI) and 16 (12%) pancreatic sufficient (). Mean birth  (z score) was 3.17 kg (- .32). There was no significant difference in birth  (z score) between PI and  babies: 3. kg (- .36) vs 3.28 kg (- .05); p = .33. By the first clinic visit the difference was significant: 3.42 kg (- 1.39) vs 4.60 kg (- .48); p < .0001.  and height remained lower in PI infants in the first year of life. In the first 2 years of life, 18 (14%) infants failed to regain their birth  z score. The median time to achieve a  z score of - 2, - 1 and  was 18, 33 and 65 weeks respectively. The median times to reach the same z scores for height were 30, 51 and 90 weeks. Birth  z score, change in  z score from birth to first clinic, faecal elastase, isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and sweat chloride were the variables identified by the classification models to predict  and height in the first and second year of life.Babies with CF have a lower birth  than the healthy population. For those diagnosed with CF by NBS, the  difference between PI and  babies was not significantly different at birth but became so by the first clinic visit. The presence of certain factors, most already identifiable at the first clinic visit can be used to identify infant at increased risk of poor growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603027>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and acute-phase proteins in early pregnant ewes after challenge with peptidoglycan-polysaccharide.</a></h1><p>Bacterial infection shortly after mating interferes with establishment of pregnancy. Injection of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-), a component of gram-positive bacteria, into sheep on day 5 after mating reduces pregnancy rate. Experiments were designed to evaluate the acute-phase response (APR) in ewes to injection of PG- on day 5 after mating (day ). Catheters were inserted into the jugular and posterior vena cava on day 4. On day 5, ewes were challenged with saline or 30 microg/kg body  (BW) PG- (Exp 1) or 60 microg/kg BW PG- (Exp 2). Blood samples were collected every  min for 6 h (Exp 1) and every  min for 2 h, hourly for 12 h, and at 24, 36, and 48 h (Exp 2). Body temperature and clinical signs of infection were monitored in Exp 2. Plasma was assayed for concentrations of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha); 2 APR proteins, serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp); and progesterone (P(4)). Ewes injected with 60 microg/kg BW PG- exhibited fever, vaginal discharge, loss of appetite, and lethargy. After challenge with either 30 microg/kg or 60 microg/kg BW PG-, TNF-alpha increased in the posterior vena cava. Concentrations of SAA and Hp in the jugular increased after challenge with 60 microg/kg BW PG-. Only half (5/10) of the ewes treated with 60 microg/kg BW PG- had ultrasonically visible embryos, and none of them had functional corpora lutea (CL) (<1 ng/mL of P(4)) on day 21. On the other hand, 8/9 (88.9%) control ewes had visible embryos and all had functional CL on day 21. Using logistic regression, pregnancy on day 21 was predicted to depend on concentrations of TNF-alpha and Hp on day 5 and concentration of P(4) on day 14. In summary, injection of PG- on day 5 after mating resulted in fever; increased concentrations of TNF-alpha, Hp, and SAA on the day of and the day after the PG- challenge; and decreased concentrations of P(4) on days 14 and 21. These factors were related to failure to establish pregnancy.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates whether the efficacy of optimal protein intake levels for protein retention in the elderly is influenced by protein quality.We investigated the effect of a 10-day adequate-protein (AP) or high-protein (HP) diet together with the protein source as caseins (CAS) or soluble milk proteins (PRO) on whole-body (WB) protein synthesis () and protein breakdown (PB) in 4 groups of healthy elderly men (mean ± SEM: 71.8 ± 24.4 yr). The study consisted of two periods of 4 h each: a post-absorptive period and a postprandial period. The fed state was defined by consumption every 20 min and for 4 h, of either  g or 30 g of PRO or CAS. Steady-state WB and splanchnic leucine kinetics were measured using a continuous infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine in the postabsorptive state and L-[1-13C]leucine infusion plus oral L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine in the postprandial state.WB  was stimulated by feeding only with HP diets, whereas WB PB corrected for splanchnic extraction showed a similar pattern of post-feeding decrease in all groups. Consequently, net leucine balance was greater in the postprandial state after HP meals than after AP meals, with PRO meals leading to a better postprandial leucine balance (3.63 ± .16 μmol kg FFM(-1) min(-1)vs. 2.77 ± .21 μmol kg FFM(-1) min(-1) for PRO HP and CAS HP, respectively; P = .005).Postprandial protein retention was better improved in elderly men by an increase in protein intake when the protein supplementation was provided as fast-digesting proteins that induce high leucine availability.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The present study, which was part of the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS LOST) trial, investigated whether the fat and protein content of four different diets affected changes in specific food cravings in overweight and obese adults. A sample of 811 adults were recruited across two clinical sites, and each participant was randomly assigned to one of four macronutrient prescriptions: 1) low fat (20% of energy), average protein (% of energy); 2) moderate fat (40%), average protein (%); 3) low fat (20%), high protein (25%); 4) moderate fat (40%), high protein (25%). With few exceptions, the type of diet that participants were assigned did not differentially affect changes in specific food cravings. Participants assigned to the high-fat diets, however, had reduced cravings for carbohydrates at month 12 (p<.05) and fruits and vegetables at month 24. Also, participants assigned to high-protein diets had increased cravings for sweets at month 6 and month 12 (<.05). Participants in all four dietary conditions reported significant reductions in food cravings for specific types of foods (i.e., high fat foods, fast food fats, sweets, and carbohydrates/starches; all <.05). Cravings for fruits and vegetables, however, were increased at month 24 (p<.05).

Young age at anesthetic exposure is believed to be critical, but human studies are scarce. This study investigated the association between exposure to surgery and anesthesia for pyloric stenosis () before 3 months of age and subsequent educational outcome in adolescence.This nationwide unselected register-based follow-up study of the Danish birth cohorts 1986-1990 compared the educational outcome of all children having undergone surgery for  before 3 months of age with a randomly selected, age-matched 5% sample of the same cohort. Primary analysis compared the average test scores at ninth grade adjusting for gender, birth , and parental age and education. Secondary analysis compared the proportions not attaining the test scores between the two groups.The exposure group comprised 779 and the control group consisted of 14 665 individuals. Although the exposure group performed lower than the control group (average score .17 lower, 95% CI: .08-.25), after adjusting for known confounders, no statistically significant difference (-.04, 95% CI: -.09 to .08) between the 2 groups could be demonstrated. However, we found an odds ratio (OR) for test score nonattainment-associated  repair of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.11-1.68).Children operated for  before 3 months of age have educational performance tests similar to the background population at age -16 years after adjusting for known confounders.

One hundred microliters of /PC (n = 6) and saline as a control (n = 10) were injected in tail veins of Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice every day from days 5.5 to 16.5 of pregnancy. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by means of the tail-cuff method. On day 17.5, the mice were anesthetized by diethyl ether and euthanized with the collapse of the circulation by drawing blood from the heart. The animals were dissected and the fetuses and placentas removed. Fetal  and placental  were evaluated. Plasma antithrombin activity (AT), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), platelet counts, and proteinuria were measured on day 17.5. Placentas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histologic studies. Statistical analysis was evaluated by analysis of variance and Welch's t-test. Mice injected with /PC showed a significant elevation in SBP (124 versus 101 mm Hg; p < .001), a significant increase in TAT levels (23 versus 6.6 mug/L; p < .05), a significant decrease in platelet counts (88 versus 102 x 10 (10)/L; p < .05), a decrease in AT, an increase in proteinuria, and a significant reduction in fetal  (1.2 versus 1.3 g; p < .0001) and placental  (.13 versus . g; p < .001), compared with controls. Placentas of mice injected with /PC showed diffuse fibrin depositions in the labyrinth layer.

After induction of anaesthesia and placement of a laryngeal mask airway (LMATM), the patients were randomly divided into three groups to receive either caudal ropivacaine alone (.4%, 2 mg x kg(-1)) in group R (n = 32) or ropivacaine (.2%, 1 mg x kg(-1)) plus ketamine (.25 mg x kg(-1)) in group RK (n = 33) or ropivacaine (.2%, 1 mg x kg(-1)) plus tramadol (1 mg x kg(-1)) in group RT (n = 34) with a total volume of .5 ml x kg(-1). Systemic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), heart rate (HR), peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), sedation and pain scores were recorded at 5, 10,  and 30 min, 1, 3, 4 and 6 h following recovery from anaesthesia. Pain was evaluated by Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale, and sedation with a five-point sedation test.No difference was found regarding age,  and duration of operation between the groups (P > .05). No patient experienced hypotension, bradycardia or respiratory depression. Duration of analgesia was longer in group RT (1377 +/- 204 min) than group R (1006 +/- 506 min) (P = .001). In the tramadol group, fewer patients required supplementary analgesics in the first 24 h (P = .005). Sedation scores were below 2 in all groups.

However, this remains controversial in deceased donor renal transplantation (DDRT) maintained on tacrolimus (TAC)/mycophenolic acid (MPA) with or without steroids.We studied the United Network for Organ Sharing Registry for patients receiving DDRT from 2000 to 2012 maintained on TAC/MPA at transplantation hospital discharge (n=74,627) to compare outcomes of IL2-RA and other induction agents. We initially divided the cohort into two groups on the basis of steroid use at the time of discharge: steroid (n=59,010) versus no steroid (n=,617). Each group was stratified into induction categories: IL2-RA, rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG), alemtuzumab, and no induction. The main outcomes were incidence of acute rejection within the first year and overall graft failure (defined as graft failure and/or death) post-transplantation. Propensity score (), specifically inverse probability of treatment , analysis was used to minimize selection bias caused by nonrandom assignment of induction therapies.Median (25th, 75th percentiles) follow-up times were 3.9 (1.1, 5.9) and 3.2 (1.1, 4.9) years for steroid and no steroid groups, respectively. Acute rejection within the first year and overall graft failure within 5 years of transplantation were more common in the no induction category (13.3%; P<.001 and 28%; P=.01, respectively) in the steroid group and the IL2-RA category (11.1%; P=.16 and 27.4%; P<.001, respectively) in the no steroid group. Compared with IL2-RA, -weighted and covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic and Cox analyses showed that outcomes in the steroid group were similar among induction categories, except that acute rejection was significantly lower with r-ATG (odds ratio [OR], .68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], .62 to .74). In the no steroid group, compared with IL2-RA, odds of acute rejection with r-ATG (OR, .80; 95% CI, .60 to 1.00) and alemtuzumab (OR, .68; 95% CI, .53 to .88) were lower, and r-ATG was associated with better graft survival (hazard ratio, .86; 95% CI, .75 to .99).In DDRT, compared with IL2-RA induction, no induction was associated with similar outcomes when TAC/MPA/steroids were used. r-ATG seems to offer better graft survival over IL2-RA in steroid avoidance protocols.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30265689>Foot typology, body  distribution, and postural stability of adolescent elite soccer players: A 3-year longitudinal study.</a></h1><p>The unique foot morphology and distinctive functions facilitate complex tasks and strategies such as standing, walking, and running. In those -bearing activities, postural stability () plays an important role. Correlations among foot type, , and other musculoskeletal problems that increase sport injury risk are known. However, long-term associations among the foot type, the , and body  (BW) distribution are lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to longitudinally identify changes in foot morphology, , and symmetry in BW distribution during adolescence among elite male soccer players.Thirty-five Czech elite male soccer players (age, .49 ± .61 years; BW, 64.11 ± 6.16 kg; body height, 174.62 ± 5.71 cm) underwent foot type, , and BW distribution measurements during 3 consecutive years (T1, T2, T3). The Chippaux-Smirak index (CSI), BW distribution, and centre of pressure (COP) displacement (total traveled way [TTW]) of each player for the preferred (PL) and non-preferred leg (NL) were acquired. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA), Bonferroni´s post hoc tests, and partial eta-squared (ηp2) coefficient were used for investigating the effect of time on selected variables and effect size evaluation.Statistically significant effect of time on CSI values (PL: F2,68 = 5.08, p < .01, ηp2 = .13 and NL: F2,68 = 10.87, p < .01, ηp2 = .24) and COP displacement values (PL: F2,68 = 5.07, p <.01, ηp2 = .13; NL: F2,68 = 3.53, p <.05, ηp2 = .09) for both legs over 3-years period was identified. Furthermore, the Bonferroni´s post hoc analysis revealed a significant improvement of  values in the PL (TTWT1 = 1617.11 ± 520.22 mm vs. TTWT2 = 1405.29 ± 462.76, p < .05; and between TTWT1 = 1617.11 ± 520.22 mm vs. TTWT3 = 1370.46 ± 373.94, p < .05). Only BW distribution parameter showed no significant differences, although slightly improved over time.We observed changes in foot typology, , and BW distribution in young elite male soccer players during 3 consecutive years. Results demonstrated that changes in  and body  distribution under the high-load sport conditions during adolescence may improve with aging, except for foot morphology. Therefore, foot morphology should be carefully monitored to minimize sport injury risk in professional young soccer players during adolescence. Further research is necessary to determine more clear associations between these parameters, soccer-related injuries, and sport performances.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27371031>Long-term survival in advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with first-line bevacizumab-based therapy.</a></h1><p>First-line bevacizumab-based therapies have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

First, the "passivation" of the silicon substrates toward polymer adsorption was performed by the deposition of an alkyne functionalized self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Then, three tailor-made omega-azido linear brush precursors, i.e., PEG-N3, PMMA-N3, and -N3 (Mn approximately 20,000 g/mol), were grafted to alkyne-functionalized SAMs via click chemistry in tetrahydrofuran. The SAM, PEG, PMMA, and  layers were characterized by ellipsometry, scanning probe microscopy, and water contact angle measurements. Results have shown that the grafting process follows the scaling laws developed for polymer brushes, with a significant dependence over the  fraction of polymer in the grafting solution and the grafting time. The chemical nature of the brushes has only a weak influence on the click chemistry grafting reaction and morphologies observed, yielding polymer brushes with thickness of ca. 6 nm and grafting densities of ca. .2 chains/nm2. The examples developed herein have shown that this highly versatile and tunable approach can be extended to the grafting of a wide range of polymer (pseudo-) brushes to silicon substrates without changing the tethering strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835072>The Outcomes of Targeted Temperature Management After Cardiac Arrest at Emergency Department: A Real-World Experience in a Developing Country.</a></h1><p>Targeted temperature management (TTM) is indicated for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest to improve outcomes.

A review of the acute and short-term outcomes and adverse events was performed.The patients had a median age of 5 years (interquartile range: 3-9 years), 71% of patients were ≤5 years, and median  was 17 kg (interquartile range: 13-30 kg). Single defects were observed in 113 patients (84%). The remainder had multiple or multifenestrated defects that were closed by a single device. The mean defect size of single defects and the mean interatrial septum length were .24 ± 5.16 mm and 38.13 ± 6.3 mm, respectively. The ratio of device to TEE (Transoesophageal echocardiography) size of ASD was 1.19 ± .12. The devices were implanted successfully in 98.5% of patients. Six cases had concordant  (Pulmonary stenosis), patent ductus arteriosus or perimembranous ventricular septal defect and were treated with balloon dilation, or closure. No residual flow was seen after device placement except in one patient with multiple fenestrations. There were five high-severity adverse events (3.7%) with no mortality. Device erosion was confirmed in one of two patients with massive haemopericardium; embolization of the device with retrieval in one patient; and heart block was detected in two cases. No cardiac perforation, device erosion, embolization, thrombus formation, or clinical evidence of bacterial endocarditis was observed during follow-up.Transcatheter closure of ASDs in children and adolescents was feasible and safe in the first 4 years experience in our centers, with good short-term outcome. Balloon sizing is not necessary for transcatheter closure of secundum ASD.

The present study investigated whether DN gel induced chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells in a maintenance medium without insulin, and whether supplementation of hyaluronic acid enhanced the chondrogenic differentiation effect of DN gel.ATDC5 cells were cultured on the DN gel and the polystyrene () dish in maintenance media without insulin for 21 days. Hyaluronic acid having a molecular  of approximately 800 kDa was supplemented into the medium so that the concentration became .01, .1, or 1. mg/mL. The cultured cells were evaluated using immunocytochemistry for type-2 collagen and real time PCR for gene expression of type-2 collagen, aggrecan, and Sox9 at 7 and 21 days of culture.The cells cultured on the DN gel formed nodules and were stained with an anti-type-2 collagen antibody, and expression of type-2 collagen and aggrecan mRNA was significantly greater on the DN gel than on the  dish surface (p < .05) in the hyaluronic acid-free maintenance medium. Hyaluronic acid supplementation of a high concentration (1. mg/mL) significantly enhanced expression of type-2 collagen and aggrecan mRNA in comparison with culture without hyaluronic acid at 21 days (p < .05).The DN gel induced chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells without insulin. This effect was significantly affected by hyaluronic acid, depending on the level of concentration. There is a high possibility that hyaluronic acid plays an important role in the in vivo hyaline cartilage regeneration phenomenon induced by the DN gel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901726>Pancreatic radiation effect in apoptosis-related rectal radiation toxicity.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic radiation effect (PRE) can be a component of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) radiotoxicity. This inter-organ correlation between the GIT and the pancreas was assessed through a rat model. Separate local irradiation to the abdomen and the pelvis was applied concurrently for 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Abdominal irradiation was categorized into pancreatic shield () and non-pancreatic shield (NPS) irradiation. After 5 Gy and  Gy irradiation, the rectal mucosa was analyzed at the first week (early phase, Ep) and the 14th week (late phase, Lp). A slow gain in body  was observed initially, particularly in the NPS group receiving a  Gy dose (P < .001). The large number of apoptotic bodies after  Gy at Ep decreased at Lp. At Ep for the 5-Gy group, the NPS group revealed more fibrotic change than the  group (P = .002). Cleaved caspase-3 (CCP3) expression was greater at Lp, and the Ep-Lp increase was prominent in the NPS--Gy group (P = .010). At Lp, for  Gy irradiation, CCP3 was expressed more in the NPS group than in the  group (P = .032). Despite no direct toxicity difference between the  and NPS groups, small changes in parameters such as fibrosis or CCP3 expression suggest that pancreatic shielding does have an effect on the radiation response in the rectal mucosa, which suggests a need for a multi-organ effect-based approach in GIT radiotoxicity assessment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459138>Haemodialysis in patients treated with oral anticoagulant: should we heparinize?</a></h1><p>Anticoagulation for the haemodialysis circuit in patients treated with oral anticoagulation poses additional haemorrhagic risk. The few available data suggest that tapering or even stopping heparinization is feasible and the HeprAN membrane with grafted heparin was developed to decrease heparin dose. The objective of our study was to evaluate the need for additional anticoagulation in patients on long-term oral anticoagulation, according to the type of membrane used.This is a prospective, randomized, crossover bifactorial trial in haemodialysed patients on oral anticoagulation. Each patient had four haemodialysis sessions with two different membranes [HeprAN or polysulphone ()] and with or without enoxaparin. Clinical coagulation was evaluated by the need for premature ending and by a visual score (Janssen scale). Coagulation activation markers were also measured: d-dimers, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, tissue factor pathway inhibitor and platelet factor-4.Ten patients were included (M/F = 4/6, mean age 63 ±  years). None of the 40 sessions ended prematurely. The clotting scores were similar with or without enoxaparin (dialyser: 1.49 ± .19 versus 1.53 ± .17, P = .97; bubble trap: .75 ± .19 versus .78 ± .22, P = .62) and with the polysulphone or the HeprAN membrane (dialyser: 1.54 ± .20 versus 1.47 ± .16, P = .65; bubble trap: .74 ± .22 versus .79 ± .19, P = .58). There was no significant difference in coagulation activation markers between dialysis modalities; however, dialysis efficacy was significantly greater with the  membrane (1.58 ± .07 versus 1.43 ± .06, P = .02).These results suggest that haemodialysis without additional anticoagulation is possible in patients with oral anticoagulation. The HeprAN membrane did not provide any additional benefit compared with a  membrane.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25537537>[Clinical analysis of 165 extremely low birth  infants].</a></h1><p>To analyze the clinical features and prognosis of extremely low birth  infants (ELBWI).Data of totally 165 hospitalized ELBWI between August 1st, 2008 and November 30th, 2013 in Hunan Children's Hospital were analyzed. The information of general data and births, prenatal care, delivery room stabilization, transfer information, complications, treatment, outcome and follow up were summarized.(1) One hundred and sixty-five ELBWI were involved, their mean gestational age was (28.4±2.4) weeks, mean birth (910.9±93.1) g. (2) Rate of delivery in tertiary hospital was 46.7% (77/165) and prenatal steroids exposure was found in 52.1% (86/165). None of the cases were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in delivery room. (3) Rate of infants who were transfered to the class III b neonatal ward within 12 hours after birth was 58.8% (97/165). (4) The main complications of them included neonatal respiratory distress syndrome(NRDS, 77.%, 127/165), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 70.1%, 75/107), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, 50.%, 40/80), preterm retinopathy (ROP, 43.%, 46/107), sepsis 39.4% (65/165), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH, 34.8%, 49/141), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, 8.%, 7/88). (5) TREATMENT: 97.6% (161/165) received oxygen therapy and 66.1% (109/165) received mechanical ventilation, 55.2% (91/165) used CPAP. 89.8% (114/127) of the NRDS used ; 44.% (33/75) of the BPD used low dose dexamethasone, 32.% (24/75) used low dose nitric oxide; 60.% (24/40) of the PDA used medication. 32.6% (/46) of the ROP received laser photocoagulation. The average time of beginning enteral feeding was 2. d, the mean time to achieve full gastrointestinal feeding was 43.4 d. (6) OUTCOME: rate of survival in 165 cases with ELBWI was 51.5% (85/165), treatment was abandoned in 37.6% (62/165), total mortality was 48.5% (80/165). There were significant difference in survival rate between different birth  group, gestational age group and admission age group (χ2=11.498, 8.789, 13.157, all P<.05); There was significant difference in rate of giving up treatment between different birth  and admission age groups (χ2=10.448, 8.259, all P<.05). The primary cause of death was economic factor and worrying about prognosis.

As a next step, we compared the bactericidal effects of low molecular weight (LMW) combined with Photodynamic Therapy to high molecular weight (HMW) chitosan.To perform PDT to kill H. pylori, we used endoscopic light as light source, methylene blue (MB) as a photosensitizer and chitosan (310-375, 50-190 kDa). We evaluated bacterial removal rate and its membrane damage by ethidium bromide monoazide PCR method (EMA q-PCR). 8-oxo-2'-dexoyguanosine by ELISA was measured for oxidative stress.At a chitosan concentration of ≤.05%, the killing effect did not differ between the two molecular weights, and 100% bacterial removal rate was observed at a light energy ≥ 6.23 mJ/cm powers under .02% MB. After  min irradiation, LMW chitosan with high concentration of MB (.004%) showed highest killing effects, which were consistent with the results of EMA q-PCR but not with the level of 8-OHdG. Bactericidal effects of LMW chitosan plus PDT using .002 and .004% MB for  min irradiation were significantly higher than those using HMW chitosan plus PDT.We found that PDT using methylene blue with LMW chitosan to kill H. pylori exerted greater bactericidal effects through bacterial membrane damage than PDT with HMW chitosan.

We assessed whether, in obesity, derangement of energetics and diastolic function is further altered during acute cardiac stress.Normal- (body mass index, 22±2 kg/m(2); n=9-17) and obese (body mass index, 39±7 kg/m(2); n=17-46) subjects underwent assessment of diastolic left ventricular function (cine magnetic resonance imaging volume-time curve analysis) and cardiac energetics (phosphocreatine/ATP ratio; (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) at rest and during dobutamine stress (heart rate increase, 65±22% and 69±14%, respectively; P=.61). At rest, obesity was associated with a 22% lower peak filling rate (P<.001) and a % lower phosphocreatine/ATP ratio (1.73±.40 versus 2.03±.28; P=.048). Peak filling rate correlated with fat mass, left ventricular mass, leptin, waist-to-hip ratio, and phosphocreatine/ATP ratio. On multivariable analysis, phosphocreatine/ATP was the only independent predictor of peak filling rate (β=.50; P=.03).

In this secondary analysis of the GoalTracker trial, we describe outcomes of consistently self-monitoring in a standalone  loss intervention. The 12-week intervention focused on daily self-monitoring of diet and/or body  in a commercial app (MyFitnessPal). Participants (N = 100; 21-65 years; BMI 25-45 kg/m) were categorized as Consistent Trackers if they tracked ≥ 6 out of 7 days for at least 75% of the targeted weeks. One-fourth of participants were Consistent Trackers.

Internal motion is usually ignored, and NOESY cross-peak intensities are interpreted in terms of internuclear distances only. Off-resonance ROESY experiments measure a weighted average of NOE and ROE. The  can be described and experimentally set by an angle theta;. For large enough molecules, NOE and ROE have opposite signs. Therefore, each cross-peak intensity becomes zero for an angle theta;(). For any sample, the maximum angle theta;() is determined by the overall motion of the molecule. Smaller theta;() values reflect the angular component of internal motions. Because individual cross-peaks are analyzed, the method evaluates internal motions of individual H,H vectors. The reduction of theta;() is largest for internal motions on a time scale of 100-300 . The sensitivity of theta;() for internal motions decreases with increasing molecular . We estimate that detecting internal motions will be practicable for molecules up to about  kDa. We describe a protocol to measure theta;() from a series of off-resonance ROESY spectra. For such a series, we describe the choice of experimental parameters, a procedure to extract theta;() from the raw data, and the interpretation of theta;() in terms of internal motions. In the small protein BPTI, we analyzed 75 cross-peaks. The precision of theta;() was .25 degrees, as compared to typical reductions of theta;() of 3 degrees. We found a well-defined maximum theta;() for cross-peaks in rigid parts of the molecule, which reflects the overall motion of the molecule. For BPTI, also many structurally important long-range cross-peaks appear rigid. The lower theta;() values of long-range contacts involving methyl groups are consistent with methyl rotation on the 25- time scale. The lower theta;() values of the flexible C-terminus and of flexible side chains translate into upper limits for the angular order parameter of .4 and .5-.8, respectively. Off-resonance ROESY can monitor internal motions of H,H contacts that are used in a structure calculation. Because no isotope labeling is needed, off-resonance ROESY can be used to detect internal motions in a wide range of natural products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23379610>Hyaluronic acid affects the in vitro induction effects of synthetic PAMPS and PDMAAm hydrogels on chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells, depending on the level of concentration.</a></h1><p>It has been a common belief that articular cartilage tissue cannot regenerate in vivo. Recently, however, we have found that spontaneous hyaline cartilage regeneration can be induced in vivo by implanting a synthetic double-network (DN) hydrogel, which is composed of poly-(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) and poly-(N,N'-dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMAAm). However, the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been clarified. Recently, we have found that single-network PAMPS and PDMAAm gels can induce chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells in vitro even in a maintenance medium. In the in vivo condition, there is a strong possibility that the induction effect of the gel itself is enhanced by some molecules which exist in the joint. We have noticed that the joint fluid naturally contains hyaluronic acid (HA). The purpose of this study is to clarify in vitro effects of supplementation of HA on the differentiation effect of the PAMPS and PDMAAm gels.We cultured the ATDC5 cells on the PAMPS gel, the PDMAAm gel, and the polystyrene () dish surface with the maintenance medium without insulin for 7 days. HA having a molecular  of approximately 800 kDa was supplemented into the medium so that the concentration became .00, .01, .10, or 1.00 mg/mL. We evaluated the cultured cells with phase-contrast microscopy and PCR analyses.On the PAMPS gel, supplementation with HA of .01 and .10 mg/mL significantly increased expression of type-2 collagen mRNA (p = .0008 and p = .0413) and aggrecan mRNA (p = .0073 and p = .0196) than that without HA. On the PDMAAm gel, supplementation with HA of 1.00 mg/mL significantly reduced expression of these genes in comparison with the culture without HA (p = .0426 and p = .0218).The in vitro induction effects of the PAMPS and PDMAAm gels on chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells are significantly affected by HA, depending on the level of concentration. These results suggested that there is a high possibility that HA plays an important role in the in vivo spontaneous hyaline cartilage regeneration phenomenon induced by the PAMPS/PDMAAm DN gel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27856105>Weakening iliopsoas muscle in healthy adults may induce stiff knee pattern.</a></h1><p>The goal of the present study was to investigate the relationship between iliopsoas muscle group weakness and related hip joint velocity reduction and stiff-knee gait (SKG) during walking in healthy individuals.A load of 5% of each individual's body  was placed on non-dominant thigh of  neurologically intact, able-bodied participants (average age: 22.4 ± .81 years). For 33 min (135 s × 13 repetitions × 5 s rest), a passive stretch () was applied with the load in place until hip flexor muscle strength dropped from 5/5 to 3+/5 according to manual muscle test. All participants underwent gait analysis before and after  to compare sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle kinematics and kinetics and temporo-spatial parameters. Paired t-test was used to compare pre- and post-stretch findings and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to determine strength of correlation between SKG parameters and gait parameters of interest (p < .05).Reduced hip flexion velocity (mean: 21.5%; p = .005) was a contributor to SKG, decreasing peak knee flexion (PKF) (-20%; p = .0008), total knee range (-18.9%; p = .003), and range of knee flexion between toe-off and PKF (-26.7%; p = .001), and shortening duration between toe-off to PKF (-16.3%; p = .0005).These findings verify that any treatment protocol that slows hip flexion during gait by weakening iliopsoas muscle may have great potential to produce SKG pattern combined with reduced gait velocity.Copyright © 2016 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.

As IL-2 is the main lymphocyte growth factor, a phase III randomized multicenter trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of subcutaneous low-dose IL-2 added to standard chemotherapy (CT) on overall survival (OS) in advanced NSCLC patients. Patients (n=241) with histologically confirmed stage IIIb or IV non-operable NSCLC underwent stratified randomization on the basis of center, ECOG , stage of disease and percentage of  loss. Patients received gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 + cisplatin (100 mg/m2) on day 2 every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles [chemotherapy (CT) arm]. In the CT+IL-2 arm, patients also received low-dose subcutaneous IL-2 3,000,000 IU/die on days 3-5, 9-11, -17. The study had 90% power to detect a 20% absolute increase in 1-year OS with 118 patients/arm. An overall response (OR) rate of 12.8% (14% in the CT+IL-2 arm and 11.4% in CT arm) was observed. Stable disease was 70 and 66.7%, and progressive disease 16 and 21.8% in the CT+IL-2 and CT arms, respectively. No differences in response were found in any subgroup analysis. At a median follow-up of 32 months, 1-year OS was 45% for the CT+IL-2 arm vs. 51% for the CT arm (p=.456 log-rank).

Sixty birds of each of 4 strains were used. The 4 types represented a classic strain (A), 2 high-yield strains (B, C), and a roaster strain (D). Photostimulation (8L:16D to 14L:10D) was applied at 2 different ages (21 and 24 wk) to 30 birds of each strain type. Within each of the  periods,  birds of each strain were fed ad libitum (F), and the remaining  were feed-restricted (R) following a common feeding schedule. On the day that each bird had its first oviposition, its feed was withdrawn. It was euthanized the following morning by cervical dislocation and organs were collected. Of the 3 main effects, feeding program had the greatest effect on all the parameters measured. Within the 21-wk  treatment group, R birds reached onset of sexual maturity later than F birds (50.2+/-1.64 vs. 36.6+/-1.01 d, respectively). There were no differences in the age at sexual maturity between R and F birds for the 24-wk  treatment (28.9+/-.95 vs. 26.9+/-.85 for R and F, respectively). These results suggest that by 24 wk, all strains had reached a threshold BW and responded uniformly to  regardless of feeding program. Feed restriction reduced the number of large yellow follicles (LYF) (diameter >10 mm) (8.43+/-.23 vs. 9.65+/-.33 for R and F birds, respectively). Follicle number was not different between birds photostimulated at 21 or 24 wk (9.6+/-.33 vs. 8.45+/-.23, respectively).

Prespike "pedestals," reflecting exit of granule constituents via the fusion pore, were less frequently observed for ATP than for serotonin or GABA and the relative amplitude (amplitude of foot compared to spike) was smaller: in some cases the ATP-dependent pedestal was missing entirely. An inward tonic current, not dependent on glucose and inhibited by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist SR95531, was observed in beta cells in clusters of islet cells. Noise analysis indicated that it was due to the activity of individual channels with a conductance of 30 , the same as expected for individual GABA(A) Cl- channels with the ionic gradients used. We conclude that (a) LDCVs accumulate ATP and serotonin; (b) regulated release of GABA can be accounted for by exocytosis of a subset of insulin-containing LDCVs; (c) the fusion pore of LDCVs exhibits selectivity and compounds are differentially released depending on their chemical properties (including size); and (d) a glucose-independent nonvesicular form of GABA release exists in beta cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29379273>Quantifying the treatment goals of people recently diagnosed with schizophrenia using best-worst scaling.</a></h1><p>This study seeks to quantify the treatment goals of people recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and explore their impact on treatment plan.People aged 18-35 years with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia within the past 5 years were surveyed in the UK, Germany, and Italy. Treatment goals were assessed via a validated best-worst scaling instrument, where participants evaluated subsets of 13 possible treatment goals identified using a balanced incomplete block design. Participants identified the most and least important goals within each task. Data were also collected on current treatment and preference for daily oral versus long-acting injectable (LAI) treatment. Hierarchical Bayes was used to identify preference weights for the goals, and latent class analysis was used to identify segments of people with similar goals. The segments were compared with the current treatment and preference for oral versus LAI treatment.Across 100 participants, the average age was 26 years, 75% were male and 50% were diagnosed within 2 years ago. Overall, preferences were most favorable for reduced disease symptoms, think clearly, reduced hospitalizations, reduced anxiety, and take care of self. A total of 61% preferred oral medication and 39% LAI. Two groups were identified with different treatment goals; 50% of participants emphasized clinical goals, including reduced disease symptoms (preference  =19.7%), reduced hospitalizations (.5%), and reduced anxiety (10.5%). The other 50% emphasized functional goals, including improved relationships with family/friends (11.4%), increased interest in work (10.6%), experiencing a fuller range of emotions (8.4%), and ability to socialize (7.5%). Those emphasizing functional goals were more likely to be on LAI (44% versus 26%; =.059) and preferred LAI (46% versus 32%; =.151).People with recent-onset schizophrenia may focus more on clinical goals or functional goals, a discussion of which may help facilitate patient engagement.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23880275>A comparison of dentin cutting efficiency of 4 round-tipped ultrasonic instruments.</a></h1><p>Ultrasonic instruments are available for a variety of endodontic uses. Few published evaluations exist that compare the dentin cutting efficiency of endodontic ultrasonic tips. Furthermore, previous comparison studies often did not take into account 2 critical factors: clinically relevant downward forces and linear movement during use.Four different round-tipped ultrasonic tips were compared (n = 5 per tip group): BUC-1 (Obtura Spartan, Fenton, MO), BL-2 (B&L Biotech, Bala Cynwyd, PA), BL-3 (B&L Biotech), and START-X #2 (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). The tips were attached to a testing apparatus that applied a -g axial force and a linear movement during instrumentation of a human dentin specimen. Instrumentation was completed at the manufacturers' recommended power settings, and 3 of the tips were also compared at an equal power setting. Instrumentation consisted of 20-second cycles for a total of 6 minutes. Dentin specimens were weighed at baseline and after 2, 4, and 6 minutes of instrumentation. The dentin cutting efficiency was measured by the change in  of dentin specimens to the nearest .1 mg.A 1-factor analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc analysis of cumulative dentin removal (after 6 minutes of instrumentation) revealed a statistically significant difference among the 4 ultrasonic tips (P ≤ .0001) at the recommended , with the BUC-1 tip removing significantly more dentin across time. At an equal power setting, the BUC-1 was significantly more efficient than the BL-3; no difference was found between the BUC-1 and the BL-2.Within the limits of this study, the BUC-1 showed the greatest dentin removal. Adding a linear movement and a clinically relevant axial force allows better generalization to clinical applications.Copyright © 2013 American Association of Endodontists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that the effect of HIV infection will be uniform across all racial/ethnic groups.A cross-sectional analysis was performed comparing HIV- (NHANES 1999-2002) and ART-naïve HIV+ men (CPCRA 061). Regional subcutaneous fat area was estimated by skinfold caliper. Total body fat (TBF), fat-free mass (FFM), and body fat index (BFI) were derived by Durnin-Womersley formula (TBF-DW, FFM-DW, BFI [TBF-DW/height(2)]). Bioelectric impedance analyses (BIA) was used to assess TBF-BIA, FFM-BIA, and body cell mass (BCM).

Low glycaemic index (GI) diets benefit both maternal and neonatal gestational outcomes. We hypothesize that maternal dietary GI or glycaemic load (GL) changes during pregnancy impact placental DNA methylation, especially in insulin resistance-related genes.From a clinical trial of overweight pregnant women, 12 subjects who successfully reduced their GI and another 12 whose GI increased despite the intervention were selected. A genome-wide differential methylation analysis of placental tissue DNA was conducted, followed by bioinformatic annotation and validation analysis. The distribution of genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and CpG sites was described. Six CpG sites in regulatory regions of four insulin-related genes (, , , and ) were selectively validated by pyrosequencing. Pairwise Spearman correlation analysis was performed to test methylation-phenotype association in an additional 153 subjects from the same trial. Correlation between methylation of significant sites and placental mRNA expression of  was also analysed.Dietary GI decreased by 24.3 (26.2-20.1) in the group who responded appropriately to the intervention and increased by 19.6 (.2-29.1) in the comparison group. Epigenome-wide analysis identified 108 DMRs and 365 CpG sites with  < .05 adjusted by false discovery rate, distributed over all chromosomes. The methylation level of cg05009389 in the 3' UTR of  was negatively correlated with maternal  gain ( = - .21,  = .027) and increase in insulin levels ( = - .24,  = .015) during gestation. Methylation levels of cg17586860 and cg18197392 in the 5' UTR region of  were negatively correlated with changes in dietary carbohydrate intake ( = - .24, s ≤ .006) and GL across gestation ( = - .23, s ≤ .008). This correlation survived the adjustment for maternal factors such as dietary GI, body mass index, and gestational diabetes. Up to 89% of cg18197392 methylation was explained by GL change. Cg14631053 methylation correlated positively with mRNA expression of  in the placenta ( = .20,  = .037)We provide the first evidence that maternal dietary GI changes during gestation may impact placental DNA methylation of insulin regulation genes.

All of the smokers completed the University of São Paulo Reasons for Smoking Scale (USP-RSS). Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and spirometry was performed to screen for COPD.Of the 183 smokers, 105 (57.4%) were female, 138 (75.4%) were White, and 125 (63.8%) were in a low economic class. The mean level of education among the smokers was 9.6 ± 6.1 years. The mean smoking history was 29 ±  pack-years, 59% of the men having a ≥ 30 pack-year smoking history.

Participants judged the  status of a series of photographed healthy , overweight and obese (class I) Caucasian males and rated the extent to which they believed each male should consider losing .There was a strong tendency for both male and female participants to underestimate the  status of the photographed overweight and obese males. Photographed males were frequently perceived as being of healthier  than they actually were. Some modest cross-cultural differences were also observed; US participants were worse at recognising obesity than UK participants (p < .05) and were also significantly more likely to believe that the photographed obese males did not need to consider losing , in comparison to both the UK and Swedish participants ( < .05). No cross-cultural differences were observed for perceptions or attitudes towards the photographed healthy  or overweight males.The  status of overweight and obese (class I) Caucasian males is underestimated when judged by males and females using visual information alone. This study provides initial evidence of modest cross-cultural differences in attitudes toward, and the ability to recognise, obesity in Caucasian males.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29094443>Online Detection of Functional Groups in SEC via Quantum Cascade Laser IR Spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>The development of coupled techniques based on chemically sensitive detectors, such as FTIR or NMR spectrometers, for size exclusion chromatography (SEC) provides sophisticated methods for determining the molecular--dependent chemical composition in polymers.

We have shown recently that the proteasome inhibitor -341 inhibits growth, induces apoptosis, and overcomes drug resistance in human myeloma cells in vitro. In this study, we examined the efficacy, toxicity, and in vivo mechanism of action of -341 using a human plasmacytoma xenograft mouse model. One hundred immunodeficient (beige-nude-xid) mice were used in two independent experiments. The mice were injected s.c. with 3 x 10(7) RPMI-8226 myeloma cells. When tumors became measurable (9.2 days; range, 6-13 days after tumor injection), mice were assigned to treatment groups receiving -341 .05 mg/kg (n = 13), .1 mg/kg (n = ), .5 mg/kg (n = 14), or 1. mg/kg (n = 14) twice weekly via tail vein, or to control groups (n = 13) receiving the vehicle only. Significant inhibition of tumor growth, even with some complete tumor regression, was observed in -341-treated mice. The median overall survival was also significantly prolonged compared with controls (30 and 34 days for high dose-treated mice versus 14 days for controls; P < .0001). -341 was well tolerated up to .5 mg/kg, but some mice treated at 1. mg/kg became moribund and lost . Analysis of tumors harvested from treated animals showed that -341 induced apoptosis and decreased angiogenesis in vivo. These studies therefore demonstrate that -341 has significant in vivo antimyeloma activity at doses that are well tolerated in a murine model, confirming our in vitro data and further supporting the early clinical promise of -341 to overcome drug resistance and improve patient outcome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269932>A score model based on pancreatic steatosis and fibrosis and pancreatic duct diameter to predict postoperative pancreatic fistula after Pancreatoduodenectomy.</a></h1><p>To establish a scoring model for the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) following pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).PD Patients from 7 institutions in 2 independent sets: developmental (n = 457) and validation cohort (n = 152) were retrospectively enrolled and analyzed.

Migration of tumour cells through 8 microm pore membranes was reduced by 60-93% when the PC-3 cells were in  media, as compared with a 67% increase after cholesterol supplementation.  supplementation reduced the binding of PC-3 cells to laminin by -38% and fibronectin by 23% while cholesterol increased binding to type IV collagen by 36%. It was concluded that  indirectly (in vivo as a dietary supplement) and directly (in tissue culture media) inhibited the growth and metastasis of PC-3 cells. beta-Sitosterol was more effective than campesterol in offering this protection in most of the parameters studied.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29361275>Individuals with varus thrust do not increase knee adduction when running with body borne load.</a></h1><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common occupational hazard for service members. This study quantified how body borne load impacts knee biomechanics for participants who do and do not present varus thrust (range of knee adduction motion exhibited from heel strike to mid-stance (-51%)) during over-ground running. Eighteen (9 varus thrust and 9 control) military personnel had knee biomechanics recorded when running with three load conditions (light, ∼6 kg, medium, % BW, and heavy, 30% BW). Subject-based means for knee biomechanics were calculated and submitted to a RM ANOVA to test the main effects and possible interactions between load and varus thrust group. The varus thrust group exhibited greater varus thrust (p = .001) and peak stance (, -100%) knee adduction (p = .009) posture compared to the control group with the light load, but not for the medium (p = .741 and p = .825) or heavy loads (p = .142 and p = .429). With the heavy load, varus thrust group reduced varus thrust (p = .023), whereas, the control group increased varus thrust (p = .037) compared to the light load, and increased  knee adduction moment compared to light (p = .006) and medium loads (p = .031). The varus thrust group, however, exhibited no significant difference in knee adduction moment between any load (p = .174). With the addition of body borne load, varus thrust participants exhibited a significant reduction in knee biomechanics related to OA; whereas, control participants adopted knee biomechanics, including greater varus thrust and knee adduction moment, related to the development of OA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Self-closure of these defects in patients with defects less than 8 mm has been reported in several studies. In children, transcatheter closure of the ASD is suggested for asymptomatic patients older than two years and with  >  kg. The purpose of this study was to show that transcatheter closure of ASD in small children with body  less than 10 kg is an effective and safe method.Between July 2016 and September 2018, 35 children with body  less than 10 kg underwent percutaneous closure of ASD using amplatzer. All patients had minimum defect size of 6 mm, pulmonary blood flow (Qp) to systemic blood flow (Qs) ratio above 1.5, right atrial and ventricular dilation, symptoms of delayed growth, and recurrent respiratory infections in their evaluation and had acceptable rims for intervention. Follow-up evaluations were done 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and yearly after discharge with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and electrocardiography (ECG).The mean age of patients at procedure was 12.06 ± 4.47 months (range: 6 to 14 months), mean  was 8.32 ± .72 kg (range: 7.5 to 9.8 kg). The mean defect size was 10.00 ± 2.32 mm (range: 6-13 mm). The mean device size used was 10.57 ± 2.57 mm (range: 7.5 to  mm). Mean duration of follow-up was 16.66 ± 6.93 months (range: 1-29 months). Respiratory rate, heart rate, pulmonary stenosis (), and Qp to Qs ratio had significant difference before and after procedure during the follow up (P < .001).Transcatheter closure of ASD with amplatzer in symptomatic small children and infants is a safe and effective treatment associated with excellent success, but long-term follow-up in a large number of patients would be warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575498>Dorsiflexion and dynamic postural control deficits are present in those with chronic ankle instability.</a></h1><p>To determine if differences in -bearing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (DFROM) and Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) reach distances were present between participants with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and healthy individuals. A secondary objective was to re-examine the relationship between these measures in participants with and without CAI.Case-control.Thirty participants with CAI were matched to 30 healthy participants. All participants performed maximum reach in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral directions of the SEBT; as well as, the -Bearing Lunge Test (WBLT) to measure DFROM. Dependent variables included maximal DFROM (cm) and normalized SEBT reach distances (%). Independent t-tests were used for group comparisons (a priori p ≤ .05). Simple-linear regression examined the relationship between the WBLT and each SEBT direction.Significant differences were detected between groups for the WBLT (CAI: 10.73 ± 3.44 cm, healthy: 12.47 ± 2.51 cm; p=.03) and anterior reach distance (CAI: 76.05 ± 6.25%, healthy: 80.12 ± 5.88%; p=.01). No differences were identified in posteromedial or posterolateral (>.70) reach. The WBLT had a significant moderate correlation to anterior reach in both groups (<.05) but was not significantly correlated to posteromedial or posterolateral reach distance (>.70).The results indicate that participants with CAI demonstrated less DFROM and anterior SEBT reach distance compared to health controls. Additionally, both groups demonstrated similar correlations between WBLT and SEBT performance. These findings suggest that participants with CAI have alterations in ankle motion which may negatively influence dynamic postural control; however, the relationship between WBLT and SEBT performance is consistent in those with and without CAI.Copyright © 2012 Sports Medicine Australia.

Pre- and postoperative symptoms were quantified using the Eckardt scoring system. Barium swallow and esophagogastroscopy were performed before and after POEM, respectively. Esophageal motility was evaluated in all patients, both preoperatively and one month after POEM treatment, using a high-resolution manometry system. Manometry data, Eckardt scores, lower esophageal sphincter pressure and barium swallow results were used to evaluate the effect of the procedure.POEM was successfully completed for all patients. The mean procedure time was 55.4 ± 17.3 min and the mean total length of myotomy of the circular esophagus was 10.5 ± 2.6 cm. No specific complications occurred, with the exception of two patients that developed asymptomatic pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Clinical improvement in symptoms was achieved in all patients. Approximately 77.5% of patients experienced  gain 6 mo after POEM, with an average of 4.78 kg (range: 2- kg). The lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure, four second integrated relaxation pressure and Eckardt scores were all significantly reduced after POEM ( < .05). A small segment of proximal esophageal peristalsis appeared postoperatively in two patients, but without normal esophageal peristalsis. The average diameter of the esophageal lumen decreased significantly from 4.39 to 3.09 cm (P < .01).POEM can relieve achalasia symptoms, improve gastroesophageal junction relaxation and restore esophageal body motility function, but not normal esophageal peristalsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22692091>Child mortality levels and trends by HIV status in Blantyre, Malawi: 1989-2009.</a></h1><p>Continuous evaluation of child survival is needed in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV prevalence among women of reproductive age continues to be high. We examined mortality levels and trends over a period of ∼20 years among HIV-unexposed and -exposed children in Blantyre, Malawi.Data from 5 prospective cohort studies conducted at a single research site from 1989 to 2009 were analyzed. In these studies, children born to HIV-infected and -uninfected mothers were enrolled at birth and followed longitudinally for at least 2 years. Information on sociodemographic, HIV infection status, survival, and associated risk factors was collected in all studies. Mortality rates were estimated using birth-cohort analyses stratified by maternal and infant HIV status. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine risk factors associated with mortality.The analysis included 8286 children. From 1989 to 1995, overall mortality rates (per 100 person-years) in these clinic-based cohorts remained comparable among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers (range 3.3-6.9) or to HIV-infected mothers (range 2.5-7.5). From 1989 to 2009, overall mortality remained high among all children born to HIV-infected mothers (range 6.3-19.3) and among children who themselves became infected (range .6-57.4, 1994-2009). Only lower birth  was consistently and significantly (P < .05) associated with higher child mortality.HIV infection among mothers and children contributed to high levels of child mortality in the African setting in the pretreatment era.

and sleeping rate induced by a subthreshold dose of pentobarbital sodium were recorded in the mice,
and the composition of moxa smoke was analyzed using headspace gas chromatography (GC-HS).A low concentration of smoke significantly decreased the frequency of locomotor activities
and the time for which the mice remaining on the rotarod; however, a high smoke concentration significantly
prolonged the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time and sleeping rate.The concentration-dependent relaxing effects of moxa smoke on the Central Nervous
System (CNS) were confirmed. Moreover, GC-HS analysis showed that the component present in the
highest concentration in moxa smoke was eucalyptol, an essential oil well recognized for its soothing
effects on the CNS. This may therefore be accountable for the sedative effects of moxa smoke.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18534487>In vivo comparison of knee kinematics for subjects having either a posterior stabilized or cruciate retaining high-flexion total knee arthroplasty.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo kinematics for subjects having either a fixed posterior stabilized () or cruciate retaining (CR) high-flexion total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Whether similar CRT is also effective for conditioning of persons with chronic tetraplegia is unknown. In addition, protein supplementation () before and immediately postexercise has been shown to enhance exercise adaptations.This study aimed to investigate whether a modified 40-45 min CRT program will improve fitness attributes in individuals with tetraplegia and whether these changes are enhanced by .Eleven individuals with chronic tetraplegia underwent 6 months of CRT performed three times per week. Six randomly assigned participants received  (whey protein = 36-37 g) in split doses immediately before and after exercise sessions. Others consumed a matched protein dose 24 h postexercise. Measurements of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength for six different resistance exercises, arm peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and arm anaerobic power (Wingate) were obtained 3 months before (-3mo), at the beginning (0mo), 3 months into (3mo), and 6 months after (6mo) the beginning of CRT.One-repetition maximum increased by 8%-11% ± 6%-12% for each successive 3-month period (P ≤ .001-.012), independent of  group (P = .105).

The structural similarity in respect of the aromatic ring between the dispersed phase, styrene, and the surfactants facilitates solubilization of styrene up to four times the  of LEP and 11 times that of LET. We propose that the solubilization site varies between core in the LEP and shell in the LET micelles. LET affords double emulsions, water in oil in water (w/o/w) over a narrow phase composition, for example at R=7., where R represents ratio of  of styrene to LET. A schematic model depicting the solubilization site of styrene at different regions in LET and LEP micelles has been proposed. On polymerization, the emulsions with LET and LEP micelles generated high molecular  polymer nanoparticles of size 12-49 nm with low polydispersity index (P(d)). This demonstrates that micellar assemblies act as templating controlled reactors for the polymerization reaction. We demonstrate that  nanoparticle dispersion of size 49 nm with polymer  fraction as high as 42.80% could be produced from emulsions with the LET surfactant, in contrast to LEP that is 50% less efficient. Polymerization of these emulsions occurs predominantly through a micellar nucleation mechanism. It is significant to note that under the same conditions, the control experiments with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) micelles resulted in polymers with broad distribution, P(d)>3. in molecular .Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Data of infants with RDS and age ≤3 days admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of participated hospitals from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 were collected by using descriptive epidemiologic survey methodology. The investigation included the basic information of children, perinatal risk factors, clinical manifestations and treatment, complications and prognosis.Of the 17 406 infants admitted to the 20 hospitals under investigation, 580 neonates (3.3%) suffered from RDS and 379 (65.3%) of them were males. Their average gestational age (GA) was (33.±2.9) weeks and birth  (BW) was (1 956±647)g. The average age of their mothers was (28±5) years, 19 (3.3%) infants with RDS were conceived with assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The selective cesarean section rate of mothers with gestational age ≥ 37 weeks was 59.3 % (51/86). The median duration and cost of the hospitalization were 13 (6., 21.) days and 14 200 (6 800, 23 200) yuan. The common perinatal risk factors in the order of occurrence rate were 33.1% (192/580) cases of birth asphyxia, 19.7% (114 /580) cases of multiple births, 17.8% (103/580) cases of gestational hypertension, .2% (88/580) cases of fetal distress, 13.3% (77/580) cases of premature rupture, 5.7% (33/580) cases of placental abruption, 1.6% (9/580) cases of gestational diabetes, 1.4% (8/580) cases of intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy; 23.6% (33/140) cases in Gansu were treated with antenatal steroids, 12.1% (8/66) cases in Xinjiang and 9.4% (25/265) cases in Shaanxi. Shaanxi had the highest rate of applying pulmonary surfactant () and intubate-surfactant-extubate to CPAP (INSURE), 61.6% (226/367) and 57.3% (142/248) respectively, but they had the lowest dosage of  (80±43) mg/kg. Hospitals in Shaanxi used CPAP as the major assisted ventilation mode (87.5%, 294/336), with the maximum ventilation duration, the median was 67. (43.7, 108.7) hours. Hospitals in Xinjiang had the lowest rate of applying  and INSURE, 27.3% (18/66) and 19.6% (10/51) cases respectively, but they had the largest dosage of  (170±32) mg/kg. In Xinjiang, conventional mechanical ventilation was used as the major assisted ventilation mode (60.5%, 23/28) and the median of ventilation duration 24.

The total mortality rate of RDS infants was 14.7% (85/580). Of the 85, 65 died after abandoning of treatment, accounting for 76.5%. The abandoning rate in Xinjiang was much higher (59.1%, 39/66) than those in Shaanxi (8.7%, 32/367) and Gansu (18.4%, 27/147). The difference was statistically significant (χ(2)=21.237, P<.05).The infants with RDS have greater average gestational age and . Problems found include incomplete prenatal examination, the high elective cesarean section rate of full-term infants with RDS, the low antepartum application rate of antenatal steroids, the non-standard use of , the low level of using INSURE, inadequate knowledge of complications as well as underdeveloped examination methods.

In total, nine hundred 1-day-old mixed sex broilers (Ross-308) were randomly distributed over 6 (2 × 3) experimental diets comprising 5 replicates of 30 broilers each for 35 d. The experimental diets contain either soybean meal (SBM) or canola meal (CM) with 3 levels (100, 110, and 120% of NRC recommendation) of d-Thr. During the course of the trial ( to 35 D), interactions (P < .05) between  and d-Thr were observed for feed intake (FI), body  gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass, and gut health parameters. The broilers fed recommended level (100%) of d-Thr had 7 and 5% poorer FCR compared with those fed diets with 110 and 120% d-Thr, respectively. For villus height (VH), an interaction (P = .007) was found between  and d-Thr level. Broilers consuming SBM diets had 22% longer villi, 10% deeper crypts, and 30% greater VH to crypt depth ratio (VCR) compared to those fed CM. The broilers fed 110% d-Thr diets had 9% lower crypt depth (CD) and % greater VCR compared with those fed diets containing NRC recommended levels. CM resulted in 9% lower protein digestibility with lower (P < .05) of some AA, whereas it was improved by 7% in broilers fed 120% d-Thr supplemented diets.

In our study, we evaluated the survival results and prognostic factors among T4 local advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) patients in a large heterogeneous group, in accordance with this new system.We retrospectively evaluated the files of 122 T4 N0-3 M0 LA-NSCLC patients, identified according to the new staging system, treated at two centers between November 2003 and June 2012. Variables correlating with univariate survival at p<.20 were later included in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Here, selection of relevant predictors of survival was carried out in accordance with the likelihood ratio formula with p<.05 regarded as significant.The median age was 60 and the median follow-up period was 17.4 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months, the 1 year overall survival (OS) rate was 72%, and the 5 year OS rate was 28%. Statistically significant predictors of survival were (p<.20) ECOG- (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status), age, T4 factor subgroup, stage and primary treatment in OS univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis for OS ECOG- (p=.001), diagnostic stage (p=.021), and primary treatment (p=.004) were significant. In the group receiving non-curative treatment, the median OS was 11. months, while it was 19. months in the definitive RT group and 26.6 months in the curative treatment group. There was a significant difference between the non-curative group and the groups which had definitive RT and curative operations (respectively p<.001 and p=.001) in terms of OS, but not between the groups which had definitive RT and curative operations. The median event free survival (EFS) rate was 9.9 months, with rates of 46% and 19% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. On univariate analysis of EFS rate with ECOG-,  loss and staging, statistical significance was found only for thorax computerized tomography (CT)+18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) use, stage and primary treatment (p<.20). In multivariate analysis with EFS, only the primary treatment was statistically significant (p=.001). In the group receiving non-curative treatment, the median EFS was 10.5 months while in the curative operation group it was 14.7 months. When all the primary treatment groups were taken into consideration, grade III/IV side effect was observed in 57 patients (46.6%). Esophagitis was most prominent among those that received definitive radiotherapy.Independent prognostic factors among these 122 heterogeneous LA-NSCLC T4 N0-3 M0 patients were age at diagnosis, ECOG-, stage and primary treatment, the last also being a significant prognostic indicator of EFS. Our findings point to the importance of appropriate staging and a multidisciplinary approach with modern imaging methods in this patient group. In those with T4 lesions, treatment selection and the effective use of curative potential should be the most important goal of clinical care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22866046>Momentary assessment of adults' physical activity and sedentary behavior: feasibility and validity.</a></h1><p>Mobile phones are ubiquitous and easy to use, and thus have the capacity to collect real-time data from large numbers of people. Research tested the feasibility and validity of an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) self-report protocol using electronic surveys on mobile phones to assess adults' physical activity and sedentary behaviors.Adults (N = 110; 73% female, 30% Hispanic, 62% overweight/obese) completed a 4-day signal-contingent EMA protocol (Saturday-Tuesday) with eight surveys randomly spaced throughout each day. EMA items assessed current activity (e.g., Watching TV/Movies, Reading/Computer, Physical Activity/Exercise). EMA responses were time-matched to minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary activity (SA) measured by accelerometer immediately before and after each EMA prompt.Unanswered EMA prompts had greater MVPA (± min) than answered EMA prompts (p = .029) for under/normal  participants, indicating that activity level might influence the likelihood of responding. The -min. intervals before versus after the EMA-reported physical activity (n = 296 occasions) did not differ in MVPA (p > .05), suggesting that prompting did not disrupt physical activity. SA decreased after EMA-reported sedentary behavior (n = 904 occasions; p < .05) for overweight and obese participants. As compared with other activities, EMA-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior had significantly greater MVPA and SA, respectively, in the ± min of the EMA prompt ( < .001), providing evidence for criterion validity.Findings generally support the acceptability and validity of a 4-day signal-contingent EMA protocol using mobile phones to measure physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults.

Gel electrophoresis showed that some of the high molecular  proteins (>45 kDa) present in HPM were not well extracted by the alkali and were absent or present in low ratio in the HPI polypeptide profile. The amino acid composition showed that the isolation process increased the Arg/Lys ratio of HPI (5.52%) when compared to HPM (3.35%). Intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism data indicate that the HPI proteins had a well-defined structure at pH 3., which was lost as pH value increased. The differences in structural conformation of HPI at different pH values were reflected as better foaming capacity at pH 3. when compared to pH 5., 7., and 9.. At 10 and 25 mg/mL protein concentrations, emulsions formed by the HPM had smaller oil droplet sizes (higher quality), when compared to the HPI-formed emulsions. In contrast at 50 mg/mL protein concentration, the HPI-formed emulsions had smaller oil droplet sizes (except at pH 3.). We conclude that the functional properties of hemp seed protein products are dependent on structural conformations as well as protein concentration and pH.© 2014 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19113134>Temperature dependence of the free volume from positron lifetime experiments and its relation to structural dynamics: phenylphthalein-dimethylether.</a></h1><p>Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was used to study the microstructure of the free volume in the temperature range between 103 K and 393 K in phenylphthalein-dimethylether (PDE), a low-molecular- glass former. Using the routine LIFETIME9., the ortho-positronium (o-) lifetime distribution was analyzed, and from this, the volume distribution gn(vh) of subnanometer-size holes was calculated. From a comparison of PALS and specific volume data, the number density and the volume fraction of holes were estimated. These free-volume data, as a function of temperature, were used to test the validity of the Cohen-Turnbull (CT) free-volume theory. It was found that the structural relaxation from dielectric spectroscopy can be described by the CT theory after introducing a corrected free volume (Vf-DeltaV), where DeltaV=.014 cm3/g. The extended free-volume theory of Cohen and Grest can be fitted to the dielectric-relaxation and free-volume data, but the parameters of both fits are not consistent. PDE shows some peculiar features. The "knee" in the o - lifetime expansion and crossover in temperature dependence of the frequency of the primary dielectric relaxation process occur at different temperatures. In addition, the change in the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann parameters at TB/Tg=1.1 has no observable effect on the mean free volume vh (or Vf). The size of the smallest representative freely fluctuating subsystem, VSV estimated from the standard deviation sigmah of gn(vh), decreases from 4.1 nm3 to 2.6 nm3 when the temperature increases from T/Tg=1. to 1.. Correspondingly, the length of dynamic heterogeneity, xi=VVS1/3, decreases from 1.6 nm to 1.4 nm. It is concluded that at T/Tg approximately 1.10=TB/Tg the system transforms from a heterogeneous to a homogeneous (true) liquid.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23085329>Fruit and vegetable intake and eating behaviors mediate the effect of a randomized text-message based  loss program.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that fruit/vegetable intake and eating behaviors mediate the relationship between experimental condition and  loss in a randomized trial evaluating a text-message based  loss program.Overweight/obese individuals from San Diego, CA (N = 52 with complete data) were randomly assigned in 2007 into one of two groups for four months: 1) the intervention group that received 2-5  management text-messages p/day; 2) the usual-care comparison group. Three 24-hour recalls assessed fruit/vegetable intake change and the eating behavior inventory (EBI) measured change in eating behaviors. Regression path models tested intervention mediation.Direct effects of the intervention were found for change in body  (b = -3.84, R(2) = .074), fruit/vegetable intake (b = 2.00, R(2) = .083), and EBI scores (b = 7., R(2) = .229) ( < .05). The treatment group to  change path was not statistically significant (b = -.673, R(2) = .208) when fruit/vegetable intake change and EBI score change were specified as intervention mediators in the model. The total indirect effect was 3.17 lb indicating that the indirect paths explained 82.6% of the total effect on  change.Fruit/vegetable intake and eating behaviors mediated the intervention's effect on  change. The findings suggest that sending text-messages that promote healthy eating strategies resulted in moderate short-term  loss.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A critical need exists to develop and test the psychometrics of brief quantitative tools for minority pediatric populations.To modify the adult beverage intake questionnaire (BEVQ-) for Hispanic preschool-aged children (BEVQ-) and test its validity and test-retest reliability in children aged 3 to 5 years.Cross-sectional. The modified quantitative 12-beverage category questionnaire assessed consumption of water, fruit juice, sweetened juice drinks, whole milk, reduced-fat milk, low-fat milk, flavored milk, carbonated sweetened drinks, diet carbonated drinks, sweet tea, tea with or without artificial sweetener, and sport drinks consumed during the past month. Hispanic mothers (n=109) recruited from day-care centers provided one 4-day food intake record (FIR) and completed two BEVQ- surveys during a 2-week period for their preschool-aged child. Data collection was conducted through one-on-one interviews in Spanish. Validity was assessed by comparing amounts (in grams) and energy intake (in kilocalories) for each beverage category between the first BEVQ- and the mean of the FIRs using paired t tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Criteria for validity were nonsignificant mean differences in grams and kilocalories from the first BEVQ- and mean of the FIRs beverage categories, and significant correlation coefficients between beverage categories. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing grams and kilocalories for each beverage category in the first BEVQ- with those from the second BEVQ- using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The criterion for reliability was a significant correlation coefficient between beverage categories. Significance was set at P<.05.Mean differences between the first BEVQ- and FIR for water (42.4±23.1 g), sweetened juice drinks (-1.6±11. g), whole milk (18.3±9.91 g), sweetened carbonated drinks (-13.±7.9 g), and total sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) (1.4±8.9 g) were not significantly different, but were significantly correlated (r=.20 to .37; P<.05). Thus, validity criteria were met. With the exception of flavored milk and tea with or without artificial sweeteners, the remaining beverage categories-total beverages and SSB-in the first BEVQ- were correlated with those from the second BEVQ- (r=.20 to .68; P<.05), meeting reliability criteria.Researchers and clinicians may use the BEVQ- to assess SSB, water, and whole-milk intake in Hispanic children. Additional modifications should be evaluated to assess total beverage intake.Copyright © 2016 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A chi-square test was used to compare variables. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Of the 844 patients, 117 (13.9%) were women and 727 (86.1%) were men. Adenocarcinoma was more common in women than in men (p<.0001). There were more women non-smokers than men (p<.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in ECOG ,  loss>10%, stage, LDH, albumin and treatment between women and men. Women younger than 65 years (17. vs 12. months; p=.03), who had adenocarcinoma histology (. vs 10. months; p=.006) and who had a hemoglobin level≥12 g/dL (18. vs 12. months; p=.01) were found to have a better median OS rate than men. Median OS rates were found to be 13. months in females and 12. months in males (p=.14). Among metastatic patients, the median OS was 11. months in females and 8. months in males (p=.005). Among stage IIIB and stage IV patients who had first line platinum-based chemotherapy, the median OS was 17. months in women and 11. months in men (p=.002). The response rate of chemotherapy was higher in women than in men (p=.03).In our study, we found that survival duration is longer and chemotherapy response is better in women with NSCLC who do not have anemia or comorbidities and who are mostly non-smokers with adenocarcinomas. Further studies regarding the causes of these differences may provide clarity on this subject.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237801>Adolescent Loss-of-Control Eating and  Loss Maintenance After Bariatric Surgery.</a></h1><p>Loss-of-control (LOC) eating is common in adults undergoing bariatric surgery and is associated with poorer  outcomes. Its long-term course in adolescent bariatric surgery patients and associations with  outcomes are unclear.Adolescents ( = 234; age range = 13-19 years) undergoing bariatric surgery across 5 US sites were assessed for postsurgery follow-up at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. Descriptive statistics and generalized linear mixed models were used to describe the prevalence of LOC eating episodes involving objectively large amounts of food and continuous eating, respectively. Generalized linear mixed models investigated the association of any LOC eating with short- and long-term BMI changes.At baseline, objectively large LOC eating was reported by .4% of adolescents, and continuous LOC eating by 27.8% of adolescents. Both forms of LOC eating were significantly lower at all postsurgical time points relative to presurgery (range = .5%-14.5%; s < .05). However, both behaviors gradually increased from 6-month to 4-year follow-up (s < .05). Presurgical LOC eating was not related to percent BMI change over follow-up ( = .79). However, LOC eating at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up was associated with lower percent BMI change from baseline at the next consecutive assessment (s < .05).Although presurgical LOC eating was not related to relative  loss after surgery, postoperative LOC eating may adversely affect long-term  outcomes. Rates of LOC eating decreased from presurgery to 6-months postsurgery but increased thereafter. Therefore, this behavior may warrant additional empirical and clinical attention.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481514>Total knee arthroplasty in valgus knees: predictive preoperative parameters influencing a constrained design selection.</a></h1><p>In valgus knees, ligament balance might remain a challenge at total knee prostheses implantation; this leads some authors to systematically propose the use of constrained devices (constrained condylar knee or hinge types...). It is possible to adapt the selected level of constraints, by reserving higher constraints to cases where it is not possible to obtain final satisfactory balance: less than 5 degrees of residual frontal laxity in extension in each compartment, and a tibiofemoral gap difference not in excess to 3 mm between flexion and extension.It is possible to establish preoperative criteria that can predict a constrained design prosthetic implantation at surgery.A consecutive series of 93 total knee prostheses, implanted to treat a valgus deformity of more than 5 degrees was retrospectively analysed. Preoperatively, full  bearing long axis AP views A-P were performed: hip knee angle (HKA) averaged 195 degrees (186 degrees to 226 degrees), 36 knees had more than  degrees of valgus, and 19 others more than 20 degrees of valgus. Laxity was measured by stress radiographies with a Telos system at 100 N. Fifty-two knees had preoperative laxity in the coronal plane of more than 10 degrees. Fourteen knees had more than 5 degrees laxity on the convex (medial) side, 21 knees had more than 10 degrees laxity on the concave (lateral) side. Statistical assessment, using univariate analysis, identified the factors that led, at surgery, to an elevated constraint selection level; these factors of independence were tested by multivariate analysis. Logistical regression permitted the classification of the said factors by their odds ratios (OR).High-constraints prostheses (CCK type) numbered 26 out of 93 implantations; the other total knee prostheses were regular posterostabilized () prostheses. Statistically, the preoperative factors that led to the choice of a constrained prosthesis were: (1) valgus severity as measured by HKA (=193 degrees, CCK=198 degrees), (2) increased posterior tibial slope (=4.8 degrees, CCK=6.5 degrees), (3) low patellar height (using Blackburne and Peel index =.89, CCK=.77), (4) severity of laxity in valgus (=2.3 degrees, CCK=4.3 degrees). Among all these factors, the only independent one was laxity in valgus (convex side laxity) (p=.0008). OR analysis showed a two-fold increased probability of implanting an elevated constraints prosthesis for each one degree increment of laxity in valgus.This study demonstrated that it was not the valgus angle severity but rather the convex medial side laxity that increased the frequency of constrained prostheses implantation. Other factors, as a low patellar height or an elevated posterior tibial slope, when associated, potentiate this possible prosthetic switch (to higher constraints) and should make surgeons aware, in these situations, of encountering difficulties when establishing ligament balance.Therapeutic retrospective study.2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Anesthesia personnels were required to fill up patient-related, surgical-related, anesthesia-related variables and adverse outcomes on a strutured data entry form. The data included preanesthetic evaluation intraoperative period and 24 hr postoperative period. Adverse events specific form was recorded when adverse events occurred. All data were keyed in data management unit with double entry technique and descriptive statistics was used in the first phase of this study.A total of 163403 consecutive cases were recorded in one year.

At baseline, the AEX+WL group consumed slightly more protein than the WL group (P<.01). Macronutrient intake did not change following AEX+WL, but the WL group decreased their fat intake and increased their carbohydrates and protein intakes (<.05), which resulted in similar macronutrient intakes between groups post-intervention. Weekday total activity counts decreased 22% (P<.05) following WL. This change tended (P=.07) to be different than the lack of change in non-structured activity observed following AEX+WL.Although similar dietary adherence was observed, these data suggest that postmenopausal women undergoing  loss may benefit from the addition of exercise to prevent the decline in non-structured activity observed following  loss alone.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14725967>Neural plasticity is impaired in cold-exposed hippocampal slices from senescent but not from age-matched presenescent F344 rats.</a></h1><p>Near the end of their natural life, many mammals enter a terminal state identifiable by a rapid loss of body  resulting from hypophagia. This study extends characterization of this senescent state by comparing viability of metabolic mechanisms supporting neural plasticity in hippocampal slices from 24 to 30 month old senescent and age-matched presenescent (body- stable) F344 male rats. Half of the slices from each rat were incubated at 22-23 degrees C, and half were immersed in cool incubation medium (12- degrees C) immediately after slicing and allowed to passively warm to room temperature over approximately 50 min to impose a cold stressor on recovery mechanisms. Following incubation, CA1 pyramidal cell population spike () amplitudes were measured before and after tetanus. In slices incubated at 22-23 degrees C, the 221.+/-24.2 % increase in  amplitude following tetanus in seven slices from five senescent rats was not significantly different from the 202.5+/-23.8% increase in six slices from five age-matched presenescent rats. In contrast, in cold-exposed slices, the 133.8+/-13.1% increase in  amplitude following tetanus in 14 slices from 10 senescent rats was significantly smaller (p<.05) than the 184.7+/-10.2% increase in 13 slices from seven age-matched presenescent rats. This smaller  enhancement in senescent rats cannot be attributed to  loss because robust potentiation was induced in cold-exposed slices from five food-restricted presenescent rats having a  loss comparable to their senescent counterparts. Thus, the blunted enhancement observed in cold-exposed slices appears to be a characteristic of senescence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845477>Plasma concentrations of dasatinib have a clinical impact on the frequency of dasatinib dose reduction and interruption in chronic myeloid leukemia: an analysis of the DARIA 01 study.</a></h1><p>Dasatinib has shown promising anti-leukemic activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, patients receiving dasatinib frequently require dose reductions and treatment interruptions (treatment alteration).We prospectively analyzed the frequency and significance of treatment alteration during dasatinib therapy in patients with CML. In all patients, trough plasma concentrations of dasatinib (C) at steady state were assessed on day 28 of therapy.28% of patients had their doses reduced at a median of 42 days, and 25% of patients had temporarily interrupted at a median of 54 days after treatment initiation.

Forty-five sedentary adolescent boys (13-14 years old) were separated in three groups according to the percentage of fat mass as follows:  normal-weight (NW) (body fat: 16. ± 1.9%),  overweight (OW) (body fat: 24. ± 1.6%), and  obese (OB) (body fat: 31. ± 3.%). All groups completed an incremental cycle exercise to exhaustion in which energy consumption (E, W), ME (%), lipid oxidation rate (LO, %), plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were determined consecutively at rest and at three intensity levels corresponding to 50 and 75% of each participant's maximal heart rate (50%HRmax and 75%HRmax) and peak  consumption (  O). During the incremental cycle exercise test, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine responses as well as ME determined at 50%HRmax, 75%HRmax, and at VO stages were significantly lower in OB compared to NW and OW individuals ( < .01). Multiple linear regressions showed that body weight (ß = -.64,  < .001), energy consumption (ß = -.24,  < .05) and lipid oxidation (ß = .69,  < .01) were significant predictors of ME at 50%HRmax. However, at 75%HRmax and  O, significant predictors of ME were epinephrine (ß = .34, ß = .49, respectively,  = .01), norepinephrine (ß = .26, ß = .60, respectively,  < .05) and power output (ß = .62, ß = .71, respectively,  < .01). These findings suggest that excess in body weight exerts a negative effect on ME at a low intensity by increasing energy consumption for obese and overweight adolescent boys, while at higher intensities (75%HRmax and VO) the lower ME could be better explained by the lower power output and catecholamine responses that were attenuated among obese and overweight adolescent boys.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086487>Characteristics of  Loss Trajectories in a Comprehensive Lifestyle Intervention.</a></h1><p>Focusing on average  loss (WL) from interventions provides useful efficacy data but masks large variability across patients.

Parameters used in latent class analyses were percent WL (%WL),  nadir, number of weekly  gains, maximum weekly percent  gain, standard deviation of weekly  changes, linear slope values, and change in slope.Average %WL was 9.73%. Latent class analyses revealed three groups with considerable overlap in %WL ranges but differing significantly on all trajectory parameters ( < .001). Group 1 had the most variable and least successful pattern of  changes. Group 3 had the least variable and most successful pattern of  changes. Group 2 fell between the others on all parameters.Emphasis on average WL likely obscures considerable variability in individual courses of  change.

A positive screen was defined as presence of cough, fever, night sweats, or  loss. Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) was defined as sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli or growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Of 737 participants with at least one diagnostic sputum specimen, PTB was diagnosed in 31 of 522 (5.9%) on ART, and 34 of 215 (.8%) not on ART. The questionnaire missed  of 31 (48.4%) PTB cases on ART, and three of 34 (8.8%) not on ART. Among participants on ART, post-test probability of PTB diagnosis (95% confidence interval) was 6.8% (4.-10.9%) if screening positive, and 5.2% (2.9-8.4%) if screening negative, whereas among participants not on ART, post-test probabilities were 20.3% (14.2-27.5%) and 4.8% (1.-13.5%), respectively. Among participants diagnosed with PTB, those on ART were significantly less likely to screen positive (adjusted odds ratio .04, 95% confidence interval: .01-.39).

We found significant (1.8-fold to 3.3-fold, p < .05) stiffening of muscle tissue in vivo in muscles subjected to 35 KPa for 30 min or over, and in muscles subjected to 70 KPa for  min or over. By incorporating this effect into a finite element (FE) model of the buttocks of a wheelchair user we identified a mechanical stress wave which spreads from the bone-muscle interface outward through longissimus muscle tissue. After 4 h of FE simulated motionlessness, 50%-60% of the cross section of the longissimus was exposed to compressive stresses of 35 KPa or over (shown to induce cell death in rat muscle within  min). During these 4 h, the mean compressive stress across the transverse cross section of the longissimus increased by 30%-40%. The identification of the stiffening-stress-cell-death injury spiral developing during the initial 30 min of motionless sitting provides new mechanistic insight into deep  formation and calls for reevaluation of the 1 h repositioning cycle recommended by the U.S. Department of Health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662128>Effect of early shearing during gestation on the productive and reproductive behavior of female sheep offspring in their first 18 months of age.</a></h1><p>The research has shown the interesting contributions of shearing in mid-gestation on the performance of lambs from birth to weaning. Other studies have reported that shearing at early pregnancy influences the development of the placenta and lamb live  at birth. However, there was a lack of information on the effect of early-prepartum shearing on the behavior of the offspring from weaning onward. This study evaluated the effect of shearing ewes at 50 days of gestation on the growth, reproductive behavior and response to a gastrointestinal parasite challenge in the female offspring from weaning to 18 months old. Fifty-seven Polwarth female lambs were used, 22 being singles and 35 twins born to ewes either shorn at 50 days of pregnancy (, n = 23) or shorn at 62 days postpartum (U, control, n = 34) resulting in four subgroups: single lambs born to  ewes (n = 8), born to U ewes (n = 14), twin lambs born to  ewes (n = ) or born to U ewes (n = 20). All progeny were managed together under improved pasture with a minimum forage allowance of 6% live  on dry basis. Body , body condition score and fecal eggs count were recorded every 14 days from weaning to 18 months of age. Concentrations of progesterone were measured weekly (from 4 to 10 months of age and from 14 to 18 months of age) to establish the onset of puberty. Ovulation rate at an induced and a natural heat (545 ± 1. and 562 ± 1. day old) was recorded. Prepartum shearing did not affect the age at puberty or the ovulation rate of female offspring, but those born as singles were more precocious ( P = .03) and heavier ( P = .02) at puberty than twin born lambs. Both the average value of parasite egg count ( P = . 7) and the Famacha index ( P = .02) for the entire study period were lower in lambs born to prepartum shorn ewes than those born to postpartum shorn ewes. In conclusion, shearing at 50 days of gestation did not affect the growth or the reproductive behavior of female offspring. However, female lambs born from ewe shorn during gestation showed a better response to the parasitic challenge, and further research is required to confirm this.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797707>Clinical prognostic model for older patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Older patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are often not prescribed standard therapy. It is important to know which older patients would be candidates for aggressive therapy based on their prognosis, and to develop a model that can help determine prognosis.Data on older patients (≥70 years) enrolled on 38 NCI cooperative group trials of advanced NSCLC from 1991 to 2011 were analyzed. Multivariable Cox PH model was built with a stepwise selection. We derived a prognostic score using the estimated Cox PH regression coefficient. We then calculated the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of survival in the testing set.The final analysis included 1467 patients, who were randomly divided into a training (n = 963) and a testing set (n = 504). The prognostic risk score was calculated as: 3 (if male) + 3 (if  = 1) + 8 (if  = 2) + 11 (if initial stage = IV) + 4 (if  loss). Patients were classified into two prognostic groups: good (-8) and poor (≥9). The median survival in the two groups in the testing set were 13. (95% CI, 10.82-.91) and 8.52 months (95% CI, 7.5-9.63), respectively. The model had area under the 1-year and 2-year ROCs (.6 and .65, respectively) that were higher than existing models.Male gender, poor performance status, distant metastases and recent  loss predict for poor overall survival (OS) in older patients with advanced NSCLC.

The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and validity of an EMA protocol to assess older adults' PA and SB. Feasibility was determined by examining factors associated with EMA survey compliance and if PA or SB were impacted by EMA survey compliance. Validity was determined by comparing EMA-reported PA and SB to objectively measured PA and SB at the EMA prompt. Over 10 days, older adults ( = 104; Age = 60-98 years) received 6 randomly prompted EMA questionnaires on a smartphone each day and wore an ActivPAL activity monitor to provide a device-based measure of PA and SB. Participants reported whether they were currently engaged in PA or SB. Older adults were compliant with the EMA and ActivPAL protocol on 92% of occasions. Differences in EMA compliance differed by  status. Among overweight and obese older adults EMA compliance differed by sex (OR = 3., 95% CI: 1.43, 6.92) and day of week (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.41). Among normal  older adults, EMA compliance differed by time of day (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.30). EMA compliance did not differ for device-based PA or SB in the  min before versus the  min after the EMA prompt, suggesting that these behaviors did not influence likelihood of responding and responding did not influence these behaviors (s > .05). When PA was reported through EMA, participants engaged in less device-based PA in the  min after compared to the  min before the EMA prompt ( = .01), suggesting possible reactance or a disruption of PA. EMA-reported PA and SB were positively associated with higher device-based PA and SB in the ± min, respectively, supporting criterion validity (s < .05). The assessment of older adults' PA and SB through EMA is feasible and valid, although there may be PA reactance to EMA prompting. Therefore, EMA represents a significant methodological tool that can aid in our understanding of the environmental, social, and psychological processes regulating older adults' PA and SB in the context of everyday life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16689549>Carbon-13 labeled polymers: an alternative tracer for depth profiling of polymer films and multilayers using secondary ion mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>13C labeling is introduced as a tracer for depth profiling of polymer films and multilayers using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Deuterium substitution has traditionally been used in depth profiling of polymers but can affect the phase behavior of the polymer constituents with reported changes in both bulk-phase behavior and surface and interfacial interactions. SIMS can provide contrast by examining various functional groups, chemical moieties, or isotopic labels. 13C-Labeled  (13C-) and unlabeled  (12C-) and PMMA were synthesized using atom-transfer radical polymerization and assembled in several model thin-film systems. Depth profiles were recorded using a Cameca IMS-6f magnetic sector mass spectrometer using both 6.-keV impact energy Cs+ and 5.5-keV impact energy O2+ primary ion bombardment with detection of negative and positive secondary ions, respectively. Although complete separation of 12C1H from 13C is achieved using both primary ion species, 6.-keV Cs+ clearly shows improved detection sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio for detection of 12C, 12C1H, and 13C secondary ions. The use of Cs+ primary ion bombardment results in somewhat anomalous, nonmonotonic changes in the 12C, 12C1H, and 13C secondary ion yields through the /PMMA interface; however, it is shown that this behavior is not due to sample charging. Through normalization of the 13C secondary ion yield to the total C (12C + 13C) ion yield, the observed effects through the /PMMA interface can be greatly minimized, thereby significantly improving analysis of polymer films and multilayers using SIMS. Mass spectra of 13C- and 12C- were also analyzed using a PHI TRIFT I time-of-flight mass spectrometer, with -keV Ga+ primary ion bombardment and detection of positive secondary ions. The (12)C7(1)H7 ion fragment and its 13C-enriched analogues have significant secondary ion yields with negligible mass interferences, providing an early indication of the potential for future use of this technique for cluster probe depth profiling of high molecular  13C-labeled fragments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30985525>Fat-Free Mass Index in a Diverse Sample of Male Collegiate Athletes.</a></h1><p>Currier, BS, Harty, , Zabriskie, HA, Stecker, RA, Moon, JM, Jagim, AR, and Kerksick, CM. Fat-free mass index in a diverse sample of male collegiate athletes. J Strength Cond Res 33(6): 1474-1479, 2019-Fat-free mass index (FFMI) is a body composition metric that has been used to assess relative muscularity in athletes. Fat-free mass index is calculated by dividing FFM by height squared, although further height corrections through linear regression may be needed in taller individuals. This study reported height-adjusted FFMI (FFMIAdj) data in 209 male collegiate athletes from 10 sports (baseball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, weightlifting, rugby, swimming, track and field, and water polo) and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit for sports with sufficient sample size. The body composition of all subjects (mean ± SD; age: 20.7 ± 1.9 years, height: 182.9 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 90.8 ± 16.8 kg, and percent body fat: .6 ± 5.3) was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression was used to adjust for height, and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit was determined by calculating the 97.5th percentile of all values. One-way analyses of variance with Games-Howell post hoc comparisons were used to determine between-sport differences. A paired-samples t-test revealed a significant difference (p < .001) between unadjusted and adjusted mean FFMI values. The overall mean FFMIAdj was 22.8 ± 2.8 kg·m. Significant between-sport differences (p < .001) in FFMIAdj were identified. Average FFMIAdj was highest in football athletes (24.28 ± 2.39 kg·m) and lowest in water polo athletes (20.68 ± 3.56 kg·m). The FFMIAdj upper limit was calculated for all athletes (28.32 kg·m), rugby (29.1 kg·m), and baseball (25.5 kg·m). This study reported FFMIAdj values in a diverse cohort of male collegiate athletes, providing data for the first time in several sports. These values can be used to guide nutritional and exercise interventions, predict athletic performance, and provide coaches with standardized information regarding the potential for further FFM accretion in male athletes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23654107>[Be based on the morphological and histological changes to study optimal dose of TCDD induced cleft palate in mice embryo].</a></h1><p>To define the optimal 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) dose based on the morphological and histological changes of fetal mice cleft palate induced by different TCDD doses.The pregnant mice were randomly divided into five groups and 6 in each grouop, and were gavaged on gestation day 10 (GD10).

However, conflicting data exist regarding the effect of L-thyroxine substitution on these parameters. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of L-thyroxine therapy on lipidaemic profile, coagulation markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and glucose homoeostasis in SH patients.It was a prospective open-label study. The following parameters were measured before and 6 months after intervention: anthropometric data, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoproteins B (apoB) and A1 (apoA1), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], fasting plasma glucose and insulin, homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), hsCRP, antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), protein S (), fibrinogen and homocysteine.Thirty-two patients (30 women) aged 52.1 ± 13.9 years with SH completed the study. Baseline mean TSH levels were 6.79 ± 2.58 mIU/ml. Achievement of euthyroidism significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (BP) in patients with SH (from 135.2 ± 18.5 to 129.7 ± .8 mmHg, p = .03) and diastolic BP only in those with baseline TSH levels > 7 mIU/ml (from 79.5 ± 9.8 to 72.1 ± 7.3 mmHg, p = .03). No significant changes in body , TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, apoB, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, AT-III, PC, , fibrinogen or homocysteine levels were noticed after restoration of euthyroidism, except for a decrease in apoA1 (p = .04) and an increase in Lp(a) levels (p = .02).Except for a reduction in systolic and diastolic BP, thyroid substitution therapy does not affect lipidaemic profile, systematic inflammation, glucose homoeostasis or coagulation in patients with SH.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593862>Combination therapy with ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporin versus third-generation cephalosporin monotherapy in Escherichia coli meningitis in infants: a multicentre propensity score-matched observational study.</a></h1><p>Escherichiacoli is the second cause of bacterial meningitis in neonates. Despite the use for 35 years of third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs), high morbidity and mortality rates with E. coli meningitis continue to occur. Because ciprofloxacin has good microbiologic activity against E. coli and good penetration in cerebrospinal fluid and brain, some authors have suggested adding ciprofloxacin to a 3GC regimen. The objective of this study was to assess combining 3GCs with ciprofloxacin versus 3GCs alone in a cohort of infants with E. coli meningitis.We included all cases of E. coli meningitis diagnosed in infants <12 months of age that were prospectively collected through the French paediatric meningitis surveillance network between 2001 and 2016. The main outcome was the proportion of short-term neurologic complications with versus without ciprofloxacin. The analysis was conducted retrospectively by multivariable regression and propensity score () analysis.Among the 367 infants enrolled, 201 (54.8%) of 367 had ciprofloxacin and 3GC cotreatment and 166 (45.2%) of 367 only a 3GC. Median age and  were  days (range, 1-318 days) and 3.42 kg (range, .66-9.4 kg). A total of 86 (23.4%) of 367 infants presented neurologic complications (seizures, strokes, empyema, abscesses, hydrocephalus, arachnoiditis); 57 received ciprofloxacin cotreatment.

Continuous change of the position of the tibial component occurred with proceeding extension. Rocking, subsidence and lift-off at different localisations were observed. In 3 of 4 knees with flat inserts the tibial component tilted anteriorly from 45 degrees to 35 degrees of flexion. A similar anterior tilt was seen in 2 of 6 with concave inserts and 5 of 6 with the  design, but the tilting started later, when the knee had 5-20 degrees more extension. From 45- degrees of flexion most components tilted into valgus. Three knees (1 concave with, 1 concave without PCL and 1 ) showed a sudden tilt into varus direction followed by a rocking motion in the opposite direction. The other types of displacements studied showed a more uniform pattern. The inducible maximum translation (MTPM) at 20 degrees of extension tended to be associated with increased migration between  and 2 yr when measured with the same parameter (Spearman's rho = .54, P = .03). Increased medial displacement of the center of the proximal tibia at 25 degrees was associated with increased anterior tilt. This type of motion was most commonly seen with the concave design. Our observations demonstrate that the forces acting on the tibial component vary during active extension, which results in rocking movements. This will influence the migration and the patttern of wear, factors of importance for the clinical longevity of a total knee replacement (TKR).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18082245>Comparison of microbial indicators under two water regimes in a soil amended with combined paper mill sludge and decomposed cow manure.</a></h1><p>An incubation study was conducted under laboratory conditions to compare the effects of soil amendment of combined paper mill sludge () and decomposed cow manure (DCM) on selected microbial indicators.

Samples were collected every 5 km during three minute rest intervals.Blood was analysed for triglyceride (TG), free fatty acids, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, insulin, lactate, and changes in plasma volume. A two factor (season by distance) repeated measures analysis of variance revealed an increase in capacity for prolonged exercise in the  by a decrease in running intensity during the aerobic capacity test (% of speed at 2. mmol/l lactate threshold, p = .008), an increase in running speed at the anaerobic threshold (p = .003) and at 4. and 2. mmol/l (p<.001) of the lactate threshold. A significant season by distance interaction was found for TG (p<.001). TG concentrations peaked at 5 km and decreased logarithmically throughout the OS (1.48 (.34) to .86 (.20) mmol/l) and  (1.90 (.31) to .73 (.18) mmol/l) tests. From the OS to the , there was an increase in the difference in TG at 5- km with a concomitant increase at 2. mmol/l of the lactate threshold. The peak TG concentrations at 5 km followed by a logarithmic decrease suggest that TG may also provide circulating energy. A greater logarithmic decrease in TG occurred in the  than in the OS, indicating a higher rate of use. There was an increase in the difference in TG at 5- km similar to the increase in the speed at 2. mmol/l of the lactate threshold between the two seasons. Glucose, insulin, lactate, and free fatty acids were similar in the two seasons.Free fatty acid and TG concentrations were much higher than expected, and the two training seasons showed significantly different patterns of TG concentration during prolonged running.

Each animal was each artificially infected with 5,000 larvae of the 3rd stage of barber's pole worm (). Body weights, dry matter intake (DMI), and fecal samples for fecal egg counts (FEC) were taken at d , 12, 23, and 41. Rumen fluid and blood samples were collected at d 45. The performance period lasted 45 d and at the completion of the study, goats were harvested, and carcass characteristics, abomasal worm counts were measured. The results showed that DMI, BW, carcass traits, and meat color were not affected by  supplementation, whereas average daily gain (ADG,  < .01), blood glucose ( < .001), phosphorus ( < .05), and cholesterol levels ( < .001) significantly increased with increasing levels of  supplementation. There was a linear ( < .01) reduction in rumen acetate to propionate ratio, ammonia-nitrogen, FEC, and  worm counts, with increasing levels of  supplementation. This study shows that  supplementation up to 30% of the diet can improve ADG and rumen fermentation while reducing gastrointestinal parasite infection in meat goats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24189395>Structure elucidation and antioxidant properties of a soluble β-D-glucan from mushroom Entoloma lividoalbum.</a></h1><p>A water soluble branched β-D-glucan (-I) with an average molecular  ~2.1×10(5) Da was isolated from alkaline extract of the fruit bodies of the edible mushroom Entoloma lividoalbum (Kühner & Romagn) Kubička which consists of terminal β-D-glucopyranosyl, (1→3)-β-D-glucopyranosyl, (1→6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl, and (1→3,6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl moieties in a molar ratio of nearly 1:3:2:1. The structure of -I was elucidated using acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, periodate oxidation study, partial hydrolysis, and 1D/2D NMR experiments. The repeating unit of the polysaccharide (-I) contains a backbone chain of three (1→6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl residues, one of which was branched at O-3 position with the side chain consisting of three (1→3)-β-D-glucopyranosyl and a terminal β-D-glucopyranosyl residues. Total antioxidant capacity of 1mg -I was measured and found equivalent to 70± μg of ascorbic acid. The -I was found to possess hydroxyl and superoxide radical-scavenging activities with EC50 values of 480 and 150 μg/mL, respectively. The reducing power of -I was determined .5 at 480 μg/mL.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Among sleep-restricted subjects, African Americans gained more  than Caucasians (d = .37, P = .003) and males gained more  than females (d = .38, P = .004). Sleep-restricted subjects consumed extra calories (130. ± 43.% of daily caloric requirement) during days with a delayed bedtime (04:00) compared with control subjects who did not consume extra calories (100.6 ± 11.4%; d = .94, P = .003) during corresponding days. In sleep-restricted subjects, increased daily caloric intake was due to more meals and the consumption of 552.9 ± 265.8 additional calories between 22:00-03:59. The percentage of calories derived from fat was greater during late-night hours (22:00-03:59, 33. ± .08%) compared to daytime (08:00-14:59, 28.2 ± .05%) and evening hours (:00-21:59, 29.4 ± .06%;  < .05).In the largest, most diverse healthy sample studied to date under controlled laboratory conditions, sleep restriction promoted  gain. Chronically sleep-restricted adults with late bedtimes may be more susceptible to  gain due to greater daily caloric intake and the consumption of calories during late-night hours.Spaeth AM; Dinges DF; Goel N.

The aim of this study was to identify the clinicopathological factors that are predictive of erlotinob treatment outcomes for NSCLC patients with unknown EGFR mutational status.A retrospective analysis of 109 patients with advanced NSCLC who had previously failed at least one line of chemotherapy and received subsequent treatment with erlotinib (150 mg/day orally) was performed. A Cox proportional hazard model for univariate and multivariate analyses was used to identify the baseline clinical parameters correlating with treatment outcome, expressed in terms of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals.The median treatment duration was  weeks (range, 4-184). The disease control rate was 55%, including disease stability for ≥ 3 months for 40% of the patients. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 4.2 and 8.5 months, respectively. The Cox model indicated that an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG ) ≥ 2 (HR 3.82; p<.001), presence of intra-abdominal metastasis (HR 3.42; p=.002), 2 or more prior chemotherapy regimens (HR 2.29; p=.021), and  loss >5% (HR 2.05; p=.034) were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib.This study suggests that NSCLC patients should be enrolled in erlotinib treatment after a first round of unsuccessful chemotherapy to improve treatment success, during which they should be monitored for intra-abdominal metastasis and  loss.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267902>Back to the Future: Impact of a Paper-Based Admission H&P on Clinical Documentation Improvement at a Level 1 Trauma Center.</a></h1><p>The Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) , as derived from the MS-DRG assigned at discharge, is in part determined by the physician-documented diagnoses. However, the terminology associated with MS-DRG determination is often not aligned with typical physician language, leading to inaccurate coding and decreased hospital reimbursements. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of a diagnosis picklist within a paper-based history and physical examination (H&P) on the average MS-DRG  and the Case-mix index (CMI). Our trauma center implemented a paper H&P form for trauma patients featuring picklist diagnoses aligned with the MS-DRG terminology and arranged by the physiologic system. To evaluate its impact, we conducted a cohort study using data from our trauma registry between July 2015 and November 2017. Our cohort included 442 (26.%) paper and 1,261 (74.%) dictated H&. Average CMI (2.56  2.) and expected patients ($25,057  $19,825) were higher for the paper group ( < .001,  = .002). Adjusted regression models demonstrated paper coding to be associated with .265 CMI points, translating to an average increase in expected payment of 6.5 per cent per patient. Utilization of a standardized, paper-based H&P template with picklist diagnoses was associated with a higher trauma service CMI and higher expected payments. Preprinted diagnoses that align with the MS-DRG terminology lead to clinical documentation improvement.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16450840>Purification and characterization of two extracellular lipases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa -x.</a></h1><p>Two different extracellular lipases were isolated and purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa -x to apparent homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography on Q- and S-Sepharose column.

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was approximately 50 nM. It is a potent inhibitor in vitro and is also effective in vivo. Administration of WR99210 parenterally (i.e., intraperitoneally) reduced the mean number of RH strain tachyzoites present in peritoneal fluid substantially 4 days after intraperitoneal infection of mice. There was a mean of approximately 35 million parasites in control mice as contrasted with approximately 2 million parasites in mice treated with 1.25 mg WR99210/kg of body  in a representative experiment (P < .05). In addition the prodrug - N'-[3-(2,4, 5-trichlorophenoxy)propyloxy]-N9-(1-methylethyl) imidocarbonimidicdiamide is converted to 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropyloxy)-1,3,5 triazine in vivo when the prodrug is administered orally. - administered by gavage also reduced intraperitoneal RH strain T. gondii tachyzoite numbers. WR99210 has high efficacy and relatively low toxicity because of its substantial effect on T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) but not the mammalian host DHFR. Amino acid sequences of T. gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, and Homo sapiens DHFRs were compared. It is of interest that of the DHFR amino acids considered to be interacting with WR99210 in P. falciparum within interatomic distances within 3 to 5 A, four of eight were shared with T. gondii DHFR. H. sapiens also shared four amino acids thought to be interacting with WR99210. Efficacy of intraperitoneal administration of WR99210 and peroral administration of - demonstrate the potential usefulness of this class of compounds in treatment of toxoplasmosis administered either parenterally or perorally.

The photophysical methods used include steady state flurescence, uv spectroscopy, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Both compounds showed solvatochromic behavior, due to intramolecular charge transfer state formation, and efficient fluorescence in polar solvents. Photophysical behavior was dependent on the metal ion. The addition of metal ions that completely fit into the crown ether cavity resulted in significant blue shifts in the fluorescence emission spectra (chemosensing properties). Partially fitting ions changed the fluorescence spectra slightly. Transient absorption measurements revealed fast and slow decay components with time constants of 10-20 and 500-600  for all fitting ions, respectively. The latter is assigned to a trans-cis photoisomerization process, which decreased in efficiency in the presence of partially fitting ions, i.e., increasing ion size. Steady state irradiation showed clear evidence of a change in the absorption spectra. Trans-cis photoisomerization and [2 + 2] photocycloaddition were found to compete with fluorescence. The ions Li+, Na+, and Ca2+, which fit into the cavity, direct the photoisomerization. Larger ions (K+, Rb+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) that partially fit the cavity cause photocycloaddition. Quantum yields of the photoreaction are between .1 and .3. Analysis of the photo-product obtained for the 1-Sr2+ system revealed a compound with a molecular  of nanosize dimension, which was equivalent to seven mass units of 1. The higher molecular  product was formed due to alternately stacked supramolecular assemblies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247193>Increasing body mass index or  does not appear to influence the association between efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy and implant effectiveness among HIV-positive women in western Kenya.</a></h1><p>Our objective was to evaluate if increasing body mass index (BMI) or  influences the association between efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and implant effectiveness.We conducted a secondary cohort analysis of HIV-positive women aged  to 45 years enrolled in HIV care in western Kenya using an implant from January 2011 to December 2015.

The stress on tibial insert is closely related to polyethylene failure. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of malrotation of tibial component for the stress on tibial insert during high flexion using a finite element analysis. We used Stryker NRG  for analysis. Three different initial conditions of tibial component including normal, ° internal malrotation, and ° external malrotation were analyzed. The tibial insert made from ultra-high-molecular- polyethylene was assumed to be elastic-plastic while femoral and tibial metal components were assumed to be rigid. Four nonlinear springs attached to tibial component represented soft tissues around the knee. Vertical load was applied to femoral component which rotated from ° to 135° while horizontal load along the anterior posterior axis was applied to tibial component during flexion. Maximum equivalent stresses on the surface were analyzed. Internal malrotation caused the highest stress which arose up to 160% of normal position. External malrotation also caused higher stress.

QT interval (QTc) was calculated by using four different equations, i.e. Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham and Hodges.Irrespectively of the used correction formula, QTc interval length was reduced after the surgery (QTc -31 ± 18 ms; QTc -12 ±  ms; QTc -14 ±  ms; QTc -9 ±  ms; all  < .001), but QTc reduction was significantly greater than the reduction in QTc calculated upon the other three equations (all  < .001). Moreover, changes in QTc (P < .001) but not in QTc, QTc and QTc (all  > .05) were significantly correlated with concurrent changes in HR. Multivariate regression analyses revealed a significant independent association of serum insulin levels with QTc, QTc and QTc values (all  < .05) preoperatively, whilst changes in QTc interval length after the surgery were not consistently associated to concurrent changes in metabolic traits.Our data show that the extent of  loss-associated QTc interval shortening largely depends on the applied HR correction equation and appears to be overestimated when the most popular Bazett's equation is used.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554345>Role of emphysema and airway obstruction in prognosis of lung cancer.</a></h1><p>It has been reported that the presence of COPD and emphysema is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, but the prognosis significance of these two conditions is not well known. The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of COPD and emphysema in the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Three hundred and fifty-three patients with cytohistologic diagnosis of NSCLC were prospectively collected. The relationship between survival at two years and the following variables: age, sex, smoking habit, comorbid diseases (cardiovascular diseases, previous tumour and COPD),  loss, presence of emphysema on CT scan, performance status () and treatment, was analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for survival analysis. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, stratified by TNM stage, was used to evaluate prognostic factors.Emphysema was present in 110 patients, associated with COPD in 78 (70.9%). In univariate analysis, survival decreased with age>70 years (p=.01), presence of emphysema (p=.02),  loss (p=.00001), ≥2 (p=.00001) and symptomatic treatment (p=.0001). Multivariate analyses identified emphysema (HR=1.49 (95% CI 1.11-2.01)), ≥2 (HR=2.12 (95% CI 1.31-3.38)) and treatment: surgery (HR=.3 (95% CI .-.56)) and chemotherapy (HR=.34 (95% CI .31-.57)) as independent prognostic factors.The presence of emphysema affects the prognostic outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Emphysema should therefore be considered for prognostic studies on comorbidity.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As the EGFR directed antibody cetuximab has shown activity concurrent with radiotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, as well as in stage IV NSCLC combined with chemotherapy, we wanted to investigate radiotherapy with concurrent cetuximab in locally advanced NSCLC, a tumour type often over expressing the EGF-receptor.Between February 2006 and August 2007 75 patients in stage III NSCLC with good performance status (  or 1) and adequate lung function (FEV1>1.) were enrolled in this phase II study at eight institutions. Treatment consisted of 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy, docetaxel 75 mg/m² and cisplatin 75 mg/m² with 3 weeks interval. An initial dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m² was given before start of 3D-CRT to 68 Gy with 2 Gy per fraction in 7 weeks concurrent with weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m².

However, there is controversy concerning the combined effect on lipid constituents during HD of the three commonly used variables; the type of heparin, dialysis membrane and the constituent of dialysate buffer bases. Consequently, this controlled prospective study was thought of.Randomly 63 patients were assigned from Urology and Nephrology haemodialysis (HD) unit, Mansoura, Egypt for the planned study. Their mean age was 45.79 +/- 13.11 years. Fourteen patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) served as control group for the remaining 49 HD patients. They were subdivided according to the HD duration (< and > 1 year), anticoagulant used (unfractionated [UFH] and low-molecular  heparin [LMWH, Enoxaparin), membrane type (Hemophane [HP] and polysulfone [] membrane) and dialysate buffer bases (bicarbonate versus acetate based).Determining the fasting lipid value of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) as well as lipoproteins including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] was completed.Bicarbonate dialysate was associated with significantly lower TG (134.7 +/- 11 mg/dl vs. 153 +/- 14 mg/dl, p = .004), higher HDL-C (33.1 +/- 3 vs. 28.3 +/- 2, p = .0002) and subsequently better atherosclerosis risk ratio [TC/HDL-C (ARR)] (6.02 +/- .09 vs. 5.3 +/- .9, p = .001) despite its insignificant effect on TC and LDL-C. However, logarithm (log) Lp (a) level was significantly higher (1.92 +/- .05 vs. 1.82 +/- .04 p = .001) in comparison with acetate dialysate. Membrane type was not influential in those dialyzed for < 1 year before intervention while after a year of HD,  (n = 11) compared to HP filters (n = 11) significantly lowered TC (151.7 +/- 16 vs. 172.6 +/- 12, p = .003), TG (127.8 +/-  vs. 155.7 +/- , p = .004), LDL-C (122.1 +/- 5 vs. 130.6 +/- 7, p = .006) levels as well as ARR (5.9 +/- .5 vs. 5.4 +/- .3, p = .02). Likewise was the reduction in log Lp (a) (1.9 +/- .03 vs. 1.8 +/- .04, p = .002) with insignificant effect on HDL-C. After 6 months, Enoxaparin caused significant improvement of TC (.0004), TG (p = .018), LDL-C (p = .006), HDL-C (.041) and Lp (a) (.047) compared to UFH. Patients who continued on Enoxaparin for 3 more months displayed an even better attenuation in most of lipid parameters whilst continuation of UFH was insignificant. Switching few patients (n = 4) from UFH to LMWH for 3 months resulted in significant lowering of TC (153 +/- 7 vs. 177.7 +/- 3, p = .01), TG (127.5 +/- 5 vs. 137.3 +/- 4, p = .03) and LDL-C (124.7 +/- 5 vs. 127.5 +/- 5, p = .005). However, switching equal number of patients from LMWH to UFH caused no significant change.Dyslipidaemia in Egyptian haemodialysis patients was improved when bicarbonate-based haemodialysis, the use of polysulfone membrane, and more so when the low-molecular  heparin Enoxaparin were used.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26096753>Serum zinc concentration in cystic fibrosis patients with CFTR I1234V mutation associated with pancreatic sufficiency.</a></h1><p>To determine serum zinc (Zn) level among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with homozygous CFTR I1234V mutation associated with pancreatic sufficiency ().A cross-sectional study was conducted including both pediatric and adult CF patients.

We explored differences between patients who did and did not receive palliative ST in order to gain evidence to support and advocate for the untreated.We performed a retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed patients with advanced, incurable NSCLC seen as outpatients at our institution between 2009 and 2012. Demographics, treatment, and survival data were collected.528 patients were seen: 291 (55%) received palliative ST, while 237 (45%) received none. Demographics were as follows: Median age 67, 55% male, 50% ECOG performance status () -1, 48% with  loss. Untreated patients were older (median 71 vs. 64, p<.01), less fit ( -1 in 27% vs. 69%, p<.01), and more likely to have lost  (57% vs. 41%, p<.01). Reasons for no treatment included poor  (67%) and patient choice (23%). Median OS was shorter amongst untreated patients (3.9 vs. 10.7 months, HR 1.80 [95% CI 1.4-2.3], p<.01). In multivariate analysis, not receiving ST was associated with shorter OS.Unsurprisingly, untreated patients had poorer prognostic features and worse OS. However, it is concerning that, despite being seen in an active academic center, nearly half of all referred patients with advanced NSCLC received no anti-cancer treatment. Current research primarily seeks to improve outcomes in treated patients with good . This review suggests that this is an inappropriate allocation of research effort. Our research should be more equitably split between good and poor performance patient groups if we are to improve the survival of all patients with advanced NSCLC. Potential strategies include more rapid diagnosis prior to functional decline, and the development of therapies effective and tolerated in a sicker population.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Examinations of participants' ability to meet the metronome paces revealed that participants who were overweight had higher cadences at the slow and fast paces (all <.05).Findings suggest that those with overweight BMI alter their gait to maintain biomechanical stability. Understanding how excess  influences gait adaptation can inform interventions to improve safety for individuals with obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28098413>Dermatomal spread following posterior transversus abdominis plane block in pediatric patients: our initial experience.</a></h1><p>Several techniques for the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block have been described. The extent of sensory changes using an ultrasound-guided posterior TAP block (pTAP) remains unclear in pediatric patients. The primary aim of this study was to report the extent of sensory changes achieved with pTAP; specifically the highest thoracic dermatome anesthetized. Secondary outcomes were pain scores (), opioid consumption, and complications.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients less than 21 years of age undergoing abdominal surgery with a unilateral or bilateral pTAP(s) for postoperative analgesia. The local anesthetic was placed posterior to the termination of the transversus abdominis muscle where the thoracolumbar fascia overrides the quadratus lumborum muscle. The extent of sensory changes, pain scores, and opioid consumption were analyzed.A total of 10 patients ( pTAP blocks) met the inclusion criteria. The mean (sd; range) age and  were  years (5 years; range 7-20 years) and 57 kg (21 kg; 27-97 kg), respectively. The cephalad dermatome levels achieved were: T7 in 6/ (40%); T8 in 10/ (67%); and T9 in 14/ (93%). An inferior dermatome level of T12/L1 and sensory extension from midaxillary line to the midline was documented in / blocks. The mean intraoperative and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) opioid consumption in morphine equivalents were .34 mg·kg (sd = .12 mg·kg ) and .04 mg·kg (sd = .05 mg·kg ), respectively. PACU pain scores were mild (<4) in 60%, moderate (4-7) in 30%, and severe (>7) in 10% of patients. No complications were reported.The current uncertainty regarding sensory blockade limits the clinical application of TAP blocks. While the midaxillary approach results in unpredictable sensory changes of the abdomen, we reliably achieved sensory changes up to a T9 level in 93% of the blocks.In this small series of patients, we demonstrate a high technical success rate of achieving cutaneous analgesia to the abdominal wall. These results should encourage clinical studies of the efficacy of this block for abdominal surgery in pediatric patients.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27282074>High wholegrain barley β-glucan lowers food intake but does not alter small intestinal macronutrient digestibility in ileorectostomised rats.</a></h1><p>Using barley cultivars differing widely in β-glucan content, we aimed to determine their effects on small intestinal macronutrient digestion in 24 ileorectostomised rats. The rats were fed 1 of 4 experimental diets, each containing a different barley variety, for 11 d. The diets had a content of , 2.1, 2.6 and 4.3 g of β-glucan/100 g. Feed intake and faecal excretion of fat, protein, starch, and non-starch polysaccharides were determined in the final 5 d of the study and apparent macronutrient digestibility calculated. Higher dietary levels of β-glucan (2.6% and 4.3%) lowered feed intake (by  and 19%, respectively) but final body  was only lowered by the 4.3% β-glucan diet relative to rats fed the % β-glucan diet (all  < .05). Protein, lipid and starch digestibility was unrelated to the dietary β-glucan content. Higher dietary levels of barley β-glucan lower feed intake of ileorectostomised rats, which is independent of intestinal fermentation and unrelated to macronutrient digestibility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28361542>Wafer Scale Fabrication of Dense and High Aspect Ratio Sub-50 nm Nanopillars from Phase Separation of Cross-Linkable Polysiloxane/Polystyrene Blend.</a></h1><p>We demonstrated a simple and effective approach to fabricate dense and high aspect ratio sub-50 nm pillars based on phase separation of a polymer blend composed of a cross-linkable polysiloxane and polystyrene (). In order to obtain the phase-separated domains with nanoscale size, a liquid prepolymer of cross-linkable polysiloxane was employed as one moiety for increasing the miscibility of the polymer blend. After phase separation via spin-coating, the dispersed domains of liquid polysiloxane with sub-50 nm size could be solidified by UV exposure. The solidified polysiloxane domains took the role of etching mask for formation of high aspect ratio nanopillars by O reactive ion etching (RIE). The aspect ratio of the nanopillars could be further amplified by introduction of a polymer transfer layer underneath the polymer blend film. The effects of spin speeds, the  ratio of the polysiloxane/ blend, and the concentration of polysiloxane/ blend in toluene on the characters of the nanopillars were investigated. The gold-coated nanopillar arrays exhibited a high Raman scattering enhancement factor in the range of 10-10 with high uniformity across over the wafer scale sample. A superhydrophobic surface could be realized by coating a self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of fluoroalkyltrichlorosilane on the nanopillar arrays. Sub-50 nm silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with high aspect ratio of about 1000 were achieved by using the nanopillars as etching mask through a metal-assisted chemical etching process. They showed an ultralow reflectance of approximately .1% for wavelengths ranging from 200 to 800 nm.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25773359>Design and optimization of topical methotrexate loaded niosomes for enhanced management of psoriasis: application of Box-Behnken design, in-vitro evaluation and in-vivo skin deposition study.</a></h1><p>Psoriasis, a skin disorder characterized by impaired epidermal differentiation, is regularly treated by systemic methotrexate (MTX), an effective cytotoxic drug but with numerous side effects. The aim of this work was to design topical MTX loaded niosomes for management of psoriasis to avoid systemic toxicity. To achieve this goal, MTX niosomes were prepared by thin film hydration technique. A Box-Behnken (BB) design, using Design-Expert(®) software, was employed to statistically optimize formulation variables. Three independent variables were evaluated: MTX concentration in hydration medium (X1), total  of niosomal components (X2) and surfactant: cholesterol ratio (X3). The encapsulation efficiency percent (Y1: EE%) and particle size (Y2: ) were selected as dependent variables. The optimal formulation (F12) displayed spherical morphology under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optimum particle size of 1375.00 nm and high EE% of 78.66%. In-vivo skin deposition study showed that the highest value of percentage drug deposited (22.45%) and AUC0-10 (1. mg.h/cm(2)) of MTX from niosomes were significantly greater than that of drug solution (13.87% and .49 mg.h/cm(2), respectively). Moreover, in-vivo histopathological studies confirmed safety of topically applied niosomes. Concisely, the results showed that targeted MTX delivery might be achieved using topically applied niosomes for enhanced treatment of psoriasis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The prenatal stressor used was repeated transportation of pregnant Brahman cows for 2 h at 60 ± 5, 80 ± 5, 100 ± 5, 120 ± 5, and 140 ± 5 d of gestation. Prenatally stressed calves ( = 41) were compared with controls ( = 44; dams did not undergo transportation during pregnancy) from 2 wk of age until weaning (average age at weaning = 174.8 ± 1.3 d). Temperament was defined by pen score (; 1 = calm and 5 = excitable), exit velocity (EV; m/sec), and temperament score (TS; ( + EV)/2) and was recorded for each calf on d -168, -140, -112, -84, -56, -28, and  relative to weaning (d  = weaning). Cortisol concentrations were determined in serum samples obtained on d -168, -140, -28, and  relative to weaning. Birth  and weaning  were not different between treatment groups ( > .1). Pen score was greater ( = .03) in prenatally stressed calves (2.84 ± .21) relative to controls (2.31 ± .21). Exit velocity was greater ( < .01) in prenatally stressed calves (2.1 ± .14 m/sec) than in controls (1.61 ± .14 m/sec). Exit velocity was affected by a treatment × calf sex interaction ( = .04) and was greater in prenatally stressed females. Exit velocity was also affected by day ( < .0001). Temperament score was greater ( = .01) in prenatally stressed calves (2.45 ± .16) than in controls (1.95 ± .16). Temperament score was affected by day ( < .01). Basal cortisol concentrations were greater ( = .04) in prenatally stressed calves (.87 ± 1.04 ng/mL) than in controls (13.42 ± 1.03 ng/mL). Basal cortisol concentrations were greater ( < .01) in females (16.61 ± 1.06 ng/mL) than in males (12.68 ± 1.02 ng/mL). Cortisol concentrations were positively correlated ( < .01) with  ( = .55, < .01), EV ( = .4, < .01), and TS ( = .55, < .01).

This investigation examined the effects of programmed aerobic exercise on protein metabolism in children (n = 7; mean +/- SEM: 9.14 +/- .46 y old; , 32.1 +/- 1.6 kg; height, 138 +/- 2.5 cm; and body mass index, 16.21 +/- .36 kg/m(2) ) using ()N-glycine methodology. Boys (n = 5) and girls (n = 2) walked (5 d/wk, 3.2-6.4 km/d) for 6 wk. Criterion measures taken at baseline (Pre) and after the exercise program (Post) included anthropometric data, dietary assessment, nitrogen balance, nitrogen flux (Q), protein synthesis (), protein breakdown (PB) and net protein balance [(Net) =  - PB]. After the walking program, there were no significant changes in body , fat-free mass or percentage of body fat, whereas height increased (P < .01). Energy and protein intakes were constant throughout the study. Nitrogen balance was significantly more positive Post than Pre (P < .05). There was a significant decrease in Q (P < .0001) with corresponding decreases in  (P < .001) and PB (P < .01). These data provide the first evidence that programmed aerobic exercise alters whole-body protein utilization in healthy, nonobese children. Longitudinal studies are required to further examine changes in protein metabolism associated with increased physical activity in this population. In addition, findings suggest a need to evaluate nutrient requirements for healthy, physically active boys and girls.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24380871>In vivo monitoring of sorafenib therapy effects on experimental prostate carcinomas using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and macromolecular contrast media.</a></h1><p>To investigate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) with macromolecular contrast media (MMCM) to monitor the effects of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib on subcutaneous prostate carcinomas in rats with immunohistochemical validation.Copenhagen rats, implanted with prostate carcinoma allografts, were randomized to the treatment group (n = 8) or the control group (n = 8).

The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle is unable to produce either EPA or DHA. Escherichia coli Nissle was transformed with the pfBS- plasmid carrying the EPA/DHA gene cluster, previously isolated from a marine bacterium. The transgenic E. coli Nissle produced EPA when grown at 10ºC (16.52 ± 1.4 mg g(-1) cell dry ), ºC (31.36 ± .25 mg g(-1) cell dry ), 20ºC (13.71 ± 2.8 mg g(-1) cell dry ), 25ºC (11.33 ± .44 mg g(-1) cell dry ) or 30ºC (.668 ± .073 mg g(-1) cell dry ). Although DHA was also produced at all these temperatures, it comprised less than .2% of total extracted fatty acids. Transcriptomic analysis using Reverse Transcription qPCR showed upregulation of the entire gene cluster in E. coli Nissle. Among EPA/DHA genes, pfaB, pfaC and pfaD were overexpressed (expression ratio of 181.9, 39.86 and 131.61, respectively) as compared to pfaA (expression ratio of 3.40) and pfaE (expression ratio of 4.05).

The feasibility of this technique has been demonstrated with low-molecular- compounds, macromolecular dyes, and proteins. Delivery of antisense oligonucleotides into the brain parenchyma represents an additional potential application of this technique not previously described. In this report, the authors examined the distribution and disposition of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (-ODN) infused for this reason. An 18-mer (35)S--ODN (molecular  approximately 6000) was infused over 1 hour into the caudate putamen of Fischer 344 rats. At 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after beginning the infusion, the brains were extracted and analyzed using quantitative autoradiographic techniques. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also aspirated from the cisterna magna and analyzed for radioactivity and stability of the (35)S--ODN. At 1 hour, the infused ODN was uniformly distributed in brain tissue, with a maximum average concentration of 4806.5 +/- 210.5 nCi/g. This represents a tissue concentration of 19.2 +/- .84 microM. Extensive spread into surrounding parenchyma was observed over the ensuing 47 hours. The (35)S--ODN radioactivity peaked in the CSF at the end of the 1-hour infusion, containing 10% (50 +/- 20 nCi) of the infused radioactivity. Activity then decayed exponentially over 11 hours, stabilizing at a lower CSF content of .2% (1 +/- .1 nCi). The volume of distribution (V(d)) was 105 +/- 7.9 mm3 at 1 hour, representing a ratio of V(d)/V(i) (volume of infusion) of 5.2. The V(d) increased to 443.4 +/- 62.3 mm(3) at the end of 48 hours, whereas the average minimum tissue concentration decreased from .2 to 3.2 microM. Undegraded 18-mer was seen throughout the 48-hour period using 20% polyacrylamide/7M urea gel electrophoresis. The animals tolerated the infusion without evidence of toxicity, and minimal structural changes in tissue were observed on histological examination. Thus, -ODN can be safely delivered in high concentrations to wide areas of the rat brain by using high-flow microinfusion, and the concentrations remain stable even after 48 hours in situ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27367614>Impact of newer self-monitoring technology and brief phone-based intervention on  loss: A randomized pilot study.</a></h1><p>Despite the proliferation of newer self-monitoring technology (e.g., activity monitors and smartphone apps), their impact on  loss outside of structured in-person behavioral intervention is unknown.A randomized, controlled pilot study was conducted to examine efficacy of self-monitoring technology, with and without phone-based intervention, on 6-month  loss in adults with overweight and obesity. Eighty participants were randomized to receive standard self-monitoring tools (ST, n = 26), technology-based self-monitoring tools (TECH, n = 27), or technology-based tools combined with phone-based intervention (TECH + PHONE, n = 27). All participants attended one introductory  loss session and completed assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. loss from baseline to 6 months differed significantly between groups P = .042; there was a trend for TECH + PHONE (-6.4 ± 1.2 kg) to lose more  than ST (-1.3 ± 1.2 kg);  loss in TECH (-4.1 ± 1.4 kg) was between ST and TECH + PHONE. Fewer ST (%) achieved ≥5%  losses compared with TECH and TECH + PHONE (44%), P = .039. Adherence to self-monitoring caloric intake was higher in TECH + PHONE than TECH or ST,  < .05.These results suggest use of newer self-monitoring technology plus brief phone-based intervention improves adherence and  loss compared with traditional self-monitoring tools.

The pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and its metabolites were characterized using both traditional noncompartmental analysis and population pharmacokinetics using NONMEM VI; pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic relationships of SN-38 with indices of toxicity were also evaluated.11 patients between 3 and 18 years were enrolled. Pharmacokinetic parameters and consideration of relevant covariates (performance status (), BSA, corrected body  (CBW), exponent of 3/4 on , etc.) were evaluated. Relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters of SN-38 and percentage change from baseline in patient biochemical response data were investigated via regression analysis.CPT-11 exhibited a mean clearance (CL) of .31 +/- 5.95 (l/h) (13.06 +/- 3.58 (l/hr/m(2))) and AUC(-inf) of 3547. +/- 1406.5 (ng x h/ml); the AUC ratio of parent CPT-11 to SN-38 was 5.%. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, decreasing  was significantly dependent on reduction in CL of CPT-11 (p < .001). The final model for CPT-11 are as follows: CL (l/h) = 1.31 x CBW(.75) (omegaCL = 21.7%), Vss (l) = 2.66 x CBW (omegaVss = 21.2%), Vc (l) = 1.13 x CBW, inter-compartment CL (l/h) = .257 x CBW(.75). Percentage changes of leucocyte and neutrophil count within a first month treatment were significantly correlated with Cmax of SN-38 (r = .78 and r = .74) and AUC0-2 of SN-38 (r = .73 and r = .73).Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to results published in several past reports.

Most of these early studies were done using loading methods not currently in favor, and using non-murine species. Our objective was to re-examine the effects of several loading parameters on the response of cortical bone using the contemporary murine axial tibial compression model. We subjected tibias of 5-month old, female C57Bl/6 mice to cyclic (4 Hz) mechanical loading and examined bone formation responses using dynamic and static histomorphometry. First, using a reference protocol of 1,200 cycles/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks, we confirmed the significant influence of peak strain magnitude on periosteal mineralizing surface (.MS/BS) and bone formation rate (.BFR/BS) (p < .05, ANOVA). There was a significant induction of periosteal lamellar bone at a lower threshold of approx. -1,000 μϵ and a transition from lamellar-woven bone near -2,000 μϵ. In contrast, on the endocortical surface, bone formation indices did not exhibit a load magnitude-dependent response and no incidence of woven bone. Next, we found that reducing daily cycle number from 1,200 to 300 to 60 did not diminish the bone formation response (p > .05). On the other hand, reducing the daily frequency of loading from 5 consecutive days/week to 3 alternate days/week significantly diminished the periosteal response, from a loading-induced increase in .MS/BS of 38% (loaded vs. control) for 5 days/week to only % for 3 days/week (p < .05). Finally, we determined that reducing the study duration from 2 to 1 weeks of loading did not affect bone formation outcomes. In conclusion, cyclic loading to -1,800 μϵ peak strain, at 4 Hz and 60 cycles/day for 5 consecutive days (1 week) induces an increase in periosteal lamellar bone formation with minimal incidence of woven bone in 5-month-old C57Bl/6 female mice. Our results provide a basis for reduction of loading duration (daily cycles and study length) without loss of anabolic effect as measured by dynamic histomorphometry. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

PL lineshapes of MDMO-PPV thin films as a function of annealing time were first measured to determine the spectroscopic signatures of chain conformations and packing in the absence of PCBM. Annealing results in enhanced interchain interactions leading to red-shifts of PL - transitions by up to ∼300 cm(-1) and apparent increases of the line shape Huang-Rhys factors. Wavelength-dependent PL lifetimes of as-cast and films annealed for short times (∼30 s) are nonexponential with an instrument-limited component of ∼100  and a ∼350  component. With longer annealing times, decays become single exponential with an average lifetime of ∼1 ns indicating that all excitations efficiently funnel to strongly coupled interchain sites. Addition of PCBM disrupts MDMO-PPV interchain interactions causing PL - transitions to blue-shift, increases in line width, and decreases in apparent Huang-Rhys factors. Resonance Raman spectra of MDMO-PPV/PCBM thin films with variable PCBM  fractions (∼50:1 up to 1:8 w/w) were then measured using short (488 nm) and long (568 nm) excitation wavelengths. The out-of-plane vinylene C-H wag mode of MDMO-PPV (∼964 cm(-1)) showed pronounced increases in intensity of up to ∼30% and red-shifts of up to 5 cm(-1) with increasing PCBM content. These changes result from a decrease of planarity between chain segments that suppresses interchain interactions. Furthermore, red-shifts of up to ∼4 cm(-1) were observed for the C═C symmetric stretch of the MDMO-PPV vinylene group (∼1625 cm(-1)) with 488 nm excitation. The sensitivity of the MDMO-PPV vinylene group vibrations with PCBM indicates preferential interactions between these two molecules and is consistent with intercalation of PCBM into the polymer structure. This assignment was confirmed by thermally annealing of MDMO-PPV/PCBM films to remove intercalated PCBM molecules, which partially restores interchain interactions as seen from smaller intensity increases (∼%) and red-shifts (∼2 cm(-1)) of the ∼964 cm(-1) mode. Overall, the spectroscopic results show that MDMO-PPV chains adopt distorted conformations (i.e., less intrachain order and shorter conjugation lengths) that have important implications for explaining the structural origins for large improvements in charge mobilities in MDMO-PPV/PCBM blends.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17905505>Toxicological evaluation of potassium sorbate added to cigarette tobacco.</a></h1><p>Potassium sorbate () may be incorporated in blended cigarette tobacco either as a mold growth inhibitor in processed tobacco sheet material, or as a preservative in flavor systems or paper adhesives. To evaluate the effect of  addition, neat material pyrolysis studies, smoke chemistry and biological activity studies (bacterial mutagenicity, cytotoxicity, in vivo micronucleus, and 90-day nose-only rat inhalation) with mainstream smoke, or mainstream smoke preparations from cigarettes containing various measured levels of  (%, .%, 1.6%, and 3.7%) were performed. At simulated tobacco burning temperatures up to 1000 degrees C, neat  completely pyrolyzed to form aromatic ring materials including benzene, toluene, substituted benzenes, naphthalene, and substituted naphthalenes. Under machine smoking conditions (FTC/ISO), high levels of  may alter the burning characteristics of the cigarette leading to decreased puff count, total particulate matter, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, 2-nitropropane, and tobacco specific nitrosamines yields in the smoke, while increasing the yield of nicotine, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, and some PAHs. Biological studies indicated no relevant differences in the genotoxic or cytotoxic potential of either mainstream smoke from cigarettes with or without added . Rats exposed to mainstream cigarette smoke developed respiratory tract changes consistent with those seen in previous smoke inhalation studies, with no relevant histopathological differences between the control and the  test cigarette groups. These studies demonstrated that high levels of  could alter the burning rate of the tobacco leading to alteration in the smoke chemistry profile. Yet, based on the panel of biological endpoints monitored here, it appeared that added  produced little relevant change in the overall toxicity profile of smoke.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16606714>Interaction of brine concentration, brine temperature, and presalting on salt penetration in Ragusano cheese.</a></h1><p>Thirty-one 3.6-kg blocks of Ragusano cheese were made on each of 6 different days (in different weeks) starting with a different batch of milk on each day. On d 1, 3, and 5, the cheeses were not presalted and on d 2, 4, and 6, all cheeses were presalted (). One of the 31 blocks of cheese was selected at random for analysis before brine salting (i.e., on d ). The remaining 30 blocks were randomly divided into 2 groups of  blocks each; one group was placed in 18% brine (18%B) and the other group was placed in saturated brine (SB). For the  blocks within each of the 2 brine concentrations (BC), 5 blocks were placed in a brine tank at 12 degrees C, 5 at  degrees C, and 5 at 18 degrees C, and submerged for 24 d. The research objective was to determine the combined impacts (i.e., interactions) of  the curd before stretching, BC (SB vs. 18%B), and brine temperature (BT; 12, , and 18 degrees C) on salt uptake, moisture content, and yield of Ragusano cheese. Although BC, BT, and  each had their own separate impacts on salt uptake, there was little interaction of these effects on salt uptake when they were used in combination. The  most quickly delivered salt to the interior of the cheese and was the most effective approach to salting for controlling early gas formation. There were strong separate impacts of BC, BT, and  on cheese moisture content, moisture loss, and net  loss, with BC having the largest separate impact on these parameters. Reducing BT reduced salt content and increased moisture, but the effects were small. The more important effect of reduced BT was to reduce growth of gas forming bacteria. The 18%B produced higher moisture, and less moisture and  loss than SB. The effect of interactions of BC, BT, and  on moisture loss and net  loss were small. To achieve the maximum benefit from the various approaches to salting for controlling early gas formation in Ragusano cheese,  combined with slightly lower BT (i.e.,  degrees C instead of 18 degrees C) should be used. Although using 18%B instead of SB did increase salt uptake, the point at which improved salt uptake occurred due to use of 18%B did not provide benefit in prevention of early gas formation, as reported separately. However, use of 18%B instead of SB provided a 9.98% increase in cheese yield due to reduced moisture loss during brining; this would be very attractive to cheese makers. The increase in yield needs to be balanced against the risk of growth of undesirable bacteria in the 18%B and the creation of another cheese quality defect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12209327>Purification of Taenia solium cysticerci superoxide dismutase and myoglobin copurification.</a></h1><p>Superoxide dismutase from Taenia solium cysticerci ( Ts SOD) was purified by sequential ion exchange chromatography on quaternary-amino-ethyl-cellulose (QAE) followed by hydrophobic interaction on phenyl sepharose () and chromatofocusing on a polybuffer exchanger 94 (PBE). Ts SOD is a 30 kDa molecular  dimeric enzyme with  kDa monomers. It is partially negative, hydrophilic, with 6.3 isoelectric point and has 2,900 U/mg activity. Bovine erythrocyte SOD antibodies cross react with Ts SOD. This enzyme is 80% inhibited by 10 mM of KCN suggesting that it has a Cu/Zn active site. Furthermore, Ts SOD totally loses its activity at 100 degrees C for 4 min. The first 25 amino acids from the Ts SOD N-terminal are (M K A V X V M R G E E G V K G V V H F T Q A G D A). This sequence is 76% similar to the Schistosoma mansoni Cu/Zn SOD. By chance, myoglobin (Mb) was also found during the purification process. A 16 kDa band was recognized in immunoblotting by horse heart Mb antibodies in QAE,  and PBE, the last-mentioned being found at pH 7..

Smartphone ownership was higher in NWCR participants (80.2% vs. 52.8%,  < .001), and NWCR smartphone owners had 23.1 times greater odds for using diet, food or calorie counter apps (58.9% vs. 5.9%) and .5 times greater odds for using  monitoring apps (31.7% vs. 3.%; all s < .01). Pew respondents more often changed their behaviour based on their tracking data (s < .01).Use of self-monitoring technology is common in  loss maintainers: more so than in a nationally representative sample.

However, its efficacy when compared to HD-DDP + RT has been questioned. At our institution, low-dose weekly carboplatin is added to Cx + RT for patients unsuitable for HD-DDP.We reviewed records of 16 patients with LA-HNSCC treated with definitive Cx + carboplatin + RT at the University of Miami from 2007 to 2011. Median follow-up was 24 months (range: 1-69 months).Median age: 71.5 years (range: 57-90 years);  male, 1 female. ECOG   = , 1 = 1. TNM staging was: T 1 = 1, T 2 = 5, T 3 = 8, T 4 = 2; N stage: N  = 8, N 1 = 5, N 2a = 2, N 2b = 1. All patients received weekly carboplatin (AUC 1.5-2), Cx given conventionally and daily conventionally fractionated RT. Median total weeks of concurrent systemic therapy = 7 (range: 3-8 weeks). RT was delivered to a median total dose of 70 Gy (range 30-74 Gy). Of the  evaluable patients, there were: 12 CR, 2 PR, and 1 PD. There were three local in-field failures, two regional failures, and three distant failures. At last follow-up, 8/ patients remained with NED. Three-year locoregional recurrence was 28.3% (95% CI: 7.7-53.9%). Mean percentage of  loss was 14% (range: 6-26%). Two patients required systemic therapy dose reduction. Three patients experienced a treatment delay and three did not finish RT as planned including a patient who received only 30 Gy due to death secondary to MI during treatment.In this small retrospective series, carboplatin/Cx/RT was well-tolerated and efficacious in patients unsuitable for HD-DDP having LA-HNSCC. Acute toxicities were similar to Cx + RT, likely due to the non-overlapping toxicity profiles of the two systemic agents. We hypothesize that the addition of a well-tolerated cytotoxic chemotherapy agent may improve the therapeutic ratio of Cx + RT in patients who are poor candidates for more aggressive therapies and warrants evaluation in a prospective manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25200383>Psychometric properties of the Compulsive Exercise Test in an adolescent eating disorder population.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the factor structure, validity, and reliability of the Compulsive Exercise Test (CET) in an adolescent clinical eating disorder population. The data source was the Helping to Outline Paediatric Eating Disorders (HOPE) Project, a prospective ongoing registry study comprising consecutive pediatric tertiary eating disorder referrals. Adolescents (N=104; 12-17years) with eating disorders completed the CET and other measures. Factor structure, convergent validity, and internal consistency were evaluated. Despite failing to identify a factor structure, the study provided clear evidence of the multidimensionality of the measure. The total score correlated significantly with measures of eating pathology, perfectionism, and frequency of exercise for shape and  control (r=.32-.70, <.05). More research into the multidimensional nature of compulsive exercise in clinical populations is needed.

All ACRC patients attending the clinic for palliative treatment were eligible for study. Demographics, including performance status (), C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin (Alb), Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), ,  history, body mass index (BMI), and nutritional status using the patient-generated subjective global assessment (PGSGA), were collected and correlated with survival. At a median follow-up of 29.8 mo, with a minimum follow-up of .7 mo, the median survival was 9.9 mo (.8-21.8 mo). Fifteen (29%) patients were newly diagnosed (stage IV colorectal cancer), and 36 (71%) had received prior chemotherapy. Although the median BMI was 27 kg/m2 (range = 17-41 kg/m2), 28 of 50 (56%) were nutritionally at risk. In fact, 19 patients (38%) were critically in need of nutrition intervention (PGSGA score of > or =9). Thirty-three of 48 patients (69%) had an elevated CRP (>10 mg/l with a median of 21.1 mg/L), and 7 patients (%) had both a CRP of >10 mg/l and hypoalbuminemia (< 35 g/l). A significant positive correlation was found between PGSGA score and CRP (P = .003; r = .430). Using univariate analysis, significantly worse survival was found for patients with poorer  (P = .001), high GPS (P = .04), low Alb (P = .017), elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP; P = .018), PGSGA score of > 9 (P = .001), and PGSGA group B/C (P = .02).

These new chiral heteroscorpionate ligands reacted with [ZnR] (R = Me, Et, CHSiMe) in a 1 : 1 molar ratio in toluene to give the mononuclear monoalkyl zinc complexes [Zn(R)(κ-NNO)] (4-12). When these reactions were carried out in a 1 : 2 molar ratio the binuclear trisalkyls [Zn(R)(κ-NNμ-O)Zn(R)] (13-18) were obtained. The structures of these complexes were elucidated by H and C{H} NMR spectroscopy and the X-ray crystal structures of 4 and 5 were also established. Interestingly, alkyl-containing zinc complexes 4-13,  and 17 act as efficient single-component initiators for the ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide at 20 °C to afford PLA materials with low molecular weights in a few hours. The dinuclear trisalkyls showed higher activity in comparison with the mononuclear zinc counterparts, suggesting a cooperative effect of the two remote metals. The narrow dispersity ranges (M/M = 1.05) of the isolated polymers in conjunction with the linear nature of the number average molecular  versus conversion plot provided evidence for living behavior. Inspection of the kinetic parameters showed that the propagations have the usual pseudo-first-order dependence on rac-lactide and catalyst concentration. End-group analysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed that the initiation occurs through nucleophilic attack of the alkyl on the lactide monomer. Microstructural analysis of poly(rac-lactide)s revealed that the most sterically hindered ligand on the alkoxide fragment exerts a moderate influence on the degree of stereoselectivity, with heteroenriched-PLAs (P = .68) produced at room temperature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16691546>Effect of various extracts and a polysaccharide from the edible mycelia of Cordyceps sinensis on cellular and humoral immune response against ovalbumin in mice.</a></h1><p>In this study, the edible mycelia of Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.)

Using four geographic sources, we found that dark mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio obscurus) ate  as well. We subsequently tested T. obscurus from Shandong, China for  degradation capability. Our results demonstrated the ability for  degradation within the gut of T. obscurus at greater rates than T. molitor. With expanded  foam as the sole diet, the specific  consumption rates for T. obscurus and T. molitor at similar sizes (2. cm, 62-64 mg per larva) were 32.44 ± .51 and 24.30 ± 1.34 mg 100 larvae d, respectively. After 31 days, the molecular  ( M) of residual  in frass (excrement) of T. obscurus decreased by 26.03%, remarkably higher than that of T. molitor (11.67%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated formation of functional groups of intermediates and chemical modification. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested that T. obscurus larvae degraded  effectively based on the proportion of  residue. Co-fed corn flour to T. obscurus and wheat bran to T. molitor increased total  consumption by 11.6% and .2%, respectively. Antibiotic gentamicin almost completely inhibited  depolymerization. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant shifts in the gut microbial community in both Tenebrio species that were associated with the  diet and  biodegradation, with changes in three predominant families (Enterobacteriaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Enterococcaceae).

We aimed to investigate the direct relationship between sarcopaenia and NAFLD or steatohepatitis in the general population.We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative samples of ,132 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011. Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/ (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001). After stratification, sarcopaenic subjects had an increased risk of NAFLD regardless of obesity (odds ratios [ORs]=1.55 to 3.02, depending on models; all <.001) or metabolic syndrome (ORs=1.63 to 4.00, all <.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated this independent association between sarcopaenia and NAFLD after adjusting for confounding factors related to obesity or insulin resistance (ORs=1.18 to 1.22, all <.001). Furthermore, among the NAFLD population, subjects with lower SMIs were likely to have advanced fibrosis compared with non-sarcopaenic individuals (BARD and FIB-4: ORs=1.83 and 1.69, respectively; both <.001). Compared with non-exercised subjects, individuals who exercised regularly had a lower risk of NAFLD (p<.001), particularly among obese people with well-preserved muscle mass.Sarcopaenia is associated with increased risks of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, independent of obesity or metabolic control.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), consisting of a blend of amorphous polymer and dielectric nanofillers, have been studied intensely to satisfy these goals; however, nanoparticle aggregates, field localization due to dielectric mismatch between particle and matrix, and the poorly understood role of interface compatibilization have challenged progress. To expand the understanding of the inter-relation between these factors and, thus, enable rational optimization of low and high contrast PNC dielectrics, we compare the dielectric performance of matrix-free hairy nanoparticle assemblies (aHNPs) to blended PNCs in the regime of low dielectric contrast to establish how morphology and interface impact energy storage and breakdown across different polymer matrices (polystyrene, , and poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and nanoparticle loadings (-50% (v/v) silica). The findings indicate that the route (aHNP versus blending) to well-dispersed morphology has, at most, a minor impact on breakdown strength trends with nanoparticle volume fraction; the only exception being at intermediate loadings of silica in PMMA (% (v/v)). Conversely, aHNPs show substantial improvements in reducing dielectric loss and maintaining charge/discharge efficiency. For example, low-frequency dielectric loss (1 Hz-1 kHz) of  and PMMA aHNP films was essentially unchanged up to a silica content of 50% (v/v), whereas traditional blends showed a monotonically increasing loss with silica loading. Similar benefits are seen via high-field polarization loop measurements where energy storage for ∼% (v/v) silica loaded PMMA and  aHNPs were 50% and 200% greater than respective comparable PNC blends. Overall, these findings on low dielectric contrast PNCs clearly point to the performance benefits of functionalizing the nanoparticle surface with high-molecular- polymers for polymer nanostructured dielectrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070659>Pubic symphysitis after transurethral resection of the prostate.</a></h1><p>Pubic symphysitis () after urological operations is uncommon.

Formic or acetic acid was used as a mobile phase to separate the carboxylic acids within  min. For liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), the ESI interface was used in both positive and negative ionization mode. ESI produced reasonable signals from positive ions, [M+NH(4)](+), of acetic, propionic and butyric acids and from negative ions, [M-H](-), of glycolic, lactic, 2-hydroxybutyric, malonic, succinic, glutaric, tartaric and citric acids. The effects of ionization parameters, source temperature, capillary voltage and cone voltage, on sensitivity and linearity were examined. Linear plots of peak area versus concentration were obtained over the range .1-20 ppm for MS detection. The detection limits of the target carboxylic acids calculated at signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3 ranged from 9 to 59 ppb. The reproducibility of retention times and peak areas were .55-1.25 and .85-2.45%, respectively.Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169416>[Cardiac metallothionein overexpression improves cardiac contractile function and attenuates oxidative stress in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice].</a></h1><p>This study was designed to examine the impact of the antioxidant metallothionein (MT) on cardiac contractile, intracellular Ca(2+) function and oxidative stress in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice. and age matched adult male FVB and cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 mg/kg Escherichia Coli LPS dissolved in sterile saline or an equivalent volume of pathogen-free saline (control groups). Six hours following LPS or saline injection, cardiac geometry and function were evaluated in anesthetized mice using the 2-D guided M-mode echocardiography. Mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) properties were examined in hearts. Cell shortening and relengthening were assessed using the following indices: peak shortening ()-indicative of the amplitude a cell can shorten during contraction; maximal velocities of cell shortening and relengthening (± dl/dt)-indicative of peak ventricular contractility; time-to- (TPS)-indicative of systolic duration; time-to-90% relengthening (TR(90))-indicative of diastolic duration (90% rather 100% relengthening was used to avoid noisy signal at baseline concentration). The 360 nm excitation scan was repeated at the end of the protocol and qualitative changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration were inferred from the ratio of fura-2 fluorescence intensity (FFI) at two wavelengths (360/380). Fluorescence decay time was measured as an indicator of the intracellular Ca(2+) clearing rate. Glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and ROS generation were detected as the markers of oxidative stress.Heart rate was increased while EF was reduced in LPS-FVB mice and heart rate was reduced and EF increased in MT-LPS transgenic mice [(528 ± 72) beats/min vs (557 ± 69) beats/min, (66 ± 14)% vs (42 ± 10)%, P < .05]. Cardiomyocytes from the LPS treated FVB mice displayed significantly reduced peak shortening () and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (±dl/dt) associated with prolonged time-to-90% relengthening (TR(90)), these effects were attenuated in cardiomyocytes from the MT-LPS mice [(5 ± 1.1)% vs (7.2 ± .8)%, dl/dt(160 ± ) µm/s vs (212 ± 36) µm/s, -dl/dt (175 ± 32) µm/s vs (208 ± 29) µm/s, TR(90) (.24 ± .03)s vs (.19 ± .02)s, P < .05]. LPS treated mice showed significantly reduced peak intracellular Ca(2+) and electrically-stimulated rise in intracellular Ca(2+) as well as prolonged intracellular Ca(2+) decay rate without affecting the basal intracellular Ca(2+) levels, again, these effects were significantly attenuated in MT-LPS transgenic mice. Metallothionein overexpression also ablated oxidative stress [reduced ROS generation and increased glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio, ROS (.35 ± .08) A/µg protein vs (.24 ± .03) A/µg protein].

Group B images were then obtained by applying  to group A image datasets. Subjective image quality was evaluated by two radiologists with a 5-point scoring system; the scores of the groups were compared. Image signal was assessed using CT values of the urinary bladder. CT and standard deviation (SD) values of the gluteus maximus were measured, and SD values of the gluteus maximus were used to represent image noise. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder were calculated. Image noise, SNR, and CNR of two groups were compared using paired t-tests.The subjective visual image quality scores of groups A and B, respectively, were 3.11 ± .30 vs. 3.82 ± .57; image noise was .79 ± 2.05 Hounsfield units (HU) vs. 11.06 ± 2.22 HU; SNRs of bladder were .50 ± .23 vs. .79 ± .39; and CNRs of bladder were 3.72 ± .85 vs. 5.14 ± 1.27. Group B showed better subjective image quality, lower image noise, and improved SNR and CNR, compared to group A; these differences were statistically significant (P < .05). The noise of group B was approximately 30% lower than that of group A; the SNR and CNR values of group B were improved by approximately 58% and 38%, respectively.Using 70 kVp +ASiR-V,  can improve the image quality of pelvic arterial phase CT images, significantly reduce the image noise, and improve the SNR and CNR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12718680>Passive Smoking and Other Factors at Different Periods of Life and Breast Cancer Risk in Chinese Women who have Never Smoked - A Case-control Study in Chongqing, People's Republic of China.</a></h1><p>A case-control study of breast cancer (BC) was conducted from 1994 to 1996 in Chongqing, People's Republic of China, in order to explore the etiological role of passive smoking (, so-called second hand smoking) as well as other early life factors (, height, socioeconomic status and history of suffering from a disease resulting in hospitalization). These factors were reviewed both in childhood (age less than 10 years) and in the teenage years (youth: 10 to 16 years). One hundred and eighty six cases of newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed BC, aged 24 to 55 years, were individually matched by day (within six months) and age (within 2 years) at diagnosis as well as marital status to 186 controls selected from outpatients not suffering from cancer. All subjects, cases and controls were never-smokers. A standardized questionnaire was used for interview in a face-to-face situation. After adjustment for a wide range of covariates using multiple logistic regression analysis,  was found to be a statistically significant risk factor for BC. This was found for exposure to  in childhood [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.24 (1.07-1.43)], in youth [1. (.90-1.47)] and in adulthood for either exposure at home [4.07 (2.21-7.50)] or at work [1.27 (1.04-1.55)]. For exposure to  in childhood, a significant dose-response effect was evident (test for trend, p<.05) with the number of smokers in the home, as well as the perceived level of exposure to , and in adulthood with the number of smokers at work. Our study also found an increased risk of BC in those with a past history of suffering from a disease requiring hospitalization [2.41 (1.21-4.81)]. Subjects with a low body  in childhood and with a poor economic status in youth were associated with increased risk of BC in their adulthood [1.54 (1.09-2.18) and 1.03 (1.00-1.06)]. Being overweight as an adult, however, was associated with a high risk of BC [1.76 (1.02-3.04)]. Age at menarche [.83 (.72-.95)] was associated negatively with risk of BC. A history of benign breast disease [2.05 (1.01-4.16)] or a history of life stress [2.32 (1.54-3.48)] were both associated with increased risk of BC. Our results therefore indicate a small but definite effect associated with , the credibility of which is enhanced by a dose-response relationship to BC risk. The other early life factors, such as age at menarche, history of suffering from a disease requiring hospitalization, history of benign breast disease, being overweight as an adult and life stress are similar to those consistently found in other countries. The associations involving low body , low socioeconomic status in early life and subsequent high risk of BC require further study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23613627>Depletion of telomerase RNA inhibits growth of gastrointestinal tumors transplanted in mice.</a></h1><p>To explore effects of telomerase RNA-targeting phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (-ASODN) on growth of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors transplanted in mice.A SCID mouse model for transplantation of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) was established using tumor cells from a patient who was diagnosed with GIST and consequently had been treated with imatinib. GIST cells cultured for 10 passages were used for inoculation into mice. Transfection of -ASODN was carried out with Lipotap Liposomal Transfection Reagent. GISTs that subsequently developed in SCID mice were subjected to intra-tumoral injection once daily from day 7 to day 28 post-inoculation, and mice were divided into the following four groups according to treatment: -ASODN group (5.00 μmoL/L of oligonucleotide, each mouse received .2 mL once daily); imatinib group (.1 mg/g body ); liposome negative control group (.01 mL/g); and saline group (.01 mL/g). On day 28, the mice were sacrificed, and tumor attributes including  and longest and shortest diameters were measured. Tumor growth was compared between treatment groups, and telomerase activity was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect expression of the mRNA encoding the apoptosis inhibition B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) gene.In the -ASODN group, tumor growth was inhibited by 59.437%, which was markedly higher than in the imatinib group (11.071%) and liposome negative control group (2.759%) [tumor inhibition = (mean tumor  of control group--mean tumor  of treatment group)/(mean tumor  of control group) × 100%]. Telomerase activity was significantly lower (P < .01) in the -ASODN group (.689 ± .158) compared with the imatinib group (1.838 ± .241), liposome negative control group (2.013 ± .273), and saline group (2.004 ± .163). Flow cytometry revealed that the apoptosis rate of tumor cells treated with -ASODN was 20.751% ± .789%, which was higher (P < .01) than that of the imatinib group (1.163% ± .469%), liposome negative control group (1.212% ± .310%), and saline group (1.172% ± .403%). Expression of bcl-2 mRNA in the transplanted GISTs was markedly downregulated (P < .01) in the -ASODN group (7.245 ± .739) compared with the imatinib group (14.153 ± 1.618) and liposome negative control group (16.396 ± 1.351).-ASODN can repress GIST growth, mediated perhaps by inhibition of telomerase activity and downregulation of bcl-2 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14739267>A cohesion/tension mechanism explains the gating of water channels (aquaporins) in Chara internodes by high concentration.</a></h1><p>Isolated internodes of Chara corallina have been used to study the gating of aquaporins (water channels) in the presence of high concentrations of osmotic solutes of different size (molecular ). Osmolytes were acetone and three glycol ethers: ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGMME), diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DEGMME), and triethylene glycol monoethyl ether (TEGMEE). The 'osmotic efficiency' of osmolytes was quite different. Their reflection coefficients ranged between . (acetone), .59 (EGMME), .78 (DEGMME), and .80 (TEGMEE). Bulk water permeability (Lp) and diffusive permeabilities () of heavy water (HDO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acetone, and glycol ethers (EGMME, DEGMME, and TEGMEE) were measured using a cell pressure probe. Cells were treated with different concentrations of osmotic solutes of up to 800 mM ( approximately 2. MPa of osmotic pressure). Inhibition of aquaporin activity increased with both increasing concentration and size of solutes (reflection coefficients). As cell Lp decreased,  increased, indicating that water and solutes used different passages across the plasma membrane. Similar to earlier findings of an osmotic gating of ion channels, a cohesion/tension model of the gating of water channels in Chara internodes by high concentration is proposed. According to the model, tensions (negative pressures) within water channels affected the open/closed state by changing the free energy between states and favoured a distorted/collapsed rather than the open state. They should have differed depending on the concentration and size of solutes that are more or less excluded from aquaporins. The bigger the solute, the lower was the concentration required to induce a reversible closure of aquaporins, as predicted by the model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28168382>Molecular Design, Expression and Evaluation of PASylated Human Recombinant Erythropoietin with Enhanced Functional Properties.</a></h1><p>Erythropoietin (EPO) is the principal hormone which, has somewhat short half-life involved in the differentiation and regulation of circulating red blood cells. The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of a polyethylene glycol mimetic technology as a biological alternative to improve pharmaceutical properties of human recombinant EPO. In silico models of EPO fused to 200 amino acids of proline, alanine, and serine (PAS) were initially generated and assessed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The fluctuations of the modeled structure reached a plateau after 6000  of MD simulation. The Phi and psi analysis showed >99.2% of residues were located in the allowed regions. An expression vector consisting of EPO cDNA tagged to PAS coding sequences was synthesized and expressed in CHO-K1 Cells. The produced PASylated molecule was purified and characterized by standard analytical methods. The molecular  of fusion protein was expanded to 70 kDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method. Analytical size exclusion chromatography revealed an approximately sevenfold increase in apparent size of produced protein. Although the in vitro potency of the fusion protein was significantly reduced (1.26 ± .05 vs. .24 ± .03 ng/ml) but, the in vivo activity was considerably increased up to 1.58 × 10 IU/ml in normocythemic mice assay. Pharmacokinetic animal studies revealed strongly .6-fold plasma half-life extension for the PASylated EPO (83.16 ± 13.28 h) in comparison to epoetin α (8.5 ± 2.4 h) and darbepoetin α (25.3 ± 2.2h).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25501329>Hydrolysate from eggshell membrane ameliorates intestinal inflammation in mice.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprises of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Cohn's disease (CD) as two main idiopathic pathologies resulting in immunologically mediated chronic inflammatory conditions. Several bioactive peptides and hydro lysates from natural sources have now been tested in animal models of human diseases for potential anti-inflammatory effects. Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a well-known natural bioactive material. In this study, we aim to study the anti-inflammatory activity of ESM hydro lysate (AL-) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, AL- was shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 secretion. In vivo treatment with AL- was shown to reduce dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced  loss, clinical signs of colitis and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 (p < .05). In addition, treatment with AL- also attenuated the severity of intestinal inflammation via down-regulation of IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This validates potential benefits of AL- as a novel preventative target molecule for treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30368560>New design total knee arthroplasty shows medial pivoting movement under -bearing conditions.</a></h1><p>To assess, using model-based dynamic radiostereometric analysis (RSA), the biomechanical behaviour of a new design posterior-stabilized () fixed-bearing (FB) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in vivo while patients performing two common motor tasks. The hypothesis was that model-based dynamic RSA is able to detect different behaviour of the implant under -bearing and non--bearing conditions.A cohort of  non-consecutive patients was evaluated by dynamic RSA 9 months after TKA implantation. The mean age of patients was 73.4 (65-72) years. The kinematic evaluations were performed using an RSA device (BI-STAND DRX 2) developed in our Institute. The patients were asked to perform two active motor tasks: sit-to-stand in -bearing condition; range of motion (ROM) while sitting on the chair. The motion parameters were evaluated using the Grood and Suntay decomposition and the low-point kinematics methods.The dynamic RSA evaluation showed a significant difference (p < .05) between the biomechanical behaviour of the prosthesis during the two motor tasks. When subjected to the patient  (in the sit-to-stand) the low point of the medial compartment had a shorter motion (5.7 ± .2 mm) than the lateral (11. ± .2 mm). This realizes a medial pivot motion as in the normal knee. In the ROM task, where the patient had no  on the prosthesis, this difference was not present: the medial compartment had a displacement of 12.7 ± .2 mm, while the lateral had 17.3 ± .2 mm.Model-based RSA proved to be an effective tool for the evaluation of TKA biomechanics. In particular, it was able to determine that the fixed-bearing posterior-stabilized TKA design evaluated in this study showed a medial pivoting movement under -bearing conditions that was not present when load was not applied. Under loading conditions what drives the pattern of movement is the prosthetic design itself. By the systematic use of this study protocol future comparisons among different implants could be performed, thus contributing significantly to the improvement of TKA design.IV.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22222320>Effects of unilateral and bilateral lower-body heavy resistance exercise on muscle activity and testosterone responses.</a></h1><p>Unilateral and bilateral lower-body heavy resistance exercises (HREs) are used for strength training. Little research has examined whether muscle activation and testosterone (TES) responses differ between these exercises. Our purpose was to compare the effects of unilateral and bilateral lower-body HRE on muscle activity using surface electromyography (sEMG) and TES concentrations. Ten resistance-trained, college-aged male athletes (football, track and field) completed 5 testing sessions in which bilateral (back squat [BS]) and unilateral (pitcher squat []) exercises were performed using a counterbalanced design. Sessions 1 and 2 determined estimated maximum strength (10 repetition maximum [10RM]) in the BS and . During testing session 3, muscle activation (sEMG) was measured in the right vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, and erector spinae (ES) during both BS and  (stance leg) exercises. In sessions 4 and 5, total TES concentrations (nanomoles per liter) were measured via blood draws at baseline (preexercise), , 5, 10, , and 30 minutes postexercise after 4 sets of 10 repetitions at the 10RM. Separate repeated-measures analyses of variance examined differences in sEMG and TES between BS and  (p < .05). The sEMG amplitudes were similar (p = .80) for BS (.22 ± .06 mV) and  (.20 ± .07 mV). The TES responses were also similar (p = .) between BS (21.8 ± 6.9 nmol·L(-1)) and  (26.2 ± 10.1 nmol·L(-1)). The similar lower limb and back sEMG and TES responses may indicate that the neuromuscular and hormonal demands were comparable for both the BS and  exercises despite the absolute work being less in the . The  exercise may be an effective method for including unilateral exercise into lower-body resistance training when designing training programs for ground-based activities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29954064>Increasing the Yield of Irish Brown Crab () during Processing without Adversely Affecting Shelf-Life.</a></h1><p>During the processing of Irish Brown Crab (), protein and moisture are released and losses up to 10% (by ) are common. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of clean label ingredients to reduce this loss, without adversely affecting shelf-life or promoting the growth of spoilage bacteria. Following preliminary studies, 5% () sodium caseinate (SC) and (5%, ) potato starch (), with and without (.5%, ) ascorbic acid (AA) were selected. Ninety crabs (30 per treatment) were soaked and boiled in water (control 1), AA (control 2), SC, , SC plus AA, or  plus AA and analyzed for cook loss as well as pH, aw, water holding capacity (WHC), and microbial shelf-life (total viable count (TVC), total Enterobacteriaceae count (TEC), and spoilage bacteria) during 28 days storage at 4 &deg;C. On average, 11.1% of the control 1  was lost during processing. This was reduced to 8.% when treated with AA (control 2) and to 3.5%, 4.7%, 5.8%, and 2.3% with SC, , SC plus AA, and  plus AA, respectively. None of these treatments negatively impacted on shelf-life and similar growth curves were observed for TVC, TEC,  spp.,  spp., lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and hydrogen disulphide producing bacteria, regardless of treatment. It was therefore concluded that, subject to sensory evaluation and validation under commercial conditions, these natural ingredients could be used to substantially increase the yield and hence commercial value of crab meat, without adversely affecting shelf-life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23369544>Effect of substitution of wheat starch by potato starch on the performance, digestive physiology and health of growing rabbits.</a></h1><p>The goal of this research was to study the effect of the substitution of wheat starch by potato starch () on the performance, health and digestion of growing rabbits. Three experimental diets were formulated with %, 7% and 14%  (PS0, PS7 and PS14, respectively) and similar starch contents (22% dry matter basis), proteins and fibre. The three diets were administered to three groups of 48 rabbits from weaning (28 days) to slaughter (70 days), and growth and health measurements were made. Another 10 rabbits per diet (30 rabbits at each age), reared under similar conditions, were slaughtered at 6 to 10 weeks of age, and the digesta were collected to analyse the caecal microbial activity (pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels, fibrolytic activity) and the starch concentration in the ileal digesta. At the same ages, the whole tract digestibility coefficients were measured in 10 other rabbits for each treatment (30 rabbits). The feed intake between 28 and 42 days of age (days) increased by 11% (P < .05) in PS0 v. PS14. Over the whole growth period (28 to 70 days),  gain was similar among diets (40.5 g/day), whereas the feed intake and feed conversion increased (8.5% and 5.2%, respectively; P < .05) with the PS14 diet. Mortality and morbidity were not affected by the diets. The starch concentration of the ileal contents increased (P < .01) with the addition of  to the diet (.39%, .77% and 1.08% for diets PS0, PS7 and PS14, respectively). Starch digestibility was .8 percentage units higher (99.8% v. 99.%) with the PS0 diet than the PS14 diet (P = .04). The bacterial cellulolytic activity in the caecum tended to be higher with the PS14 diet (P = .07). The total VFA caecal concentration increased (P < .01) only in 6-week-old rabbits with PS7 compared with PS0 (54.7 v. 74.5 mmol/l). Protein digestibility and ileal starch concentration decreased (P < .05) with age (6 v. 10 weeks), and hemicelluloses digestibility increased (P < .05). At 10 weeks of age, rabbits showed a higher VFA pool (6.25 mol) and proportion of butyrate (.9%) and a lower proportion of acetate (79.3%), ammonia level (7.5 mmol/l) and C3/C4 ratio (.31) than at 6 weeks of age. The intake of potato starch had no effect on the performance, caecal microbial activity or digestive health of growing rabbits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347374>Inoculations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase vegetable yields and decrease phoxim concentrations in carrot and green onion and their soils.</a></h1><p>As one of the most widely used organophosphate insecticides in vegetable production, phoxim (C(12)H()N(2)O(3)) is often found as residues in crops and soils and thus poses a potential threat to public health and environment. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may make a contribution to the decrease of organophosphate residues in crops and/or the degradation in soils, but such effects remain unknown.A greenhouse pot experiment studied the influence of AM fungi and phoxim application on the growth of carrot and green onion, and phoxim concentrations in the two vegetables and their soil media. Treatments included three AM fungal inoculations with Glomus intraradices BEG 141, G. mosseae BEG 167, and a nonmycorrhizal control, and four phoxim application rates (, 200, 400, 800 mg l(-1), while 400 mg l(-1) rate is the recommended dose in the vegetable production system). Carrot and green onion were grown in a greenhouse for 130 d and 150 d. Phoxim solution (100 ml) was poured into each pot around the roots 14d before plant harvest. Results showed that mycorrhizal colonization was higher than 70%, and phoxim application inhibited AM colonization on carrot but not on green onion. Compared with the nonmycorrhizal controls, both shoot and root fresh weights of these two vegetables were significantly increased by AM inoculations irrespective of phoxim application rates. Phoxim concentrations in shoots, roots and soils were increased with the increase of phoxim application rate, but significantly decreased by the AM inoculations. Soil phosphatase activity was enhanced by both AM inocula, but not affected by phoxim application rate. In general, G. intraradices BEG 141 had more pronounced effects than G. mosseae BEG 167 on the increase of fresh  production in both carrot and green onion, and the decrease of phoxim concentrations in plants and soils.Our results indicate a promising potential of AM fungi for enhancing vegetable production and reducing organophosphorus pesticide residues in plant tissues and their growth media, as well as for the phytoremediation of organophosphorus pesticide-contaminated soils.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26021978>Effects of obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus on placental phospholipids.</a></h1><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse effects in the offspring. The composition of placental glycerophospholipids (GPL) is known to be altered in GDM and might reflect an aberrant fatty acid transfer across the placenta and thus affect the foetal body composition. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of obesity and GDM, respectively, on placental GPL species composition. We investigated molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine () in term placentas from controls (lean non-diabetic, body-mass-index [BMI] 18-24.9k g/m(2), n=31), obese non-diabetics (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2), n=17) and lean diabetics (n=), using liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. PE(16:/22:6) and PE(18:/20:4) were increased in GDM and decreased species were PC(18:/20:3), PC(18:1/20:3) and (18:/18:2). A consistent difference between BMI related changes and changes caused by GDM was not observed. Arachidonic acid percentages of cord blood correlated with placental PC(16:/20:4), whereas foetal docosahexaenoic acid correlated to placental PE species. Furthermore, a positive correlation of placental  was found to levels of PE containing arachidonic acid. We demonstrated that obesity and GDM are associated with decreased dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents of placental GPL, with unknown consequences for the foetus. PC(16:/20:4) was identified as the major component for the supply of arachidonic acid to the foetal circulation, whereas PE containing arachidonic acid was found to be associated to the placental and infant growth.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2015.

The clinical features of the disease are similar in these two groups, and include peritoneal carcinomatosis, ascites, thrombocytemia, systemic symptoms (fever and night sweats), and hypercoagulability. There is no known curative therapy for this disease. Cisplatin has activity in 25% of patients. Mesothelial cells are known to contain high levels of carboxylesterase, a key enzyme in the activation of Irinotecan (CPT-11) to SN-38.

Seventy-five male Golden Syrian hamsters, weighing 100 to 120 g, were fed a regular rodent chow for 2 weeks before being randomly assigned into 5 groups of  animals each fed semisynthetic diets for 4 weeks. Group 1 was given a control diet that contained .25% cholesterol and 5% fat with a polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio of .4. Groups 2 to 5 were fed the control diet and given 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA (Licowax) (VLCFA25), 50 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA (VLCFA50), 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA+1000 mg/kg BW per day of LT (VLCFA25/LT), and 25 mg/kg BW per day of VLCFA+1000 mg/kg BW per day of  (Cholestatin, VLCFA25/), respectively. Results showed that HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were not changed by VLCFA25, although increased by VLCFA50 (P<.05) relative to control. Total cholesterol (T-C) and non-HDL-C levels were not affected by VLCFA25 and VLCFA50 as compared with control. VLCFA25/LT had higher (P<.02) T-C and HDL-C levels than any other treatments and increased (P<.05) liver  relative to control. In contrast, VLCFA25/ reduced T-C (P=.0004) and non-HDL-C (P=.007) without effect on HDL-C levels compared with control. Triglyceride levels were not affected by any treatment. Cholesterol biosynthesis rate was higher (P<.05) in animals fed VLCFA25 and VLCFA50 than those fed control or VLCFA25/LT or VLCFA25/. Results suggest that PSs can decrease total and non-HDL-C cholesterol, whereas VLCFA may increase HDL-C in hamsters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16896805>The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, prevents the development of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in the rat through reduction of endothelial cell apoptosis and overexpression of eNOS.</a></h1><p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors improve endothelial function and exert antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells of systemic vessels. This study was aimed to assess the protective effects of pravastatin (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) against monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats. Pravastatin (, 10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle were given orally for 28 days to Wistar male rats injected or not with monocrotaline (MC, 60 mg/kg intraperitonealy) and treated or not by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)  mg/kg/day. At 4 weeks, monocrotaline-injected rats developed severe pulmonary hypertension, with an increase in right ventricular pressure (RVP) and right ventricle/left ventricle+septum  ratio (RV/LV+S), associated with a decrease in pulmonary artery dilation induced either by acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside. Hypertensive pulmonary arteries exhibited an increase in medial thickness, medial wall area, endothelial cell apoptosis, and a decrease of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. Monocrotaline-rat lungs showed a significant decrease of eNOS expression (4080+/-27 vs 12189+/-761 arbitrary density units [ADU] for MC and control groups respectively, P<.01) and a significant increase of cleaved caspase-3 expression by western blotting (Control=11628+/-2395 vs MC=2326+/-2243 ADU, P<.05). A non-significant trend toward a reduced mortality was observed with pravastatin (relative risk of death = .33; 95% confidence interval [.08-1.30], P= .12 for MC+ vs MC groups). Pravastatine induced a protection against the development of the pulmonary hypertension (RVP in mmHg: 30+/-3 vs 45+/-4 and RV/LV+S: .46+/-.04 vs .62+/-.05 for MC+ and MC groups respectively, P<.05) and was associated with a significant reduction of MC-induced thickening (61+/-6 mum vs 81+/-3 mum for MC+ and MC groups respectively, P= .01) of the medial wall of the small intrapulmonary arteries. Pravastatin partially restored acetylcholine-induced pulmonary artery vasodilation in MC rats (Emax=65+/-5% and 46+/-3% for MC+ and MC group respectively, P<.05) but had no effect on acetylcholine-induced pulmonary artery vasodilation in MC+L-NAME rats. It also prevented apoptosis and restored eNOS expression of pulmonary artery endothelial cells, as well as in the whole lung. Pravastatin reduces the development of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension and improves endothelium-dependent pulmonary artery relaxation, probably through a reduced apoptosis and a restored eNOS expression of endothelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836630>Fatty Acid, Lipid Classes and Phospholipid Molecular Species Composition of the Marine Clam  (Sowerby 1851) from Cua Lo Beach, Nghe An Province, Vietnam.</a></h1><p>This study aims to analyze compositions of fatty acids and phospholipid molecular species in the hard clams  (Sowerby, 1851) harvested from Cua Lo beach, Nghe An province, Viet Nam. Total lipid of hard clams  occupied 1.7 ± .2% of wet weight and contained six classes: hydrocarbon and wax (HW), triacylglycerol (TAG), free fatty acids (FFA), sterol (ST), polar lipid (PoL), and monoalkyl diacylglycerol (MADAG). Among the constituents, the proportion of PoL accounted was highest, at 45.7%. In contrast, the figures for MADAG were lowest, at 1.3%. Twenty-six fatty acids were identified with the ratios of USAFA/SAFA was 2. The percentage of n-3 PUFA (ω-3) and n-6 PUFA (ω-6) was high, occupying 38.4% of total FA. Among PUFAs, arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) accounted for 3.8%, 7.8%, 2.2% and 12.% of total lipid of the clam respectively. Phospholipid molecular species were identified in polar lipids of the clams consisting six types: phosphatidylethalnolamine (PE, with 28 molecular species), phosphatidylcholine (PC, with 26 molecular species), phosphatidylserine (, with 18 molecular species), phosphatidylinositol (PI, with 10 molecular species), phosphatidylglycerol (PG, with only one molecular species), and ceramide aminoethylphosphonate (CAEP, with  molecular species). This is the first time that the molecular species of sphingophospholipid were determined, in  in particular, and for clams in general. Phospholipid formula species of PE and  were revealed to comprise two kinds: Alkenyl acyl glycerophosphoethanolamine and Alkenyl acyl glycerophosphoserine occupy 80.3% and 81.% of total PE and  species, respectively. In contrast, the percentage of diacyl glycero phosphatidylcholine was twice as high as that of PakCho in total PC, at 69.3, in comparison with 30.7%. In addition, phospholipid formula species of PI and PG comprised only diacyl glycoro phospholipids. PE 36:1 (p18:/18:1), PC 38:6 (16:/22:6),  38:1 (p18:/20:1), PI 40:5 (20:1/20:4), PG 32: (16:/16:) and CAEP 34:2 (16:2/d18:) were the major molecular species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20355850>A novel reactive processing technique: using telechelic polymers to reactively compatibilize polymer blends.</a></h1><p>Difunctional reactive polymers, telechelics, were used to reactively form multiblock copolymers in situ when melt-blended with a blend of polystyrene and polyisoprene. To quantify the ability of the copolymer to compatibilize the blends, the time evolution of the domain size upon annealing was analyzed by SEM. It was found that the most effective parameter to quantify the ability of the copolymer to inhibit droplet coalescence is K(rel)t(stable), the relative coarsening constant multiplied by the stabilization time. These results indicate that intermediate-molecular- telechelic pairs of both highly reactive Anhydride--Anhydride/NH(2)-PI-NH(2) and slower reacting Epoxy--Epoxy/COOH-PI-COOH both effectively suppress coalescence, with the optimal molecular  being slightly above the critical molecular  of the homopolymer, M(c). The effects of telechelic loading were also investigated, where the optimal loading concentration for this system was .5 wt %, as higher concentrations exhibited a plasticizing effect due to the presence of unreacted low-molecular- telechelics present in the blend. A determination of the interfacial coverage of the copolymer shows that a conversion of approximately 1.5-3.% was required for 20% surface coverage at 5. wt % telechelic loading, indicating a large excess of telechelics in this system. At the optimal loading level of .5 wt %, a conversion of % was required for 20% surface coverage. The results of these experiments provide a clear understanding of the role of telechelic loading and molecular  on its ability to reactively form interfacial modifiers in phase-separated polymer blends and provide guidelines for the development of similar reactive processing schemes that can use telechelic polymers to reactively compatibilize a broad range of polymer blends.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16851802>Ultrafast dynamics of liquid poly(ethylene glycol)s and crown ethers studied by femtosecond Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Ultrafast molecular dynamics of liquid poly(ethylene glycol)s, tetra(ethylene glycol), penta(ethylene glycol), and poly(ethylene glycol) with the molecular  of 600, and crown ethers, 12-crown-4 and -crown-5, have been investigated by means of femtosecond optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy. Picosecond Kerr transients of poly(ethylene glycol)s and crown ethers are characterized by a biexponential function with the time constants of about 2 and 20 . Both the faster and slower time constants do not vary much among the five oligo(ethylene oxide)s. Femtosecond dynamics is discussed based on the Kerr (depolarized Raman) spectra obtained by Fourier transform deconvolution analysis of the high time resolution Kerr transients. The broad low-frequency band (-200 cm(-1)) in the Kerr spectrum is analyzed by two Brownian oscillators. The spectral shapes of linear poly(ethylene glycol) and cyclic crown ether are very different. Both the low- and high-frequency Brownian oscillators for crown ethers show lower frequency and broader spectral features than those for poly(ethylene glycol)s. The comparison of the low-frequency spectra of poly(ethylene glycol)s and crown ethers shows that the low-frequency spectrum of -crown-5 is closer to that of poly(ethylene glycol)s than that of 12-crown-4 is. The difference of the low-frequency spectra between poly(ethylene glycol) and crown ether is discussed with the concepts of molecular conformation and liquid density. The features of the observed intramolecular vibrational bands are also correlated with the molecular conformations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685356>Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: Establishing a benchmark for the proportion of patients suitable for radical treatment.</a></h1><p>Outcome data from Cancer Care Ontario suggest that only 27% of patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receive chemoradiotherapy. However, many patients are not suitable for radical treatment. This study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with stage III NSCLC suitable for radical treatment and to examine reasons for choosing a palliative approach otherwise.This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed stage III NSCLC treated between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2009, at the Juravinski Cancer Centre, Canada. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes.A total of 122 patients with stage III NSCLC were included. Additional data on 37 patients with stage IV NSCLC and pleural effusions (previously stage IIIB) are included for comparison. Of the 122 patients, 61 (50%) received radical treatment and 61 (50%) were treated palliatively. Reasons for excluding patients from radical treatment were  loss (WL) > 10% within 3 months of presentation (11%), performance status () > 2 (16%), or combined poor  and WL (33%). Significant comorbid health problems excluded only % of patients from radical treatment. The median overall survival (OS) for patients treated radically was 23.3 months versus 7. months for those treated palliatively. Patients with poor  or WL > 10% had OS similar to that of patients with stage IV pleural effusion (7.1 months vs. 7.2 months). Patients with poor  and WL > 10% had the poorest survival (3 months).The present data do not support extrapolating radical treatment of stage III NSCLC beyond the eligibility criteria used in clinical trials.

Since the original description of deficiency of the pulmonary surfactant in premature neonates by Avery in 1959, RDS has most commonly been attributed to developmental immaturity of surfactant production. But in clinical practice it has been found that there was RDS in term and late-term neonates. Many of them were recognized as transient tachypnea at the beginning, they were diagnosed as RDS until respiratory distress and the typical radiological signs were demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of RDS of term and late-term neonates.All neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine between May, 2005 and May, 2007 on the basis of RDS were analyzed. RDS was diagnosed when respiratory distress and the typical radiological signs were documented. Patients were grouped into preterm group (Group 1, gestational age < 35 w, n = 103) and term and late-term group (Group 2, gestational age > or = 35 w, n = 74).In Group 1, 76 preterm infants were male, the mean gestational age was 31.1 w, the mean Apgar score at 1 min was 7.6, the mean birth  was 1702 g, 56 cases were vaginally delivered and 47 were delivered through Cesarean section. Only one was delivered via elective Cesarean section before onset of labor. A total of 88 patients needed mechanical ventilation (MV), the time for beginning MV was 8.7 h (1 - 72 h), and lasted for 4.3 d (.5 - 29 d). The oxygenation index (OI) was 11.9 (10.00 - 52.63) and PaO2/PAO2 was .29 (.03 - .98). Four patients had an OI > 40. A total of 28 patients were treated with pulmonary surfactant (), and 11 of the 28 underwent MV, the OI before and 2 h, 8 - 12 h and 20 - 24 h after using  were 10.5, 5.4, 3.4, and 4.3, respectively (P < .01). A total of 33 patients in Group 1 had intracranial hemorrhage, 4 patients had pneumothorax, 4 patients had persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and  patients had ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). In Group 2, 54 infants were male, the mean gestational age was 37 w, the mean Apgar score at 1 min was 8.5, the mean birth  was 2789 g, 8 cases were vaginally delivered, 66 were delivered through Cesarean section and 59 were delivered via elective Cesarean section before onset of labor. A total of 63 patients needed MV, the time for beginning MV was 27.8 h (1 - 72 h, compared to Group 1, P < .01), and lasted for 3.7 d (.5 - 13.5 d). The OI was 19.70 (10.00 - 56.67, compared to Group 1, P < .01) and PaO2/PAO2 was .16 (.017 - .470, compared to Group 1, P < .01). Seven patients had an OI > 40. A total of 8 patients were treated with  and 7 of them had MV, the OI before and 2 h, 8 - 12 h and 20 - 24 h after using  were 11.2, 7.6, 7.5, and 7.6 (the last two compared to group 1, P < .01, respectively). A total of 16 patients had pneumothorax, 10 patients had intracranial hemorrhage, 16 patients had PPHN and 7 patients had VAP.Most of the term and late-term neonates who developed RDS were delivered through cesarean section before onset of labor. They underwent MV later. The oxygenation was worse than RDS in preterm infants.  did not have the same effect as seen in preterm infants.

We hypothesized that baseline IR would be positively associated with follow-up body mass index (BMI) and fat mass.Two hundred and forty-nine healthy African American and Caucasian children aged 6-12 years at high risk for adult obesity because of early-onset childhood overweight and/or parental overweight were followed for up to  years with repeated BMI and fat mass measurements. We examined baseline serum insulin and homeostasis model of assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) as predictors of follow-up BMI Z-score and fat mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in mixed model longitudinal analyses accounting for baseline body composition, pubertal stage, sociodemographic factors and follow-up interval.At baseline, 39% were obese (BMI⩾95th percentile for age/sex). Data from 1335 annual visits were examined. Children were followed for an average of 7.2±4.3 years, with a maximum follow-up of  years. After accounting for covariates, neither baseline insulin nor HOMA-IR was significantly associated with follow-up BMI (>.26), BMIz score (>.22), fat mass (>.78) or fat mass percentage (>.71). In all models, baseline BMI (P<.0001), body fat mass (P<.0001) and percentage of fat (P<.001) were strong positive predictors for change in BMI and fat mass. In models restricted to children without obesity at baseline, some but not all models had significant interaction terms between body adiposity and insulinemia/HOMA-IR that suggested less gain in mass among those with greater insulin or IR. The opposite was found in some models restricted to children with obesity at baseline.In middle childhood, BMI and fat mass, but not insulin or IR, are strong predictors of children's gains in BMI and fat mass during adolescence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614559>Quantifying Actual and Perceived Inaccuracy When Estimating the Sugar, Energy Content and Portion Size of Foods.</a></h1><p>In order to adhere to dietary guidelines and manage health risks, consumers need to be able to estimate with some accuracy the sugar and energy content of foods. The present study compared how well participants could estimate the sugar and energy content of foods, the  of foods, and approximate portion size (using a hand measure estimation aid). The study had three aims. First, it aimed to investigate differences in accuracy across the four measures. Second, it aimed to examine whether these differences in accuracy between estimation measures were accurately perceived by the participants. Third, it aimed to test if estimation accuracy was related to food journaling experience, body-mass index or gender. One hundred and ninety-seven participants took part in an estimation task and filled in a questionnaire. While the participants were inaccurate when using all four estimation measures, inaccuracy was most pronounced for sugar content (s ≥ .39), which was consistently overestimated by between 62.1% and 98.5% of the sample. None of the other measures showed a consistent pattern of under- or overestimation. Participants' perceived accuracy did not match their actual accuracy (s ≤ |.20|, s ≥ .005). Actual accuracy showed only marginal covariation with food journaling experience (s ≤ 2.01, s ≥ .049, s ≤ .14), body-mass index (s ≤ |.|, s ≥ .041) or gender (s ≤ 3.17, s ≥ .002, s ≤ .46). It is particularly challenging for consumers to estimate the sugar content of food, which might have negative consequences for health and well-being. Thus, more education about sugar content and misperceptions is needed to support consumers so that they can make healthy food choices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634371>Course of depressive symptoms and treatment in the longitudinal assessment of bariatric surgery (LABS-2) study.</a></h1><p>To examine changes in depressive symptoms and treatment in the first 3 years following bariatric surgery.The longitudinal assessment of bariatric surgery-2 (LABS-2) is an observational cohort study of adults (n = 2,458) who underwent a bariatric surgical procedure at 1 of 10 US hospitals between 2006 and 2009. This study includes 2,148 participants who completed the Beck depression inventory (BDI) at baseline and ≥ one follow-up visit in years 1-3.At baseline, 40.4% self-reported treatment for depression. At least mild depressive symptoms (BDI score ≥ 10) were reported by 28.3%; moderate (BDI score 19-29) and severe (BDI score ≥30) symptoms were uncommon (4.2 and .5%, respectively). Mild-to-severe depressive symptoms independently increased the odds (OR = 1.75; P = .03) of a major adverse event within 30 days of surgery. Compared with baseline, symptom severity was significantly lower at all follow-up time points (e.g., mild-to-severe symptomatology was 8.9%, 6 months; 8.4%, 1year; 12.2%, 2 years; .6%, 3 years;  < .001), but increased between 1 and 3 years postoperatively (P < .01). Change in depressive symptoms was significantly related to change in body mass index (r = .42; P < 0001).Bariatric surgery has a positive impact on depressive features.

In this study, abundances and characteristics of microplastics in sediments and benthic organisms from the South Yellow Sea were investigated. First, we optimized the sediment sampling for microplastic analysis and found that the top layer (-5 cm) had the highest abundance, and microplastic abundances decreased significantly with increase in sediment depth. The abundance of microplastics was 560-4205 n/kg dry  in the surface sediments (the topmost 3 cm) of 14 sites and 1.7-47. n/g wet  in the tissues of benthic organisms. Moreover, microplastic abundances in sediments and benthic organisms were both positively correlated with water depth. Fibers, transparent microplastics, and small microplastics (<.5 mm) were the most dominant types in sediments and organisms. FTIR analysis showed that polypropylene (PP, 31%), polyester (PE, 24%), nylon (19%), and polystyrene (, %) were the most abundant polymers in sediments. The results of SEM showed rough surfaces and obvious cracks on the microplastics isolated from sediments. In addition, characteristics of microplastics in Ophiura sarsii, Crangon affinis, and Acila mirabilis were compared. Our results demonstrate that a comprehensive investigation of microplastics in sediments and benthic communities will help to fully understand the ecological risk of microplastic pollution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We applied a newly developed stable tracer approach to assess in one session in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and healthy older adults both the minimal amount of protein intake to obtain protein anabolism (anabolic threshold) and the efficiency of dietary protein to promote protein anabolism (anabolic capacity).We studied 12 clinically and  stable patients with moderate to very severe COPD (mean ± SE forced expiratory volume in 1 s: 36 ± 3% of predicted) and 10 healthy age-matched older adults. At 2-h intervals and in consecutive order, all participants consumed a mixture of ., .04, .10 and .30 g hydrolyzed casein protein×kg ffm×2 h and carbohydrates (2:1). We assessed whole body protein synthesis (), breakdown (PB), net  (-PB) and net protein balance (phenylalanine (PHE) intake - PHE to tyrosine (TYR) hydroxylation) by IV primed and continuous infusion of L-[ring-H]PHE and L-[C,N]-TYR. Anabolic threshold (net protein balance = ) and capacity (slope) were determined on an individual basis from the assumed linear relationship between protein intake and net protein balance.We confirmed a linear relationship between protein intake and net protein balance for all participants (R range: .9988-1., p ≤ .0006). On average, the anabolic threshold and anabolic capacity were comparable between the groups (anabolic threshold COPD vs. healthy: 3.82 ± .31 vs. 4.20 ± .36 μmol PHE × kg ffm × hr; anabolic capacity COPD vs. healthy: .952 ± .007 and .954 ± .004). At protein intake around the anabolic threshold (.04 and .10 g protein×kg ffm×2 h), the increase in net  resulted mainly from PB reduction (p < .0001) whereas at a higher protein intake (.30 g protein×kg ffm×2 h)  was also stimulated (p < .0001).The preserved anabolic threshold and capacity in clinically and  stable COPD patients suggests no disease related anabolic resistance and/or increased protein requirements.ClinicalTrials.gov; No. ; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether early life exposure to air pollution causes persistent cardiovascular consequences measured at adulthood. Pregnant FVB mice were exposed to filtered (FA) or concentrated ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) during gestation and nursing. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 at an average concentration of 51.69 μg/m(3) from the Columbus, OH region for 6 h/day, 7 days/wk in utero until weaning at 3 wk of age. Birth  was reduced in PM2.5 pups compared with FA (1.36 ± .12 g FA, n = 42 mice; 1.30 ± . g PM2.5, n = 67 P = .012). At adulthood, mice exposed to perinatal PM2.5 had reduced left ventricular fractional shortening compared with FA-exposed mice (43.6 ± 2.1% FA, 33.2 ± 1.6% PM2.5, P = .001) with greater left ventricular end systolic diameter. Pressure-volume loops showed reduced ejection fraction (79.1 ± 3.5% FA, 35.5 ± 9.5% PM2.5, P = .005), increased end-systolic volume (10.4 ± 2.5 μl FA, 39.5 ± 3.8 μl PM2.5, P = .001), and reduced dP/dt maximum (11,605 ± 200 μl/s FA, 9,569 ± 800 μl/s PM2.5, P = .05) and minimum (-9,203 ± 235 μl/s FA, -7,045 ± 189 μl/s PM2.5, P = .0005) in PM2.5-exposed mice. Isolated cardiomyocytes from the hearts of PM2.5-exposed mice had reduced peak shortening (%, 8.53 ± 2.82% FA, 6.82 ± 2.04% PM2.5, P = .003), slower calcium reuptake (τ, .22 ± .09 s FA, .26 ± .07 s PM2.5, P = .048), and reduced response to β-adrenergic stimulation compared with cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that were exposed to FA. Histological analyses revealed greater picro-sirius red-positive-stained areas in the PM2.5 vs. FA group, indicative of increased collagen deposition. We concluded that these data demonstrate the detrimental role of early life exposure to ambient particulate air pollution in programming of adult cardiovascular diseases and the potential for PM2.5 to induce persistent cardiac dysfunction at adulthood.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519490>Propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism in the developing rat impairs synaptic transmission and plasticity in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus.</a></h1><p>Reductions in thyroid hormone during critical periods of brain development can have devastating effects on neurological function that are permanent. Neurochemical, molecular and structural alterations in a variety of brain regions have been well documented, but little information is available on the consequences of developmental hypothyroidism on synaptic function. Developing rats were exposed to the thyrotoxicant, propylthiouracil (PTU:  or  ppm), through the drinking water of pregnant dams beginning on GD18 and extending throughout the lactational period. Male offspring were allowed to mature after termination of PTU exposure at weaning on PND21 and electrophyiological assessments of field potentials in the dentate gyrus were conducted under urethane anesthesia between 2 and 5 months of age. PTU dramatically reduced thyroid hormones on PND21 and produced deficits in body  that persisted to adulthood. Synaptic transmission was impaired as evidenced by reductions in excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope and population spike () amplitudes at a range of stimulus intensities. Long-term potentiation of the EPSP slope was impaired at both modest and strong intensity trains, whereas a paradoxical increase in  amplitude was observed in PTU-treated animals in response to high intensity trains. These data are the first to describe functional impairments in synaptic transmission and plasticity in situ as a result of PTU treatment and suggest that perturbations in synaptic function may contribute to learning deficits associated with developmental hypothyroidism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15838467>Early outcomes of endovascular versus open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Private Sector (NSQIP-).</a></h1><p>There remains no consensus on the appropriate application of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Information from administrative databases, industry-sponsored trials, and single institutions has inherent deficiencies. This study was designed to compare early outcomes of open (OPEN) versus EVAR in a contemporary (2000 to 2003) large, multicenter prospective cohort.Fourteen academic medical centers contributed data to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Private Sector (NSQIP-), which ensures uniform, comprehensive, prospective, and previously validated data entry by trained, independent nurse reviewers. A battery of clinical and demographic features was assessed with multivariate analysis for association with the principal study end points of 30-day operative mortality and morbidity.One thousand forty-two patients underwent elective infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs: 460 EVAR and 582 OPEN. EVAR patients were older (74 vs 71 years, P < .0001), included more men (84.6% vs 79.6%, P < .05), and had a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25.4% vs 17.9%, P < .01). EVAR resulted in significantly reduced overall morbidity (24% vs 35%, P < .0001) and hospital stay (4 vs 9 days, P < .0001). Cardiopulmonary and renal function-related comorbidities had the expected significant impact on mortality for both procedures at univariate analysis ( P < .05). While crude mortality rates between EVAR and OPEN did not differ significantly (2.8% vs 4.%) ( P = .32). After multivariate analysis, correlates of operative mortality included OPEN (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 5.78; P < .05), advanced age (OR, 1.11; P < .001), history of angina (OR, 5.54; P < .01), poor functional status (OR, 5.78; P < .001), history of  loss (OR, 7.42; P < .01), and preoperative dialysis (OR, 51.4; P < .0001). EVAR also compared favorably to OPEN (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.89; P < .0001) for overall morbidity.Significant morbidity accompanies AAA repair, even at major academic medical centers. These data strongly endorse EVAR as the preferred approach in the presence of significant cardiopulmonary or renal comorbidities, or poor preoperative functional status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897623>Effect of selenium supplementation and plane of nutrition on mares and their foals: foaling data.</a></h1><p>To investigate the maternal plane of nutrition and role of Se yeast on foaling variables and passive transfer of IgG, 28 Quarter Horse mares were used in a study with a randomized complete block design. Mares were blocked by expected foaling date and assigned randomly within block to dietary treatments. Dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial with 2 planes of nutrition, pasture or pasture + grain mix (fed at .75% of BW on an as-fed basis) and 2 concentrations of Se yeast ( or .3 mg/kg of DMI). This resulted in 4 treatments: pasture (PA), pasture + Se (), pasture + grain mix (PG), and pasture + grain mix + Se (PGS). Assuming DMI at 2% of BW, the mares fed PA and  received approximately 100% of the calculated NRC (2007) DE requirements, whereas PG and PGS received 120%. Selenium supplementation began 110 d before the estimated foaling date, and all dietary treatments were terminated at parturition. At parturition, foaling variables were recorded. Additionally, placental  was recorded and 2 samples from each placenta were collected for analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein. Colostrum was obtained for fat, protein, milk urea N, somatic cell count, and IgG analyses. Foal blood samples were collected at , 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after parturition for IgG analysis. There was no effect (P >or= .21) of Se or plane of nutrition on foaling variables; however, foal BW as a percentage of mare BW tended (P = .10) to be reduced in foals from mares on grain mix (PG and PGS; 7.6%) compared with mares not fed grain mix (PA and ; 8.%). There was also no effect (P >or= .20) of Se or plane of nutrition on placental cell number (mg of DNA/g), potential cellular activity (RNA:DNA), expulsion time, or . However, mares fed supplemental Se ( and PGS) had decreased (P = .02) placental cell size (24.1 mg of protein/mg of DNA) compared with mares not fed supplemental Se (PA and PG; 32.5 mg of protein/mg of DNA). There was also no effect (P >or= .18) of Se or plane of nutrition on colostral fat, protein, milk urea N, or somatic cell count. However, mares fed grain mix (PG and PGS) had less (P = .03) colostral IgG (76.5 g/L) compared with mares not fed grain mix (PA and ; 126.6 g/L). Foals from mares fed grain (PG and PGS) tended (P = .06) to have less overall serum IgG (13.6 g/L) compared with foals from mares not fed grain (PA and ; .3 g/L). These data indicate that the maternal diet during the last one-third of gestation affects placental efficiency and colostral IgG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15319247>The palliative benefits of MVP (mitomycin C, vinblastine and cisplatin) chemotherapy in patients with malignant mesothelioma.</a></h1><p>With the rising incidence of malignant mesothelioma (MM), it is important to optimise treatment to control symptoms, maintain quality of life and, if possible, prolong life. We have analysed prospectively collected data to evaluate a frequently used palliative chemotherapy regimen.Between October 1986 and May 2002 all patients with inoperable pleural mesothelioma were considered for treatment with MVP (mitomycin C 8 mg/m2 every 6 weeks, vinblastine 6 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) chemotherapy. Symptoms were assessed by physician assessment at baseline and after each cycle of chemotherapy.One hundred and fifty patients were treated with MVP for mesothelioma. Forty-three per cent had a performance status () 2 or worse. The response rate was .3%, with 68.6% having stable disease. Sixty-nine per cent reported an improvement in symptoms; in particular there were good responses for pain (71%), cough (62%) and dyspnoea (50%). The most common grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia (22%). Median overall survival was 7 months, with 1-year survival 31% and 2-year survival 11%. Median survival for patients with  /1 was 10 months, and was 6 months for patients with  2/3. Poor prognostic factors in univariate analysis included poor ,  loss, mixed or sarcomatoid histology, low haemoglobin and high white blood cell count. Excluding pathological subtype, the prognostic significance of poor  and  loss were retained in multivariate analysis.Palliation of symptoms in MM is achievable with current cisplatin-based treatments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500939>A randomized, double-blind, phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination for recurrent glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>We conducted a phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24+ recurrent glioblastoma to develop a new treatment modality.We randomly assigned 88 recurrent glioblastoma patients to receive PPV (n = 58) or the placebo (n = 30) at a 2-to-1 ratio. Four of 12 warehouse peptides selected based on preexisting peptide-specific immunoglobulin G levels or the corresponding placebos were injected 1×/week for 12 weeks.Our trial met neither the primary (overall survival [OS]) nor secondary endpoints. Unfavorable factors for OS of 58 PPV patients compared with 30 placebo patients were SART2-93 peptide selection (n = 13 vs 8, hazard ratio [HR]: .9), ≥70 years old (4 vs 4, 7.87), >70 kg body  (10 vs 7, 4.11), and performance status ()3 (8 vs 2, 2.82), respectively. Consequently, the median OS for PPV patients without SART2-93 selection plus one of these 3 favorable factors (<70 y old, ≤70 kg, or PS0-2) was significantly longer than that for the corresponding placebo patients (HR: .49, .44, and .51), respectively. Preexisting immunity against both all 12 warehouse peptides besides SART2-93 and the other cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope peptides was significantly depressed in the patients with SART2-93 selection (n = 21) compared with that of the patients without SART2-93 selection (n = 67). Biomarkers correlative for favorable OS of the PPV patients were a lower percentage of CD11b+CD14+HLA-DRlow immunosuppressive monocytes and a higher percentage of CD4+CD45RA- activated T cells, the intermediate levels of chemokine C-C ligand 2 (CCL2), vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, or haptoglobin, respectively.This phase III trial met neither the primary nor secondary endpoints.© The Author(s) 2018.

ASD transcatheter occlusion techniques have become alternative to surgical procedures. A number of different devices are available for transcatheter ASD closure. The type and incidence of complications depend partially upon different devices.A retrospective analysis was performed on the patients treated from October 1998 to January 2003. Transcatheter closure of ASD with Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) was performed in 119 patients, of whom 3 patients were multiple ASD, 3 associated with pulmonary stenosis () and 3 patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The age of the cases ranged from .8 to 17 years (mean 7.5 +/- 2.8 years) and the body  ranged from 6.7 to 88 kg (mean 23.7 +/- 7.8 kg). They all met with criteria for transcatheter closure. The balloon-stretched diameter of ASD was determined with fluoroscopy, ultrasound and measuring plate. A choice of device size was identical to or 1 approximately 2 mm larger than the stretched diameter (SD). A simultaneous PDA closure with device or balloon dilation was done in six cases associated with PDA or , respectively. Follow-up was performed based on the echocardiographic and clinical findings.In 119 cases examined with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), ASD mean diameter was (12.9 +/- 5.6) mm (6.5 - 34.5 mm), pulmonary mean pressure was (29. +/- 5.) mmHg (25. - 62. mmHg), and SD was (.7 +/- 4.8) mm (8. - 38. mm). The diameters of these devices were (. +/- 5.) mm (8 - 38 mm). The devices were successfully implanted in 112 cases. Of them, 3 patients had multiple ASD with one device occlusion. 6 cases associated with PDA or  were treated successfully with PDA occlusion or balloon dilatation, respectively. The immediate, one month and one year complete occlusion rates were 93.8% (105/112), 97.3% (109/112) and 98.2% (110/112), respectively. Residual shunt remained in 2 cases. No complication occurred except transient atrial premature beats and grade II type 1 A-V block in 5 cases (4.5%) and 1 cases (.9%), respectively. The whole time period of the procedure ranged from 25 to 68 minutes. The total follow up period was from one month to 4.3 years. No unsatisfactory device position or embolization or clinical evidence of bacterial arteritis was found during the follow-up period.Transcatheter closure of secundum ASD using the ASO is a safe and effective alternative to surgical repair. Transcatheter closure of secundum ASD associated with small anterior, inferior or posterior rim is feasible using ASO. ASO can be performed in infants and young children only if the diameter of disk is smaller than the diameter of atrial septum. Multiple ASD is not the contraindication for intervention. If the diameter of ASD is over 36 mm, the device choice should depend on the maximum diameter of ASD determined with echocardiography. TTE is suitable for the smaller ASD and TEE for the bigger ASD. It is very important to avoid air embolism and atrial perforation during the procedure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506941>High-frequency gastric electrical stimulation for the treatment of gastroparesis: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>High-frequency gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is a relatively new treatment for medically refractory gastroparesis. There have been a number of clinical studies based on the use of a high-frequency stimulator (Enterra, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate evidence for improved clinical outcome with this device.A literature search of major medical databases was performed for the period January 1992 to August 2008. Clinical studies involving an implanted high-frequency GES device were included and reported a range of clinical outcomes. Studies of external, temporary, and/or low-frequency GES were excluded.Of 13 included studies, 12 lacked controls and only one was blinded and randomized. Following GES, patients reported improvements in total symptom severity score (3/13 studies, mean difference 6.52 [confidence interval--CI: 1.32, 11.73]; P = .01), vomiting severity score (4/13, 1.45 [CI: .99, 1.91]; P < .0001), nausea severity score (4/13, 1.69 [CI: 1.26, 2.12]; P < .0001), SF-36 physical composite score (4/13, 8.05 [CI: 5.01, 11.10]; P < .0001), SF-36 mental composite score (4/13, 8.16 [CI: 4.85, 11.47]; P < .0001), requirement for enteral or parenteral nutrition (8/13, OR 5.53 [CI: 2.75, 11.13]; P < .001), and 4-h gastric emptying (5/13, 12.7% [CI: 9.8, .6]; P < .0001).  gain did not reach significance (3/13, 3.68 kg [CI: -.23, 7.58]; P = .07). The device removal or reimplantation rate was 8.3%.Results show substantial benefits for high-frequency GES in the treatment of gastroparesis. However, caution is necessary in interpreting the results, primarily because of the limitations of uncontrolled studies. Further controlled studies are required to confirm the clinical benefits of high-frequency GES.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30485919>Nutrition support in hospitalized cancer patients with malnutrition in China.</a></h1><p>Malnutrition has adverse impacts on survival of cancer patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition, and the nutrition support status in hospitalized patients with cancer in China.A multi-center, cross-sectional study was conducted in 29 tertiary public hospital wards in 14 Chinese cities. Malnutrition was defined as  loss (WL) >5% over the past 6 months or body mass index (BMI) <20 kg/m2 with WL >2%. The nutrition risk index (NRI) and performance status () were evaluated.1138 hospitalized cancer patients (93.4% of the initial sample, 662 men, 60.6±14.5 years) were enrolled. Overall, 41.3% of patients were malnourished. The percentage of nutritional disorders as determined by the NRI was 51.4%.  was  in 50.3%, 1 in .4%, 2 in 13.9%, and 3 or 4 in 20.4%. Compared with patients with  of -1, patients with  of 3-4 had a relative risk of malnutrition of 1.275 (95% CI .250-.488, p<.0001). Only 38.6% of patients received nutrition support, of whom 45.% of the malnourished and 31.9% of the non-malnourished patients did; 63.2% of patients complained of poor appetite, while merely 14.% of patients had received nutrition counseling.The prevalence of malnutrition is high in hospitalized cancer patients, and inappropriate use of nutritional interventions highlights the urgent need to define standard operating procedures and quality control process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297299>Comparison between normal saline and a polyelectrolyte solution for fluid resuscitation in severely dehydrated infants with acute diarrhoea.</a></h1><p>The optimal intravenous solution for rehydration of infants and children with severe dehydration is debated.The aim was to compare the efficacy of a polyelectrolyte solution (group ) with sodium chloride .9% solution (group NS) in rapid parenteral rehydration of severely dehydrated infants with acute diarrhoea.Primary outcomes were volume and time to hydration. Secondary outcomes were urea, creatinine, electrolytes, glucose, arterial pH and bicarbonate levels. Patients were assigned randomly and openly to one of the two treatment groups. Severe dehydration was defined as one or more of the following associated with any other sign of dehydration: depressed consciousness, a weak or absent pulse or capillary refill time > 10 sec. Peripheral blood samples for chemical pathology were collected before and after rapid fluid therapy. The mean age of the 36 enrolled infants was 9.1 mths. All had depressed consciousness or severe hypotension/shock. The fluid infusion rate was 50 ml/kg/hr until haemodynamic stability was restored (absence of severe hypotension and two urine emissions). Fluid volume, time to rehydration and  before and after rehydration were recorded.All infants recovered full pulse within 1 hr; most had a better level of consciousness or capillary refill <3 sec. Group NS ( infants) showed (before and after treatment, respectively) a decrease of plasma potassium (3.4 to 3.1 mmol/L, p=.07), bicarbonate (13.3 to 12.2 mmol/L, p=.01) and glucose (8.2 to 5.8 mmol/L, p<.01). Group  (21 infants) showed a decrease of potassium (4.4 to 3.2 mmol/L, p<.01) but an increase in bicarbonate (11.6 to 13.3 mmol/L, p<.01) and glucose (11.4 to 14.8 mmol/L, p=.08).Polyelectrolyte solution was as effective as normal saline on volume expansion and better for correcting acidosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18229964>Interfacial energetics of protein adsorption from aqueous buffer to surfaces with varying hydrophilicity.</a></h1><p>Adsorption isotherms constructed from time-and-concentration-dependent advancing contact angles thetaa show that the profound biochemical diversity among ten different blood proteins with molecular  spanning 10-1000 kDa has little discernible effect on the amount adsorbed from aqueous phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution after 1 h contact with a particular test surface selected from the full range of observable water wettability (as quantified by PBS adhesion tension tauoa=gammaolv cos thetaoa; where gammaolv is the liquid-vapor interfacial tension and thetaoa is the advancing PBS contact angle). The maximum advancing spreading pressure, Pimaxa, determined from adsorption isotherms decreases systematically with tauoa for methyl-terminated self-assembled monolayers (CH3 SAM, tauo=- mN/m), polystyrene spun-coated onto electronic-grade SiOx wafers (, tauo=7.2 mN/m), aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated SiOx surfaces (APTES, tauo = 42 mN/m), and fully water wettable SiOx (tauo=72 mN/m). Likewise, the apparent Gibbs' surface excess [Gammasl-Gammasv], which measures the difference in the amount of protein adsorbed Gamma (mol/cm2) at solid-vapor (SV) and solid-liquid (SL) interfaces, decreases with tauo from maximal values measured on the CH3 SAM surface through zero (no protein adsorption in excess of bulk solution concentration) near tauo=30 mN/m (thetaa=65 degrees). These latter results corroborate the conclusion drawn from independent studies that water is too strongly bound to surfaces with tauo>or=30 mN/m to be displaced by adsorbing protein and that, as a consequence, protein does not accumulate within the interfacial region of such surfaces at concentrations exceeding that of bulk solution ([Gammasl-Gammasv]= at tauo=30 mN/m). Results are collectively interpreted to mean that water controls protein adsorption to surfaces and that the mechanism of protein adsorption can be understood from this perspective for a diverse set of proteins with very different amino acid compositions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16197624>Safety and efficacy of irinotecan plus high-dose leucovorin and intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer: pooled analysis of two consecutive southern Italy cooperative oncology group trials.</a></h1><p>A biweekly regimen of irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on day 1 and levo-leucovorin (LV) 250 mg/m2 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 850 mg/m2 via intravenous bolus on day 2 was assessed in 2 consecutive randomized trials in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).Individual data of 254 patients were merged, and baseline features potentially affecting overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and occurrence of severe toxicity were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses.In the pooled series, ORR was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27%-39%). Liver-only disease (47% vs. 25%; P=.0012) and absence of previous  loss (38% vs. 20%; P=.0189) were significantly associated with a higher ORR on the multivariate analysis. Absence of  loss (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.93; P=.0377) was significantly associated with a longer PFS (7.5 months vs. 6 months). Median OS was .1 months (95% CI, 13.5-16.6 months). Primary surgery, good performance status (), only one metastatic site, and oxaliplatin-based second-line treatment independently predicted a longer OS.

The rapid (microsecond) initial charging of the capacitor can be used to infer the dielectric constant of the solution. The much slower decay of current arising from the polarization of electrodes depends on the differential capacitance of the diffuse clouds of charge carriers accumulating next to each electrode and on the ohmic resistance of the fluid. Using the Gouy-Chapman model for the differential capacitance, Debye lengths of 80-600 nm were deduced that decrease with increasing concentration of PIBS. Values of the Debye lengths were confirmed by performing independent measurements of double-layer repulsion between a 6 microm polystyrene () latex sphere and a -coated glass plate using total internal reflection microscopy in the same solutions. The charge carriers appear to be inverted PIBS micelles having apparent Stokes diameters of 20-40 nm. Dynamic light scattering reveals a broad distribution of sizes having an intensity-averaged diameter of  nm. This smaller size might arise (1) from overestimating the electrophoretic mobility of micelles by treating them as point charges or (2) because charged micelles are larger on average than uncharged micelles. When Faradaic reactions and zeta potentials on the electrodes can be neglected, such current versus time experiments yield values for the Debye length and ionic strength with less effort than force measurements. To obtain the concentration of charge carriers from measurements of conductivity, the mobility of the charge carriers must be known.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408625>Optimal Pulmonary Valve Annulus Diameter for Annulus Preservation in Tetralogy of Fallot May Be Far Smaller Than Normal Annulus Size.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that optimal pulmonary valve annulus (PVA) diameter upon annulus preservation (AP) in tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) may be far smaller than the normal diameter. Retrospective review of the 61 consecutive patients who underwent ToF repair between January 2016 and September 2017 was performed. Median age, body , and median PVA (Z) at repair were 166 days (interquartile range, IQR, 141-182 days), 7.4 kg (IQR, 6.6-8. kg), and -1.83 (IQR, -2.56 to -.90), respectively. Upon AP, subvalvar and supravalvar obstructions were completely eliminated, leaving a pressure gradient only at the valve level. AP was achieved in 58 patients (95.1%). Pulmonary valve intervention comprised commissurotomy in 35 patients, commissurotomy with bougination in 8 patients, and transannular patching in 3 patients. For  patients, the pulmonary valve was left intact. Median PVA diameter measured by Hegar dilator after PV intervention was 8 mm (IQR, 7-9 mm), which was 3.9 mm (IQR, 2.3-4.3 mm) smaller than normal dimension and translated to a PVA (Z) of -1.85 (IQR, -2.40 to -.78). Postrepair right and left ventricular pressure ratio was .47 ± .12. During the median follow-up duration of 353 days (IQR, 191-482 days), 4 patients (including 3 who underwent transannular patching) developed significant pulmonary regurgitation. Freedom from reintervention for , significant , and PR at 1 year was 92.4%, 83.2%, and 90.6%, respectively. Optimal PVA for AP may be far smaller than the normal diameter.

AYC aqueous dispersion containing 5% (w/v) AYC and .5% (w/v) glycerol was prepared. Subsequently, AYC was coated onto core granules containing acetaminophen (AAP). Spray mist size under various spray conditions and viscosity of the AYC aqueous dispersion at various AYC concentrations were measured. AYC spray mists were optically observed. The surface of AYC cast film and AYC-coated granules were observed with a confocal scanning laser microscope. We attempted to show the utility of AYC as a novel material for granule coating, following the tablet coating in our previous report. In addition, the film formation mechanism of AYC was investigated. A smooth surface of the AYC-coated granules was obtained at a coating ratio of only 5%, which generally requires approximately -30% coating against the core granule , with no aggregation. These results are attributable to the fact that the granules were coated with a large number of small mists of AYC and the coating progressed efficiently, and the thin film layer of AYC was formed on the granules by mutual tangling of the hydrogel layers of AYC polysaccharides. AAP release from AYC-coated granules was obviously rapid, suggesting the high utility of AYC as a coating material for the rapidly releasing granules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275596>Early  loss in a standalone mHealth intervention predicting treatment success.</a></h1><p>Early  loss is a strong predictor of longer-term and clinically meaningful  loss but has not been studied in the context of mobile health ('mHealth') interventions.GoalTracker was a randomized trial among adults (21-65 years) with overweight or obesity comparing three 12-week standalone mHealth interventions for  loss.

Collapsing across arms, this analysis examined participants with a 1-month  ( = 84), categorizing them as either early responders (≥2%  loss at 1 month) or early non-responders (<2%  loss at 1 month).Early responders - 36% of participants - had greater per cent  change at 3 months (-5.93% [95% confidence interval: -6.82%, -5.03%]) than early non-responders (-1.45% [-2.%, -.75%]), which was sustained at 6 months (-5.91% [-7.33%, -4.48%] vs. -1.28% [-2.37%, -.19%]; s < .0001). Over half (57%) of early responders achieved ≥5%  loss at 3 months vs. 11% of early non-responders. At 4 weeks, self-monitoring frequency (/diet) was significantly greater among early responders, which continued across 12 weeks.Responding early to an mHealth treatment is associated with higher engagement and greater likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful  loss.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14654926>Association of serum IL-6 levels with comprehensive geriatric assessment variables in a population of elderly cancer patients.</a></h1><p>The primary aim of this study was to find whether any association exists between serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, and the most important comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) variables such as functional status, cognitive functions and nutrition in a population of elderly cancer patients. The secondary aims were to find whether any difference existed between: i) age groups, ii) performance status scores, iii) patients who had lost  versus those who had not. Eighty-four elderly patients with advanced cancer were included in the study (stage III .4%, and stage IV 72.6%). Serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were significantly higher in elderly than in the other adult cancer patients. Among the CGA variables investigated, the most affected were functional status assessed by IADL, cognitive functions by MMSE and nutrition. The ECOG  was shown to be significantly associated with all the dimensions of CGA investigated: poor  (>/=2) corresponded to severe disabilities. As for the relationship of serum IL-6 with CGA variables, the strongest correlations were between IL-6 and functional status assessed by both Katz ADL (p=.0003), IADL (p=.0070) and nutrition (p=.0013). Moreover, we observed an association, although not statistically significant, between functional disability (ADL and IADL) and high IL-6 levels in individuals with  loss. IL-6 levels seem to be independently associated with all CGA variables investigated in the present study in a population of elderly cancer patients. Because the most important CGA variables, in particular functional status, have been observed to be strongly associated with survival, the present study, confirming our previously reported ones, suggests that IL-6 may be a reliable marker of disease outcome and supports the feasibility of using IL-6 as a sensitive outcome marker in studies based on novel approaches aiming at modifying age- and cancer-related biologic mechanisms.</p></html>
