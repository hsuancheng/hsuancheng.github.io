Novel approaches for the perfection of wound healing have been determined as a stitch in time saves nine. Dysregulation of the immune response is a key element in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases and serves as a potential target for novel therapeutic strategies. Vitamin B5 (VB5), also known as pantothenate or "anti-stress vitamin," is the precursor of coenzyme A, which is essential in every micro-organism. Many pantothenic acid amides acquire persuasive antimicrobial activity. Pantothenic acid improves surgical wounds healing with moisturizing and skin  enhancing potential. Its deficiency leads to reduced cortisol production, increased arthritic pain, myalgia, fatigue, headache, depression, insomnia, and widespread "proinflammatory" effects on the immune-system. VB5 triggers immune cells to produce cytokines and is multifunctional. The paradoxical effect of VB5 on the switch of anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines has been revealed. This review aims to present the long research journey of B5 as it is becoming a forerunner in the healing of wounds and in enhancing the immune , thus providing potentially important therapeutic implications. As its role in healing a wound stitch is promising, amending the immune system damage too is a hopeful target.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696187>Static magnetization of immobilized, weakly interacting, superparamagnetic nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>The magnetization curve and initial susceptibility of immobilized superparamagnetic nanoparticles are studied using statistical-mechanical theory and Monte Carlo computer simulations. The nanoparticles are considered to be distributed randomly within an implicit solid matrix, but with the easy axes distributed according to particular textures: these are aligned parallel or perpendicular to an external magnetic field, or randomly distributed. The magnetic properties are calculated as functions of the magnetic crystallographic anisotropy  (measured with respect to the thermal energy by a parameter σ), and the Langevin susceptibility (related to the dipolar coupling constant and the volume fraction). It is shown that the initial susceptibility χ is independent of σ in the random case, an increasing  of σ in the parallel case, and a decreasing  of σ in the perpendicular case. Including particle-particle interactions enhances χ, and especially so in the parallel case. A first-order modified mean-field (MMF1) theory is accurate as compared to the simulation results, except in the parallel case with a large value of σ. These observations can be explained in terms of the range and strength of the (effective) interactions and correlations between particles, and the effects of the orientational degrees of freedom. The full magnetization curves show that a parallel texture enhances the magnetization, while a perpendicular texture suppresses it, with the effects growing with increasing σ. In the random case, while the initial response is independent of σ, the high-field magnetization decreases with increasing σ. These trends can be explained by the energy required to rotate the magnetic moments with respect to the easy axes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651369>Discovering myeloid cell heterogeneity in the lung by means of next generation sequencing.</a></h1><p>The lung plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis, as it is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonary homeostasis is maintained by a network of tissue-resident cells, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells and leukocytes.

Recently developed unbiased next generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed cell heterogeneity in the lung with respect to  and pathology and has reshaped our knowledge. New phenotypes and distinct gene signatures have been identified, and these new findings enhance the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases.

A coding system to characterize patient assessments about opioids, physician responses to assessments, and patient-endorsed opioid side effects was developed and applied to transcripts of video-recorded visits. All visits were independently coded by 2 authors.Eighty-six established adult patients taking opioids for chronic pain; 49 physicians in 2 academic primary care clinics MAIN MEASURES: Frequency and topic of patients' opioid assessments; proportion of opioid assessments classified as clues (assessments indicating potential willingness to consider non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses); physician responses to patient clues; frequency and type of patient-endorsed side effects KEY RESULTS: Patients made a mean of 3.2 opioid assessments (median 2) per visit. The most common assessment topics were pain relief (51%), effect on  (21%), and opioid safety (14%). Forty-seven percent of opioid assessments (mean 1.5 per visit) were classified as clues. Fifty-three percent of visits included ≥ 1 clue; 21% of visits contained ≥ 3 clues. Physicians responded to patient clues with no/minimal response 43% of the time, sympathetic/empathetic statements 14% of the time, and further explored clues 43% of the time. Fifty-eight percent of patients endorsed ≥ 1 opioid-related side effect; 10% endorsed ≥ 3 side effects. The most commonly endorsed side effects were constipation (15% of patients), sedation (15%), withdrawal symptoms (13%), and nausea (12%).Patient statements suggesting openness to non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses are common during routine primary care visits. Listening for and exploring these clues may be a patient-centered strategy for broaching difficult topics with patients on long-term opioid therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665423>Identification of Metagenomics Structure and  Associated With Temporal Changes in Rat (Rattus norvegicus) Skin Microbiome During Health and Cutaneous Burn.</a></h1><p>The cutaneous skin microbiome is host to a vast ensemble of resident microbes that provide essential capabilities including protection of skin  integrity and modulation of the host immune response. Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin microbiome during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community  in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core microbiome that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).© The Author(s) 2019.

Follow-up studies examined the influence of extracellular application of three different natural blends of known anti-inflammatories, one a polysaccharide blend, and the other two antioxidant blends, one oil-soluble the other water-soluble, to examine ACasp-1 inhibition. Clinical work using the same blend of polysaccharides employed at 3% in a moisturizing formulation was examined for skin  recovery, measured with TEWL over a 60 hour time frame after tape stripping on 10 individuals, and extended moisturization, measured using corneometer conductance after a single product application out through a 48-hour regression on 10 individuals.In vitro results indicated that two exogenous activators, 60 mJ/cm UVB and 5 mM ATP, worked to upregulate expression of ACasp-1 within a 20 hour timeframe. Additional studies were conducted to examine the influence of three xtracellularly applied active ingredient blends. A blend of polysaccharides demonstrated potential to inhibit ACasp-1 expression in both UVB- and ATP-activated skin cells. Oil-soluble and water-soluble antioxidant blends inhibited ACasp-1 expression in UVB-activated keratinocytes but not ATP-activated keratinocytes.  disruption studies indicated that 3% of the polysaccharide blend accelerated  recovery in a 60 hour time frame as measured by TEWL. Skin hydration studies showed an ability for the polysaccharide blend to show significant improvements in skin hydration out to 48 hours after a single application versus a moisturizing placebo.The role of the skin's innate immune response, controlled by NLRP inflammasomes, is beginning to be linked to numerous skin conditions including inflammaging. In this work it was found that: 1) an in vitro assay could activate NHEKs to express NLRP inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression, 2) Ingredient blends inhibited UVB and ATP-induced NLRP inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression, and 3) skin  disruption improvements and extended skin hydration could be achieved with 3% of the polysaccharide blend.© 2019 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652502>Neutrophil-Derived Microvesicle Induced Dysfunction of Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells In Vitro.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB), composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) that are tightly linked by tight junction (TJ) proteins, restricts the movement of molecules between the periphery and the central nervous system. Elevated systemic levels of neutrophils have been detected in patients with altered BBB , but the role of neutrophils in BMEC dysfunction is unknown. Neutrophils are key players of the immune response and, when activated, produce neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMV). NMV have been shown to impact the integrity of endothelial cells throughout the body and we hypothesize that NMV released from circulating neutrophils interact with BMEC and induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Therefore, the current study investigated the interaction of NMV with human BMEC and determined whether they altered gene expression and  in vitro. Using flow cytometry and confocal imaging, NMV were shown to be internalized by the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 via a variety of energy-dependent mechanisms, including endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The internalization of NMV significantly altered the transcriptomic profile of hCMEC/D3, specifically inducing the dysregulation of genes associated with TJ, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and vesicular transport. Functional studies confirmed NMV significantly increased permeability and decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of a confluent monolayer of hCMEC/D3. These findings indicate that NMV interact with and affect gene expression of BMEC as well as impacting their integrity. We conclude that NMV may play an important role in modulating the permeability of BBB during an infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610731>Bone Marrow-Derived Cells Restore Functional Integrity of the Gut Epithelial and Vascular Barriers in a Model of Diabetes and ACE2 Deficiency.</a></h1><p>There is incomplete knowledge of the impact of bone marrow cells on the gut microbiome and gut  .We postulated that diabetes mellitus and systemic ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut  .Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from wild-type, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetes mellitus), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut  integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and bone marrow cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the ACE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted  was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells, but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan-producing bacteria. When compared with control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of myeloid angiogenic cells significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with peptidoglycan biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut  integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut  dysfunction, increased levels of peptidoglycan and FABP-2 (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein 2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n=21) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=23) compared with nondiabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that peptidoglycan activates a noncanonical TLR-2 (Toll-like receptor 2) associated MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88)-ARNO (ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide-binding site opener)-ARF6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6) signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of peptidoglycan on the endothelium.We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut   and dysbiosis in ACE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of myeloid angiogenic cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664714>Protein Expression and Functional Relevance of Efflux and Uptake Drug Transporters at the Blood-Brain  of Human Brain and Glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>The knowledge of transporter protein expression and  at the human blood-brain  (BBB) is critical to prediction of drug BBB penetration and design of strategies for improving drug brain/brain tumor delivery. This study determined absolute transporter protein abundances in isolated microvessels of human normal brain (N=30), glioblastoma (N=47), rat (N=10) and mouse brain (N=10), and cell membranes of MDCKII cell lines, using targeted proteomics. In glioblastoma microvessels, ABCB1, ABCG2, MCT1, GLUT1, Na/K ATPase, and Claudin-5 protein levels were significantly reduced, while LAT1 was increased and GLU1 remained the same, as compared to human normal brain microvessels. ABCC4, OATP1A2, OATP2B1, and OAT3 were undetectable in microvessels of both human brain and glioblastoma. Species difference in BBB transporter abundances was noted. Cellular permeability experiments and modeling simulations suggested that not a single apical uptake transporter, but a vectorial transport system consisting of an apical uptake transporter and basolateral efflux mechanism was required for efficient delivery of poor transmembrane permeability drugs from the blood to brain.© 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612457>Nuclear Mechanics and Cancer Cell Migration.</a></h1><p>As a cancer cell invades adjacent tissue, penetrates a basement membrane , or squeezes into a blood capillary, its nucleus can be greatly constricted. Here, we examine: (1) the passive and active deformation of the nucleus during 3D migration; (2) the nuclear structures-namely, the lamina and chromatin-that govern nuclear deformability; (3) the effect of large nuclear deformation on DNA and nuclear factors; and (4) the downstream consequences of mechanically stressing the nucleus. We focus especially on recent studies showing that constricted migration causes nuclear envelope rupture and excess DNA damage, leading to cell cycle suppression, possibly cell death, and ultimately it seems to heritable genomic variation. We first review the latest understanding of nuclear dynamics during cell migration, and then explore the functional effects of nuclear deformation, especially in relation to genome integrity and potentially cancerous mutations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626902>In vitro effects of glyphosate and Roundup on Sertoli cell .</a></h1><p>Roundup (R), a formulation that contains glyphosate (G) as the active ingredient, is a commonly used nonselective herbicide that has been proposed to affect male fertility. It is well known that an adequate Sertoli cell  is essential to maintain germ cell development. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether G and R are able to affect Sertoli cell functions, such as energy metabolism and blood-testis  (BTB) integrity. Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old rats were exposed to 10 and 100 ppm of G or R, doses which do not decrease cell viability. Neither G nor R caused impairment in lactate production or fatty acid oxidation. G and R decreased Transepithelial Electrical Resistance, which indicates the establishment of a Sertoli cell junction . However, neither G nor R modified the expression of claudin11, ZO1 and occludin, proteins that constitute the BTB. Analysis of cellular distribution of claudin11 by immunofluorescence showed that G and R induced a delocalization of the signal from membrane to the cytoplasm. The results suggest that G and R could alter an important  of Sertoli cell such as BTB integrity and thus they could compromise the normal development of spermatogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Irrespective of the type, all these disorders are generally produced by mutations in genes involved in a variety of cellular functions in the skin. These mutations lead to disruption of the stratum corneum and impairment of the skin , producing clinical features such as hyperkeratosis, skin scaling, erythema, fissures, pruritus, inflammation, and skin pain. Despite advances in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of ichthyoses, there is, to our knowledge, no definitive cure for skin manifestations, and current treatments consist of moisturizers, emollients, and keratolytic agents. In this respect, the development of new formulations based on nanotechnology could be useful to enhance their therapeutic effectiveness. In this article, we provide a comprehensive description of pharmacological treatments for cutaneous manifestations in patients with inherited ichthyosis and discuss novel approaches with therapeutic potential for this purpose.

Adenosine receptor activation in brain capillaries can modulate blood-brain  permeability by decreasing the protein levels and  of efflux transporters. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether the activation of adenosine receptors improves convulsions outcome in carbamazepine (CBZ) resistant animals and modulates the protein levels of efflux transporters (P-GP, MRP1, MRP2) in brain capillaries. We employed the window-pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling model to develop CBZ resistant rats by CBZ administration during the post-kindling phase, and tested if these animals displayed subsequent resistance to other antiepileptic drugs. Crucially, we investigated if the administration of a broad-spectrum adenosine agonist (NECA) improves convulsions control in CBZ resistant rats. Of potential therapeutic relevance, in CBZ resistant rats NECA restored the anticonvulsant effect of CBZ. We also evaluated how the resistance to CBZ and the activation of adenosine receptors with NECA affect protein levels of efflux transporters in brain capillaries, as quantified by western blot. While CBZ resistance was associated with the up-regulation of both P-GP/MRP2 in brain capillaries, with the administration of NECA in CBZ resistant rats, we observed a decrease of P-GP and an increase of MRP2 levels, in brain capillaries. Since the activation of adenosine receptors improves the outcome of convulsions probably through the modulation of the efflux transporters protein levels in brain capillaries, adenosine agonists could be useful as an adjunct therapy for the control of Drug Resistant Epilepsy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Acute cellular rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) are all risk factors for the subsequent development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Acute cellular rejection and lymphocytic bronchiolitis have well defined histopathologic diagnostic criteria and grading. Diagnosis of AMR requires a multidisciplinary approach. CLAD is the major  to long-term survival following lung transplantation. The most common phenotype of CLAD is bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) which is defined by a persistent obstructive decline in lung .

The cellular structure of the BBB is mainly composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), which are surrounded by astrocytic endfeet that are connected by tight junction proteins, pericytes and astrocytes. Recently, several studies have shown that aberrant increase in intracellular calcium levels in BMVECs lead to cellular metabolic disturbances and subsequent impairment of BBB integrity. Although multiple stresses can lead to intracellular calcium accumulation, inherent protective mechanisms in affected cells are subsequently activated to maintain calcium homeostasis. However, once the increase in intracellular calcium goes beyond a certain threshold, disturbances in cellular structures, protein expression, and the BBB permeability are inevitable. Here, we review recent research on the different factors regulating intracellular calcium concentrations and the mechanisms related to how calcium signaling cascades protect the BMVECs from outside injury. We also consider the potential of calcium signaling regulators as therapeutic targets for modulating intracellular calcium homeostasis and ameliorating BBB disruption in patients with calcium-related pathologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657094>Vegetable butters and oils in skin wound healing: Scientific evidence for new opportunities in dermatology.</a></h1><p>The use of vegetable butters and oils shows promising results in the treatment of skin wounds, as they have an effective impact on the phases of the wound-healing process through their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activities and by promoting cell proliferation, increasing collagen synthesis, stimulating dermal reconstruction, and repairing the skin's lipid  . In this article, in vitro and in vivo studies of argan (Argania spinosa), avocado (Persea americana), black cumin (Nigella sativa), calophyllum (Calophyllum inophyllum), coconut (Cocos nucifera), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), grape (Vitis vinifera), green coffee (Coffea arabica), lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus), linseed (Linum usitatissimum), lucuma (Pouteria lucuma), mango (Mangifera indica), olive (Olea europaea), pomegranate (Punica granatum), pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), rapeseed (Brassica napus), sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oils were reviewed. In many cases, vegetable oils proved to be more effective than synthetic wound-healing compounds used as controls. The fatty-acid components of vegetable oils are assumed to play a major role in the wound-healing process, in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid. Evidence shows that oils with a higher linoleic to oleic acid ratio are more effective for lipid  repair. However, in depth studies are needed to gain knowledge about vegetable oils' effects on the skin and vice versa.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657241>Transcerebral exchange kinetics of large neutral amino acids during acute inspiratory hypoxia in humans.</a></h1><p>Hypoxaemia is present in many critically ill patients, and may contribute to encephalopathy. Changes in the passage of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) across the blood-brain  (BBB) with an increased cerebral influx of aromatic amino acids into the brain may concurrently be present and also contribute to encephalopathy, but it has not been established whether hypoxaemia  may trigger such changes. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 11 healthy men using the Kety-Schmidt technique and obtained paired arterial and jugular-venous blood samples for the determination of LNAAs by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline and after 9 hours of poikilocapnic normobaric hypoxia (12% O). Transcerebral net exchange was determined by the Fick principle, and transport of LNAAs across the BBB was determined mathematically. Hypoxia increased both the systemic and corresponding cerebral delivery of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine, and the branched-chain amino acids leucine and isoleucine. Despite this, the transcerebral net exchange values and mathematically derived brain extracellular concentrations for all LNAAs were unaffected. In conclusion, the observed changes in circulating LNAAs triggered by hypoxaemia do not affect the transcerebral exchange kinetics of LNAAs to such an extent that their brain extracellular concentrations are affected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660028>Gut-liver axis signaling in portal hypertension.</a></h1><p>Portal hypertension (PHT) in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) results from increased intrahepatic resistance caused by pathologic changes of liver tissue composition (structural component) and intrahepatic vasoconstriction (functional component). PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal  in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal   is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of microbiota composition and , intestinal  integrity, as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

Recent models have furthermore incorporated 3D extracellular matrix hydrogels to recapitulate the composition and cell-matrix interactions found in the native microenvironment. Assessment of   in these 3D organ-on-a-chip models, however, is typically limited to diffusive permeability measurements that are exclusively fluorescence-based. In this work, an on-chip electrochemical method to measure endothelial permeability in a 3D hydrogel-based vascular model was developed that replaces the ubiquitous fluorescent tracer with an electroactive one. Unlike the traditional fluorescent-based method, this electrochemical method eliminates the need for bulky, costly and complex optical instrumentation that require measurements to be performed outside of the incubator. A 3D extracellular matrix gel-based microfluidic model was first developed that incorporates capillary pressure  microstructures. Micromilling of thermoplastics was used to fabricate these microstructures in a rapid, moldless fashion. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the permeability of endothelial cells cultured on hydrogels was electrochemically measured after being subject to perfusion conditions, and following exposure to known permeability mediators. In summary, the electrochemical permeability assay possesses both the benefits of on-chip integration and robustness of the traditional fluorescence-based assay while also enabling the measurement of   in an organ-on-a-chip incorporating 3D culture conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Stable  silencing in HLMVECs resulted in impaired endothelial   and constitutive activation of P38MAPK.

During this time period there were 38 GWASs reported in 19 papers, including the largest performed to date for many of these conditions. Overall, we learned that childhood onset asthma is associated with the most independent loci compared to other defined groups of asthma and allergic disease cases; adult onset asthma and moderate-to-severe asthma are associated with fewer genes, which are largely a subset of those associated with childhood onset asthma. There is significant genetic overlap between asthma and allergic diseases, particularly with respect to childhood onset asthma, which harbors genes that reflect the importance of   biology, and to HLA region genes, which are the most frequently associated genes overall in both groups of diseases. Although the largest GWASs in African American and Latino/Hispanic populations were reported during this period, they are still significantly underpowered compared to studies reported in European ancestry populations, highlighting the need for larger studies, particularly in childhood onset asthma and allergic diseases, in these important populations that carry the greatest burden of disease.Copyright © 2019.

After establishment of a preclinical IPAA model in rats, the impact of the pan-PHD small-molecule inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced pouchitis was studied. Clinical and molecular parameters were investigated.PHD1, but not PHD2 or PHD3, was overexpressed in pouchitis in biopsies of patients with IPAA for UC but not FAP. In addition, PHD1 expression correlated with disease activity. DMOG treatment profoundly mitigated DSS-induced pouchitis in a rodent IPAA model. Mechanistically, DMOG restored intestinal epithelial   by induction of tight junction proteins zona occludens-1 and claudin-1 and alleviation of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, thus attenuating pouch inflammation.Together, these results establish a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting PHD1 with small-molecule inhibitors in pouchitis after IPAA for UC.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Oxidative stress is known as one of the major pathological factor in ischemia. Since the precise  of AR protein in ischemic injury is fully unclear, we examined the  of AR protein in hippocampal neuronal (HT-22) cells and in an animal model of ischemia in this study. Cell permeable Tat-AR protein was produced by fusion of protein transduction domain in Tat for delivery into the cells. Tat-AR protein transduced into HT-22 cells and significantly inhibited cell death and regulated the mitogen-activate protein kinases (MAPKs), Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3 under oxidative stress condition. In an ischemic animal model, Tat-AR protein transduced into the brain tissues through the blood-brain  (BBB) and drastically decreased neuronal cell death in hippocampal CA1 region.

Such infants may continue to grow slowly after birth, regardless of birth weight (BW), due to morbidities related to their immature organs. Severe GR increases the susceptibility to infections, but it is not clear if this is a consequence of impaired systemic immunity or other factors, such as prolonged hospital stay or poor mucosal  . Using preterm pigs as models for preterm infants, we hypothesized that moderate GR, exerting limited clinical effects, does not influence systemic immune development.  Preterm pigs were delivered by cesarean section and fed bovine milk diets until 19 d. Piglets with fetal growth restriction (F-GR, the lowest 25% of BW,  = 27, excluding those with BW <350 g) and postnatal growth restriction (P-GR, the lowest 25% of postnatal growth rate,  = 24) were compared with their corresponding controls (F-CON,  = 92, and P-CON,  = 85, respectively). Organ weights were determined and blood collected for assessment of clinical status (blood chemistry and hematology). For a subgroup ( = 58), in depth analyses of neutrophil , T cell counts, plasma cytokine levels, and leucocyte gene expression were performed.  For F-GR pigs, adrenal gland weight was increased and bone mineral content decreased at 19 d. Total leucocyte levels were lower at birth and interleukin-10 levels increased at d 8-10. In P-GR pigs, total leucocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts along with helper T cell fractions were elevated at 8-19 d of age, while the fraction of neutrophils with phagocytic capacity was reduced. Diarrhea and all remaining organ weights, blood chemistry, and immune variables were not affected by F-GR or P-GR.  Moderate GR before and after preterm birth has limited effect on systemic immune development in preterm pigs, despite marginal effects on immune cell populations, adrenocortical , and body composition. Similar responses may be observed for preterm infants with moderate fetal and postnatal growth restriction.Copyright © 2019 Bæk, Sangild, Thymann and Nguyen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626040>Overexpression of BCL-2 in the Intestinal Epithelium Prevents Sepsis-Induced Gut   Via Altering Tight Junction Protein Expression.</a></h1><p>Sepsis induces both intestinal hyperpermeability and epithelial apoptosis. While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent gut  dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the gut epithelium (Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal tight junctions were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin 5 and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins 2, 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all tight junction mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via tight junction alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl-2 overexpression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636247>An Autopsy Case of Pulmonary Capillary Hemangiomatosis with an Electron Microscopy Study.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) are rare diseases that share clinical, X-ray, and histological features. Most patients have poor prognosis due to severe respiratory impairment. Recently, EIF2AK4 mutations were found in some patients with PCH and PVOD, but the role of this mutation is still unknown. We report an autopsy case of PCH and discuss a mechanism of respiratory dysfunction based on an electron microscopy study. CASE REPORT The patient was a Japanese man in his sixties. He suffered from acute exacerbation of dyspnea during treatment of COPD. Respiratory  testing revealed DLCO' 32.1% and DLCO'/VA 23.6%. Echocardiography demonstrated findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension. A CT scan showed mild emphysema and small ground-glass opacity in the lungs. However, we could not find the exact cause of his respiratory failure and he died 28 days after admission. At autopsy, the histology showed multilayering capillary proliferation within the alveolar walls. Electron microscopy examination revealed prominent widening of the air-blood , scarce fusion of the epithelial and capillary basement membranes, and frequent narrowing of the capillary lumen. CONCLUSIONS We reported an autopsy case with PCH with no histological findings of PVOD. Whether PCH and PVOD are 2 different histological patterns of the same disease remains to be verified. The changes in the air-blood  detected by electron microscopy may explain the respiratory impairment and pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695329>In-vitro blood-brain  models for drug screening and permeation studies: an overview.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) is comprised of brain microvascular endothelial central nervous system (CNS) cells, which communicate with other CNS cells (astrocytes, pericytes) and behave according to the state of the CNS, by responding against pathological environments and modulating disease progression. The BBB plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in the CNS by maintaining restricted transport of toxic or harmful molecules, transport of nutrients, and removal of metabolites from the brain. Neurological disorders, such as NeuroHIV, cerebral stroke, brain tumors, and other neurodegenerative diseases increase the permeability of the BBB. While on the other hand, semipermeable nature of BBB restricts the movement of bigger molecules i.e. drugs or proteins (>500 kDa) across it, leading to minimal bioavailability of drugs in the CNS. This poses the most significant shortcoming in the development of therapeutics for CNS neurodegenerative disorders. Although the complexity of the BBB (dynamic and adaptable ) affects approaches of CNS drug delivery and promotes disease progression, understanding the composition and functions of BBB provides a platform for novel innovative approaches towards drug delivery to CNS. The methodical and scientific interests in the  and pathology of the BBB led to the development and the advancement of numerous in vitro models of the BBB. This review discusses the fundamentals of BBB structure, permeation mechanisms, an overview of all the different in-vitro BBB models with their advantages and disadvantages, and rationale of selecting penetration prediction methods towards the critical role in the development of the CNS therapeutics.© 2019 Bagchi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614347>In vivo Tracking of DNA for Precise Determination of the Stratum Corneum Thickness and Superficial Microbiome Using Confocal Raman Microscopy.</a></h1><p>The skin   is mostly provided by the stratum corneum (SC), the uppermost layer of the epidermis. To noninvasively analyze the physiological properties of the skin  functionin vivo, it is important to determine the SC thickness. Confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) is widely used for this task. In the present in vivo study, a new method based on the determination of the DNA concentration profile using CRM is introduced for determining the SC thickness. The obtained SC thickness values are compared with those obtained using other CRM-based methods determining the water and lipid depth profiles. The obtained results show almost no significant differences in SC thickness for the utilized methods. Therefore, the results indicate that it is possible to calculate the SC thickness by using the DNA profile in the fingerprint region, which is comparable with the SC thickness calculated by the water depth profiles (ANOVA test p = 0.77) and the lipid depth profile (ANOVA test p = 0.74). This provides the possibility to measure the SC thickness by using the DNA profile, in case the water or lipid profile analyses are influenced by a topically applied formulation. The increase in DNA concentration in the superficial SC (0-2 µm) is related to the DNA presence in the microbiome of the skin, which was not present in the SC depth below 4 µm.© 2019 S.

Despite restrict cigarette smoking ban in indoor or some outdoor locations, the risk of non-smokers to be exposed to environmental cigarette smoke is not yet eliminated. Beside the well-known effects of cigarette smoke to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, a growing literature has shown during the last 3 decades its noxious effects also on cutaneous tissues. Being the largest organ as well as the interface between the outer environment and the body, human skin acts as a natural shield which is continuously exposed to harmful exogenous agents. Thus, a prolonged and/or repetitive exposure to significant levels of toxic smoke pollutants may have detrimental effects on the cutaneous tissue by disrupting the epidermal   and by exacerbating inflammatory skin disorders (i.e. psoriasis, atopic dermatitis). With the development of very complex skin tissue models and sophisticated cigarette smoke exposure systems it has become important to better understand the toxicity pathways induced by smoke pollutants in more realistic laboratory conditions to find solutions for counteracting their effects. This review provides an update on the skin models currently available to study cigarette smoke exposure and the known pathways involved in cutaneous toxicity. In addition, the article will briefly cover the inflammatory skin pathologies potentially induced and/or exacerbated by cigarette smoke exposure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is an emerging notion that neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases are linked in several ways, and in this review, we discuss the current status regarding vascular dysregulation in neurodegenerative disease, and conversely, how cerebrovascular diseases are associated with central nervous system (CNS) degeneration and dysfunction.

Contrary to previous studies, there was no apparent detrimental effect on skin wrinkle or pigmentation from traffic pollution, which might be attributed to the higher than general public level of photo-exposure in this population. At the same time, pollution exposure especially the heavy traffic pollution exposure was found to associate with lower stratum corneum trypsin-like enzyme activity (SCTE), reduced catalase activity and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) in tape strips.The evidence suggests that traffic-derived air pollution could deteriorate skin's physical and antioxidant , whereas factors like photo-exposure can be overwhelming against appearance aging. Therefore, in addition to photoprotection, skin  care should be considered for people with high air pollution exposure.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637161>Blood-Brain  Dysfunction in a 3D In Vitro Model of Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h1><p>Harmful materials in the blood are prevented from entering the healthy brain by a highly selective blood-brain  (BBB), and impairment of   has been associated with a variety of neurological diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BBB breakdown has been shown to occur even before cognitive decline and brain pathology. To investigate the role of the cerebral vasculature in AD, a physiologically relevant 3D human neural cell culture microfluidic model is developed having a brain endothelial cell monolayer with a BBB-like phenotype. This model is shown to recapitulate several key aspects of BBB dysfunction observed in AD patients: increased BBB permeability, decreased expression of claudin-1, claudin-5, and VE-cadherin, increased expression of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 and reactive oxygen species, and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides at the vascular endothelium. Thus, it provides a well-controlled platform for investigating BBB  as well as for screening of new drugs that need to pass the BBB to gain access to neural tissues.© 2019 The Authors.

The major histocompatibility complex MHC, named the Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system in humans, represents a vital  structure in the organism by presenting pathogen-derived peptides to T cells as the main initial step of the adaptive immune response. The huge level of polymorphism observed in HLA genes definitely reflects selection, favouring heterozygosity at the individual or population level, in a pathogen-rich environment, although many are located in introns or in exons that do not code for the antigen-biding site of the HLA. Over the past three decades, the extent of allelic diversity at HLA loci has been well characterized using high-resolution HLA-DNA typing and the number of new HLA alleles, produced through next-generation sequencing methods, is even more rapidly increasing. The level of the HLA system polymorphism represents an obstacle to the search of potential compatible donors for patients affected by haematological disease proposed for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Data reported in literature clearly show that antigenic and/or allelic mismatches between related or unrelated donors and patients influences the successful HSCT outcome. However, the recent development of the new transplant strategy based on the choice of haploidentical donors for HSCT is questioning the role of HLA compatibility, since the great HLA disparities present do not worsen the overall clinical outcome. Nowadays, NGS has contributed to define at allelic levels the HLA polymorphism and solve potential ambiguities. However, HLA functions and tissue typing probably need to be further investigated in the next future, to understand the reasons why in haploidentical transplants the presence of a whole mismatch haplotype between donors and recipients, both the survival rate and the incidence of acute GvHD or graft rejection are similar to those reported for unrelated HSCTs.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676317>MicroRNAs in central nervous system diseases: A prospective role in regulating blood-brain  integrity.</a></h1><p>Given the essential role of the blood-brain  (BBB) in the central nervous system (CNS), cumulative investigations have been performed to elucidate how modulation of BBB structural and functional integrity affects the pathogenesis of CNS diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injuries, dementia, and cerebral infection.

In particular, the role of the AlO passivation layer on the MoS channel has been investigated. In the case of nonpassivated MoS TFTs, increase of off-current is observed with NO gas, which has been modeled with the modulation of the effective Schottky  height for holes because of the generation of in-gap states near the valence band as NO gases interact with the MoS channel. The nonpassivated MoS TFTs are simulated based on nonequilibrium Green's  method, and the simulation results do confirm this sensing mechanism. On the other hand, MoS TFTs with the AlO passivation layer have been modeled with a pseudo-double gate structure as NO gases on the capping layer can act like the secondary gate inducing the positive charge state. Our quantum transport simulation shows that the significant threshold voltage shift can be achieved with NO gas, which matches the experimental observation, thereby exhibiting a completely different sensing mechanism of the passivated device from the nonpassivated counterpart. In addition, we also discuss competing device parameters for the passivated MoS TFTs by varying the main and the secondary gate dielectric, suggesting co-optimization to realize high sensitivity and low power consumption simultaneously.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694393>S-Nitrosylation of Plastin-3 Exacerbates Thoracic Aortic Dissection Formation via Endothelial  Dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a fatal disease that leads to aortic rupture and sudden death. However, little is known about the effect and molecular mechanism of S-nitrosylation (SNO) modifications in TAD formation. Approach and Results: SNO levels were higher in aortic tissues from TAD patients than in those from healthy controls, and PLS3 (plastin-3) SNO was identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, tail vein administration of endothelial-specific adeno-associated viruses of mutant PLS3-C566A (denitrosylated form) suppressed the development of TAD in mice, but the wild-type PLS3 (S-nitrosylated form) virus did not. Mechanistically, Ang II (angiotensin II)-induced PLS3 SNO enhanced the association of PLS3 with both plectin and cofilin via an iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase)-dependent pathway in endothelial cells. The formation of PLS3/plectin/cofilin complex promoted cell migration and tube formation but weakened adherens junction formation in Ang II-treated endothelial cells. Interestingly, denitrosylated form of PLS3 partially mitigated Ang II-induced PLS3/plectin/cofilin complex formation and cell junction disruption. Additionally, the inhibition of iNOS attenuated PLS3 SNO and the association of PLS3 with plectin and cofilin, thereby modulating endothelial  .Our data indicate that protein SNO modification in endothelial cells modulates the progression of aortic aneurysm and dissection.

The effect of enteric parasites on the gut  of teleost fish, which represent the most ancient bony vertebrates, is far from being understood. The intestinal myxozoan parasite Enteromyxum leei dwells between gut epithelial cells and causes severe enteritis in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), anorexia, cachexia, growth impairment, reduced marketability and increased mortality.This study aimed to outline the gut failure in this fish-parasite model using a multifaceted approach and to find and validate non-lethal serum markers of gut  dysfunction. Intestinal integrity was studied in parasitized and non-parasitized fish by immunohistochemistry with specific markers for cellular adhesion (E-cadherin) and tight junctions (Tjp1 and Cldn3) and by functional studies of permeability (oral administration of FITC-dextran) and electrophysiology (Ussing chambers). Serum samples from parasitized and non-parasitized fish were analyzed using non-targeted metabolomics and some significantly altered metabolites were selected to be validated using commercial kits.The immunodetection of Tjp1 and Cldn3 was significantly lower in the intestine of parasitized fish, while no strong differences were found in E-cadherin. Parasitized fish showed a significant increase in paracellular uptake measured by FITC-dextran detection in serum. Electrophysiology showed a decrease in transepithelial resistance in infected animals, which showed a diarrheic profile. Serum metabolomics revealed 3702 ions, from which the differential expression of 20 identified compounds significantly separated control from infected groups in multivariate analyses. Of these compounds, serum inosine (decreased) and creatine (increased) were identified as relevant and validated with commercial kits.The results demonstrate the disruption of tight junctions and the loss of gut  , a metabolomic profile of absorption dysfunction and anorexia, which further outline the pathophysiological effects of E. leei.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682042>Stress test of the skin: The cutaneous permeability  treadmill.</a></h1><p>Studying skin   is central to our understanding of many skin disorders.

Tobacco smoke exposure science has created a body of knowledge that demonstrates the conclusive negative impacts on respiratory health; similar knowledge remains to be established for cannabis. To address this unmet need, we performed in vitro functional and transcriptomic experiments with a human airway epithelial cell line (Calu-3) exposed to cannabis smoke, with tobacco smoke as a positive control. Demonstrating the validity of our in vitro model, tobacco smoke induced gene expression profiles that were significantly correlated with gene expression profiles from published tobacco exposure datasets from bronchial brushings and primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. Applying our model to cannabis smoke, we demonstrate that cannabis smoke induced functional and transcriptional responses that overlapped with tobacco smoke. Ontology and pathway analysis revealed that cannabis smoke induced DNA replication and oxidative stress responses. Functionally, cannabis smoke impaired epithelial cell  , antiviral responses, and increased inflammatory mediator production. Our study reveals striking similarities between cannabis and tobacco smoke exposure on impairing  , suppressing antiviral pathways, potentiating of pro-inflammatory mediators, and inducing oncogenic and oxidative stress gene expression signatures. Collectively our data suggest that cannabis smoke exposure is not innocuous and may possess many of the deleterious properties of tobacco smoke, warranting additional studies to support public policy, government regulations, and user practices.© 2019 The Authors.

By contrast, little is known about the emergent multicellular responses to environmental changes, such as antibiotic exposure, which may hold the key to understanding the structure and functions of the most common type of bacterial communities: biofilms. Here, by monitoring all individual cells in Vibrio cholerae biofilms during exposure to antibiotics that are commonly administered for cholera infections, we found that translational inhibitors cause strong effects on cell size and shape, as well as biofilm architectural properties. We identified that single-cell-level responses result from the metabolic consequences of inhibition of protein synthesis and that the community-level responses result from an interplay of matrix composition, matrix dissociation and mechanical interactions between cells. We further observed that the antibiotic-induced changes in biofilm architecture have substantial effects on biofilm population dynamics and community assembly by enabling invasion of biofilms by bacteriophages and intruder cells of different species. These mechanistic causes and ecological consequences of biofilm exposure to antibiotics are an important step towards understanding collective bacterial responses to environmental changes, with implications for the effects of antimicrobial therapy on the ecological succession of biofilm communities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614181>Microglia in developing white matter and perinatal brain injury.</a></h1><p>Perinatal brain injury (PBI) to the developing white matter results in hypomyelination of axons and can cause long-term motor and cognitive deficits e.g. cerebral palsy. There are currently no approved therapies aimed at repairing the white matter following insult, underscoring the need to investigate the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PBI. Microglia have been strongly implicated, but their  and heterogeneity in this context remain poorly understood, posing a  to the development of microglia-targeted therapies for white matter repair following PBI.

Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), including delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, are serious complications that can result in increased 1-year mortality when superimposed on dementia. Importantly, there are no disease-modifying therapeutic options for PND. Our lab developed the "broad spectrum" mixed-lineage kinase 3 inhibitor URMC-099 to inhibit pathological innate immune responses that underlie neuroinflammation-associated cognitive dysfunction. Here, we test the hypothesis that URMC-099 can prevent surgery-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.Orthopedic surgery was performed by fracturing the tibia of the left hindlimb with intramedullary fixation under general anesthesia and analgesia. In a pilot experiment, 9-month-old mice were treated five times with URMC-099 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), spaced 12 h apart, with three doses prior to surgery and two doses following surgery. In this experiment, microgliosis was evaluated using unbiased stereology and blood-brain  (BBB) permeability was assessed using immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunostaining. In follow-up experiments, 3-month-old mice were treated only three times with URMC-099 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), spaced 12 h apart, prior to orthopedic surgery. Two-photon scanning laser microscopy and CLARITY with light-sheet microscopy were used to define surgery-induced changes in microglial dynamics and morphology, respectively. Surgery-induced memory impairment was assessed using the "What-Where-When" and Memory Load Object Discrimination tasks. The acute peripheral immune response to surgery was assessed by cytokine/chemokine profiling and flow cytometry. Finally, long-term fracture healing was assessed in fracture callouses using micro-computerized tomography (microCT) and histomorphometry analyses.Orthopedic surgery induced BBB disruption and microglial activation, but had no effect on microglial process motility. Surgically treated mice exhibited impaired object place and identity discrimination in the "What-Where-When" and Memory Load Object Discrimination tasks. Both URMC-099 dosing paradigms prevented the neuroinflammatory sequelae that accompanied orthopedic surgery. URMC-099 prophylaxis had no effect on the mobilization of the peripheral innate immune response and fracture healing.These findings show that prophylactic URMC-099 treatment is sufficient to prevent surgery-induced microgliosis and cognitive impairment without affecting fracture healing. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence for the advancement of URMC-099 as a therapeutic option for PND.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670003>Injected laquinimod D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate polymeric micelles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized pathologically by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in -mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal  of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, reperfusion injuries such as oedema and haemorrhagic transformation largely limit the use of this potent treatment to a narrow time window. Recently, transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel has emerged as a potential target for vascular protection in stroke management. Non-specificity and side effects are major concerns for current TRPM4 blockers. The present study was undertaken to develop a novel TRPM4 blocker for stroke management. We report the generation of a TRPM4-specific antibody M4P which binds to a region close to the channel pore. M4P could inhibit TRPM4 current and downregulate TRPM4 surface expression, therefore prevent hypoxia-induced cell swelling. In the rat model of 3-h stroke reperfusion, application of M4P at 2 h after occlusion ameliorated reperfusion injury by improving blood-brain  integrity, and enhanced functional recovery. Our results demonstrate that TRPM4 blockade could attenuate reperfusion injury in stroke recanalization. When applied together with reperfusion treatments, TRPM4 blocking antibody has the potential to extend the therapeutic time window for acute ischemic stroke.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619473>Diverse Cardiopulmonary Diseases are Associated with Distinct Xenon MRI Signatures.</a></h1><p>As an increasing number of patients exhibit concomitant cardiac and pulmonary disease, limitations of standard diagnostic criteria are more frequently encountered. Here, we apply noninvasive Xenon MR imaging and spectroscopy to identify patterns of regional gas transfer impairment and hemodynamics that are uniquely associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), left heart failure (LHF), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).Healthy volunteers (n=23) and patients with COPD (n=8), IPF (n=12), LHF (n=6), and PAH (n=10) underwent Xe gas transfer imaging and dynamic spectroscopy. For each patient, 3D maps were generated to depict ventilation,  uptake (Xe dissolved in interstitial tissue), and red blood cell (RBC) transfer (Xe dissolved in RBCs). Dynamic Xe spectroscopy was used to quantify cardiogenic oscillations in the RBC signal amplitude and frequency shift.Compared to healthy volunteers, all patient groups exhibited decreased ventilation and RBC transfer (p≤0.01, p≤0.01). Patients with COPD demonstrated more ventilation and  defects compared to all other groups (p≤0.02, p≤0.02). In contrast, IPF patients demonstrated elevated  uptake compared to all other groups (p≤0.007) and increased RBC amplitude and shift oscillations compared to healthy volunteers (p=0.007, p≤0.01). Patients with COPD and PAH both exhibited decreased RBC amplitude oscillations (p=0.02, p=0.005) compared to healthy volunteers. LHF was distinguishable from PAH by enhanced RBC amplitude oscillations (p=0.01).COPD, IPF, LHF, and PAH each exhibit unique Xe MR imaging and dynamic spectroscopy signatures. These metrics may help with diagnostic challenges in cardiopulmonary disease and increase understanding of regional lung  and hemodynamics at the alveolar-capillary level.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647965>ResTORing   in the skin.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636346>TGFβ1 single-nucleotide polymorphism C-509T alters mucosal cell  in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis.</a></h1><p>Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic Th2 antigen-driven disorder associated with tissue remodeling. Inflammation and remodeling lead to esophageal rigidity, strictures, and dysphagia. TGFβ1 drives esophageal remodeling including epithelial  dysfunction and subepithelial fibrosis. A functional SNP in the TGFβ1 gene that increases its transcription (C-509T) is associated with elevated numbers of esophageal TGFβ1-expressing cells. We utilized esophageal biopsies and fibroblasts from TT-genotype EoE children to understand if TGFβ1 influenced fibroblast and epithelial cell  in vivo. Genotype TT EoE esophageal fibroblasts had higher baseline TGFβ1, collagen1α1, periostin, and MMP2 (p < 0.05) gene expression and distinct contractile properties compared with CC genotype (n = 6 subjects per genotype). In vitro TGFβ1 exposure caused greater induction of target gene expression in genotype CC fibroblasts (p < 0.05). Esophageal biopsies from TT-genotype subjects had significantly less epithelial membrane-bound E-cadherin (p < 0.01) and wider cluster distribution at nanometer resolution. TGFβ1 treatment of stratified primary human esophageal epithelial cells and spheroids disrupted transepithelial resistance (p < 0.001) and E-cadherin localization (p < 0.0001). A TGFβ1-receptor-I inhibitor improved TGFβ1-mediated E-cadherin mislocalization. These data suggest that EoE severity can depend on genotypic differences that increase in vivo exposure to TGFβ1.

Although there has been significant progress in understanding how apoE4 (apolipoprotein E4) drives amyloid pathology, its effects on amyloid-independent pathways, in particular cerebrovascular integrity and , are less clear. Approach and Results: Here, we show that brain pericytes, the mural cells of the capillary walls, differentially modulate endothelial cell phenotype in an apoE isoform-dependent manner. Extracellular matrix protein induction, tube-like structure formation, and  formation were lower with endothelial cells cocultured with pericytes isolated from apoE4-targeted replacement mice compared with those from apoE3-TR mice. Importantly, aged apoE4-targeted replacement mice had decreased extracellular matrix protein expression and increased plasma protein leakages compared with apoE3-TR mice.ApoE4 impairs pericyte-mediated basement membrane formation, potentially contributing to the cerebrovascular effects of apoE4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697827>The primacy of gastrointestinal tract antigen presenting cells in lethal graft-versus-host disease.</a></h1><p>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains a cornerstone of curative therapy for high-risk and/or advanced hematological malignancies but remains limited by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is initiated by the interaction between recipient antigen presenting cells (APC) and donor T-cells, culminating in T-cell differentiation along pathogenic type-1 (Th1/Tc1) and type-17 (Th17/Tc17) paradigms, at the expense of tolerogenic regulatory T-cell (Treg/Tr1) patterns. Type-1 and type-17 T-cells secrete cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF and IFNg) critical to the cytokine storm that amplifies donor APC expansion and their alloantigen presentation. It is become increasingly clear that pathogenic donor T-cell differentiation is initiated by both professional recipient APC (e.g. dendritic cells (DC)) and non-professional APC (e.g. epithelial and mesenchymal), particularly within the GI-tract. In the immediate peri-transplant period, these APC are profoundly modified by PAMP/DAMP signals derived from conditioning and intestinal microbiota. Subsequently donor DC in the GI-tract are activated by DAMP/PAMP signals in the colon that gain access to the lamina propria once the mucosal  mucosa is compromised by GVHD. This results in donor DC expansion and alloantigen presentation in the colon, and their subsequent migration into the mesenteric lymph nodes. Here, new donor T-cells are primed, expanded, differentiated and imprinted with gut-homing integrins permissive of migration into the damaged GI-tract, resulting in the lethal feed-forward cascade of GVHD. These new insights into our understanding of the cellular and molecular factors initiating GVHD, both spatially and temporally, give rise to a number of logical therapeutic targets, focusing on the inhibition of APC  in the GI-tract.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676603>Disrupted blood-retina lysophosphatidylcholine transport impairs photoreceptor health but not visual signal transduction.</a></h1><p>Retinal photoreceptor cells contain the highest concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in our bodies, and it has been long assumed that this is critical for supporting normal vision. Indeed, early studies employing DHA dietary restriction documented reduced light sensitivity by DHA-deprived retinas. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a major route of DHA entry in the retina is the delivery across the blood-retina  by the sodium-dependent lipid transporter, Mfsd2a. This discovery opened a unique opportunity to analyze photoreceptor health and  in DHA-deprived retinas using the  knockout mouse as animal model. Our lipidome analyses of  retinas and outer segment membranes corroborated the previously reported decrease in the fraction of DHA-containing phospholipids and a compensatory increase in phospholipids containing arachidonic acid. We also revealed an increase in the retinal content of monounsaturated fatty acids and a reduction in very long chain fatty acids. These changes could be explained by a combination of reduced DHA supply to the retina and a concomitant upregulation of several fatty acid desaturases controlled by sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factors, which are upregulated in  retinas.  retinas undergo slow progressive degeneration, with ∼30% of photoreceptor cells lost by the age of 6 months. Despite this pathology, the ultrastructure  photoreceptors and their ability to produce light responses were essentially normal. These data demonstrate that, whereas maintaining the LPC route of DHA supply to the retina is essential for long-term photoreceptor survival, it is not important for supporting normal phototransduction.Phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are greatly enriched in the nervous system, with the highest concentration found in the light-sensitive membranes of photoreceptor cells. In this study, we analyzed the consequences of impaired DHA transport across the blood-retina . We have found that, in addition to a predictable reduction in the DHA level, the affected retinas undergo a complex, transcriptionally-driven rebuilding of their membrane lipidome in a pattern preserving the overall saturation/desaturation balance of retinal phospholipids. Remarkably, these changes do not affect the ability of photoreceptors to produce responses to light but are detrimental for the long-term survival of these cells.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672459>Conditioned medium obtained from human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells attenuates focal cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion injury in rats by targeting mTOR pathway.</a></h1><p>Conditioned medium obtained from human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSC-CM) was recently shown to have many antioxidant, antiapoptotic and proangiogenic growth factors. The present study was performed to investigate whether protective effects of hAMSC-CM against focal cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with modulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was created and the animals were divided into three groups including sham, MCAO and MCAO + hAMSC-CM. Drug was administrated immediately after cerebral reperfusion (i.v). The expressions of mTOR, p-mTOR and LC3 were measured using Western blotting and real time-PCR, respectively. Apoptosis and neuronal loss were determined using TUNEL and Nissl staining, respectively. Infarct volume and the blood-brain  (BBB) damage were evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Evans Blue (EB) uptake, respectively. Compared with sham, significant infarct volume, apoptotic cell death, and neuronal loss were found in MCAO rats that reversed by hAMSC-CM (P < 0.05). Likewise, MCAO rats exhibited increased mRNA level of light-chain 3 (LC3) and the LC3II/LC3I ratio as well as decreased expression level of p-mTOR that reversed by hAMSC-CM (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of total mTOR among the experimental groups. In summary, our results demonstrate that hAMSC-CM gives rise to neuroprotection following ischemic stroke by restoring mTOR activity and inhibiting autophagy.Copyright © 2019.

There is growing evidence that in addition to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), aging critically impairs pathways determining cellular resilience to oxidative stressors. In young organisms, the evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway maintains cellular reduction-oxidation homeostasis and promotes a youthful cellular phenotype by regulating the transcription of an array of cytoprotective (antioxidant, pro-survival, anti-inflammatory and macromolecular damage repair) genes. A critical mechanism by which increased ROS production and Nrf2 dysfunction promote vascular aging and exacerbate pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases is induction of cellular senescence, an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Senescent cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, contributing to impairment of angiogenic processes, chronic sterile inflammation, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and  dysfunction. Herein, we review mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses in the aged vasculature and discuss the multifaceted role of Nrf2 dysfunction in the genesis of age-related pathologies affecting the circulatory system, including its role in induction of cellular senescence. Therapeutic strategies that restore Nrf2 signaling and improve vascular resilience in aging are explored to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in older adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660049>Skin   in patients under radiation therapy due to the head and neck cancers - Preliminary study.</a></h1><p>To present the possibility of non-invasive monitoring of the skin after radiotherapy in regards of epidermal  .Radiodermatitis constitutes 95% of all side effects in patients after radiotherapy. The proper assessment of the severity of radiodermatitis can be determined using semi-quantitative clinical scores [Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE)].The most accepted way to analyze the epidermal   is to determine Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL).In prospective study, we included 16 patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy or concomitant chemoradiation in whom we performed non-invasive assessments of the skin  , including TEWL measurement. The final analysis included 6 patients (4 treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, 2 with radical chemoradiation). Clinical assessment of irradiated skin was based on target lesion score (TLS) and CTCAE v 4.0.The mean TLS score in the middle of irradiation was 1.6 points, after last irradiation it was 2.3 points; 3 months later the mean TLS score was: 0. CTCAE v 4.0 criteria: 2 patients had grade 0, 3 patients - grade 1; 1 patient - grade 2. There were statistically significant differences in TEWL related to irradiated skin in the following time intervals: before vs. in the middle; before vs. day after; in the middle vs. day after; in the middle vs. 3 months after; day after vs. 3 months after.The study showed that radiotherapy causes skin  dysfunction in all patients independently of clinical radiodermatitis.

However, there are many disadvantages of these methods, including additional trauma to the spinal cord parenchyma and technical challenges. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility and potential benefits of intravenous transplantation of OECs in a rat hemisection SCI model. OECs derived from olfactory bulb tissue were labeled with quantum dots (QDs), and their biodistribution after intravenous transplantation was tracked using a fluorescence imaging system. Accumulation of the transplanted OECs was observed in the injured spinal cord within 10 min, peaked at seven days after cell transplantation, and decreased gradually thereafter. This time window corresponded to the blood-spinal cord  (BSCB) opening time, which was quantitated with the Evans blue leakage assay. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined neuronal growth (GAP-43), remyelination (MBP), and microglia (Iba-1) reactions at the lesion site. Motor  recovery was also measured using a classic open field test (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score). Compared with the group injected only with QDs, the rats that received OEC transplantation exhibited a prominent reduction in inflammatory responses, increased neurogenesis and remyelination, and significant improvement in motor . We suggest that intravenous injection could also be an effective method for delivering OECs and improving functional outcomes after SCI. Moreover, the time course of BSCB disruption provides a clinically relevant therapeutic window for cell-based intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696318>Structural and functional conservation of non-lumenized lymphatic endothelial cells in the mammalian leptomeninges.</a></h1><p>The vertebrate CNS is surrounded by the meninges, a protective  comprised of the outer dura mater and the inner leptomeninges, which includes the arachnoid and pial layers. While the dura mater contains lymphatic vessels, no conventional lymphatics have been found within the brain or leptomeninges. However, non-lumenized cells called Brain/Mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells or Fluorescent Granule Perithelial cells (muLECs/BLECs/FGPs) that share a developmental program and gene expression with peripheral lymphatic vessels have been described in the meninges of zebrafish. Here we identify a structurally and functionally similar cell type in the mammalian leptomeninges that we name Leptomeningeal Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (LLEC). As in zebrafish, LLECs express multiple lymphatic markers, containing very large, spherical inclusions, and develop independently from the meningeal macrophage lineage. Mouse LLECs also internalize macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid, including Amyloid-β, the toxic driver of Alzheimer's disease progression. Finally, we identify morphologically similar cells co-expressing LLEC markers in human post-mortem leptomeninges. Given that LLECs share molecular, morphological, and functional characteristics with both lymphatics and macrophages, we propose they represent a novel, evolutionary conserved cell type with potential roles in homeostasis and immune organization of the meninges.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645181>Effects of dietary resveratrol supplementation on immunity, antioxidative capacity and intestinal   in weaning piglets.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate effects of dietary supplementation of resveratrol on immunity, antioxidative capacity, intestinal   in weaning piglets.

A central feature of P. gingivalis pathogenicity is dysregulation of innate immunity at the gingival epithelial interface; however, the molecular basis underlying P. gingivalis-dependent abrogation of epithelial   remains unknown. Gingival epithelial cells express junctional adhesion molecule (JAM1), a tight junction-associated protein, and JAM1 homodimers regulate epithelial  . Here we show that Arg-specific or Lys-specific cysteine proteases (gingipains) secreted by P. gingivalis can specifically degrade JAM1 at K134 and R234 in gingival epithelial cells, resulting in permeability of the gingival epithelium to 40 kDa dextran, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and proteoglycan (PGN). A P. gingivalis strain lacking gingipains was impaired in degradation of JAM1. Knockdown of JAM1 in monolayer cells and a three-dimensional multilayered tissue model also increased permeability to LPS, PGN, and gingipains. Inversely, overexpression of JAM1 in epithelial cells prevented penetration by these agents following P. gingivalis infection. Our findings strongly suggest that P. gingivalis gingipains disrupt   of stratified squamous epithelium via degradation of JAM1, allowing bacterial virulence factors to penetrate into subepithelial tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657630>Intestinal epithelial deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 alters expression of inflammatory mediators and  .</a></h1><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are important hormones involved in the regulation of multiple physiologic functions. GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective  . We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term.

In a typical unfolding experiment at constant force, the total extension jumps between two values that correspond to the folded and unfolded states of the molecule. For several biomolecular systems, the committor, which is the probability to fold starting from a given extension, has been used to extract the molecular activation  (a technique known as "committor inversion"). In this work, we study the influence of the force probe, which is much larger than the molecule being measured, on the activation  obtained by committor inversion. We use a two-dimensional framework in which the diffusion coefficient of the molecule and of the pulling device can differ. We systematically study the free energy profile along the total extension obtained from the committor by numerically solving the Onsager equation and using Brownian dynamics simulations. We analyze the dependence of the extracted  on the linker stiffness, molecular  height, and diffusion anisotropy and, thus, establish the range of validity of committor inversion.

Recent work suggests that alterations in blood-brain  (BBB)  and subsequent cortical exposure to coagulation factors may initiate, promote, and/or sustain SE. This suggestion is based on the observation that the serine protease thrombin, which plays a fundamental role in the blood coagulation cascade, increases neural excitability through the activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1). However, it remains unclear whether systemic inhibition of thrombin asserts "anti-epileptic" effects in vivo. We here used the pilocarpine model of SE in adult 3-month-old male mice to address the question whether intraperitoneal injection of the thrombin inhibitor α-NAPAP (0.75 mg/kg) counters SE. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of thrombin ameliorates the behavioral outcome of pilocarpine-induced SE. Similar results are obtained when the thrombin receptor PAR1 is pharmacologically blocked using intraperitoneal injection of SCH79797 (25 μg/kg) prior to SE induction. Consistent with these results, an increase in thrombin immunofluorescence is detected in the hippocampus of pilocarpine-treated animals. Moreover, increased hippocampal serine protease activity is detected 90 min after SE induction, which is not observed in animals treated with α-NAPAP prior to SE induction. Together, these results corroborate and extend recent studies suggesting that novel oral anticoagulants which target thrombin (and PAR1) may assert anti-epileptic effects in vivo. KEY MESSAGES: Systemic thrombin/PAR1-inhibition ameliorates anticoagulants behavioral seizures. Status epilepticus increases thrombin levels in the hippocampus. Increased serine protease activity in the hippocampus after status epileptic. Anti-epileptic potential of clinically used anticoagulants must be evaluated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684130>The Blood-Brain  and Its Intercellular Junctions in Age-Related Brain Disorders.</a></h1><p>With age, our cognitive skills and abilities decline. Maybe starting as an annoyance, this decline can become a major impediment to normal daily life. Recent research shows that the neurodegenerative disorders responsible for age associated cognitive dysfunction are mechanistically linked to the state of the microvasculature in the brain. When the microvasculature does not  properly, ischemia, hypoxia, oxidative stress and related pathologic processes ensue, further damaging vascular and neural . One of the most important and specialized functions of the brain microvasculature is the blood-brain  (BBB), which controls the movement of molecules between blood circulation and the brain parenchyma. In this review, we are focusing on tight junctions (TJs), the multiprotein complexes that play an important role in establishing and maintaining  . After a short introduction of the cell types that modulate   via intercellular communication, we examine how age, age related pathologies and the aging of the immune system affects TJs. Then, we review how the TJs are affected in age associated neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Lastly, we summarize the TJ aspects of Huntington's disease and schizophrenia.  dysfunction appears to be a common denominator in neurological disorders, warranting detailed research into the molecular mechanisms behind it. Learning the commonalities and differences in the pathomechanism of the BBB injury in different neurological disorders will predictably lead to development of new therapeutics that improve our life as we age.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689373>The Gut-Liver Axis in the Control of Energy Metabolism and Food Intake in Animals.</a></h1><p>Recent research has convincingly demonstrated a bidirectional communication axis between the gut and liver that enables the gut microbiota to strongly affect animals' feeding behavior and energy metabolism. As such, the gut-liver axis enables the host to control and shape the gut microbiota and to protect the intestinal . Gut microbiota-host communication is based on several gut-derived compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, methylamines, amino acid-derived metabolites, and microbial-associated molecular patterns, which act as communication signals, and multiple host receptors, which sense the signals, thereby stimulating signaling and metabolic pathways in all key tissues of energy metabolism and food intake regulation. Disturbance in the microbial ecosystem balance, or microbial dysbiosis, causes profound derangements in the regulation of appetite and satiety in the hypothalamic centers of the brain and in key metabolic pathways in peripheral tissues owing to intestinal  disruption and subsequent induction of hepatic and hypothalamic inflammation.

Drosophila is a common insect model, used to study  disruption related to aging, traumatic injury, or environmental stress. Net leak of a non-toxic dye (Brilliant blue FCF) from the gut lumen to the hemolymph is often used to identify  failure under these conditions, but Drosophila are capable of actively transporting structurally-similar compounds. Here, we examined whether cold stress (like other stresses) causes Brilliant blue FCF (BB-FCF) to appear in the hemolymph of flies fed the dye, and if so whether Drosophila are capable of clearing this dye from their body following chilling. Using in situ midgut leak and transport assays as well as Ramsay assays of Malpighian tubule transport, we tested whether these ionoregulatory epithelia can actively transport BB-FCF. In doing so, we found that the Drosophila midgut and Malpighian tubules can mobilize BB-FCF via an active transcellular pathway, suggesting that elevated concentrations of the dye in the hemolymph may occur from increased paracellular permeability, reduced transcellular clearance, or both. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Drosophila are able to actively secrete Brilliant blue FCF, a commonly used marker of  dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining stem cell homeostasis and survival. However, the role of autophagy in mediating ADSC paracrine effects has not been thoroughly elucidated. We examined whether ADSCs participate in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC)  damage in a paracrine manner and illuminated the role of autophagy in regulating ADSC paracrine effects. PMVECs and ADSCs with or without autophagy inhibition were cocultured without intercellular contact, and the microvascular   was assessed after LPS treatment. ADSC paracrine  was evaluated by detecting essential growth factors for endothelial cells. For in vivo experiments, ADSCs with or without autophagy inhibition were transplanted into LPS-induced lung-injury mice, and lung injury was assessed. ADSCs significantly alleviated LPS-induced microvascular  injury. In addition, ADSC paracrine levels of VEGF, FGF, and EGF were induced by LPS treatment, especially in the coculture condition. Inhibiting autophagy weakened the paracrine  and the protective effects of ADSCs on microvascular  injury. Moreover, ADSC transplantation alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, and inhibiting autophagy markedly weakened the therapeutic effect of ADSCs on lung injury. Together, these findings show that ADSC paracrine effects play a vital protective role in LPS-induced pulmonary microvascular  injury. Autophagy is a positive mediating factor in the paracrine process. These results are helpful for illuminating the role and mechanism of ADSC paracrine effects and developing effective therapies in acute lung injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649553>Induction of Secretagogue Independent Gastric Acid Secretion  a Novel Aspirin-Activated Pathway.</a></h1><p>Aspirin has been widely recommended for acute and chronic conditions for over 2,000 years. Either single or repetitive doses are commonly used for analgesic and antipyretic reasons and to prevent heart attacks, stroke, and blood clot formation. Recent studies show that it can also be used chronically to dramatically reduce the risk of a variety of cancers. However, prolonged usage of aspirin can cause severe damage to the mucosal , increasing the risk of ulcer formation and GI-bleeding events. In the present study, we show the effects of acute low-dose aspirin exposure as an active secretagogue-inducing gastric acid secretion. Studies were carried out with isolated gastric glands using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF-AM to assess acid secretion. The non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME (30 μM), or the specific inhibitor ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) was applied while monitoring intracellular pH. The effects of basolateral exposure to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) caused activation of gastric acid secretion  the H, K-ATPase. Our data suggest that aspirin increases nitric oxide (NO) production, which in turn activates acid secretion. Exposure of gastric glands to either the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME, and the highly selective, soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) effectively inhibited aspirin-dependent gastric acid secretion. Aspirin can be considered as a novel secretagogue, in the way that it activates the H, K-ATPase. With increased daily aspirin consumption, our findings have important implications for all individuals consuming aspirin even in low doses and the potential risks for increased acid secretion.Copyright © 2019 Kitay, Ferstl, Link and Geibel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654502>Circular RNA USP1 regulates the permeability of blood-tumour  via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis.</a></h1><p>Recent studies indicate circular RNAs are related to dysregulation of vascular endothelial cell , yet the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we characterized the functional role of circular RNA USP1 (circ-USP1) in the regulation of the blood-tumour  (BTB) permeability and the potential mechanisms. In the current study, the circ-USP1 expressing level was up-regulated in glioma cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (GECs) of the BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of circ-USP1 disrupted the  integrity, increased its permeability as well as reduced tight junction-related protein claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 expressions in GECs. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay indicated that circ-USP1 bound to miR-194-5p and suppressed its activity. MiR-194-5p contributed to circ-USP1 knockdown-induced increase of BTB permeability via targeting and down-regulating transcription factor FLI1. Furthermore, FLI1 regulated the expressions of claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 in GECs through binding to their promoter regions. Single or combined treatment of circ-USP1 and miR-194-5p effectively promoted anti-tumour drug doxorubicin across BTB to induce apoptosis of glioma cells. Overall, this present study identified the crucial regulation of circ-USP1 on BTB permeability via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis-mediated regulation of tight junction proteins, which might facilitate the development of therapeutics against human gliomas.© 2019 The Authors.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and cutaneous hydration and to determine the subjects' evaluation of efficacy, tolerability and future use. A dermatologist examined subjects and measured TEWL and cutaneous hydration on day (D) 0, D7 and D21, when subjects ranked symptoms. Subjects completed a questionnaire on D21.The per-protocol population consisted of 42 subjects receiving treatment for rosacea. Eleven subjects developed adverse events, none of which were considered to be related to the skincare products. Five subjects showed signs or symptoms that were potentially associated with the skincare products that might suggest poor cutaneous tolerability; these were generally mild. TEWL decreased significantly by a mean of 17% on D7 and a mean of 28% on D21 compared with baseline (both P < 0.001). Skin hydration increased significantly by a mean of 5% on D7 (P = 0.008) and a mean of 10% on D21 (P < 0.001) compared with baseline. Subjects reported that the regimen was pleasant (98%) and effective (95%) and that it offered various benefits; 90% of subjects reported that they would like to continue to use the regimen and would buy the products.The skincare regimen improved skin hydration and skin   in subjects receiving medical treatment for rosacea and was well tolerated.Galderma S.A.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623229>Probiotics Prevents Sensitization to Oral Antigen and Subsequent Increases in Intestinal Tight Junction Permeability in Juvenile-Young Adult Rats.</a></h1><p>Increased intestinal permeability is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of food allergy. We explore the mechanism responsible for changes in the morphology and  of the intestinal  using a rat model of food allergy, focusing on the contribution of intestinal microbiota. Juvenile-young adult rats were sensitized with ovalbumin and treated with antibiotics or probiotics (  and  ), respectively. The serum ovalbumin-IgE levels, intestinal permeability, histopathological features, tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins, Th2 cytokines, and gut microbiota in feces were analyzed in each group. Sensitized rats showed an increase in ovalbumin-IgE levels and intestinal permeability with gut mucosal inflammation, whereas rats that received probiotics were only mildly affected. Rats given ovalbumin, but not those given probiotics, showed a reduction in both TJ-related protein expression and localization. Th2 cytokine levels were increased in the sensitized rats, but not in those given probiotics. TJs in rats treated with ovalbumin and antibiotics were disrupted, but those in rats administered probiotics were undamaged. Clostridiaceae were increased in the probiotics groups, especially , relative to the ovalbumin-sensitized group. Gut microbiota appears to play a role in regulating epithelial  , and probiotics may help to prevent food sensitization through the up-regulation of TJ proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635305>AMPK Activation Promotes Tight Junction Assembly in Intestinal Epithelial Caco-2 Cells.</a></h1><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is principally known as a major regulator of cellular energy status, but it has been recently shown to play a key structural role in cell-cell junctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AMPK activation on the reassembly of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. We generated Caco-2 cells invalidated for AMPK α1/α2 (AMPK dKO) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated the effect of the direct AMPK activator 991 on the reassembly of tight junctions following a calcium switch assay. We analyzed the integrity of the epithelial  by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the paracellular permeability, and quantification of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) deposit at plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Here, we demonstrated that AMPK deletion induced a delay in tight junction reassembly and relocalization at the plasma membrane during calcium switch, leading to impairments in the establishment of TEER and paracellular permeability. We also showed that 991-induced AMPK activation accelerated the reassembly and reorganization of tight junctions, improved the development of TEER and paracellular permeability after calcium switch. Thus, our results show that AMPK activation ensures a better recovery of epithelial   following injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624591>Low-protein diets supplemented with casein hydrolysate favor the microbiota and enhance the mucosal humoral immunity in the colon of pigs.</a></h1><p>High-protein diets can increase the colonic health risks. A moderate reduction of dietary crude-protein (CP) level can improve the colonic bacterial community and mucosal immunity of pigs. However, greatly reducing the dietary CP level, even supplemented with all amino acids (AAs), detrimentally affects the colonic health, which may be due to the lack of protein-derived peptides. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of supplementation of casein hydrolysate (peptide source) in low-protein (LP) diets, in comparison with AAs supplementation, on the colonic microbiota, microbial metabolites and mucosal immunity in pigs, aiming to determine whether a supplementation of casein hydrolysate can improve colonic health under very LP level. Twenty-one pigs (initial BW 19.90 ± 1.00 kg, 63 ± 1 days of age) were assigned to three groups and fed with control diet (16% CP), LP diets (13% CP) supplemented with free AAs (LPA) or casein hydrolysate (LPC) for 4 weeks.Compared with control diet, LPA and LPC diet decreased the relative abundance of  and , and LPC diet further decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria. LPC diet also increased the relative abundance of . Both LP diets decreased concentrations of ammonia and cadaverine, and LPC diet also reduced concentrations of putrescine, phenol and indole. Moreover, LPC diet increased total short-chain fatty acid concentration. In comparison with control diet, both LP diets decreased protein expressions of Toll-like receptor-4, nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and LPC diet further decreased protein expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-1 and interferon-γ. LPC diet also increased protein expressions of G-protein coupled receptor-43, interleukin-4, transforming growth factor-β, immunoglobulin A and mucin-4, which are indicators for mucosal defense activity.The results showed that supplementing casein hydrolysate showed beneficial effects on the colonic microbiota and mucosal immunity and   in comparison with supplementing free AAs in LP diets. These findings may provide new framework for future nutritional interventions for colon health in pigs.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616251>The Evolving Concept of the Blood Brain  (BBB): From a Single Static  to a Heterogeneous and Dynamic Relay Center.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) helps maintain a tightly regulated microenvironment for optimal central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and facilitates communications with the peripheral circulation. The brain endothelial cells, lining the brain's vasculature, maintain close interactions with surrounding brain cells, e.g., astrocytes, pericytes and perivascular macrophages. This  facilitates critical intercellular crosstalk, giving rise to the concept of the neurovascular unit (NVU). The steady and appropriate communication between all components of the NVU is essential for normal CNS homeostasis and , and dysregulation of one of its constituents can result in disease. Among the different brain regions, and along the vascular tree, the cellular composition of the NVU varies. Therefore, differential cues from the immediate vascular environment can affect BBB phenotype. To support the fluctuating metabolic and functional needs of the underlying neuropil, a specialized vascular heterogeneity is required. This is achieved by variances in  , expression of transporters, receptors, and adhesion molecules. This mini-review will take you on a journey through evolving concepts surrounding the BBB, the NVU and beyond. Exploring classical experiments leading to new approaches will allow us to understand that the BBB is not merely a static separation between the brain and periphery but a closely regulated and interactive entity. We will discuss shifting paradigms, and ultimately aim to address the importance of BBB endothelial heterogeneity with regard to the  of the BBB within the NVU, and touch on its implications for different neuropathologies.Copyright © 2019 Villabona-Rueda, Erice, Pardo and Stins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665283>Deficient Resident Memory T-Cell and Cd8 T-Cell Response to Commensals in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Aims: The intestinal microbiota is closely associated with resident memory lymphocytes in mucosal tissue. We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell  via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated  immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory  of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve   and prevent B-cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671369>Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor by dioxin directly shifts gut microbiota in zebrafish.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota is of critical importance to host health. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut microbiota. In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, inflammation, epithelial  integrity, oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota was also caused by PCB126 over time as a  of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut microbiota, which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut inflammation was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial  integrity, suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial  can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response. Overall, this study has deciphered, for the first time, the direct regulative effects of AhR activity on gut microbiota. Future research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of AhR action on certain bacterial population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of stress on the risk of IBD onset remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) could initiate or aggravate the onset of colon inflammation in rats which, in turn, would be capable of triggering bowel disease. We found that CUMS exposure increased infiltration of CD-45 positive cells and MPO activity, as well as augmented the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-6 within the colon of these rats. In addition, CUMS treatment changed the composition and diversity of gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal epithelial permeability, indicating the presence of a defect in the intestinal . This CUMS-induced disruption of mucosal  integrity was associated with a reduction in expression of the tight junction protein, occludin 1, and an inhibition in mucosal layer functioning via reductions in goblet cells. Results from bacterial cultures revealed an increased presence of bacterial invasion after CUMS treatment as compared with that observed in controls. Thus, our data indicate that CUMS treatment induces alterations of the fecal microbiome and intestinal  defects, which facilitates bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa and further exacerbates inflammatory reactions within the colon. Accordingly, chronic stress may predispose patients to gastrointestinal infection and increase the risk of inflammation-related gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 Wei, Li, Tang, Sun, Chen, Wang, Liu, Yu, Yu, Liu and Ma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689438>Dual-modality imaging of endothelial progenitor cells transplanted after ischaemic photothrombotic stroke.</a></h1><p>Stroke is a refractory cerebral blood circulation disorder.

Here, we evaluated the biological  of EPCs in treating a mouse model of cerebral ischaemic stroke, using dual-mode bioluminescence and magnetic resonance imaging to trace EPCs in vivo.We constructed a viral vector with a luciferase-enhanced green fluorescent protein (Luc-eGFP) reporter gene for bioluminescence imaging (BLI) detection, and simultaneously synthesized the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, nano-sized superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO), to co-label human umbilical cord blood-derived EPCs (hEPCs).

In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut   to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller.

We aim to investigate the effects of vitamin D on intestinal injury in intestinal epithelial cells and organoids.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce injury in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) and organoids, and the effect of vitamin D was assessed. Cell viability was measured and inflammation cytokines TNFα and IL-8 were quantified. FITC-dextran 4 kDa (FD4) permeability was measured using Transwell while tight junction markers were assessed by immunofluorescence staining in IEC-18 and intestinal organoids. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.IEC-18 viability was decreased by LPS treatment, but was prevented by vitamin D. The upregulation of inflammation was inhibited by vitamin D, which also decreased epithelium permeability. Vitamin D restored tight junction ZO-1 and claudin 2.

In the rat Optimized Peritoneal Adhesion Model (OPAM) the starch-based hemostats 4DryField and Arista were tested for their capability to act in a preventive manner against adhesion formation (applied as a powder that was mixed  with saline solution to form a  gel). Adhesions were scored using the established scoring systems by Lauder and Hoffmann, as well as histopathologically using the score by Zühlke. Animals receiving saline solution were used as controls. As previously published, 4DryField reduced peritoneal adhesions significantly. However, Arista did not lead to a statistically significant reduction of adhesion formation. When comparing 4DryField and Arista applied in the same manner, only 4DryField was significantly effective in preventing peritoneal adhesions. Histopathological evaluations confirmed the results of the macroscopic investigation, leading to the conclusion that starch-based hemostats do not generally have the capability to  as effective adhesion prevention devices.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645839>The mTOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin enhances the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 modulating the activation of human microglial cells.</a></h1><p>Emerging evidence suggests the potential use of rapamycin in treatment of several neurological disorders. The drug readily crosses the blood brain  and may exert direct immunomodulatory effects within the brain. Microglia are the main innate immune cells of the brain, thus critically involved in the initiation and development of inflammatory processes at this level. However, there are conflicting data from rodent studies about the pharmacological effects of rapamycin on microglial inflammatory responses. Considering that rodent microglia display relevant biochemical and pharmacological differences compared to human microglia, in the present study we studied the effects of rapamycin in an experimental model of human microglia, the human microglial clone 3 (HMC3) cell line. Rapamycin was tested in the nM range both under basal conditions and in cells activated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail, consisting in a mixture of interferon-γ and interleukin-1β (II). The drug significantly increased II stimulatory effect on interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression and release in the HMC3 cells, while reducing the production of free oxygen radicals (ROS) both under basal conditions and in cells activated with II. Consistently with its known molecular mechanism of action, rapamycin reduced the extent of activation of the so-called 'mechanistic' target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase and the total amount of intracellular proteins. In contrast to rodent cells, rapamycin did not alter human microglial cell viability nor inhibited cell proliferation. Moreover, rapamycin did not exert any significant effect on the morphology of the HMC3 cells. All together these data suggest that the inhibition of mTORC1 in human microglia by rapamycin results in complex immunomodulatory effects, including a significant increase in the expression and release of the pro-inflammatory IL-6.Copyright © 2019 Cappoli et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683705>Meta-Analysis of  Dependent Transcriptional Networks: A Roadmap for Identifying Novel Conserved Genetic Pathways.</a></h1><p> The   () and vertebrate - () transcription factors are among the most critical genes for epithelial development, maintenance and homeostasis, and are remarkably well conserved from fungi to humans.

To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.2%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain  (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for 5 weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods. Notably, CPZ(±PT)-feeding induced changes in the brain proteome related to the suppression of immune , cellular metabolism, synaptic  and cellular structure/organization, indicating that demyelinating conditions, such as MS, can be initiated in the absence of adaptive immune system involvement.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668565>Kidney transplantation after sleeve gastrectomy in the morbidly obese candidate: results of a 2-year experience.</a></h1><p>Morbid obesity serves as a  to kidney transplantation (KT) due to potential suboptimal posttransplant outcomes. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has previously been shown to improve transplant eligibility through weight loss.We aimed to examine the role LSG plays in improving patient outcomes postrenal transplantation, including possible impact on new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT).University Hospital.A single-center analysis was performed identifying all patients who underwent KT after LSG from 2011 to 2017 (n = 41). Exclusion criteria included type I diabetes and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft  was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.5%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.2% versus 48.5%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21.5 units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%). One patient developed delayed graft  (2.4%, versus institutional rate of 13.3%). After 1 year postKT, there was 1 graft loss (2.4%) and no mortality.This is the largest reported series of KT after planned LSG in morbidly obese patients.

In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity, the specific  of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and . Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO-2 are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular  of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate tight junction and endothelial  integrity, which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657756>Effects of resveratrol on intestinal oxidative status and inflammation in heat-stressed rats.</a></h1><p>Heat stress, experienced by humans and animals under high ambient temperatures, is known to induce oxidative stress and inflammation, which endangers human health as well as animal welfare and production. The gastrointestinal tract is predominantly responsive to heat stress and compromised intestinal functions can contribute to multi-organ injury under heat environment. Resveratrol (RSV) has significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of RSV on intestinal  (digestion and ), oxidative stress and inflammation in heat-stressed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally fed with 100 mg RSV/kg body weight/day prior to daily heat stress (40 °C per day for 1.5 h) exposure for 3 consecutive days. The results showed that RSV reversed the increased serum cortisol level and diamine oxidase activity, the altered jejunal morphology, the decreased jejunal disaccharidase activities, the elevated malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities in the jejunum, as well as the increased jejunal mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and tight junction proteins in heat-stressed rats, to various degrees. In conclusion, RSV could alleviate intestinal injury and dysfunctions by improving oxidative status and suppressing inflammation in heat-stressed rats.Copyright © 2019.

Vascularization is one of the major challenges for recapitulating processes in the developing human brain. Here, we examined the formation of blood vessel-like structures in cerebral organoids induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro. The results indicated that VEGF enhanced differentiation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) without reducing neuronal markers in the embryonic bodies (EBs), which then successfully developed into cerebral organoids with open-circle vascular structures expressing an EC marker, CD31, and a tight junction marker, claudin-5, characteristic of the blood-brain  (BBB). Further treatment with VEGF and Wnt7a promoted the formation of the outer lining consisting of pericyte-like cells, which surrounded the vascular tubes. RNA sequencing revealed that VEGF upregulated genes associated with tube formation, vasculogenesis, and the BBB; it also changed the expression of genes involved in brain embryogenesis, suggesting a role of VEGF in neuronal development. These results indicate that VEGF treatment can be used to generate vessel-like structures with mature BBB characteristics in cerebral organoids in vitro.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We detected the expression of circ-SOD2 in Caco2 and NCM460 cells after being treated with inflammatory factors (LPS, TNF-α, IL1-β). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the cellular location of circ-SOD2 in the UC colorectal mucosal tissues. The circ-SOD2 overexpression vector was constructed and produced and then transfected into Caco2 cells to examine the cells' trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), permeability of FITC-dextran and the alterations of epithelial  related molecules.We found 264 circRNAs (111 increased and 153 decreased) differentially expressed in the inflamed colon mucosa compared with normal colon mucosa using a P-value <0.05 and a >1.5-fold change cutoff. To validate the circRNA microarray results, we selected some circRNAs to perform qRT-PCR based on the following criteria: (1) circRNAs raw data >100 in each sample, (2) fold-change >2, (3) P<0.05. We identified 10 dysregulated circRNA, among them, circ-SOD2 was upregulated with maximum fold-change in the UC inflamed colorectal mucosa tissues.

Recently, histone lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) was identified as a new form of histone acylation that connects starvation-responsive metabolism to epigenetic regulation. Sirtuins are a family of NAD-dependent deacetylases. Through systematic profiling studies, we show that human SIRT3 displays class-selective histone de-β-hydroxybutyrylase activities with preference for H3 K4, K9, K18, K23, K27, and H4K16, but not for H4 K5, K8, K12, which distinguishes it from the Zn-dependent HDACs. Structural studies revealed a hydrogen bond-lined hydrophobic pocket favored for the S-form Kbhb recognition and catalysis. β-backbone but not side chain-mediated interactions around Kbhb dominate sequence motif recognition, explaining the broad site-specificity of SIRT3. The observed class-selectivity of SIRT3 is due to an entropically unfavorable  associated with the glycine-flanking motif that the histone Kbhb resides in. Collectively, we reveal the molecular basis for class-selective histone de-β-hydroxybutyrylation by SIRT3, shedding lights on the  of sirtuins in Kbhb biology through hierarchical deacylation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650038>Differential modulation of transendothelial electrical resistance by TRPV4 agonists is mediated by apoptosis and/or necrosis.</a></h1><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) has been implicated in many disease conditions also in the lung.

SAR405838 is a novel molecularly-targeted agent that is in clinical trials for various solid tumors. Its application for tumors in the brain has not yet been examined, even though the target, the MDM2-p53 interaction, is attractive for tumors that could occur in the brain, including glioblastoma (GBM) and brain metastases. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that SAR405838 is an avid substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp mediated active efflux at the blood-brain  plays a dominant role in limiting SAR405838 brain distribution. Even though the absence of P-gp significantly increases the drug exposure in the brain; the systemic exposure, including absorption and clearance processes, were unaffected by P-gp deletion. Model-based parameters of SAR405838 distribution across the BBB indicate the CLout of the brain was approximately 40-fold greater than the CLin. The free fraction of SAR405838 in plasma and brain were found to be low, and subsequent Kp,uu values were less than unity, even in P-gp/Bcrp knockout mice. These results indicate additional efflux transporters other than P-gp and Bcrp may be limiting distribution of SAR405838 to the brain. Concomitant administration of elacridar significantly increased brain exposure, also without affecting the systemic exposure. This study characterized the brain distributional kinetics of SAR405838, a novel MDM2 inhibitor, to evaluate its potential in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The paper examined the brain distributional kinetics of a novel MDM2-p53 targeted agent, SAR405838, to see its possible application for brain tumors by using in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches. SAR405838 is found to be an exclusive substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which limits its distribution to the brain. Based on the findings in the paper, manipulating of the  of P-gp can significantly increase the brain exposure of SAR405838, which may give an insight on its potential in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain cancer.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638637>Physical mechanism for the synapse behaviour of WTiO-based memristors.</a></h1><p>Tungsten-based memristors possess many advantages as candidates for memristive devices, including gradual changes in resistance states and memorization and learning functions. However, most previous reports mainly focus on studying synaptic learning rules instead of analysing the internal mechanism that results in the exterior learning rules. Herein, we discuss stacked Au/WTiO/Au and Ti/WTiO/Au devices in which the  of the resistance switch is realized by the externally induced local migration of oxygen ions. The consecutively adjustable multilevel resistance of the Au/WTiO/Au device may be due to the variation in the  width and height in high oxygen vacancy concentrations. Additionally, the high and low resistance states of Ti/WTiO/Au devices are considered as a result of the connection and rupture of the conductive filaments at low concentrations of oxygen vacancies.

Inflammatory activation of microglia in the still-developing brain of preterm-born infants is associated with permanent neurological sequelae in 9 million infants every year. Investigating the regulators of microglial activation in the developing brain across models of neuroinflammation-mediated injury (mouse, zebrafish) and primary human and mouse microglia we found using analysis of genes and proteins that a reduction in Wnt/β-catenin signalling is necessary and sufficient to drive a microglial phenotype causing hypomyelination. We validated in a cohort of preterm-born infants that genomic variation in the Wnt pathway is associated with the levels of connectivity found in their brains. Using a Wnt agonist delivered by a blood-brain  penetrant microglia-specific targeting nanocarrier we prevented in our animal model the pro-inflammatory microglial activation, white matter injury and behavioural deficits. Collectively, these data validate that the Wnt pathway regulates microglial activation, is critical in the evolution of an important form of human brain injury and is a viable therapeutic target.© The Author(s) (2019).

The BBB allows the brain to maintain its highly specialized microenvironment by restricting entry of blood-borne substances including molecules that induce myelin damage. Accumulating evidence suggests that interactions between brain endothelial cells and neighboring cells, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), are required for the induction and maintenance of BBB . Here, we compared the ability of OPCs and oligodendrocytes to modulate BBB integrity using co-cultures of rat brain endothelial cells with OPCs or oligodendrocytes. We found that OPCs lowered the brain endothelial permeability to sodium fluorescein, and this enhancement of BBB  was prevented by treatment with AG1296 (a PDGFRα inhibitor). Oligodendrocytes also enhanced BBB integrity. Pharmacological inhibition of PDGFRα did not affect the oligodendrocyte-induced BBB facilitation. These data indicate that oligodendrocytes enhance BBB integrity through pathways other than PDGF-BB/PDGFRα signaling triggered by the brain endothelial cell-derived PDGF-BB. Therefore, our findings suggest that oligodendrocytes constitutively support BBB integrity through soluble factors. Crosstalk between brain endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes could play a facilitatory role in maintaining BBB integrity in the white matter.Copyright © 2019.

However, some patients respond poorly to diuretic management. The PubMed database was searched to identify experimental studies on pulmonary edema in animals, experimental studies on surfactant , including patients with pulmonary edema, and clinical studies reporting  dysfunction and/or injury in patients with acute pulmonary edema. Studies with animal models demonstrate that high capillary pressures can cause  disruption in alveolar capillary units which increases permeability and the transfer of fluid and protein into lung parenchyma. Fluid in alveolar spaces alters surfactant  which increases fluid flux out of capillaries into the lung parenchyma secondary to larger transcapillary hydrostatic gradients. Patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema have increased levels of surfactant protein B in their plasma which reflect  disruption and increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha which reflect acute tissue injury. Increased surfactant protein B plasma levels are associated with abnormal gas exchange in patients with chronic heart failure. Patients with exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction have increased levels of surfactant protein B after short periods of exercise. Pathology studies in patients with chronic heart failure have found increased connective tissue in alveolar capillary units and increased numbers of type II alveolar cells, and these changes represent an adaptive response in these patients. Clinicians need to consider the possibility of  dysfunction and disruption in patients with both acute and chronic pulmonary edema and understand that diuresis may have a limited effect on symptoms in some patients.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

TRPV4 expressed in the skin area contributes to several skin functions as a  to maintain internal body  and a transporter of external stimuli. The skin condition such as skin temperature and osmolarity varies with internal and external changes, and may influence the activity of TRPV4 contributing to skin , thermal sensation, and thermoregulation. However, the combination effect of skin conditions such as temperature and osmolarity on the activity of TRPV4 has not been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of temporal adaptation (5-10 min) to different temperature (25-35 °C) and osmolarity (250-350 mOsm) conditions on the heat response (until 40 °C) of human TRPV4 in cultured cells using Ca imaging. The temperature to activate TRPV4 increased with elevation of the adaptation temperature, and decreased with the adaptation to hypoosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. In addition, the heat response was inhibited with the adaptation to hyperosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. Thus, we demonstrated that the activation temperature of TRPV4 varied with the temporal sensory adaptation to different temperature and osmolarity conditions. These findings may contribute to gaining better understanding of the variation in several TRPV4-mediated skin functions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of ADMSC administration on blood-brain  (BBB) condition, apoptosis, inflammation, and the activity of miR-21-3p/MAT2B axis was assessed. The role of miR-21-3p inhibition in the  of ADMSCs was further validated in in vitro neural cells.ADMSCs administration improved BBB condition, inhibited apoptosis, and suppressed inflammation. It also reduced the abnormally high level of miR-21-3p in MCAO rats. Dual luciferase assays showed that miR-21-3p directly inhibited the MAT2B expression in neural cells, and miR-21-3p inhibition by inhibitor or ADMSC-derived exosomes in neurons attenuated hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced impairments similarly to that of ADMSCs in vivo.This study confirmed the protective effect of ADMSCs against ischemic brain injury exerted by suppressing miR-21-3p level and up-regulating MAT2B level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614502>Ibuprofen-Loaded Hyaluronic Acid Nanofibrous Membranes for Prevention of Postoperative Tendon Adhesion through Reduction of Inflammation.</a></h1><p>A desirable multi-functional nanofibrous membrane (NFM) for prevention of postoperative tendon adhesion should be endowed with abilities to prevent fibroblast attachment and penetration and exert anti-inflammation effects. To meet this need, hyaluronic acid (HA)/ibuprofen (IBU) (HAI) NFMs were prepared by electrospinning, followed by dual ionic crosslinking with FeCl (HAIF NFMs) and covalent crosslinking with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to produce HAIFB NFMs. It is expected that the multi-functional NFMs will act as a physical  to prevent fibroblast penetration, HA will reduce fibroblast attachment and impart a lubrication effect for tendon gliding, while IBU will  as an anti-inflammation drug. For this purpose, we successfully fabricated HAIFB NFMs containing 20% (HAI20FB), 30% (HAI30FB), and 40% (HAI40FB) IBU and characterized their physico-chemical properties by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and mechanical testing. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that all NFMs except HAI40FB possessed excellent effects in preventing fibroblast attachment and penetration while preserving high biocompatibility without influencing cell proliferation. Although showing significant improvement in mechanical properties over other NFMs, the HAI40FB NFM exhibited cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts due to the higher percentage and concentration of IBU released form the membrane. In vivo studies in a rabbit flexor tendon rupture model demonstrated the efficacy of IBU-loaded NFMs (HAI30FB) over Seprafilm and NFMs without IBU (HAFB) in reducing local inflammation and preventing tendon adhesion based on gross observation, histological analyses, and biomechanical functional assays. We concluded that an HAI30FB NFM will act as a multi-functional  membrane to prevent peritendinous adhesion after tendon surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654641>Complement C3 participates in the  and mechanism of traumatic brain injury at simulated high altitude.</a></h1><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to severe mortality and disability, in which secondary injury induced by complement activation plays an important role. TBI tends to be associated with more severe cerebral edema and worse neurological functional recovery if it occurs in high-altitude areas than in low-altitude areas. However, the underlying mechanism of this difference is unknown. Thus, we used cobra venom factor (CVF) to deplete complement C3 in simulated high-altitude areas to explore whether the differences in outcome at different altitudes are related to secondary injury caused by complement C3.The weight-drop model was adopted to induce TBI in rats. Rats were randomly divided into the following groups: sham + saline (sham), high altitude + TBI + saline (HAT), high altitude + TBI + CVF (H-CVF), low altitude + TBI + saline (LAT), and low altitude + TBI + CVF (L-CVF). Brain contusion and edema volumes, brain water content, myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) expression, interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) expression, mortality rate, neurological , and complement component 3 (C3) mRNA expression were measured by techniques such as Evans blue fluorescence, Perls staining, TUNEL staining, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to evaluate correlations between complement activation and secondary injury.The activation of complement after TBI was significantly higher at high altitude than at low altitude. High-altitude TBI resulted in a leakier blood-brain , more severe cerebral edema and higher mortality than low-altitude TBI did. In addition, high-altitude TBI tended to be associated with more MBP degradation, ferric iron deposition, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammatory factor deposition than low-altitude TBI. All of these effects of TBI were partially reversed by inhibiting complement activation using CVF.Our study provided evidence that TBI at high altitude leads to severe edema and high mortality and disability rates. Complement C3 activation is one of the important factors contributing to secondary brain injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Within this host-bacteria interaction,  can modify the host immune reaction and adjust the gene expression, which is associated with periodontitis pathogenesis and developing strategies. Herein, a meta-analysis was made to get the differential gene expression profiles in epithelial cells with or without  infection. The network-based meta-analysis program for gene expression profiling was used. Both the gene ontology analysis and the pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes were conducted. Our results determined that 290 genes were consistently up-regulated in  infected epithelial cells. 229 gene ontology biological process terms of up-regulated genes were discovered, including "negative regulation of apoptotic process" and "positive regulation of cell proliferation/migration/angiogenesis". In addition to the well-known inflammatory signaling pathways, the pathway associated with a transcriptional misregulation in cancer has also been increased. Our findings indicated that  benefited from the survival of epithelial cells, and got its success as a colonizer in oral epithelium. The results also suggested that infection of  might contribute to oral cancer through chronic inflammation. Negative regulation of the apoptotic process and transcriptional misregulation in cancer pathway are important contributors to the cellular  changes during infection development, which have particular relevance to the pathogenesis and progressions of periodontitis, even to the occurrence of oral cancer.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678432>Brain orexin improves intestinal   via the vagal cholinergic pathway.</a></h1><p>Orexins are neuropeptides that are implicated in a number of functions. With regard to the gastrointestinal functions, orexin acts centrally to regulate gastric secretion, gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensation. Little is however known about a role of central orexin in the control of intestinal  . The present study was performed to clarify whether brain orexin plays a role in the control of intestinal permeability. Colonic permeability was estimated in vivo by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue in colonic tissue in rats. Intracisternally administered orexin-A but not orexin-B dose-dependently blocked the increased intestinal permeability by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or corticotropin-releasing factor while intraperitoneally injected orexin-A failed to block it. Atropine or vagotomy abolished the action by central orexin-A. Intravenous injection of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a central vagal stimulant, significantly blocked the LPS-induced increase in intestinal permeability and atropine prevented the action of 2-DG. Intracisternal injection of SB-334687, a selective orexin 1 receptor antagonist, significantly blocked the action of 2-DG-induced improvement of intestinal hyperpermeability. These results suggest that exogenously administered or endogenously released orexin acts centrally to improve the intestinal hyperpermeability by LPS via the vagal cholinergic pathway. The findings also suggest for the first time that the brain could control intestinal permeability. The neuronal rapid protective advantage to the host by improving the intestinal   by the neuropeptide may help us understand the brain-gut interaction in stress sensitive gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome associated with the altered intestinal permeability.Copyright © 2019.

This study evaluated the effects of a chemically characterized OLE in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, describing the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects, with special attention to vascular dysfunction and gut microbiota composition.C57BL/6J mice were distributed in different groups: control, control-treated, obese and obese-treated with OLE (1, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day). Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for 5 weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment, metabolic plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and insulin levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial   were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut microbiota composition were evaluated. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and insulin resistance, and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic microbiota by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the dysbiosis associated to obesity. The extract reversed the endothelial dysfunction observed in the aortic rings of obese mice. FMT from donors HFD-OLE to recipient mice fed an HFD prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.OLE exerts beneficial effects in HFD-induced obesity in mice, which was associated to an improvement in plasma and tissue metabolic profile, inflammatory status, gut microbiota composition and vascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The nature of the vaginal microbiota is well-known; in contrast, the upper reproductive tract remains largely unexplored. Alteration in the uterine microbiota, which is dependent on the nutrients and hormones available to the uterus, is likely to play an important role in uterine-related diseases such as hysteromyoma, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. Uterine mucosa is an important tissue  whose main  is to offer protection against pathogens and other toxic factors, while maintaining a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbes. These characteristics are shared by all the mucosal tissues; however, the uterine mucosa is unique since it changes cyclically during the menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. The immune system, besides its role in the defense process, plays crucial roles in reproduction as it ensures local immune tolerance to fetal/paternal antigens, trophoblast invasion, and vascular remodeling. The human endometrium contains a conspicuous number of immune cells, mainly Natural Killers (NK) cells, which are phenotypically distinct from peripheral cytotoxic NK, cells and macrophages. The endometrium also contains few lymphoid aggregates comprising B cell and CD8 T cells. The number and the phenotype of these cells change during the menstrual cycle. It has become evident in recent years that the immune cell phenotype and  can be influenced by microbiota. Immune cells can sense the presence of microbes through their pattern recognition receptors, setting up host-microbe interaction. The microbiota exerts an appropriately controlled defense mechanism by competing for nutrients and mucosal space with pathogens. It has recently been considered that uterus is a non-sterile compartment since it seems to possess its own microbiota. There has been an increasing interest in characterizing the nature of microbial colonization within the uterus and its apparent impact on fertility and pregnancy. This review will examine the potential relationship between the uterine microbiota and the immune cells present in the local environment.Copyright © 2019 Agostinis, Mangogna, Bossi, Ricci, Kishore and Bulla.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678552>Clematichinenoside AR ameliorated spontaneous colitis in Il-10 mice associated with improving the intestinal   and abnormal immune responses.</a></h1><p>Clematichinenoside AR (AR) is a saponin extracted for traditional Chinese medicine with the effects of improving the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and mediating anti-inflammatory activities. However, its effect on Crohn's disease (CD) is still unknown. We aimed to investigate the impact of AR on CD-like colitis and determine the mechanism underlying its effects.Interleukin-10 gene knockout (Il-10) mice (male, fifteen weeks old) with spontaneous colitis were allocated to the positive control and AR-treated (32 mg/kg AR administered every other day by gavage for 4 weeks) groups. Wild-type (WT) mice (male, fifteen weeks old) composed the negative control group. The effects of AR on intestinal   and structure and T cell responses as well as the potential mechanisms underlying these effects were investigated.AR treatment significantly improved spontaneous colitis in Il-10 mice as demonstrated by reductions in the inflammatory score, disease activity index (DAI) and levels of inflammatory factors. The effects of AR on colitis in Il-10 mice were related to protecting intestinal   and maintaining immune system homeostasis (regulatory T cell (Treg)/T helper 17 (Th17) cell balance).

The expression of GFAP gene is regulated by many transcription factors (TFs), mainly Janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 cascade and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell signaling. GFAP expression is also modulated by protein kinase and other signaling molecules that are elicited by neuronal activity and hormones. Abnormal expression of GFAP proteins occurs in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, brain edema-eliciting diseases, traumatic brain injury, psychiatric disorders and others. GFAP, mainly in α-isoform, is the major component of cytoskeleton and the scaffold of astrocytes, which is essential for the maintenance of astrocytic structure and shape. GFAP also has highly morphological plasticity because of its quick changes in assembling and polymerizing states in response to environmental challenges. This plasticity and its corresponding cellular morphological changes endow astrocytes the functions of physical  between adjacent neurons and stabilizer of extracellular environment. Moreover, GFAP colocalizes and even molecularly associates with many functional molecules. This feature allows GFAP to  as a platform for direct interactions between different molecules. Last, GFAP involves transportation and localization of other functional proteins and thus serves as a protein transport guide in astrocytes. This guiding role of GFAP involves an elastic retraction and extension cytoskeletal network that couples with GFAP reassembling, transporting, and membrane protein recycling machinery. This paper reviews our current understanding of the expression and functions of GFAP as well as their regulation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610615>Hypertonic saline and seawater solutions damage sinonasal epithelial cell air-liquid interface cultures.</a></h1><p>Nasal irrigation (NI) is commonly used to treat several sinonasal diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP); however, the effects of NI on the sinonasal epithelium are not fully known. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of commonly used NI solutions on epithelial mucociliary and  functionality in primary cultured human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs).HNECs from control subjects and patients with CRSwNP were established as air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Differentiated cultures were treated with different NI solutions, including isotonic 0.9% and hypertonic 3.0% saline, isotonic and hypertonic seawater, and Ringer lactate solution. The changes in ciliary beat frequency (CBF), numbers of ciliated and goblet cells, and cytotoxicity were measured. Epithelial  functionality was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electric resistance (TER), paracellular flux, and expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin.Isotonic saline, isotonic seawater, and Ringer lactate solutions did not affect epithelial mucociliary and   in either control or CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures; however, hypertonic saline induced a significant disruption of these cell functions in both cultures. Hypertonic seawater caused a transient decrease of CBF and TER in CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures, in contrast to inducing an obvious mucociliary and  dysfunction and cytotoxicity in control ALI cultures.Although isotonic NI solutions appear to not affect epithelial mucociliary and   in control and CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures, hypertonic saline and seawater solutions damaged sinonasal epithelial cells in ALI cultures.

Impaired intestinal  functions play a major role in chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI)-associated obesity, but the regulation of BCRP during obesity and its role in maintaining the intestinal   during CLGI-associated obesity are unknown. In the present study, using several approaches, including efflux assays, immunoprecipitation/-blotting/-histochemistry, paracellular permeability assay, fluorescence activated cell sorting, cytokine assay, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we report that obese individuals have compromised intestinal BCRP functions and that diet-induced obese mice recapitulate these outcomes. We demonstrate that the compromised BCRP functions during obesity are due to loss of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of BCRP. Our results indicate that JAK3-mediated phosphorylation of BCRP promotes its interactions with membrane-localized β-catenin essential not only for BCRP expression and surface localization, but also for the maintenance of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions. We observed that reduced intestinal JAK3 expression during human obesity or JAK3 knockout in mouse or siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells all result in significant loss of intestinal BCRP expression and compromised colonic drug efflux and  functions. Our results uncover a mechanism of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions and establish a role for BCRP in preventing CLGI-associated obesity both in humans and in mice.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611906>Exosomal Circular RNA as a Biomarker Platform for the Early Diagnosis of Immune-Mediated Demyelinating Disease.</a></h1><p>Exosomes can pass through the blood-brain  and are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The components in exosomes, such as DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids, change greatly and are closely related to disease progression. Circular RNA (circRNA) is stable in structure and has a long half-life in exosomes without degradation. Therefore, circRNA is considered an ideal biomarker and can be used to monitor a variety of central nervous system diseases. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of exosomal circRNA (exo-circRNA) in CSF from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases to identify suitable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. circRNA expression levels in exosomes obtained from five CSF samples from immune-mediated demyelinating disease patients and five paired CSF control samples were analyzed using a hybridization array. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that 5,095 exo-circRNAs were differentially expressed between patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases and paired control samples. Of these exo-circRNAs, 26 were identified as significantly differentially expressed in CSF exosomes from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases (FC ≥1.5 and p ≤ 0.05). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that the upregulation or activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) and RAD23 homolog B, nucleotide excision repair protein (RAD23B) may be associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. Then, a competing endogenous RNA network was constructed and centered on the most upregulated/downregulated exo-circRNAs to predict their  in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. In addition, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction results stating that hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 were validated in an independent cohort of subjects. Canonical correlation analysis results indicated a potential connection between exosomal hsa_circ_0012077 expression level and immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that when hsa_circ_0087862 or hsa_circ_0012077 was employed alone for diagnosing immune-mediated demyelinating diseases, the diagnostic accuracy was 100%. In conclusion, based on this study, exosomal hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 in CSF could be used as suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating disease based on their expression levels. Moreover, the upregulation or activation of PTPRF and RAD23B was potentially associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases.Copyright © 2019 He, Ren, Li, Yang, Wang and Yang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627318>Exploring the Binding Mechanism and Dynamics of EndoMS/NucS to Mismatched dsDNA.</a></h1><p>The well-known mismatch repair (MMR) machinery, MutS/MutL, is absent in numerous  and some . Recent studies have shown that EndoMS/NucS has the ability to cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing a mismatched base pair, which suggests a novel mismatch repair process. However, the recognition mechanism and the binding process of EndoMS/NucS in the MMR pathway remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the binding dynamics of EndoMS/NucS to mismatched dsDNA and its energy as a  of the angle between the two C-terminal domains of EndoMS/NucS, through molecular docking and extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is found that there exists a half-open transition state corresponding to an energy  (at an activation angle of approximately 80 ∘ ) between the open state and the closed state, according to the energy curve. When the angle is larger than the activation angle, the C-terminal domains can move freely and tend to change to the open state (local energy minimum). Otherwise, the C-terminal domains will interact with the mismatched dsDNA directly and converge to the closed state at the global energy minimum. As such, this two-state system enables the exposed N-terminal domains of EndoMS/NucS to recognize mismatched dsDNA during the open state and then stabilize the binding of the C-terminal domains of EndoMS/NucS to the mismatched dsDNA during the closed state. We also investigate how the EndoMS/NucS recognizes and binds to mismatched dsDNA, as well as the effects of K + ions. The results provide insights into the recognition and binding mechanisms of EndoMS/NucS to mismatched dsDNA in the MMR pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696935>Insulin-induced membrane permeability to glucose in human muscles at rest and following exercise.</a></h1><p>Increased insulin action is an important component of the health benefits of exercise, but its regulation is complex and not fully elucidated. Previous studies of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the skeletal muscle membrane found insufficient increases to explain the increases in glucose uptake. By determination of leg glucose uptake and interstitial muscle glucose concentration we calculated insulin-induced muscle membrane permeability to glucose 4 h after one-legged knee-extensor exercise during a submaximal euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. We found during submaximal insulin stimulation that muscle membrane permeability to glucose in humans increases twice as much in previously exercised vs. rested muscle and it outstrips the supply of glucose which then becomes limiting for glucose uptake. This methodology can now be employed to determine muscle membrane permeability to glucose in people with diabetes, who have reduced insulin action, and in principle can also be used to determine membrane permeability to other substrates or metabolites.Increased insulin action is an important component of the health benefits of exercise, but the regulation of insulin action in vivo is complex and not fully elucidated. Increases in skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation are inconsistent and mostly cannot explain the increases in insulin action in humans. Here we used leg glucose uptake (LGU) and interstitial muscle glucose concentration to calculate insulin-induced muscle membrane permeability to glucose, a variable not previously possible to quantify in humans. Muscle membrane permeability to glucose, measured 4 h after one-legged knee-extensor exercise, increased ∼17-fold during a submaximal euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp in rested muscle (R) and ∼36-fold in exercised muscle (EX). Femoral arterial infusion of L-NMMA or ATP decreased and increased, respectively, leg blood flow (LBF) in both legs but did not affect membrane glucose permeability. Decreasing LBF reduced interstitial glucose concentrations to ∼2 mM in the exercised but only to ∼3.5 mM in non-exercised muscle and abrogated the augmented effect of insulin on LGU in the EX leg. Increasing LBF by ATP infusion increased LGU in both legs with uptake higher in the EX leg. We conclude that it is possible to measure functional muscle membrane permeability to glucose in humans and it increases twice as much in exercised vs. rested muscle during submaximal insulin stimulation. We also show that muscle perfusion is an important regulator of muscle glucose uptake when membrane permeability to glucose is high and we show that the capillary wall can be a significant  for glucose transport.

In these devices, modulation on the  width and/or height is usually realized by electric field or magnetic field. Here, a new piezotronic tunneling junction (PTJ) principle, in which the quantum tunneling is controlled/tuned by externally applied mechanical stimuli, is proposed. In these metal/insulator/piezoelectric semiconductor PTJs, such as Pt/Al O /p-GaN, the height and the width of the tunneling barriers can be mechanically modulated via the piezotronic effect. The tunneling current characteristics of PTJs exhibit critical behavior as a  of external mechanical stimuli, which results in high sensitivity (≈5.59 mV MPa ), giant switching (>10 ), and fast response (≈4.38 ms). Moreover, the mechanical controlling of tunneling transport in PTJs with various thickness of Al O is systematically investigated. The high performance observed with these metal/insulator/piezoelectric semiconductor PTJs suggest their great potential in electromechanical technology. This study not only demonstrates dynamic mechanical controlling of quantum tunneling, but also paves a way for adaptive interaction between quantum tunneling and mechanical stimuli, with potential applications in the field of ultrasensitive press sensor, human-machine interface, and artificial intelligence.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present study, male mice were orally exposed 1, 10 or 100 μg/L MC-LR for 90 or 180 days, and pathological approach and the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics were employed with testes. Proteomics revealed that a number of differentially altered proteins may be involved in MC-LR-induced chronic testicular toxicity. The biological process analysis indicated the altered proteins played an important role in biological adhesion, cellular process, response to stimulus or rhythmic process. The cellular component analysis revealed that most of the proteins with altered expression associated with cell part, extracellular region, extracellular region part, membrane, membrane part, organelle or organelle part. The molecular  showed that these proteins were critical in molecular transducer activity. Integrity analyses provide first compelling evidence that MC-LR significantly cause dysfunction of blood-testis  (BTB) through affecting tight junctions and gap junctions. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT eventually contributed to injury result from chronic low-level MC-LR treatment. Identification of proteins in testis responsive to MC-LR provides insights into molecular mechanisms of chronic toxicity of MCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) is an actin-binding protein, expressed as EPLIN-α and EPLIN-β by alternative promoters; however, the isoform-specific functions are not yet understood. Aortic compared to cava vein ECs and shear stress-exposed cultured ECs express increased EPLIN-β levels that stabilize stress fibers. In contrast, EPLIN-α expression is increased in growing and migrating ECs, is targeted to membrane protrusions, and terminates their growth via interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. The data indicate that EPLIN-α controls protrusion dynamics while EPLIN-β has an actin filament stabilizing role, which is consistent with FRAP analyses demonstrating a lower EPLIN-β turnover rate compared to EPLIN-α. Together, EPLIN isoforms differentially control actin dynamics in ECs, essential in shear stress responses, cell migration, and  .Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A relationship between microbial translocation (MT), or their biomarkers (lipopolysaccharide binding protein-1 [LBP-1], soluble cluster of differentiation [sCD]-14), and physical  has been reported in healthy older adults, rats, and invertebrates. However, it is not known whether the existence of comorbidities, or clinical interventions intended to reduce comorbidities through weight loss or exercise, alters this connection. We measured inflammation, MT, and physical  in 288 overweight/obese older patients with cardiometabolic disease and self-reported mobility limitations who were enrolled in a weight loss and lifestyle intervention study. At baseline, inflammatory cytokines and LBP-1 were positively correlated after adjustment for age, gender, and body mass index. A higher LBP-1 was significantly associated with poorer physical functional after covariate adjustment. Further, even when IL-6 levels were included in the models, 400-m walk time (p = 0.003), short physical performance battery (p = 0.07), and IL-8 (p < 0.001) remained positively associated with LBP-1. Lifestyle interventions improved body mass and some functional measures; however, MT and inflammation were unchanged. MT is reliably related to inflammation, and to poorer physical  in older adults with comorbid conditions. Intestinal   did not appear to improve as a result of intervention assignment, suggesting alternative strategies are needed to target this pro-inflammatory pathway in aging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660683>Efficacy of a skin care cream with TRPV1 inhibitor 4-t-butylcyclohexanol in the topical therapy of perioral dermatitis.</a></h1><p>Perioral dermatitis is a clinically distinctive reaction pattern of facial dermatitis, including redness, dryness, burning, pruritus and skin tightness. A gold standard treatment remains unclear.Our study evaluates the clinical value of a skin care cream with the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 inhibitor 4-t-butylcyclohexanol in POD patients over 8 weeks.This open, unblinded 8-week clinical trial included 48 patients. A skin care cream containing 4-t-butylcyclohexanol was applied over a period of 8 weeks. Standardized questionnaires were used at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks, for history documentation, objective and subjective severity scores, and quality of life assessments. Six different skin  parameters were assessed at all timepoints.The perioral dermatitis severity score decreased significantly during the treatment period. This was mirrored by significantly lower patients' subjective numerical rating score and an improved quality of life score. Transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration and skin erythema improved significantly during the treatment period.This transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 inhibitor-based skin care cream improved subjective and objective parameters of perioral dermatitis. Decreased transepidermal water loss values and increased stratum corneum hydration demonstrate a restored skin  . Consequently, the topical inhibition of these receptors is a promising management option for POD.© 2019 The Authors.

We present a resource to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate BBB  in health and dysfunction during disease. Using endothelial cell enrichment and RNA sequencing, we analyzed the gene expression of endothelial cells in mice, comparing brain endothelial cells with peripheral endothelial cells. We also assessed the regulation of CNS endothelial gene expression in models of stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and seizure, each having profound BBB disruption. We found that although each is caused by a distinct trigger, they exhibit strikingly similar endothelial gene expression changes during BBB disruption, comprising a core BBB dysfunction module that shifts the CNS endothelial cells into a peripheral endothelial cell-like state. The identification of a common pathway for BBB dysfunction suggests that targeting therapeutic agents to limit it may be effective across multiple neurological disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684505>Advantages of AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with an Al-composition graded quantum .</a></h1><p>AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV LEDs) still suffer from poor quantum efficiency and low optical power. In this work, we proposed a DUV LED structure that includes five unique AlGaN quantum barriers (QBs); Each QB has a linear-increment of Al composition by 0.03 along the growth direction, unlike those commonly used flat QBs in conventional LEDs. As a result, the electron and hole concentration in the active region was considerably increased, attributing to the success of the electron blocking effect and enhanced hole injection efficiency. Importantly, the optical power was remarkably improved by 65.83% at the injection current of 60 mA. After in-depth device optimization, we found that a relatively thinner graded QB layer could further boost the LED performance because of the increased carrier concentrations and enhanced electron and hole wave  overlap in the QW, triggering a much higher radiative recombination efficiency. Hence, the proposed graded QBs, which have a continuous increment of Al composition along the growth direction, provide us with an effective solution to boost light output power in the pursuit of high-performance DUV emitters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665089>Impact of Docetaxel on blood-brain   and formation of breast cancer brain metastases.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignant tumor in females and the 2nd most common cause of brain metastasis (BM), that are associated with a fatal prognosis. The increasing incidence from 10% up to 40% is due to more effective treatments of extracerebral sites with improved prognosis and increasing use of MRI in diagnostics. A frequently administered, potent chemotherapeutic group of drugs for BC treatment are taxanes usually used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, which, however, have been suspected to be associated with a higher incidence of BM. The aim of our study was to experimentally analyze the impact of the taxane docetaxel (DTX) on brain metastasis formation, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.A monocentric patient cohort was analyzed to determine the association of taxane treatment and BM formation. To identify the specific impact of DTX, a murine brain metastatic model upon intracardial injection of breast cancer cells was conducted. To approach the functional mechanism, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and electron microscopy of mice as well as in-vitro transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tracer permeability assays using brain endothelial cells (EC) were carried out. PCR-based, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses with additional RNA sequencing of murine and human ECs were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by DTX treatment.Taxane treatment was associated with an increased rate of BM formation in the patient cohort and the murine metastatic model. Functional studies did not show unequivocal alterations of blood-brain  properties upon DTX treatment in-vivo, but in-vitro assays revealed a temporary DTX-related  disruption. We found disturbance of tubulin structure and upregulation of tight junction marker claudin-5 in ECs. Furthermore, upregulation of several members of the tubulin family and downregulation of tetraspanin-2 in both, murine and human ECs, was induced.In summary, a higher incidence of BM was associated with prior taxane treatment in both a patient cohort and a murine mouse model. We could identify tubulin family members and tetraspanin-2 as potential contributors for the destabilization of the blood-brain . Further analyses are needed to decipher the exact role of those alterations on tumor metastatic processes in the brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671598>Intermittent Hypoxia-Hyperoxia Training Improves Cognitive  and Decreases Circulating Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects not only the central nervous system, but also peripheral blood cells including neutrophils and platelets, which actively participate in pathogenesis of AD through a vicious cycle between platelets aggregation and production of excessive amyloid beta (Aβ). Platelets adhesion on amyloid plaques also increases the risk of cerebral microcirculation disorders. Moreover, activated platelets release soluble adhesion molecules that cause migration, adhesion/activation of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which may damage blood brain  and destroy brain parenchyma. The present study examined the effects of intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic training (IHHT) on elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor of AD. Twenty-one participants (age 51-74 years) were divided into three groups: Healthy Control ( = 7), MCI+Sham ( = 6), and MCI+IHHT ( = 8). IHHT was carried out five times per week for three weeks (total 15 sessions). Each IHHT session consisted of four cycles of 5-min hypoxia (12% FO) and 3-min hyperoxia (33% FO). Cognitive parameters, Aβ and amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, microRNA 29, and long non-coding RNA in isolated platelets as well as NETs in peripheral blood were investigated. We found an initial decline in cognitive  indices in both MCI+Sham and MCI+IHHT groups and significant correlations between cognitive test scores and the levels of circulating biomarkers of AD. Whereas sham training led to no change in these parameters, IHHT resulted in the improvement in cognitive test scores, along with significant increase in APP ratio and decrease in Aβ expression and NETs formation one day after the end of three-week IHHT. Such effects on Aβ expression and NETs formation remained more pronounced one month after IHHT. In conclusion, our results from this pilot study suggested a potential utility of IHHT as a new non-pharmacological therapy to improve cognitive  in pre-AD patients and slow down the development of AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636638>Heparanase-Dependent Remodeling of Initial Lymphatic Glycocalyx Regulates Tissue-Fluid Drainage During Acute Inflammation .</a></h1><p>The glycocalyx is a dense layer of carbohydrate chains involved in numerous and fundamental biological processes, such as cellular and tissue homeostasis, inflammation and disease development. Composed of membrane-bound glycoproteins, sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycan side-chains, this structure is particularly essential for blood vascular  functions and leukocyte diapedesis. Interestingly, whilst the glycocalyx of blood vascular endothelium has been extensively studied, little is known about the composition and  of this glycan layer present on tissue-associated lymphatic vessels (LVs). Here, we applied confocal microscopy to characterize the composition of endothelial glycocalyx of initial lymphatic capillaries in murine cremaster muscles during homeostatic and inflamed conditions using an anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibody and a panel of lectins recognizing different glycan moieties of the glycocalyx. Our data show the presence of HS, α-D-galactosyl moieties, α2,3-linked sialic acids and, to a lesser extent, N-Acetylglucosamine moieties. A similar expression profile was also observed for LVs of mouse and human skins. Interestingly, inflammation of mouse cremaster tissues or ear skin as induced by TNF-stimulation induced a rapid (within 16 h) remodeling of the LV glycocalyx, as observed by reduced expression of HS and galactosyl moieties, whilst levels of α2,3-linked sialic acids remains unchanged. Furthermore, whilst this response was associated with neutrophil recruitment from the blood circulation and their migration into tissue-associated LVs, specific neutrophil depletion did not impact LV glycocalyx remodeling. Mechanistically, treatment with a non-anticoagulant heparanase inhibitor suppressed LV HS degradation without impacting neutrophil migration into LVs. Interestingly however, inhibition of glycocalyx degradation reduced the capacity of initial LVs to drain interstitial fluid during acute inflammation. Collectively, our data suggest that rapid remodeling of endothelial glycocalyx of tissue-associated LVs supports drainage of fluid and macromolecules but has no role in regulating neutrophil trafficking out of inflamed tissues via initial LVs.Copyright © 2019 Arokiasamy, King, Boulaghrasse, Poston, Nourshargh, Wang and Voisin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615975>Oxidative stress-mediated TXNIP loss causes RPE dysfunction.</a></h1><p>The disruption of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), for example, through oxidative damage, is a common factor underlying age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Aberrant autophagy also contributes to AMD pathology, as autophagy maintains RPE homeostasis to ensure blood-retinal  (BRB) integrity and protect photoreceptors. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) promotes cellular oxidative stress by inhibiting thioredoxin reducing capacity and is in turn inversely regulated by reactive oxygen species levels; however, its role in oxidative stress-induced RPE cell dysfunction and the mechanistic link between TXNIP and autophagy are largely unknown. Here, we observed that TXNIP expression was rapidly downregulated in RPE cells under oxidative stress and that RPE cell proliferation was decreased. TXNIP knockdown demonstrated that the suppression of proliferation resulted from TXNIP depletion-induced autophagic flux, causing increased p53 activation via nuclear localization, which in turn enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and activation. Moreover, TXNIP downregulation further negatively impacted BRB integrity by disrupting RPE cell tight junctions and enhancing cell motility by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, Src kinase. Finally, we also revealed that TXNIP knockdown upregulated HIF-1α, leading to the enhanced secretion of VEGF from RPE cells and the stimulation of angiogenesis in cocultured human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. This suggests that the exposure of RPE cells to sustained oxidative stress may promote choroidal neovascularization, another AMD pathology. Together, these findings reveal three distinct mechanisms by which TXNIP downregulation disrupts RPE cell  and thereby exacerbates AMD pathogenesis. Accordingly, reinforcing or restoring BRB integrity by targeting TXNIP may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing or attenuating photoreceptor damage in AMD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622101>Machine Learning Configuration Interaction for ab Initio Potential Energy Curves.</a></h1><p>The concept of machine learning configuration interaction (MLCI) ( 2018, 14, 5739), where an artificial neural network (ANN) learns on the fly to select important configurations, is further developed so that accurate ab initio potential energy curves can be efficiently calculated. This development includes employing the artificial neural network also as a hash  for the efficient deletion of duplicates on the fly so that the single and double space does not need to be stored and this  to scalability is removed. In addition, configuration state functions are introduced into the approach so that pure spin states are guaranteed, and the transferability of data between geometries is exploited. This improved approach is demonstrated on potential energy curves for the nitrogen molecule, water, and carbon monoxide. The results are compared with full configuration interaction values, when available, and different transfer protocols are investigated. It is shown that, for all of the considered systems, accurate potential energy curves can now be efficiently computed with MLCI. For the potential curves of N and CO, MLCI can achieve lower errors than stochastically selecting configurations while also using substantially less processor hours.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641698>Proteomic analysis of a filaggrin-deficient skin organoid model shows evidence of increased transcriptional-translational activity, keratinocyte-immune crosstalk and disordered axon guidance.</a></h1><p> Atopic eczema is an itchy inflammatory disorder characterised by skin  dysfunction. Loss-of- mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin ( ) are a major risk factor, but the mechanisms by which filaggrin haploinsufficiency leads to atopic inflammation remain incompletely understood. Skin as an organ that can be modelled using primary cells  provides the opportunity for selected genetic effects to be investigated in detail.  Primary human keratinocytes and donor-matched primary fibroblasts from healthy individuals were used to create skin organoid models with and without siRNA-mediated knockdown of . Biological replicate sets of organoids were assessed using histological, functional and biochemical measurements.   knockdown leads to subtle changes in histology and ultrastructure including a reduction in thickness of the stratum corneum and smaller, less numerous keratohyalin granules. Immature organoids showed evidence of  impairment with  knockdown, but the mature organoids showed no difference in transepidermal water loss, water content or dye penetration. There was no difference in epidermal ceramide content. Mass spectrometry proteomic analysis detected >8000 proteins per sample. Gene ontology and pathway analyses identified an increase in transcriptional and translational activity but a reduction in proteins contributing to terminal differentiation, including caspase 14, dermokine, AKT1 and TGF-beta-1. Aspects of innate and adaptive immunity were represented in both the up-regulated and down-regulated protein groups, as was the term 'axon guidance'.       This work provides further evidence for keratinocyte-specific mechanisms contributing to immune and neurological, as well as structural, aspects of skin  dysfunction.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis also known as Lyell's syndrome was first described by Lyell in 1956. Drugs are by far the most common cause of toxic epidermal necrolysis, in which large sheets of skin are lost from the body surface making redundant the   of the skin, with its resultant complications. Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions to various precipitating agents that predominantly involve the skin and mucous membranes. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is rare but considered medical emergencies as they are potentially fatal. Drugs are the most common cause accounting for about 65%-80% of the cases. The most common offending agents are sulfonamides, NSAIDs, butazones and hydrantoins. An immune mechanism is implicated in the pathogenesis, but its nature is still unclear. There is a prodormal phase in which there is burning sensation all over the skin and conjunctivae, along with skin tenderness, fever, malaise and arthralgias. Early sites of cutaneous involvement are the presternal region of the trunk and the face, but also the palms and soles, rapidly spread to their maximum extent, the oral mucosa and conjunctiva being affected. Initial lesions are macular, followed by desquamateion, or may be from atypical targets with purpuriccenters that coalesce, from bullae, then slough. The earlier a causative agent is withdrawn the better is the prognosis. Several treatment modalities given in addition to supportive care are reported in the literature, such as systemicsteroids, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins, ciclosporin, TNF antagonists. Recovery is slow over a period of 14-28 days and relapses are frequent. Mortality is 25%-50% and half the deaths occur due to secondary infection. Here we report a 50-year-old female of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. She was admitted to the dermatology ward with extensive peeling of skin over the trunk and limbs. She had taken alamotrigine for epilepsy. A week after taking the tablets, the patient developed a severe burning sensation all over the body and followed by a polymorphic erythematous dermatitis and widespread peeling of skin. We treated this patient with high dose corticosteroids, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins and etanercept, but eventually she died of secondary aspergillus fumigatus infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642795>Combined ischemic preconditioning and resveratrol improves blood-brain  breakdown via Hippo/YAP/TAZ signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to survey the treatment  of the activation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway by combined ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and resveratrol (RES) before brain ischemia/reperfusion improves blood-brain  (BBB) disruption in rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were pretreated with 20 mg/kg RES and IPC and then subjected to 2 h of ischemia and 22 h of reperfusion. The brain tissues were collected; the cerebral infarct volume was determined; the Evans blue (EB) level, the brain water content (BWC) and apoptosis were assessed; and the expressions of YAP and TAZ were investigated in cerebral tissues. Both IPC and RES preconditioning reduced the cerebral infarct size, improved BBB permeability, lessened apoptosis, and upregulated expressions of YAP and TAZ compared to the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group, while combined IPC and RES significantly enhanced this action.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636388>Hypermethylation of FOXA1 and allelic loss of PTEN drive squamous differentiation and promote heterogeneity in bladder cancer.</a></h1><p>Intratumoral heterogeneity in bladder cancer is a  to accurate molecular sub-classification and treatment efficacy. However, individual cellular and mechanistic contributions to tumor heterogeneity are controversial. We examined potential mechanisms of FOXA1 and PTEN inactivation in bladder cancer and their contribution to tumor heterogeneity. These analyses were complemented with inactivation of FOXA1 and PTEN in intermediate and luminal mouse urothelium. We show inactivation and reduced expression of FOXA1 and PTEN is prevalent in human disease, where PTEN and FOXA1 are downregulated by allelic loss and site-specific DNA hypermethylation, respectively. Conditional inactivation of both Foxa1 and Pten in intermediate/luminal cells in mice results in development of bladder cancer exhibiting squamous features as well as enhanced sensitivity to a bladder-specific carcinogen. In addition, FOXA1 is hypermethylated in basal bladder cancer cell lines, and this is reversed by treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. By integrating human correlative and in vivo studies, we define a critical role for PTEN loss and epigenetic silencing of FOXA1 in heterogeneous human disease and show genetic targeting of luminal/intermediate cells in mice drives squamous differentiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629733>Pharmacological and toxicological in vitro and in vivo effect of higher doses of oxime reactivators.</a></h1><p>The major  of compounds with an oxime moiety attached to a quarternary nitrogen pyridinium ring is to reactivate acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphorus agent (OP). However, other oxime mechanisms (e.g. modulation of cholinergic or glutamatergic receptor) may be involved in the recovery. The main disadvantage of positively charged reactivators is their low ability to penetrate into the brain although crossing the blood brain  could be supported via increasing the dose of administered oxime. Thus, this study presents maximal tolerated doses (MTD) for marketed oximes (TMB-4, MMB-4, LüH-6, HI-6, 2-PAM) and the most promising K-oximes (K027, K048, K203) which can be used in OP therapy in the future. No signs of sarin intoxication were observed in mice treated with 100% MTD of HI-6 in contrast to those treated with atropine and only 5% LD of HI-6. 100% MTD of HI-6 resulted in levels of 500 μM and 12 μM in plasma and brain, respectively. This concentration is by a far margin safe with respect to direct effects on neuronal cell viability and, on the other hand, does not have any effects on central NMDA receptors or central nACh receptors. However, a weak antimuscarinic activity in case of LüH-6 and a weak peripheral antinicotinic action in case of TMB-4 and 2-PAM could be observed at their respective 100% MTD dose. These high doses, represented by MTD, are, however, irrelevant to clinical practice since they led to mild to moderate toxic side effects. Therefore, we conclude that clinically used doses of marketed oxime reactivators have no significant direct pharmacological effect on the tested receptors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The consequences of obesity in the skin are underestimated. In this paper, we review the effect of obesity on the skin, including how increased body mass index affects skin , skin , collagen structure, and wound healing. Obesity also affects sebaceous and sweat glands and causes circulatory and lymphatic changes. Common skin manifestations related to obesity include acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons, keratosis pilaris, striae distensae, cellulite, and plantar hyperkeratosis. Obesity has metabolic effects, such as causing hyperandrogenism and gout, which in turn are associated with cutaneous manifestations. Furthermore, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial and Candida skin infections, as well as onychomycosis, inflammatory skin diseases, and chronic dermatoses like hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, and rosacea. The association between atopic dermatitis and obesity and the increased risk of skin cancer among obese patients is debatable. Obesity is also related to rare skin conditions and to premature hair graying. As physicians, understanding these clinical signs and the underlying systemic disorders will facilitate earlier diagnoses for better treatment and avoidance of sequelae.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Two consecutive measurements of each parameter were obtained at two anatomic locations, the volar forearm, and below the sternum. Randomization was by mode of delivery, with 50 vaginal and 50 cesarean section (C/S) delivered newborns.Skin pH decreased significantly following the first bath at both anatomic sites regardless of whether the bath was performed with water or with cleanser, and there was no significant effect on the change in pH in these two groups. Baseline TEWL and SCH measurements were significantly lower in the sternum area compared to the volar forearm. TEWL decreased significantly after the first bath except when the bath was given with water alone on the sternum site. SCH also decreased significantly after the first bath except in the forearm when the bath was given with water alone.We conclude that skin surface pH, TEWL, and SCH all decrease significantly following the first bath, an indication of the development of skin   in the newly born infant. In addition, bathing with water alone or water and a liquid baby cleanser does not impact the developing skin .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682474>Cdc42 is involved in NC1 peptide-regulated BTB dynamics through actin and microtubule cytoskeletal reorganization.</a></h1><p>Noncollagenous domain 1 (NC1)-peptide is a biologically active peptide derived from the C-terminal region of collagen α3(IV) chain, a structural constituent protein at the basement membrane in the rat testis, likely  proteolytic cleavage of matrix metalloproteinase 9. Studies have shown that this NC1 peptide regulates testis  by inducing Sertoli cell blood-testis  (BTB) remodeling and is also capable of inducing elongate spermatid exfoliation through its disruptive effects on the organization of actin- and microtubule (MT)-based cytoskeletons at these cell adhesion sites. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. NC1 peptide was found to exert its biologic effects through an activation of small GTPase cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42) because cooverexpression of the dominant negative mutant of Cdc42 [namely, Cdc42-T17N ( a single mutation of amino acid residue 17 from the N terminus from Thr to Asn by site-directed mutagenesis, making it constitutively inactive)] and NC1 peptide was able to block the NC1 peptide-induced Sertoli cell tight junction-permeability  disruption. Their cooverexpression also blocked the NC1 peptide-induced misdistribution of BTB-associated proteins at the cell-cell interface and also disruptive cytoskeletal organization of F-actin and MTs through changes in spatial expression of the corresponding actin and MT regulatory proteins. Interestingly, NC1 peptide was also found to induce an up-regulation of phosphorylated (p)-ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) (namely, p-rpS6-S235/S236) and a concomitant down-regulation of p-Akt1/2 (namely, p-Akt1-S473 and p-Akt2-S474), but these changes could not be blocked by overexpression of Cdc42-T17N. More importantly, NC1 peptide-induced Cdc42 activation was effectively blocked by treatment of Sertoli cell epithelium with a p-Akt1/2 activator SC79, which is also capable of blocking NC1 peptide-induced down-regulation of p-Akt1-S473 and p-Akt2/S474, but not p-rpS6-S235/S236 up-regulation. In summary, these findings illustrate that Cdc42 is working downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/rpS6/Akt1/2 signaling pathway to support NC1 peptide-mediated effects on Sertoli cell  in the testis using the rat as an animal model.-Su, W., Cheng, C. Y.

Current understanding of drug permeability at placental and blood-brain barriers during development is poor. In adults, ABC transporters limit many drugs from entering the brain; however, little is known about their  during development. : The transfer of clinically relevant doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen), digoxin and cimetidine into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was estimated using radiolabelled drugs in Sprague Dawley rats at three developmental stages: E19, P4 and adult. Drugs were applied intraperitoneally either acutely or following chronic exposure (for five days). Entry into brain, CSF and transfer across the placenta was measured and compared to three markers (L-glucose, sucrose, glycerol) that cross barriers by "passive diffusion". The expression of ABC transporters in the brain, choroid plexus and placenta was estimated using RT-qPCR. : All three drugs entered the developing brain and CSF in higher amounts than the adult brain and CSF. Comparisons with "passive" permeability markers suggested that this might be due to age-related differences in the functional capacity of ABC-efflux mechanisms. In adult animals, chronic treatment reduced digoxin (12% to 5%, p<0.01) and paracetamol (30% to 21%, p<0.05) entry compared to acute treatment, with the decrease in digoxin entry correlating with up-regulation of efflux transporter  (PGP). In fetal and newborn animals, no gene up-regulation or transfer decreases were observed. Instead, chronic paracetamol treatment resulted in increased transfer into the fetal brain (66% to 104%, p<0.001). : These results suggest that the developing brain may be more at risk from acute drug exposure than the adult brain due to reduced efflux capacity and at greater risk from chronic treatment due to a lack of efflux mechanism regulatory capacity.Copyright: © 2019 Koehn L et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660977>NDP-MSH binding melanocortin-1 receptor ameliorates neuroinflammation and BBB disruption through CREB/Nr4a1/NF-κB pathway after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation and blood-brain  (BBB) disruption are two vital mechanisms of secondary brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Recently, melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) activation by Nle4-D-Phe7-α-MSH (NDP-MSH) was shown to play a neuroprotective role in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. This study aimed to investigate whether NDP-MSH could alleviate neuroinflammation and BBB disruption after experimental ICH, as well as the potential mechanisms of its neuroprotective roles.Two hundred and eighteen male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to autologous blood-injection ICH model. NDP-MSH, an agonist of Mc1r, was administered intraperitoneally injected at 1 h after ICH insult. To further explore the related protective mechanisms, Mc1r small interfering RNA (Mc1r siRNA) and nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (Nr4a1) siRNA were administered via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection before ICH induction. Neurological test, BBB permeability, brain water content, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot analysis were implemented.The Expression of Mc1r was significantly increased after ICH. Mc1r was mainly expressed in microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells following ICH. Treatment with NDP-MSH remarkably improved neurological  and reduced BBB disruption, brain water content, and the number of microglia in the peri-hematoma tissue after ICH. Meanwhile, the administration of NDP-MSH significantly reduced the expression of p-NF-κB p65, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP-9 and increased the expression of p-CREB, Nr4a1, ZO-1, occludin, and Lama5. Inversely, the knockdown of Mc1r or Nr4a1 abolished the neuroprotective effects of NDP-MSH.Taken together, NDP-MSH binding Mc1r attenuated neuroinflammation and BBB disruption and improved neurological deficits, at least in part through CREB/Nr4a1/NF-κB pathway after ICH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618600>Contributions of Aging to Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.</a></h1><p>Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is characterized by changes in the pial and parenchymal microcirculations. SVD produces reductions in cerebral blood flow and impaired blood-brain  , which are leading contributors to age-related reductions in brain health. End-organ effects are diverse, resulting in both cognitive and noncognitive deficits. Underlying phenotypes and mechanisms are multifactorial, with no specific treatments at this time. Despite consequences that are already considerable, the impact of SVD is predicted to increase substantially with the growing aging population. In the face of this health challenge, the basic biology, pathogenesis, and determinants of SVD are poorly defined. This review summarizes recent progress and concepts in this area, highlighting key findings and some major unanswered questions. We focus on phenotypes and mechanisms that underlie microvascular aging, the greatest risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and its subsequent effects.

However, in the olfactory bulb (OB), the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) is almost devoid of astrocytes, raising the question which glial cells are part of the BBB. We used mice expressing EGFP in astrocytes and tdTomato in olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), a specialized type of glial cells in the ONL, to unequivocally identify both glial cell types and investigate their contribution to the BBB in the olfactory bulb. OECs were located exclusively in the ONL, while somata of astrocytes were located in deeper layers and extended processes in the inner sublamina of the ONL. These processes surrounded blood vessels and contained aquaporin-4, an astrocytic protein enriched at the BBB. In the outer sublamina of the ONL, in contrast, blood vessels were surrounded by aquaporin-4-negative processes of OECs. Transcardial perfusion of blood vessels with lanthanum and subsequent visualization by electron microscopy showed that blood vessels enwrapped by OECs possessed intact tight junctions. In acute olfactory bulb preparations, injection of fluorescent glucose 6-NBDG into blood vessels resulted in labeling of OECs, indicating glucose transport from the perivascular space into OECs. In addition, Ca transients in OECs in the outer sublamina evoked vasoconstriction, whereas Ca signaling in OECs of the inner sublamina had no effect on adjacent blood vessels. Our results demonstrate that the BBB in the inner sublamina of the ONL contains astrocytes, while in the outer ONL OECs are part of the BBB.© 2019 The Authors.

Renovascular hypertension represents the most common cause of secondary hypertension, and its progress is associated with overactivation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), causing systemic and local changes. Aliskiren is a renin-inhibiting drug that optimizes RAAS suppression. In this sense, the objective of the present study was to analyze the morphophysiology of the left kidney in Wistar rats with renovascular hypertension after treatment with Aliskiren. Parameters such as systolic blood pressure, urinary creatinine and protein excretion, renal cortex structure and ultrastructure, fibrosis and tissue inflammation were analyzed. Our results showed that the hypertensive animals treated with Aliskiren presented a reestablishment of blood pressure, expression of renin, and renal , as well as a remodeling of morphological alterations through the reduction of fibrosis. The treatment regulated the laminin expression and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, restoring the integrity of the glomerular filtration . Therefore, our findings suggest that Aliskiren has a renoprotective effect acting on the improvement of the morphology,  and pathology of the renal cortex of animals with renovascular hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628933>Glutathione alleviates acute intracerebral hemorrhage injury via reversing mitochondrial dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Glutathione (GSH) has been studied for its neuroprotection value in several diseases, but the effect of GSH on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unclear. In this study, we examined the protective effects of GSH in an experimentally induced ICH model and investigated the relative mechanisms. Adult male C57BL/6j mice were randomized into Sham, ICH and GSH treatment groups. GSH was injected with the dose of 50, 100 or 200 mg / kg once per day for 3 days, starting immediately after operation. The results revealed a GSH-mediated improvement of neurological deficits score (NDS), motor and sensory functions impairment in a dose-dependent manner three days post ICH (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 12; ICH, n=9; GSH 50, n=10; GSH 100, n=10; GSH 200, n=11) in addition to significantly reduced mortality rate (p =0.2632, GSH 200 vs ICH. n = 12 per group) and damage volume (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. n = 12 per group). GSH treatment also attenuated injury measured by decreased brain edema (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 10; ICH, n=10; GSH 200, n=12), blood-brain  disruption (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 10; ICH, n=10; GSH 200, n=12), and histopathological damage (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8) 72 h after ICH. In addition, GSH treatment also decreased cell apoptosis (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8) and resulted in up-regulated protein expression of complex I (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8), which was consistent with an overall up-regulation of complex I  in mitochondria using Oxygraph-2K high resolution respirometry (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 4; ICH, n= 5; GSH 200, n=6). In conclusion, GSH effectively improved the prognosis of ICH mice by attenuating neurological impairment, decreasing neural damage, and inhibiting apoptosis. The neuroprotection by GSH resulted from the up-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative respiration . The results of our study suggest that GSH can be a potential therapeutic agent for ICH.Copyright © 2019.

The technique allows the study of capillary waves with amplitudes in the range of 10-9 m, excited at the surface of the bubble by an electric field of intensity in the order of 10 V/cm. By studying the resonant modes of the bubble (radial and shape modes) it is possible to assess variations of interfacial properties and, in particular, of the net surface charge as a  of bulk protein concentration. Sensing the interfacial charge, the technique enables us to follow the absorption process in condition of low concentrations, not easily assessable by other methods. We focus on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Lysozyme, as representatives of typical globular proteins. To provide a comprehensive insight into the novelty of the technique we also investigated the equilibrium adsorption of SDS ionic surfactant for bulk concentrations hundreds times lower than the CMC. Results unveil how the absorption of charged molecules affects the amplitudes of the bubble resonant modes even before affecting the frequencies in a transition-like fashion. Different adsorption models are proposed and developed. They are validated against the experimental findings by comparing frequency and amplitude data. By measuring the charging rate of the bubble interface, we have followed the absorption kinetics of BSA and Lysozyme recognizing a slow, energy  limited, phenomena, with characteristic times in agreement with data in the literature. The evaluation of the surface excess concentration () of BSA and SDS at equilibrium is obtained by monitoring charge uptake. At the investigated low bulk concentrations, reliable comparisons with literature data from equilibrium surface tension isotherm models, are reported.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658783>Phenolic Profile and Antioxidant Activity of the Edible Tree Peony Flower and Underlying Mechanisms of Preventive Effect on HO-Induced Oxidative Damage in Caco-2 Cells.</a></h1><p>The entire phenolic profiles and antioxidant activities of different organs of the edible tree peony flowers ( (FDB)) were analyzed. HPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS/MS) analyses of individual phenolic compounds revealed that the petal and stamen contained higher levels of flavonoid glycosides than other organs ( < 0.05). Kaempferol-3,7-di--glucoside was the dominant flavonoid in these two organs, however, the calyx and ovary contained higher contents of gallic acid derivatives than other organs ( < 0.05). Hexa--galloyl-glucose was the dominant species in the calyx and ovary. At the same concentration of total phenolic extract (TPE), the stamen had the highest protection effect on Caco-2 cell oxidative damage induced by HO. The antioxidant effect was attributed to potent antioxidant capability; restored redox state due to the increased expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); and improved   of Caco-2 cell owing to increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), CLDN3 (Claudin 3), and occludin mRNA expression.

Patients with severe cerebrovascular stenosis often undergo cerebrovascular bypass surgery. However, the sharply increased fluid shear stress (FSS) after cerebrovascular bypass disrupts the physiological  of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) at the lesion site, damaging BBB and inducing intracerebral hemorrhage eventually.

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and  of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1  leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut   by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum pesticide that is widely used in agricultural production. In this manuscript, the effects of diets containing glyphosate on intestinal morphology, intestinal immune factors, intestinal antioxidant capacity and the mRNA expression associated with the Nrf2 signaling pathway were investigated in weaned piglets. Twenty-eight healthy female hybrid weaned piglets (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) were randomly selected with an average weight of 12.24 ± 0.61 kg. Weaned piglets were randomly assigned into 4 treatment groups and fed a basal diet supplemented with 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg glyphosate for a 35-day feeding trial. We found that glyphosate had no effect on intestinal morphology. In the duodenum, glyphosate increased the activities of CAT and SOD (linear, P < 0.05) and increased the levels of MDA (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05). In the duodenum, glyphosate remarkably increased the relative mRNA expression levels of Nrf2 (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) and NQO1 (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) and reduced the relative mRNA expression levels of GPx1, HO-1 and GCLM (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05). In the jejunum, glyphosate remarkably increased the relative mRNA expression levels of Nrf2 (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) and decreased the relative mRNA expression levels of GCLM (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05). Glyphosate increased the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 in the duodenum (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) and the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 in the jejunum (linear, P < 0.05). Glyphosate increased the mRNA expression of NF-κB in the jejunum (linear, P = 0.05). Additionally, the results demonstrated that glyphosate linearly decreased the ZO-1 mRNA expression levels in the jejunum and the mRNA expression of claudin-1 in the duodenum (P < 0.05). In the duodenum, glyphosate increased the protein expression levels of Nrf2 (linear, P = 0.025). Overall, glyphosate exposure may result in oxidative stress in the intestines of piglets, which can be alleviated by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and self-detoxification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal  (oBRB) and supplies glucose, oxygen and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual . Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an  system.A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF - 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal , cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors.  < 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis.Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (HO↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (5 mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis.The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE  and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Yumnamcha, Devi and Singh.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636846>Alleviation of Ultraviolet B-Induced Photoaging by 7-MEGA 500 in Hairless Mouse Skin.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 7-MEGA™ 500 on the improvement of skin aging in an UVB-induced photo-aging model of hairless mice.

It is hypothesized that in addition to decreased cardiac output, increases in central-and consequentially, cerebral-venous pressure (backward failure) also contribute significantly to the genesis of cognitive impairment. To test this hypothesis and elucidate the specific pathogenic role of venous congestion in the brain, we have established a novel model of increased cerebral venous pressure: mice with jugular vein ligation (JVL). To test the hypothesis that increased venous pressure in the brain contributes to the development of cognitive deficits by causing blood-brain  disruption, dysregulation of blood flow, and/or promoting neuroinflammation, in C57BL/6 mice, the internal and external jugular veins were ligated. Cognitive  (radial arm water maze), gait  (CatWalk), and motor coordination (rotarod) were tested post-JVL. Neurovascular coupling responses were assessed by measuring changes in cerebral blood flow in the whisker barrel cortex in response to contralateral whisker stimulation by laser speckle contrast imaging through a closed cranial window. Blood-brain  integrity (IgG extravasation) and microglia activation (Iba1 staining) were assessed in brain slices by immunohistochemistry. Neuroinflammation-related gene expression profile was assessed by a targeted qPCR array. After jugular vein ligation, mice exhibited impaired spatial learning and memory, altered motor coordination, and impaired gait , mimicking important aspects of altered brain  observed in human heart failure patients. JVL did not alter neurovascular coupling responses. In the brains of mice with JVL, significant extravasation of IgG was detected, indicating blood-brain  disruption, which was associated with histological markers of neuroinflammation (increased presence of activated microglia) and a pro-inflammatory shift in gene expression profile. Thus, cerebral venous congestion per se can cause blood-brain  disruption and neuroinflammation, which likely contribute to the genesis of cognitive impairment. These findings have relevance to the pathogenesis of cognitive decline associated with heart failure as well as increased cerebal venous pressure due to increased jugular venous reflux in elderly human patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661303>Cytosolic phospholipase A2 is a key regulator of blood-brain   in epilepsy.</a></h1><p>Blood-brain  dysfunction in epilepsy contributes to seizures and resistance to antiseizure drugs. Reports show that seizures increase brain glutamate levels, leading to  dysfunction. One component of  dysfunction is overexpression of the drug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Based on our previous studies, we hypothesized that glutamate released during seizures activates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), resulting in P-gp and BCRP overexpression. We exposed isolated rat brain capillaries to glutamate  and used an - approach of isolating brain capillaries from rats after status epilepticus (SE) and in chronic epileptic (CE) rats. Glutamate increased cPLA2, P-gp, and BCRP protein and activity levels in isolated brain capillaries. We confirmed the role of cPLA2 in the signaling pathway in brain capillaries from male and female mice lacking cPLA2. We also demonstrated, , that cPLA2 inhibition prevents overexpression of P-gp and BCRP at the blood-brain  in rats after status epilepticus and in CE rats.

The failure to demonstrate drug efficacy has been the major reason that drug development does not progress beyond phase II and III clinical trials. The combination of two-dimensional (2D) cellular in vitro and animal models has been the gold standard for basic science research and preclinical drug development studies. However, most findings from these systems fail to translate into human trials because these models only partly recapitulate human  and pathology. The lack of a dynamic three-dimensional microenvironment in 2D cellular models reduces the physiological relevance, and for these reasons, 3D and microfluidic model systems are now being developed as more native-like biological assay platforms. 3D cellular in vitro systems, microfluidics, self-organized organoids, and 3D biofabrication are the most promising technologies to mimic human  because they provide mechanical cues and a 3D microenvironment to the multicellular components. With the advent of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, the 3D dynamic in vitro systems further enable extensive access to human-like tissue models. As increasingly complex 3D cellular systems are produced, the use of current visualization technologies is limited due to the thickness and opaqueness of 3D tissues. Tissue-clearing techniques improve light penetration deep into tissues by matching refractive indices among the 3D components. 3D segmentation enables quantitative measurements based on 3D tissue images. Using these state-of-the-art technologies, high-throughput screening (HTS) of thousands of drug compounds in 3D tissue models is slowly becoming a reality. In order to screen thousands of compounds, machine learning will need to be applied to help maximize outcomes from the use of cheminformatics and phenotypic approaches to drug screening.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of epithelial EP4 in maintaining colonic homeostasis by characterizing the intestinal epithelial cell-specific EP4 knockout (EP4 cKO) mice. Mice harboring the epithelial EP4 deletion showed significantly lower colonic crypt depth and lower numbers of secretory cell lineages, as well as impaired epithelial cells in the colon. Interestingly, EP4-deficient colon epithelia showed a higher number of apoptotic cells. Consistent with the defect in mucosal   of colonic epithelia and secretory cell lineages, EP4 cKO colon stroma showed enhanced immune cell infiltration, which was accompanied by increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, EP4-deficient colons were susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Our study is the first to demonstrate that epithelial EP4 loss resulted in potential "inflammatory" status under physiological conditions. These findings provided insights into the crucial role of epithelial PGE/EP4 axis in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644356>Endothelial Response to Pathophysiological Stress.</a></h1><p>Located in the innermost layer of the vasculature and directly interacting with blood flow, endothelium integrates various biochemical and biomechanical signals to maintain   with selective permeability, vascular tone, blood fluidity, and vascular formation. Endothelial cells respond to laminar and disturbed flow by structural and functional adaption, which involves reprogramming gene expression, cell proliferation and migration, senescence, autophagy and cell death, as well as synthesizing signal molecules (nitric oxide and prostanoids, etc) that act in manners of autocrine, paracrine, or juxtacrine. Inflammation occurs after infection or tissue injury. Dysregulated inflammatory response participates in pathogenesis of many diseases. Endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli from the circulation or the microenvironment exhibit impaired vascular tone, increased permeability, elevated procoagulant activity, and dysregulated vascular formation, collectively contributing to the development of vascular diseases. Understanding the endothelial response to pathophysiological stress of hemodynamics and inflammation provides mechanistic insights into cardiovascular diseases, as well as therapeutic opportunities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634869>The Effect of Lauric Acid on Pathogens Colonizing the Burn Wound: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Some of the most serious complications of burns include septic infections. Instead of fulfilling the  of a protective , tissues damaged by high temperature create a niche that serves as an environment and source of nourishment for pathogens. An accepted practice is to use antibiotics to inhibit development of pathogens. Taking into consideration the characteristics of the burn wound and increasing antibiotic resistance, the search for new substances that have both antimicrobial and regenerative effects seems justified. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of lauric acid on bacteria-colonizing tissue samples taken during surgical treatment of burns.Lauric acid was combined with 5 different ointment bases: Anhydrous Eucerin DAB, Anhydrous Eucerin II, Hydrophilic Vaseline, White Vaseline, and Lekobaza. The content of lauric acid in the ointment bases was 10% to 20% w/w. The preparations were applied onto samples of burnt skin collected during surgery. The samples were subsequently subjected to a microbiological test with the use of model strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.With one exception (White Vaseline), lauric acid showed a more pronounced effect on bacteria in 20% w/w concentration. In a 10% lauric acid concentration, no effect on bacteria was observed on the Hydrophilic Vaseline ointment base. Lauric acid had the strongest inhibiting effect on microbial growth of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Satisfactory zones of inhibition were also observed in the case of Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed only when pure lauric acid was used.Due to its aseptic and regenerative effect on chemically damaged tissues, lauric acid can be a promising modifier of the burn healing process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686002>Anionic nanoparticles enable the oral delivery of proteins by enhancing intestinal permeability.</a></h1><p>The oral delivery of bioactive peptides and proteins is prevented by the intestinal epithelial , in which intercellular tight junction complexes block the uptake of macromolecules. Here we show that anionic nanoparticles induce tight junction relaxation, increasing intestinal permeability and enabling the oral delivery of proteins. This permeation-enhancing effect is a  of nanoparticle size and charge, with smaller (≤ 200 nm) and more negative particles (such as silica) conferring enhanced permeability. In healthy mice, silica nanoparticles enabled the oral delivery of insulin and exenatide, with 10 U kg orally delivered insulin sustaining hypoglycaemia for a few hours longer than a 1 U kg dose of subcutaneously injected insulin. In healthy, hyperglycaemic and diabetic mice, the oral delivery of 10 U kg insulin led to a dose-adjusted bioactivity of, respectively, 35%, 29% and 23% that of the subcutaneous injection of 1 U kg insulin. The permeation-enhancing effect of the nanoparticles was reversible, non-toxic, and attributable to the binding to integrins on the surface of epithelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672544>Hydrogen peroxide permeability of cellular membranes in insulin-producing cells.</a></h1><p>Hydrogen peroxide (HO) plays a central role in redox signalling and in oxidative stress-mediated cell death. It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a   of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

The kinetics of QOOH radical decomposition and reaction with O have been determined as a  of temperature and pressure, using observations of OH radical production and decay following H-atom abstraction from tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide ((CH)COOH) by Cl atoms to produce QOOH (CH(CH)COOH) radicals. The kinetics of QOOH decomposition have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 298 K), and pressure (10 to 350 Torr), in helium and nitrogen bath gases, and those of the reaction between QOOH and O have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 304 K), and pressure (10 to 100 Torr) in He and N. Decomposition of the QOOH radicals was observed to display temperature and pressure dependence, with a  height for decomposition of (44.7 ± 4.0) kJ mol determined by master equation fitting to the experimental data. The rate coefficient for the reaction between QOOH and O was determined to be (5.6 ± 1.7) × 10 cm s at 298 K, with no significant dependence on pressure, and can be described by the Arrhenius parameters  = (7.3 ± 6.8) × 10 cm s and  = -(5.4 ± 2.1) kJ mol in the temperature range 251 to 304 K. This work represents the first measurements of any QOOH radical kinetics as a  of temperature and pressure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622617>Control of the retinal local RAS by the RPE: An interface to systemic RAS activity.</a></h1><p>As many other organs, the retina has a local renin-angiotensin-system (RAS). All main elements of the RAS are active in the retina: renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzymes. The functional role of the intraretinal RAS is not fully understood. So far, histological and functional analysis point to a regulation of ganglion cell activity and maybe also of bipolar cell activity, but it is not clear how RAS contributes to retinal signal processing. In contrast to local RAS in other organs, the retinal RAS is clearly separated from the systemic RAS. The angiotensin-2 (AngII)/AngI ratio in the retina is different to that in the plasma. However, it appears that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), that forms the outer blood/retina , is a major regulator of the retinal RAS by producing renin. Interestingly, comparable to the kidney, the renin production in the RPE is under control of the angiotensin-2 receptor type-1 (AT1). AT1 localizes to the basolateral membrane of the RPE and faces the blood side of the blood/retina . Increases in systemic AngII reduce renin production in the RPE and therefore decrease the intraretinal RAS activity. The relevance of the local RAS for retinal  remains unclear. Nevertheless, it is of fundamental significance to understand the pathology of systemically induced retinal diseases such as hypertension or diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the pathophysiological impact of dermokine, we generated mice deficient for two (βγ) or all dermokine isoforms (αβγ). Both variants, especially dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited scale and wrinkle formation resembling ichthyosis accompanied by transepidermal water imbalance at the neonatal stage. When reared under low humidity several dermokine αβγ-deficient mice died by postnatal day 21. Moreover, the cornified envelope (CE) was vulnerable, and skin  lipid ceramides were reduced in the epidermis of dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. cDNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR assays of the epidermis revealed upregulation of small proline-rich protein and late CE family members, as well as antimicrobial peptides in dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. These  gene signatures were similar to that seen in psoriasis, whereas recent studies demonstrated that congenital ichthyosis has gene profiles resembling psoriasis. In line with these findings, adult dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited aggravated phenotypes in psoriasis-like dermatitis models but not in allergic dermatitis models. Dermokine may play a regulatory role in inflammatory dyskeratotic diseases such as congenital ichthyosis and psoriasis in the crosstalk between  dysfunction and inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Dietary fiber is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and modulates the composition of the gut microbiota. New evidence indicates that dietary fiber also directly interacts with the epithelium and immune cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract by microbiota-independent effects. This review provides a focused overview of how dietary fiber improve human health and how these reported health benefits are connected to molecular pathways, in (1) a microbiota-independent manner, via interaction with specific surface receptors on epithelial and immune cells regulating intestinal  and immune , (2) a microbiota-dependent manner via maintaining intestinal homeostasis by promoting beneficial microbes, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, limiting the growth, adhesion and cytotoxicity of pathogenic microbes, as well as stimulating fiber-derived microbial short-chain fatty acid production.This article is protected by copyright.

Despite decades of extensive research on understanding its underlying mechanism and developing the pharmacological treatment, very little is known about the biological alterations leading to epileptogenesis. Due to this gap, the currently available antiepileptic drug therapy is symptomatic in nature and is ineffective in 30% of the cases. Mounting evidences revealed the pathophysiological role of neuroinflammation in epilepsy which has shifted the focus of epilepsy researchers towards the development of neuroinflammation-targeted therapeutics for epilepsy management. Markedly increased expression of key inflammatory mediators in the brain and blood-brain  may affect neuronal  and excitability and thus may increase seizure susceptibility in preclinical and clinical settings. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme synthesizing the proinflammatory mediators, prostaglandins, has widely been reported to be induced during seizures and is considered to be a potential neurotherapeutic target for epilepsy management. However, the efficacy of such therapy involving COX-2 inhibition depends on various factors viz., therapeutic dose, time of administration, treatment duration, and selectivity of COX-2 inhibitors. This article reviews the preclinical and clinical evidences supporting the role of COX-2 in seizure-associated neuroinflammation in epilepsy and the potential clinical use of COX-2 inhibitors as a future strategy for epilepsy treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679818>The TNF-like weak inducer of the apoptosis/fibroblast growth factor-inducible molecule 14 axis mediates histamine and platelet-activating factor-induced subcutaneous vascular leakage and anaphylactic shock.</a></h1><p>Anaphylaxis includes mast cell (MC) activation, but less is known about downstream mechanisms (ie, vascular permeability controlled by endothelial cells [ECs]). The TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its sole receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible molecule 14 (Fn14), belong to the TNF superfamily and are involved in proinflammatory responses.We sought to investigate the role of TWEAK/Fn14 axis in anaphylaxis.In vivo vascular permeability and mouse models of passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA) and active systemic anaphylaxis were applied to wild-type (WT), TWEAK- and Fn14-deficient mice (TWEAK and Fn14, respectively). Primary bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and ECs from WT and Fn14 or TWEAK mice were studied. The TWEAK/Fn14 axis was also investigated in human samples.Mice with PSA and active systemic anaphylaxis had increased Fn14 and TWEAK expression in lung tissues and increased serum soluble TWEAK concentrations. TWEAK and Fn14 deficiencies prevent PSA-related symptoms, resulting in resistance to decreased body temperature, less severe reactions, and maintained physical activity. Numbers of MCs after PSA are similar between genotypes in different tissue regions, such as ear skin and the trachea, tongue, peritoneum, lungs, and bone marrow. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed no differences in degranulation or mediator release between WT and Fn14 BMMCs after IgE-FcεRI stimulation. In vivo and in vitro histamine and platelet-activating factor administration increases Fn14 receptor expression in lungs and ECs. Moreover, Fn14 deficiency in ECs maintained in vitro impermeability when stimulated by mediators or activated BMMCs but not by TWEAK BMMCs, indicating that Fn14 is crucial for endothelial  . TWEAK/Fn14 deletion or TWEAK-blocking antibody prevented histamine/platelet-activating factor-induced vascular subcutaneous permeability. Circulating soluble TWEAK levels were increased in patients with anaphylaxis, and plasma from those patients increased Fn14 expression in ECs.The TWEAK/Fn14 axis participates in anaphylactic reactions. Inhibition of TWEAK/Fn14 interaction could be efficacious in anaphylaxis therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

An additional MNT sample was collected 6 months after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS, MNT-6).  mRNA levels were significantly reduced in all specimens by approximately three- to five-fold, while  was increased in MNT-0, as compared with controls. Six months after surgery their levels were reversed to control values. CRSwNP patients with  isolated from sinus swabs showed upregulation of  in MNT and NP as compared with patients with sterile swabs.

The structure and  of viral rhodopsins are unknown. We present functional characterization and high-resolution structure of an Organic Lake Phycodnavirus rhodopsin II (OLPVRII) of group 2. It forms a pentamer, with a symmetrical, bottle-like central channel with the narrow vestibule in the cytoplasmic part covered by a ring of 5 arginines, whereas 5 phenylalanines form a hydrophobic  in its exit. The proton donor E42 is placed in the helix B. The structure is unique among the known rhodopsins. Structural and functional data and molecular dynamics suggest that OLPVRII might be a light-gated pentameric ion channel analogous to pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, however, future patch clamp experiments should prove this directly. The data shed light on a fundamentally distinct branch of rhodopsins and may contribute to the understanding of virus-host interactions in ecologically important marine protists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671075>SDR9C7 catalyzes critical dehydrogenation of acylceramides for skin  formation.</a></h1><p>The corneocyte lipid envelope composed of covalently bound ceramides and fatty acids is important to the integrity of the permeability  in the stratum corneum, and its absence is a prime structural defect in various skin diseases associated with defective skin  . SDR9C7 encodes a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7) recently found mutated in ichthyosis. In a patient with SDR9C7 mutation and a mouse Sdr9c7 knockout model we show loss of covalent binding of epidermal ceramides to protein, a structural fault in the . For reasons unresolved, protein binding requires lipoxygenase-catalyzed transformations of linoleic acid (18:2) esterified in ω-O-acylceramides. In Sdr9c7-/- epidermis, quantitative LC-MS assays revealed almost complete loss of a species of ω-O-acylceramide esterified with linoleate-9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-ketone; other acylceramides related to the lipoxygenase pathway were in higher abundance. Recombinant SDR9C7 catalyzed NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of linoleate 9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-alcohol to the corresponding 13-ketone, while ichthyosis mutants were inactive. We propose, therefore, that the critical requirement for lipoxygenases and SDR9C7 is in producing acylceramide containing the 9,10-epoxy-11E-13-ketone, a reactive moiety known for its non-enzymatic coupling to protein. This suggests a mechanism for coupling of ceramide to protein and provides important insights into skin  formation and pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691624>(3R)-5,6,7-trihydroxy-3-isopropyl-3-methylisochroman-1-one enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody through inhibiting PI3Kδ/γ.</a></h1><p> Immunotherapy has demonstrated durable clinical responses in various cancers by disinhibiting the immune system, largely attributed to the success of immune-checkpoint blockade. However, there are still subsets of patients across multiple cancers not showing robust responses to these agents and one significant  to their efficacy may be the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we demonstrated that functional inhibition of MDSCs with (3 R)-5,6,7-trihydroxy-3-isopropyl-3-methylisochroman-1-one (TIMO), a potent PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor, enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody in the tumor model. A syngeneic ovarian tumor model was established. MDSCs from the peripheral blood and tumor parenchyma were analyzed by flow cytometry. Proliferation and killing effects of T-lymphocytes were measured. IFNγ production was measured by ELISA assay. qPCR and western blot were used to detect the gene and protein expression. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of TIMO combined with anti-PD1 antibody were assessed by the tumor model. Our data demonstrated that inhibition of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs)  with TIMO could overcome MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression and promote antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses, resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell-mediated tumor control. We further demonstrated that TIMO and anti-PD1 combination therapy promoted tumor growth control in a syngeneic ovarian tumor model. Our results provided proof of concept for a new combination strategy involving the use of a selective inhibitor of PI3Kδ/γ to inhibit the  of MDSCs to enhance tumor responses to immune checkpoint blocking antibodies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636538>Role of Exosomes in Central Nervous System Diseases.</a></h1><p>There are many types of intercellular communication, and extracellular vesicles are one of the important forms of this. They are released by a variety of cell types, are heterogeneous, and can roughly be divided into microvesicles and exosomes according to their occurrence and . Of course, exosomes do not just play a role in cell-to-cell communication. In the nervous system, exosomes can participate in intercellular communication, maintain the myelin sheath, and eliminate waste. Similarly, exosomes in the brain can play a role in central nervous system diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, and traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with both positive and negative effects (such as the transfer of misfolded proteins). Exosomes contain a variety of key bioactive substances and can therefore be considered as a snapshot of the intracellular environment. Studies have shown that exosomes from the central nervous system can be found in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral body fluids, and that their contents will change with disease occurrence. Because exosomes can penetrate the blood brain  (BBB) and are highly stable in peripheral circulation, they can protect disease-related molecules well and therefore, using exosomes as a biomarker of central nervous system diseases is an attractive prospect as they can be used to monitor disease development and enable early diagnosis and treatment optimization. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of exosomes, and introduce their pathophysiological roles in different diseases of the central nervous system as well as their roles and applications as a viable pathological biomarker.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Bai, Zhang, Huang, Xu and Zhang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628277>A novel model of cerebral hyperperfusion with blood-brain  breakdown, white matter injury, and cognitive dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Cerebral hyperperfusion (CHP) is associated with considerable morbidity. Its pathophysiology involves disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) with subsequent events such as vasogenic brain edema and ischemic and/or hemorrhagic complications. Researchers are trying to mimic the condition of CHP; however, a proper animal model is still lacking. In this paper the authors report a novel surgically induced CHP model that mimics the reported pathophysiology of clinical CHP including BBB breakdown, white matter (WM) injury, inflammation, and cognitive impairment.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and contralateral CCA stenosis. Three days after the initial surgery, the stenosis of CCA was released to induce CHP. Cortical regional cerebral blood flow was measured using laser speckle flowmetry. BBB breakdown was assessed by Evans blue dye extravasation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels. WM injury was investigated with Luxol fast blue staining. Cognitive  was assessed using the Barnes circular maze. Other changes pertaining to inflammation were also assessed. Sham-operated animals were prepared and used as controls.Cerebral blood flow was significantly raised in the cerebral cortex after CHP induction. CHP induced BBB breakdown evident by Evans blue dye extravasation, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was identified as a possible culprit. WM degeneration was evident in the corpus callosum and corpus striatum. Immunohistochemistry revealed macrophage activation and glial cell upregulation as an inflammatory response to CHP in the striatum and cerebral cortex. CHP also caused significant impairments in spatial learning and memory compared with the sham-operated animals.The authors report a novel CHP model in rats that represents the pathophysiology of CHP observed in various clinical scenarios. This model was produced without the use of pharmacological agents; therefore, it is ideal to study the pathology of CHP as well as to perform preclinical drug trials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683816>Health-Seeking Behavior for Erectile Dysfunction in Methadone Maintenance Treatment Patients.</a></h1><p>: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is commonly associated with methadone usage.

This study was designed to determine the effect of chamaejasmine, a biflavonoid present in , on atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin lesions in a 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced murine model of AD. Initially, we examined the anti-allergic activities of ten flavonoids from  by measuring β-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells. Subsequently, an SKH-1 hairless mouse model of AD was developed based on the topical application of DNCB. Chamaejasmine (0.5%) or pimecrolimus (1%, positive control) were applied to dorsal skins of DNCB-sensitized AD mice for two weeks. Serum IL-4 and IgE levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin hydration were measured using a Tewameter TM210 and a SKIN-O-MAT, respectively. Of the ten flavonoids isolated from , chamaejasmine most potently inhibited DNP-specific IgE-induced degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. Topical administration of chamaejasmine attenuated the clinical symptoms of DNCB-induced dermatitis (i.e., itching, dryness, erythema, and edema). Histological analyses demonstrated that dermal thickness and mast cell infiltration in dermis were significantly reduced by chamaejasmine. In addition, 0.5% chamaejasmine inhibited DNCB-induced increases in total IL-4 and IgE levels in serum, improved skin  , and increased epidermis moisture.

Gramicidin channels have emerged as a powerful system for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of membrane protein  regulation through changes in bilayer properties, which are reflected in the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution between nonconducting gramicidin monomers and conducting bilayer-spanning dimers. To improve our understanding of how subtle changes in bilayer thickness alter the gramicidin monomer and dimer distributions, we performed extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence-quenching experiments on gramicidin A (gA). The free-energy calculations predicted a nonlinear coupling between the bilayer thickness and channel formation. The energetic  inhibiting gA channel formation was sharply increased in the thickest bilayer (1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). This prediction was corroborated by experimental results on gramicidin channel activity in bilayers of different thickness. To further explore the mechanism of channel formation, we performed extensive unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, which allowed us to observe spontaneous gA dimer formation in lipid bilayers. The simulations revealed structural rearrangements in the gA subunits and changes in lipid packing, as well as water reorganization, that occur during the dimerization process. Together, the simulations and experiments provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the process and mechanism of gramicidin channel formation, as a prototypical example of the bilayer regulation of membrane protein .Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

Traversal of the barriers protecting the brain by pathogens is a prerequisite for the development of meningitis. Bacteria have developed a variety of different strategies to cross these barriers and reach the CNS. To this end, they use a variety of different virulence factors that enable them to attach to and traverse these barriers. These virulence factors mediate adhesion to and invasion into host cells, intracellular survival, induction of host cell signaling and inflammatory response, and affect  .

We synthesize six ferrofluid samples, four of which have the same wide particle size distribution with a high (more than 2kT) average energy of magnetic dipole interactions. These samples differ in particle concentration and dynamic viscosity. The two remaining samples have a lower content of large particles and a moderate energy of magnetic dipole interactions. For all samples, we measure the dynamic susceptibility in the weak probing field at frequencies up to 160 kHz and the field amplitude dependence of the susceptibility at a frequency of 27 kHz. The results show that the susceptibility dispersion at frequencies up to 10 kHz is due to the rotational diffusion of colloidal particles and aggregates. Steric and hydrodynamic interparticle interactions are the main reason for the strong concentration dependence of the viscosity and so they also strongly influence the frequency dependence of the susceptibility. The influence of van der Waals and magnetic dipole interactions on the susceptibility is manifested indirectly, through the formation of multiparticle clusters. The contribution of clusters to the low-frequency susceptibility reaches 80%. Their large sizes (about 100 nm) shift the dispersion region to frequencies of 1-100 Hz, depending on the temperature and particle concentration. Experiments at 27 kHz demonstrate the increase in the dynamic susceptibility with increasing field amplitude. This growth is unexpected since all spectral amplitudes in the Debye  expansion of the dynamic susceptibility decrease monotonically with increasing field. To clarify the situation, the auxiliary problem of the magnetodynamics of a uniaxial particle in the alternating field is solved numerically. The Fokker-Planck-Brown rotational diffusion equation is used. It is shown that an increase in the field amplitude reduces the anisotropy  and the Néel relaxation time of particles and increases the dynamic susceptibility by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the weak-field limit. The calculation results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data and allow us to propose a consistent interpretation of these data. We find that the increase in dynamic susceptibility with increasing amplitude is observed when two necessary conditions are met: (i) The suspension viscosity and the field frequency are high enough to cause the blocking of the rotational degrees of freedom of particles and aggregates and (ii) particles with a large magnetic anisotropy are present in the ferrofluid.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644554>Acute normobaric hypoxia does not affect the simultaneous exercise-induced increase in circulating BDNF and GDNF in young healthy men: A feasibility study.</a></h1><p>Physical exercise has a neuromodulatory effect on the central nervous system (CNS) partially by modifying expression of neuropeptides produced and secreted by neurons and glial cells, among which the best examined are brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Because both neurotrophins can cross the brain-blood  (BBB), their blood levels indirectly reflect their production in the CNS. Moreover, both neuropeptides are involved in modulation of dopaminergic and serotoninergic system . Because limited information is available on the effects of exercise to volition exhaustion and acute hypoxia on CNS, BDNF and GDNF formation, the aims of the present study were to verify whether 1) acute exercise to exhaustion in addition to neurons also activates glial cells and 2) additional exposure to acute normobaric moderate hypoxia affects their . In this feasibility study we measured blood concentrations of BDNF, GDNF, and neuropeptides considered as biomarkers of brain damage (bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP) in seven sedentary healthy young men who performed a graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer under normoxic (N) and hypoxic conditions: 2,000 m (H2; FiO2 = 16.6%) and 3,000 m altitude (H3; FiO2 = 14.7%). In all conditions serum concentrations of both BDNF and GDNF increased immediately after cessation of exercise (p<0.01). There was no effect of condition or interaction (condition x time of measurement) and exercise on any of the brain damage biomarkers: bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP. Moreover, in N (0<0.01) and H3 (p<0.05) exercise caused elevated serum 5-HT concentration. The results suggest that a graded effort to volitional exhaustion in normoxia, as well as hypoxia, simultaneously activates both neurons and astrocytes. Considering that s100B, GFAP, bFGF, and NGF (produced mainly by astrocytes) are markers of brain damage, it can be assumed that a maximum effort in both conditions is safe for the CNS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650247>Tricellular tight junction protein LSR/angulin-1 contributes to the epithelial  and malignancy in human pancreatic cancer cell line.</a></h1><p>Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR)/angulin-1 is a crucial molecule of tricellular contacts in the epithelial  of normal cells and the malignancy of cancer cells. To investigate whether LSR/angulin-1 affects the epithelial  and malignancy in human pancreatic cancer, human pancreatic cancer cell line HPAC was used. Treatment with EGF or TGF-β increased the expression of LSR, but not tricellulin (TRIC), and induced the localization of LSR and TRIC to bicellular tight junctions from tricellular tight junctions. TGF-β receptor type-1 inhibitor EW-7197 prevented changes of the distribution and the   of LSR by TGF-β. Knockdown of LSR increased cell migration, invasion, proliferation and EGF ligand amphiregulin expression and decreased the epithelial . Treatment with amphiregulin induced cell migration and invasion and knockdown of amphiregulin prevented the increases of cell migration, invasion and proliferation caused by knockdown of LSR. Treatment with LSR ligand peptide angubindin-1 decreased the epithelial  and the expression of LSR, but not TRIC, and increased cell invasion. Knockdown of TRIC decreased cell migration and the epithelial . In immunohistochemical analysis of human pancreatic cancer tissues, LSR and TRIC were found to be localized at the cell membranes of normal pancreatic ducts and well-differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), whereas in poorly differentiated PDAC, LSR was weakly detected in the cytoplasm. Amphiregulin was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of well- and poorly differentiated PDAC. In pancreatic cancer, LSR contributes to the epithelial  and malignancy via growth factors and may be a potential targeting molecule in the therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632373>Administration of  Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) develop as a result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota. Multiple clinical and animal data have shown that  is associated with a healthy mucosa. However, its precise role in colitis is currently unknown. Our study aimed to determine its protective effects and underlying mechanisms in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were administered  Muc or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once daily by oral gavage for 14 days. Colitis was induced by drinking 2% DSS from days 0 to 6, followed by 2 days of drinking normal water. Mice were weighed daily and then sacrificed on day 8. We found that  improved DSS-induced colitis, which was evidenced by reduced weight loss, colon length shortening and histopathology scores and enhanced  . Serum and tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL1α, IL6, IL12A, MIP-1A, G-CSF, and KC) decreased as a result of  administration. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences showed that  induced significant gut microbiota alterations. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokines and other injury factors were negatively associated with , , and , which were prominently abundant in -treated mice. We confirmed that  treatment could ameliorate mucosal inflammation either via microbe-host interactions, which protect the gut   and reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, or by improving the microbial community. Our findings suggest that  may be a potential probiotic agent for ameliorating colitis.Copyright © 2019 Bian, Wu, Yang, Lv, Wang, Li, Ye, Fang, Wu, Jiang, Shi and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626304>Transcriptional profiling of the murine airway response to acute ozone exposure.</a></h1><p>Ambient ozone (O3) exposure has serious consequences on respiratory health, including airway inflammation and injury. Decades of research have yielded thorough descriptions of these outcomes; however, less is known about the molecular processes that drive them. The aim of this study was to further describe the cellular and molecular responses to O3 exposure in murine airways, with a particular focus on transcriptional responses in two critical compartments: conducting airways (CA) and airway macrophages (AM). After exposing adult, female C57BL/6J mice to filtered air, 1 or 2 ppm O3, we assessed hallmark responses including airway inflammation (cell counts and cytokine secretion) and injury (epithelial permeability), followed by gene expression profiling of CA and AM by RNA-seq. As expected, we observed concentration-dependent increases in airway inflammation and injury. CA and AM both exhibited changes in gene expression to both 1 and 2 ppm O3 that were largely compartment-specific. In CA, genes associated with epithelial  , detoxification processes, and cellular proliferation were altered, while O3 affected genes involved in innate immune signaling, cytokine production, and extracellular matrix remodeling in AM. Further, CA and AM also exhibited notable differences in concentration-response expression patterns for large numbers of genes. Overall, our study has described transcriptional responses to acute O3 exposure, revealing both shared and unique gene expression patterns across multiple concentrations of O3 and in two important O3-responsive tissues. These profiles provide broad mechanistic insight into pulmonary O3 toxicity, and reveal a variety of targets for focused follow-up studies.© The Author(s) 2019.

It had been unclear how lack of ZDHHC13 proteins resulted in cutaneous abnormalities. In this study, we first demonstrate that enzymatic palmitoylation activity, rather than protein scaffolding, by ZDHHC13 is essential for skin  integrity, showing that knock-in mice bearing an enzymatically dead DQ-to-AA ZDHHC13 mutation cyclically lost their hair after weaning, recapitulating knock-out phenotypes of skin inflammation and dermatitis. To establish the ZDHHC13 substrates responsible for skin  development, we employed quantitative proteomic approaches to identify protein molecules whose palmitoylation is tightly controlled by ZDHHC13. We identified over 300 candidate proteins that could be classified into four biological categories: immunological disease, skin development and , dermatological disease, and lipid metabolism. Palmitoylation of three of these candidates-loricrin, peptidyl arginine deiminase type III and keratin fiber crosslinker transglutaminase 1-by ZDHHC13 was confirmed by biochemical assay. Palmitoylation was critical for in vivo protein stability of the latter two candidates. Our findings reveal the importance of protein palmitoylation in skin  development, partly by promoting envelope protein crosslinking and the filaggrin processing pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It allows one to directly map the  properties onto the atomic-motion components of the reaction coordinate at the TS, which has potential to shed light onto some mechanistic features of a chemical process. To demonstrate the applicability of RMCF to reactivity, we link the kinetic energy distribution within a reactive mode with the asynchronicity (η) in C-H bond activation, as they both evolve in a series of coupled proton-electron transfer (CPET) reactions between FeIVO oxidants and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. RMCF shows how the earliness or lateness of a process manifests as a redistribution of kinetic energy in the reactive mode as a  of the free energy of reaction (ΔG0) and η. Finally, the title analysis can be applied to predict H-atom tunneling contributions and kinetic isotope effects in a set of reactions, yielding a transparent rationalization based on the kinetic energy distributions in the reactive mode.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681193>The Effect of  on Gut Microbiota, Immune Response and Intestinal   During the Development of Necrotic Enteritis in Chickens.</a></h1><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry. Probiotics are used as potential alternatives to antibiotics to prevent NE. It is known that  can act as a probiotic that can prevent infection. However, whether or not it exerts a beneficial effect on NE in chickens remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated the impact of  on immune response and intestinal microbiota during the development of NE in chickens, including experimental stages with basal diets, high-fishmeal-supplementation diets, and  challenge. Chickens were divided into two groups from day 1 to day 20: one group had its diet supplemented with  supplementation and one did not. At day 20, the chickens were divided into four groups:  challenged and unchallenged chickens with and without  supplementation. All groups were fed a basal diet for 13 days and thereafter a basal diet with 50% fishmeal from day 14 to 24. Chickens were infected with  from day 21 to 23. At days 13, 20 and 24, samples were collected for analysis of the relative expression of immune response and intestinal mucosa -related genes and intestinal microbes. The results show that  can inhibit the increase in IL-17A gene expression and the reduction in Claudin-1 gene induced-expression caused by  challenge. Moreover,  was found to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in infected chickens. Although  was found to have a significant beneficial effect on the structure of intestinal bacteria in the basal diet groups and decrease the abundance of  in the gut, it did not significantly affect the occurrence of intestinal lesions and did not significantly correct the shift in gut bacterial composition post  infection. In conclusion, although  promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory and tight junction protein genes and inhibits pro-inflammatory genes in challenged chickens, it is not adequate to improve the structure of intestinal microbiota in NE chickens. Therefore, more effective schemes of  supplementation to prevent and treat NE in chickens need to be identified.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Peng, Gao, Wei, Xiang, Yuan and Xu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662022>Localization of Tricellular Tight Junction Molecule LSR at Midbody and Centrosome During Cytokinesis in Human Epithelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Epithelial integrity and   are maintained during cytokinesis in vertebrate epithelial tissues. The changes in localization and the roles of tricellular tight junction molecule lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) during cytokinesis are not well known, although new tricellular tight junctions form at the flank of the midbody during cytokinesis. In this study, we investigated the changes in localization and the role of LSR at the midbody and centrosome during cytokinesis using human endometrial carcinoma cell line Sawano, comparing the tricellular tight junction molecule tricellulin; bicellular tight junction molecules occludin, claudin-7, zonula occludens-1, and cingulin; and the epithelial polarized related molecules apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2, PAR3, and yes-associated protein. During cytokinesis induced by treatment with taxol, the epithelial  was maintained and the tricellular tight junction molecules LSR and tricellulin were concentrated at the flank of the acetylated tubulin-positive midbody and in γ-tubulin-positive centrosomes with the dynein adaptor Hook2, whereas the other molecules were localized there as well. All the molecules disappeared by knockdown using small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, by the knockdown of Hook2, the epithelial  was maintained and most of the molecules disappeared from the centrosome. These findings suggest that LSR may play crucial roles not only in   but also in cytokinesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636329>Mitochondrial dysfunction increases pro-inflammatory cytokine production and impairs repair and corticosteroid responsiveness in lung epithelium.</a></h1><p>COPD is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and irreversible lung tissue damage. Inhaled noxious gases, including cigarette smoke, are the major risk factor for COPD. Inhaled smoke first encounters the epithelial lining of the lungs, causing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We investigated whether a mitochondrial defect may contribute to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, impaired epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid sensitivity as observed in COPD. We used wild-type alveolar epithelial cells A549 and mitochondrial DNA-depleted A549 cells (A549 Rho-0) and studied pro-inflammatory responses using (multiplex) ELISA as well as epithelial   and repair (real-time impedance measurements), in the presence and absence of the inhaled corticosteroid budesonide. We observed that A549 Rho-0 cells secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type A549 cells and display impaired repair upon wounding. Budesonide strongly suppressed the production of neutrophil attractant CXCL8, and promoted epithelial integrity in A549 wild-type cells, while A549 Rho-0 cells displayed reduced corticosteroid sensitivity compared to wild-type cells. The reduced corticosteroid responsiveness may be mediated by glycolytic reprogramming, specifically glycolysis-associated PI3K signaling, as PI3K inhibitor LY294002 restored the sensitivity of CXCL8 secretion to corticosteroids in A549 Rho-0 cells. In conclusion, mitochondrial defects may lead to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, reduced epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid responsiveness in lung epithelium, thus potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611796>Astrocytes: Role and Functions in Brain Pathologies.</a></h1><p>Astrocytes are a population of cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain. Postnatally, astrocyte progenitors migrate to reach their brain area and related properties. They have a regulatory role of brain functions that are implicated in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, controlling blood-brain  permeability and maintaining extracellular homeostasis. Mature astrocytes also express some genes enriched in cell progenitors, suggesting they can retain proliferative potential. Considering heterogeneity of cell population, it is not surprising that their disorders are related to a wide range of different neuro-pathologies. Brain diseases are characterized by the active inflammatory state of the astrocytes, which is usually described as up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In particular, the loss of astrocytes  as a result of cellular senescence could have implications for the neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease, and for the aging brain. Astrocytes can also drive the induction and the progression of the inflammatory state due to their Ca signals and that it is strongly related to the disease severity/state. Moreover, they contribute to the altered neuronal activity in several frontal cortex pathologies such as ischemic stroke and epilepsy. There, we describe the current knowledge pertaining to astrocytes' role in brain pathologies and discuss the possibilities to target them as approach toward pharmacological therapies for neuro-pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Siracusa, Fusco and Cuzzocrea.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666293>Putative  of goblet cells as epithelial sealing in ischaemia/reperfusion-induced intestinal  dysfunction.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624315>A collagen gel-coated, aligned nanofiber membrane for enhanced endothelial  .</a></h1><p>Herein, a collagen gel-coated and aligned nanofiber membrane named Col-ANM is developed, which remarkably improves endothelial   by providing biochemical and topographical cues simultaneously. Col-ANM is fabricated by collagen gel coating process on an aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membrane, which is obtained by a simple electrospinning process adopting a parallel electrode collector. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on Col-ANM exhibit remarkably enhanced endothelial   with high expression levels of intercellular junction proteins of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, a high TEER, and a cellular permeability compared with the artificial porous membranes in commercial cell culture well inserts. The enhanced endothelial   is conjectured to be attributed to the synergistic effects of topographical and biochemical cues provided by the aligned PCL nanofibers and collagen gel in the Col-ANM, respectively. Finally, the reactive oxygen species is applied to the HUVEC monolayer formed on the Col-ANM to destroy the tight junctions between HUVECs. The destruction of the tight junctions is demonstrated by the decreased TEER value over time.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether PD protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial  disruption through SIRT3 activation and to disclose the underlying mechanisms. Wild-type mice were injected with LPS and Evans Blue assay was performed to evaluate vascular permeability. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with LPS. Endothelial permeability was evaluated by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran leakage. SIRT3 activity was determined by a Deacetylase Fluorometric kit, and protein expression level of SIRT3 was detected by western blotting. Mitochondrial  was evaluated by determination of ROS level, mitochondrial membrane potential and mPTP opening. In endotoxemic mice, PD pretreatment attenuated vascular leakage in multiple organs while SIRT3 inhibition with 3-TYP reversed the effects of PD. PD treatment in late sepsis also exhibited  protective effects. In HUVECs, PD alleviated LPS-induced F-actin rearrangement, cadherin-catenin complex dissociation and endothelial hyperpermeability, whereas 3-TYP or SIRT3 siRNA attenuated the protective effects of PD. PD enhanced SIRT3 deacetylase activity, and attenuated LPS-induced decrease in SIRT3 expression as well. Furthermore, gain-of- and loss-of- strategies also confirmed the role of SIRT3 in enhancing endothelial  integrity. It was further ascertained that PD enhanced SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of SOD2 and cyclophilin D (CypD), thus suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent endothelial  dysfunction. In addition, it was revealed that RAGE was involved in LPS-regulated SIRT3 signaling. Our results suggest that polydatin protects against LPS-induced endothelial  disruption dependent on SIRT3 and can be applied as a potential therapy for sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693390>Mitochondria: at the crossroads of regulating lung epithelial cell  in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</a></h1><p>Disturbances in mitochondrial structure and  in lung epithelial cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such disturbances not only affect cellular energy metabolism, but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which mitochondria are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death pathways and cellular remodeling to physical   and innate immunity, all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective mitochondria are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell , innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial   in COPD. We also discuss the applicability and potential therapeutic value of recently proposed strategies for the restoration of mitochondrial  in the treatment of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678325>Extracellular vesicles as an emerging tool for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a series of interacting pathophysiological cascades, including the aggregation of β-amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles derived from hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. AD is the cause of approximately 70% of dementia, an irreversible and untreatable syndrome at its late stage. Hence, more efforts should be devoted to identifying at-risk or preclinical AD populations for early intervention and the improved design of drug trials. The exosome, a nanoscale subtype of extracellular vesicle that serves as a cell-to-cell communication messenger, is an emerging liquid biopsy tool for various diseases including AD. Recently, it has been discovered that brain-derived exosomes can flow through the blood-brain  to the peripheral blood, containing important protein and nucleic acid biomarkers that are associated with the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Other reports showed a strong involvement of exosomes in synaptic , insulin resistance, and neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we summarize those studies and assess the value of exosomes as an emerging tool for the early detection of AD in conjunction with the current clinical diagnosis paradigm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Advances in diagnostics and imaging have led to increased detection of central nervous system (CNS) metastases in patients with progressive cancers. Improved control of extracranial systemic disease, and the limited ability of current therapeutics to cross the blood-brain  (BBB) also contribute to the increase in incidence of brain metastases, as tumor cells seek refuge in the brain. Surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation (whole-brain radiation therapy and stereotactic radiation surgery [WBRT/SRS]) are a clinically established treatment paradigm for patients with brain metastases. With the advent of genetic and molecular characterization of tumors and their immune microenvironment, clinical trials seek to include targeted drugs into the therapeutic regimen for eligible patients.

A large fraction of those patients need platelet transfusions, which can be life-saving if bleedings occur and also allow diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The outcomes of platelet transfusions are not always easy to predict in terms of bleeding control or increase in platelet count.

Scarring from surgery can have a significant physical and psychological impact depending on the colour, relief, size, body location, surface area or . Whether a procedure be life-saving such as a mastectomy, a caesarean, or a mole excision, or aesthetic such as breast reconstruction or laser treatment, patients are increasingly concerned with having an aesthetic scar outcome. With improved surgical and technological advances, elective surgery and cosmetic procedures are becoming safer and easier to perform in both hospitals and outpatient clinics. This means that more people elect to undergo procedures for an increasing number of indications on varied body areas including the face, back and limbs but also breasts, ears or genitalia. Therefore, taking the final scar outcome into consideration both before and after a procedure is becoming particularly important to ensure that controlled healing occurs with minimal discomfort. As the healing process varies from one procedure to another, and from one body part to another, each wound requires specific care. Dermatologists are well placed to manage wound healing but there remains a need for them to be involved in wound management and help surgeons better manage the wound healing process beyond wound closure and infection control. Basic skin care can play a role to protect the skin  , control inflammation and enhance natural healing. The objective of this review is to provide recommendations based on published literature for the role basic skin care plays in supporting continued wound management following invasive procedures.© 2019 Jourdan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689519>Phloretin ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice by regulating the gut microbiota.</a></h1><p>Phloretin, extracted from the pericarp and velamen of apples or pears, is a dihydrochalcone flavonoid with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. It has been reported that phloretin has anti-inflammatory effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. However, the role of the gut microbiota in the phloretin anti-UC process remains unclear. In this study, we observed that the anti-UC effect of phloretin was affected by co-housing, probably because of the transmissible nature of the gut micobiota. Through fecal micobiota transplantation (FMT), the effects of the gut microbiota on the anti-UC of phloretin were further confirmed. UC was induced in mice by administrating 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. Phloretin (60 mg/kg) was administered by gavage every day during the experiment. Fecal microbes (10 CFU/mL) from phloretin-treated UC mice were administered by gavage to non-phloretin-treated UC mice for 7 days. The results showed that FMT, like phloretin, ameliorated UC by improving disease symptoms and colon inflammation, balancing inflammatory cytokines, maintaining intestinal  integrity, restoring systemic immune , inhibiting NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorating the oxidant stress. Both FMT and phloretin treatment increased the levels of Bacteroidetes, Alistipes and Lactobacillus and decreased those of Firmicutes, Oscillibacter and Ruminiclostridium_6. Correlation analysis between gut microbes and micro-environmental factors revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively correlated with DAI, pathological score, and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels, and Alistipes was more abundant in phloretin or FMT treated UC mice. Oscillibacter abundance was significantly positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-1β levels and pathological score, and Oscillibacter was increased in UC mice. Furthermore, network analysis of the dominant genera revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively related to Oscillibacter abundance. In conclusion, this study suggests that the anti-UC effects of phloretin are achieved through regulation of the gut microbiota and phloretin has the potential to be developed as a promising agent for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2019.
