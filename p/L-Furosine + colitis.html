A minimally invasive test that provides a surrogate measure of endoscopic activity is required.Plasma nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectra from 40 patients with UC followed prospectively over 6 months were analysed with multivariate statistics. NMR metabolite profiles were compared with endoscopic [Ulcerative  Endoscopic Index of Severity: UCEIS], histological [Nancy Index] and clinical [Simple Clinical  Activity Index: SCCAI] severity indices, along with routine blood measurements.A blinded principal component analysis spontaneously separated metabolite profiles of patients with low [≤3] and high [>3] UCEIS. Orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis identified low and high UCEIS metabolite profiles with an accuracy of 77 ± 5%. Plasma metabolites driving discrimination included decreases in lipoproteins and increases in isoleucine, valine, glucose and myo-inositol in high compared to low UCEIS. This same metabolite profile distinguished between low [Nancy 0-1] and high histological activity [Nancy 3-4] with a modest although significant accuracy [65 ± 6%] but was independent of SCCAI and all blood parameters measured. A different metabolite profile, dominated by changes in lysine, histidine, phenylalanine and , distinguished between improvement in UCEIS [decrease ≥1] and worsening [increase ≥1] over 6 months with an accuracy of 74 ± 4%.Plasma NMR metabolite analysis has the potential to provide a low-cost, minimally invasive technique that may be a surrogate for endoscopic assessment, with predictive capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383440>Immunohistochemical examination of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of hesperetin on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced  in rats.</a></h2><p>The trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced  model is used to investigate the pathogenesis of ulcerative . Colon inflammation and apoptosis are associated with tissue damage in ulcerative . Hesperetin is a natural flavonoid that exhibits antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. We investigated the effects of hesperetin on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), protein  phosphatase, receptor type C (CD45), caspase-3 and Bax expressions in TNBS in induced  model in rats. Male rats were divided into three groups: control group treated with 1 ml physiological saline,  group, and  + hesperetin group treated with TNBS and hesperetin. Hesperetin treatment was applied for 10 days starting 3 days prior to  induction. At the end of the experiment, TNF-α, CD45, caspase-3 and Bax expressions in colon tissue were determined using indirect immunohistochemistry. Increased immunoreactivity of both inflammation markers, TNF-α, CD45, and apoptotic markers, caspase-3 and Bax, was detected in the  group. Hesperetin treatment effected significant reduction of all parameters.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of DAP12 and Syk pathways in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).DAP12 deficient and DAP12 transgenic, overexpressing an increased amount of DAP12, mice and Syk deficient mice in the C57/BL6 background were used for these studies.  was induced by administering mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), in drinking water, or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), by intrarectal enema.Abundant expression of DAP12 and Syk was detected in colon samples obtained from Crohn's disease patients with expression restricted to immune cells infiltrating the colonic wall. In rodents development of DSS  as measured by assessing severity of wasting diseases, global  score,and macroscopic and histology scores was robustly attenuated in DAP12-/- and Syk-/- mice. In contrast, DAP12 overexpression resulted in a striking exacerbation of colon damage caused by DSS. Induction of colon expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to DSS administration was attenuated in DAP12-/- and Syk-/- mice, whereas opposite results were observed in DAP12 transgenic mice. Treating wild-type mice with a DAP-12 inhibitor or a Syk inhibitor caused a robust attenuation of  induced by DSS and TNBS.DAP12 and Syk are essential mediators in inflammation-driven immune dysfunction in murine colitides. Because DAP12 and Syk expression is upregulated in patients with active disease, present findings suggest a beneficial role for DAP12 and Syk inhibitors in IBD.© 2017 Crohn’s &  Foundation of America.

The anti-inflammatory role of PTPN2 is highlighted by the fact that PTPN2-deficient mice die a few weeks after birth because of systemic inflammation and severe . However, the tissues, cells, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that myeloid cell-specific deletion of PTPN2 in mice (PTPN2-LysMCre) promotes intestinal inflammation but protects from -associated tumor formation in an IL-1β-dependent manner. Elevated levels of mature IL-1β production in PTPN2-LysMCre mice are a consequence of increased inflammasome assembly due to elevated phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Thus, we have identified a dual role for myeloid PTPN2 in directly regulating inflammasome activation and IL-1β production to suppress pro-inflammatory responses during  but promote intestinal tumor development.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Thus, we aim to elucidate the potential role and underlying mechanism of PTPRO in UC. In this study, increased expression of PTPRO, toll-like receptor (TLR4) and inflammatory cytokines were observed in mucosal tissues (MTs) from inflamed areas and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) of patients with UC compared with those from healthy controls. Then, it was manifested that PTPRO promoted the expression of TLR4 and proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-induced (LPS-induced) inflammatory macrophage model. Besides, PTPRO inhibited the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) but enhanced the apoptosis of IECs in macrophages. Moreover, levels of phosphorylated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/p65 and inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα) were more significantly increased in PTPRO overexpressed macrophages. In addition, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.807 (95%CI = 0.686-0.958, P < .001) suggesting PTPRO as an ideal diagnostic marker for UC. Taken these, the present study shows strong evidence that PTPRO exaggerates inflammation in UC via TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30376595>The  phosphatase Shp-2 confers resistance to colonic inflammation by driving goblet cell function and crypt regeneration.</a></h2><p>The Src homology-2 domain-containing  phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) regulates many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding SHP-2 are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative . We recently reported that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Shp-2 in mice (Shp-2 ) leads to chronic  and -associated cancer. This suggests that SHP-2-dependent signaling protects the colonic epithelium against inflammation and -associated cancer development. To verify this hypothesis, we generated mice expressing the Shp-2 E76K activated form specifically in IEC. Our results showed that sustained Shp-2 activation in IEC increased intestine and crypt length, correlating with increased cell proliferation and migration. Crypt regeneration capacity was also markedly enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo organoid culture. Shp-2 activation alters the secretory cell lineage, as evidenced by increased goblet cell numbers and mucus secretion. Notably, these mice also demonstrated elevated ERK signaling in IEC and exhibited resistance against both chemical- and Citrobacter rodentium-induced . In contrast, mice with IEC-specific Shp-2 deletion displayed reduced ERK signaling and rapidly developed chronic . Remarkably, expression of an activated form of Braf in Shp-2-deficient mice restored ERK activation, goblet cell production and prevented .

Mice at four different stages of colon cancer development were obtained, named AD1 (inflammation of the recovery), AD2 (mild dysplasia), AD3 (adenoma) and AD4 (adenocarcinoma), as well as negative control (no treatment). The expression of TTK was measured by real time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining in mouse colon tissues and 24 pairs of CRC specimens. The relationship between TTK and prognosis was analyzed in a set of CRC genome-wide gene expression microarray data that was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  The genome-wide microarray data from mouse AOM-DSS model indicated that the expression of TTK mRNA was gradually elevated during the development of colon cancer. The subsequent qPCR results showed that TTK mRNA levels in negative control, AD1, AD2, AD3 and AD4 groups were 1.05±0.42, 1.10±0.03, 1.38±0.15, 1.33±0.17 and 2.12±0.22, respectively. And TTK expression in AD2, AD3 and AD4 groups were significantly higher than that in negative control (<0.05). The protein expression of TTK showed by immunohistochemical staining had similar tendency as the results of TTK mRNA. Besides that, the TTK mRNA levels in tumor tissues (0.71±0.10) from 24 CRC patients were significantly higher than those in paired adjacent normal tissues (0.18±0.04; <0.001). The positive expression rate of TTK protein in 5 pairs of CRC clinical samples was 80.0%, and it was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues (30.8%, =0.014). Furthermore, according to a public transcriptomic data (GSE17536), the high levels of TTK were associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients.  Elevated expression of TTK is related to colonic carcinogenesis in both of mouse model and human CRC samples.

Anti-cytokine therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in IBD. Janus kinases (JAKs) are  kinases that bind different intracellular cytokine receptors, leading to phosphorylation of signal transducer and activation of transcription molecules implicated on targeted gene transcription. Four isoforms of JAKs have been described: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Oral JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have been developed as synergic anti-cytokine therapy in IBD, showing different selectivity towards JAK isoforms. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, has been recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC. With the aim of improving the benefit: risk ratio of this drug class, several second-generation subtype-selective JAKi are under development. However, whether selective inhibition of JAK isoforms is associated with an increased clinical efficacy and/or a better safety profile remains debatable. The aim of this review is to critically review the preclinical and clinical data for the differential selectivity of JAK inhibitors and to summarise the potential clinical implications of the selective JAK inhibitors under development for UC and CD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Body weight of mice was measured regularly and colonoscopy was done at the end of the experiments. Mice were sacrificed afterwards and colon specimens were obtained for H&amp;E staining. For analysis of wound healing, mechanical wounds were introduced during endoscopy and wound closure assessed by daily colonoscopy.Although colonoscopy and weight development suggested changes in  severity, the lack of any influence of PTPN2 deficiency on histological scoring for inflammation severity after acute or chronic DSS  indicates that  severity is not influenced by epithelial-specific loss of PTPN2. Chronic  induced the development of aberrant crypt foci more frequently in PTPN2xVilCre mice compared to their wild type littermates. On the other hand, loss of PTPN2-induced enhanced epithelial cell proliferation and promoted wound closure.Loss of PTPN2 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) has no significant influence on inflammation in DSS . Obviously, loss of PTPN2 in IECs can be compensated in vivo, thereby suppressing a phenotype. This lack of a -phenotype might be due to enhanced epithelial cell proliferation and subsequent increased wound-healing capacity of the epithelial layer.© 2016 S.

Recent studies indicate that chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) plays a key role in metabolic deterioration in the obese population. Previously, we reported that Jak3 was essential for mucosal differentiation and enhanced colonic barrier functions and its loss in mice resulted in basal CLGI and predisposition to DSS induced . Since CLGI is associated with diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, present studies determined the role of Jak3 in development of such conditions. Our data show that loss of Jak3 resulted in increased body weight, basal systemic CLGI, compromised glycemic homeostasis, hyperinsulinemia, and early symptoms of liver steatosis. Lack of Jak3 also resulted in exaggerated symptoms of metabolic syndrome by western high-fat diet. Mechanistically, Jak3 was essential for reduced expression and activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in murine intestinal mucosa and human intestinal epithelial cells where Jak3 interacted with and activated p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3K, through  phosphorylation of adapter protein insulin receptor substrate (IRS1). These interactions resulted in activation of PI3K-Akt axis, which was essential for reduced TLR expression and TLR associated NFκB activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential role of Jak3 in promoting mucosal tolerance through suppressed expression and limiting activation of TLRs thereby preventing intestinal and systemic CLGI and associated obesity and MetS.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030277>The Wnt5a-Ror2 axis promotes the signaling circuit between interleukin-12 and interferon-γ in .</a></h2><p>Wnt5a, which regulates various cellular functions in Wnt signaling, is involved in inflammatory responses, however the mechanism is not well understood.

ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC) colon tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino acid composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, arachidonic, and linoleic acid. In the same way, differences in the amino acid composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, , methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino acid fragments.

An additional 3 patients who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV)  while on dasatinib therapy were identified and studied. Dasatinib  may have an immune-mediated mechanism similar to GVHD, and dasatinib use may be associated with CMV . Awareness of this association is important for avoiding unnecessary intensification of immunosuppression for suspected gut GVHD.Copyright © 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Flavonoids have demonstrated radical-scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of BJe in mice subjected to experimental . was induced in mice by intracolonic instillation of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS). BJe was administered daily orally (at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg).Four days after DNBS administration, colon nuclear factor NF-κB translocation and MAP kinase phospho-JNK activation were increased as well as cytokine production such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β. Neutrophil infiltration, by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, in the mucosa was associated with up-regulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and P-selectin). Immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine and poly ADP-ribose (PAR) also showed an intense staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with BJe decreased the appearance of diarrhea and body weight loss. This was associated with a reduction in colonic MPO activity. BJe reduced nuclear NF-κB translocation, p-JNK activation, the pro-inflammatory cytokines release, the appearance of nitrotyrosine and PAR in the colon and reduced the up-regulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. In addition, colon inflammation was also associated with apoptotic damage. Treatment with BJe caused a decrease of pro-apoptotic Bax expression and an increase of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression.The results of this study suggested that administration of BJe induced, partly specified, anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which potentially may be beneficial for the treatment of IBD in humans.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

A meta-analysis was conducted using 23 comparative studies with a total of 16,719 patients and 17,783 controls. The meta-analysis showed an association between the A allele of the PTPN22 G788A polymorphism and decreased risk of autoimmune diseases in all subjects (p &lt; 0.001). Analysis after stratification by ethnicity indicated that the PTPN22 788A allele was significantly associated with autoimmune diseases in Europeans (p &lt; 0.001) but not in Latin Americans. Meta-analysis by autoimmune disease type showed a significant negative association between the PTPN22 788A allele and systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (p = 001), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (p = 0.008), ulcerative  (UC) (p = 0.016), but not Crohn's disease (CD). A single study for each showed no association between the PTPN22 788A allele and systemic sclerosis, giant cell arteritis, Henoch-schonlein purpura, uveitis, and Grave's disease. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the PTPN22 G788A polymorphism confers protection against SLE, RA, and UC, supporting evidence of association of the PTPN22 gene with a subgroup of autoimmune diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30877063>Properties of FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Because mutations, overexpression, and dysregulation of protein kinases play essential roles in the pathogenesis of many illnesses, this enzyme family has become one of the most important drug targets in the past 20 years. The US FDA has approved 48 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of netarsudil (which is given as an eye drop) and temsirolimus (which is given intravenously). Of the 48 approved drugs, the majority (25) target receptor protein- kinases, ten target non-receptor protein- kinases, and 13 target protein-serine/threonine protein kinases. The data indicate that 43 of these drugs are used in the treatment of malignancies (36 against solid tumors including lymphomas and seven against non-solid tumors, e.g., leukemias). Seven drugs are used in the treatment of non-malignancies: baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; netarsudil, glaucoma; tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative . Moreover, ibrutinib and sirolimus are used for the treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. The most common drug targets include ALK, B-Raf, BCR-Abl, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Most of the small molecule inhibitors (45) interact directly with the protein kinase domain. In contrast, sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are larger molecules (MW ≈ 1000) that bind to FKBP-12 to generate a complex that inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). This review presents the available drug-enzyme X-ray crystal structures for 27 of the approved drugs as well as the chemical structures and physicochemical properties of all of the FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase antagonists. Six of the drugs bind covalently and irreversibly to their target. Twenty of the 48 drugs have molecular weights greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular weight of drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib). Nearly half of the antagonists (23) have a lipophilic efficiency with values of less than five while the recommended optima range from 5-10. One of the vexing problems is the near universal development of resistance that is associated with the use of small molecule protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We have recently demonstrated that mice with an intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of SHP-2 (SHP-2(IEC-KO) ) develop severe  1 month after birth. However, the mechanisms by which SHP-2 deletion induces colonic inflammation remain to be elucidated. We generated SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice lacking Myd88 exclusively in the intestinal epithelium. The colonic phenotype was histologically analyzed and cell differentiation was determined by electron microscopy and lysozyme or Alcian blue staining. Microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Results show that innate defense genes including those specific to Paneth cells were strongly up-regulated in SHP-2-deficient colons. Expansion of intermediate cells (common progenitors of the Goblet and Paneth cell lineages) was found in the colon of SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice whereas Goblet cell number was clearly diminished. These alterations in Goblet/intermediate cell ratio were noticed 2 weeks after birth, before the onset of inflammation and were associated with significant alterations in microbiota composition. Indeed, an increase in Enterobacteriaceae and a decrease in Firmicutes were observed in the colon of these mice, indicating that dysbiosis also occurred prior to inflammation. Importantly, loss of epithelial Myd88 expression inhibited  development in SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice, rescued Goblet/intermediate cell ratio, and prevented NFκB hyperactivation and inflammation. These data indicate that SHP-2 is functionally important for the maintenance of appropriate barrier function and host-microbiota homeostasis in the large intestine. J. Cell.

These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced  in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced  while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS : it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27854102>The Next Generation of Targeted Molecules for the Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.</a></h2><p>With the recent approval of several new targeted therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), there are now multiple options for its treatment. Inhibitors of Bruton  kinase (with ibrutinib being the first-in-class US Food and Drug Administration-approved agent) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (with idelalisib as the first-in-class approved agent) are promising because they are generally well tolerated and highly effective against this malignancy. These agents may be particularly important in the treatment of older patients who are less able to tolerate the myelosuppression (and subsequent infections) associated with chemoimmunotherapy. As a class of medications, B-cell receptor inhibitors have some unique side effects, including redistribution lymphocytosis. Toxicities associated specifically with ibrutinib include increased risk for bleeding and atrial fibrillation. Idelalisib also has some unique toxicities: transaminitis, , and pneumonitis. Targeted therapies recently approved for use in CLL include the novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies obinutuzumab and ofatumumab, and the B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor venetoclax. This article describes the clinical data that led to approval of these B-cell receptor inhibitors for the treatment of CLL, and highlights newer agents in clinical development that target the same kinases as the currently available therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26829767>SHARPIN controls regulatory T cells by negatively modulating the T cell antigen receptor complex.</a></h2><p>SHARPIN forms a linear-ubiquitin-chain-assembly complex that promotes signaling via the transcription factor NF-κB. SHARPIN deficiency leads to progressive multi-organ inflammation and immune system malfunction, but how SHARPIN regulates T cell responses is unclear. Here we found that SHARPIN deficiency resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of and defective function of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). Transfer of SHARPIN-sufficient Treg cells into SHARPIN-deficient mice considerably alleviated their systemic inflammation. SHARPIN-deficient T cells displayed enhanced proximal signaling via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) without an effect on the activation of NF-κB. SHARPIN conjugated with Lys63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin chains, which led to inhibition of the association of TCRζ with the signaling kinase Zap70; this affected the generation of Treg cells. Our study therefore identifies a role for SHARPIN in TCR signaling whereby it maintains immunological homeostasis and tolerance by regulating Treg cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372858>Exploration of the therapeutic aspects of Lck: A kinase target in inflammatory mediated pathological conditions.</a></h2><p>Lck, a non-receptor src family kinase, plays a vital role in various cellular processes such as cell cycle control, cell adhesion, motility, proliferation and differentiation. As a 56 KDa protein, Lck phosphorylates  residues of various proteins such as ZAP-70, ITK and protein kinase C. The structure of Lck is comprised of three domains, one SH3 in tandem with a SH2 domain at the amino terminal and the kinase domain at the carboxy terminal. Physiologically, Lck is involved in the development, function and differentiation of T-cells. Additionally, Lck regulates neurite outgrowth and maintains long-term synaptic plasticity in neurons. Given a major role of Lck in cytokine production and T cell signaling, alteration in expression and activity of Lck may result in various diseased conditions like cancer, asthma, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative , atherosclerosis etc. This article provides evidence and information establishing Lck as one of the therapeutic targets in various inflammation mediated pathophysiological conditions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Despite progress in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] drug development, not more than one-third of patients achieve steroid-free remission and mucosal healing with current therapies. Furthermore, patient stratification tools for therapy selection are lacking. We aimed to identify and quantify epithelial ER stress in a patient-specific manner in an attempt towards personalised therapy.A biopsy-derived intestinal epithelial cell culture system was developed and characterised. ER stress was induced by thapsigargin and quantified with a BiP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] of cell lysates from 35 patients with known genotypes, who were grouped based on the number of IBD-associated ER stress and autophagy risk alleles.The epithelial character of the cells was confirmed by E-cadherin, ZO-1, and MUC2 staining and CK-18, CK-20, and LGR5 gene expression. Patients with three risk alleles had higher median epithelial BiP-induction [vs untreated] levels compared with patients with one or two risk alleles [p = 0.026 and 0.043, respectively]. When autophagy risk alleles were included and patients were stratified in genetic risk quartiles, patients in Q2, Q3, and Q4 had significantly higher ER stress [BiP] when compared with Q1 [p = 0.034, 0.040, and 0.034, respectively].We developed and validated an ex vivo intestinal epithelial cell culture system and showed that patients with more ER stress and autophagy risk alleles have augmented epithelial ER stress responses. We thus presented a personalised approach whereby patient-specific defects can be identified, which in turn could help in selecting tailored therapies.Copyright © 2017 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Identification of novel, noninvasive, diagnostic biomarkers remains a priority. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of fecal amino acid composition as diagnostic biomarker for pediatric IBD.In this case-control study, treatment-naïve, de novo pediatric patients with IBD from two tertiary centers were included. Endoscopic severity of ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) was based on physician global assessment scores, substantiated by levels of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein at study inclusion. Patients were instructed to collect a fecal sample prior to bowel cleansing. Healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from primary schools in the same region. Dedicated amino acid analysis was performed on all samples.Significant differences between 30 IBD patients (15 UC, 15 CD) and 15 age and sex-matched HCs were found in six amino acids (histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, , and valine; all area under the curve >0.75 and P < 0.005), displaying higher levels in IBD. When distributing the patients according to type of IBD, a similar spectrum of amino acids differed between UC and HC (histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, and serine), whereas three amino acids were different between CD and HC (histidine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine).Significantly increased levels of six different fecal amino acids were found in patients with IBD compared to controls.

Leukocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO) produces the two-electron oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), damaging tissue and playing a role in cellular recruitment, thereby exacerbating gut injury. We tested whether the MPO-inhibitor, 4-Methoxy-TEMPO (MetT), ameliorates experimental IBD.  was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 3% w/v dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS) in drinking water ad libitum over 9-days with MetT (15 mg/kg; via i. p. injection) or vehicle control (10% v/v DMSO+90% v/v phosphate buffered saline) administered twice daily during DSS challenge. MetT attenuated body-weight loss (50%, p < 0.05, n = 6), improved clinical score (53%, p < 0.05, n = 6) and inhibited serum lipid peroxidation. Histopathological damage decreased markedly in MetT-treated mice, as judged by maintenance of crypt integrity, goblet cell density and decreased cellular infiltrate. Colonic Ly6C, MPO-labelled cells and 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr) decreased in MetT-treated mice, although biomarkers for nitrosative stress (3-nitro--; 3-NO-Tyr) and low-molecular weight thiol damage (assessed as glutathione sulfonamide; GSA) were unchanged. Interestingly, MetT did not significantly impact colonic IL-10 and IL-6 levels, suggesting a non-immunomodulatory pathway. Overall, MetT ameliorated the severity of experimental IBD, likely via a mechanism involving the modulation of MPO-mediated damage.Copyright © 2019.

Chronic or recurrent inflammation is generally regarded to be a necessary precondition for the initiation of intestinal fibrosis. In this view, fibrosis is a pathologically augmented healing response to inflammation-induced mucosal tissue destruction and injury. At present, there are no approved or effective medical therapies aimed specifically at fibrosis or stricture in IBD. Indirect benefits may occur from anti-inflammatory therapies, although there is no consensus on this. Therapy for fibrosis is complicated by the fact that a wound-healing response is essential in CD and ulcerative . Several pharmaceutical companies are now working on the therapy of fibrosis in other diseases. Strategies interfering with TGF-β expression and activation are promising. Pirfenidone has been studied in several clinical trials. Further therapeutic options are second-generation and wide-spectrum  kinase inhibitors. These inhibit growth factor receptor signaling, thus reducing fibrosis in animal models and some patients with tumor-associated fibrosis. At present, the development of antifibrotic therapies takes place in other diseases such as lung and liver fibrosis. This is partially due to a lack of experimental models for gut fibrosis and the fact that reliable readouts (MRI, serum markers) in patients are lacking. It will be important to test the above-mentioned newly available treatment strategies in IBD to profit from progress in other fibrotic diseases.© 2014 S.

We aimed to assess whether trebananib, a peptibody that inhibits binding of angiopoietin 1 and 2 to Tie2, improved progression-free survival when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel as first-line therapy in advanced epithelial ovarian, primary fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer in a phase 3 clinical trial.TRINOVA-3, a multicentre, multinational, phase 3, double-blind study, was done at 206 investigational sites (hospitals and cancer centres) in 14 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with biopsy-confirmed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III to IV epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers, and an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using a permuted block method (block size of six patients) to receive six cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m) and carboplatin (area under the serum concentration-time curve 5 or 6) every 3 weeks, plus weekly intravenous trebananib 15 mg/kg or placebo. Maintenance therapy with trebananib or placebo continued for up to 18 additional months. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigators, in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and is complete.Between Jan 30, 2012, and Feb 25, 2014, 1164 patients were screened and 1015 eligible patients were randomly allocated to treatment (678 to trebananib and 337 to placebo). After a median follow-up of 27·4 months (IQR 17·7-34·2), 626 patients had progression-free survival events (405 [60%] of 678 in the trebananib group and 221 [66%] of 337 in the placebo group). Median progression-free survival did not differ between the trebananib group (15·9 months [15·0-17·6]) and the placebo group (15·0 months [12·6-16·1]) groups (hazard ratio 0·93 [95% CI 0·79-1·09]; p=0·36). 512 (76%) of 675 patients in the trebananib group and 237 (71%) of 336 in the placebo group had grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events; of which the most common events were neutropenia (trebananib 238 [35%] vs placebo 126 [38%]) anaemia (76 [11%] vs 40 [12%]), and leucopenia (81 [12%] vs 35 [10%]). 269 (40%) patients in the trebananib group and 104 (31%) in the placebo group had serious adverse events. Two fatal adverse events in the trebananib group were considered related to trebananib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin (lung infection and neutropenic ); two were considered to be related to paclitaxel and carboplatin (general physical health deterioration and platelet count decreased). No treatment-related fatal adverse events occurred in the placebo group.Trebananib plus carboplatin and paclitaxel did not improve progression-free survival as first-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. The combination of trebananib plus carboplatin and paclitaxel did not produce new safety signals. These results show that trebananib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is minimally effective in this patient population.Amgen.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, we demonstrated in a preclinical model that rats subjected to neonatal colon inflammation show increased basal plasma norepinephrine (NE), which contributes to GHS through the upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) expression in the gastric fundus. We tested the hypothesis that neonatal colon inflammation increases anxiety-like behavior and sympathetic nervous system activity, which upregulates the expression of NGF to induce GHS in adult life. Chemical sympathectomy, but not adrenalectomy, suppressed the elevated NGF expression in the fundus muscularis externa and GHS. The measurement of heart rate variability showed a significant increase in the low frequency-to-high frequency ratio in GHS vs. the control rats. Stimulus-evoked release of NE from the fundus muscularis externa strips was significantly greater in GHS than in the control rats.  hydroxylase expression was increased in the celiac ganglia of the GHS vs. the control rats. We found an increase in trait but not stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in GHS rats in an elevated plus maze. We concluded that neonatal programming triggered by colon inflammation upregulates  hydroxylase in the celiac ganglia, which upregulates the release of NE in the gastric fundus muscularis externa. The increase of NE release from the sympathetic nerve terminals concentration dependently upregulates NGF, which proportionately increases the visceromotor response to gastric distention. Neonatal programming concurrently increases anxiety-like behavior in GHS rats.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25972152>Role of Dopamine and D2 Dopamine Receptor in the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>VEGF-induced vascular permeability and blood vessels remodeling are key features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. Dopamine through D2 receptor (D2R) inhibits VEGF/VPF-mediated vascular permeability and angiogenesis in tumor models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pathogenesis of IBD is characterized by the disturbance of dopaminergic system and D2R activity.IL-10 knockout (KO) mice and rats with iodoacetamide-induced ulcerative  (UC) were treated intragastrically with D2R agonists quinpirole (1 mg/100 g) or cabergoline (1 or 5 µg/100 g). Macroscopic, histologic, and clinical features of IBD, colonic vascular permeability, and angiogenesis were examined.Although colonic D2R protein increased, levels of  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter DAT decreased in both models of IBD. Treatment with quinpirole decreased the size of colonic lesions in rats with iodoacetamide-induced UC (p < 0.01) and reduced colon wet weight in IL-10 KO mice (p < 0.05). Quinpirole decreased colonic vascular permeability (p < 0.001) via downregulation of c-Src and Akt phosphorylation. Cabergoline (5 µg/100 g) reduced vascular permeability but did not affect angiogenesis and improved signs of iodoacetamide-induced UC in rats (p < 0.05).Treatment with D2R agonists decreased the severity of UC in two animal models, in part, by attenuation of enhanced vascular permeability and prevention of excessive vascular leakage.

Here, the anti-inflammatory regulation by intact guar gum (GG) was investigated using mice and human intestinal Caco-2 cells.Administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) increased myeloperoxidase activity and CXC motif chemokine ligand2 (an IL-8 homolog) expression in the small intestines of mice, while supplemental GG reduced these increases. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced IL-8 expression through nuclear factor kappa B p65, spleen  kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways. Pre-treatment of cells with GG reduced the TNF-α-induced IL-8 expression and cellular signaling. GG increased the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 expression in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that this is one of the probable mechanisms involved in GG-mediated anti-inflammatory regulation. The anti-inflammatory regulation and SOCS-1 expression induced by GG were sensitive to neutralization of toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and dectin-1, and to inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) and  kinase cSrc pathways. Finally, supplemental GG increased SOCS-1 expression in the small intestines of both DSS-administered and normal mice.Intact GG activates TLR2 and dectin-1, and increases SOCS-1 expression via JAK and cSrc pathways, resulting in anti-inflammatory regulation in intestinal epithelium.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Notwithstanding, TAM RTKs are also potent and indispensable inhibitors of inflammation. The combined deletion of Axl and Mertk in mice enhances chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, including increased inflammation in the gut and -associated cancer. On the other hand, deletion of Tyro3 increases the risk of allergic responses. Therefore, the indiscriminate inhibition of these TAM RTKs could result in undesirable immunological diseases. Here we show that AXL, but not MERTK or TYRO3 expression is enhanced in late stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and AXL expression associates with a cell migration gene signature. Silencing AXL or the inhibition of AXL kinase activity significantly inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion. These results indicate that the selective inhibition of AXL alone might confer sufficient therapeutic benefit in CRC, while preserving at least some of the beneficial, anti-inflammatory effects of MERTK and TYRO3 RTKs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552582>Interaction between hydrogen sulfide-induced sulfhydration and  nitration in the KATP channel complex.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is an endogenous gaseous mediator affecting many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Enhanced expression of H2S and reactive nitrogen/oxygen species (RNS/ROS) during inflammation alters cellular excitability via modulation of ion channel function. Sulfhydration of cysteine residues and  nitration are the posttranslational modifications induced by H₂S and RNS, respectively. The objective of this study was to define the interaction between  nitration and cysteine sulfhydration within the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel complex, a significant target in experimental . A modified biotin switch assay was performed to determine sulfhydration of the KATP channel subunits, Kir6.1, sulphonylurea 2B (SUR2B), and nitrotyrosine measured by immunoblot. NaHS (a donor of H₂S) significantly enhanced sulfhydration of SUR2B but not Kir6.1 subunit. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) (a donor of peroxynitrite) induced nitration of Kir6.1 subunit but not SUR2B. Pretreatment with NaHS reduced the nitration of Kir6.1 by SIN-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with the two subunits, as well as in enteric glia. Two specific mutations within SUR2B, C24S, and C1455S prevented sulfhydration by NaHS, and these mutations prevented NaHS-induced reduction in  nitration of Kir6.1. NaHS also reversed peroxynitrite-induced inhibition of smooth muscle contraction. These studies suggest that posttranslational modifications of the two subunits of the KATP channel interact to alter channel function. The studies described herein demonstrate a unique mechanism by which sulfhydration of one subunit modifies  nitration of another subunit within the same channel complex. This interaction provides a mechanistic insight on the protective effects of H₂S in inflammation.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637107>Malignant Melanoma of the Anus Found during Routine Colonoscopy in Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by recurrent or chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which results in increased risk of developing cancer. Anorectal malignant melanoma is often misdiagnosed as either hemorrhoids or benign anorectal conditions in inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the overall prognosis and survival of IBD are poor. To date, the best treatment strategy remains controversial. Only early diagnosis and complete excision yield survival benefit. Here, we report a 64-year-old woman with ulcerative , who was found to have anal malignant melanoma on routine colonoscopy. The lesion was confined to the mucosa with no distant metastasis. She underwent complete trans-anal excision. There was no recurrence at the four-year follow-up. Physicians should be aware of increased risk of cancer development in IBD patients and remember the importance of meticulous inspection of the anal canal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29487233>Phosphotyrosine-Mediated Regulation of Enterohemorrhagic  Virulence.</a></h2><p>Enteric pathogens with low infectious doses rely on the ability to orchestrate the expression of virulence and metabolism-associated genes in response to environmental cues for successful infection. Accordingly, the human pathogen enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) employs a complex multifaceted regulatory network to link the expression of type III secretion system (T3SS) components to nutrient availability. While phosphorylation of histidine and aspartate residues on two-component system response regulators is recognized as an integral part of bacterial signaling, the involvement of phosphotyrosine-mediated control is minimally explored in Gram-negative pathogens. Our recent phosphotyrosine profiling study of  identified 342 phosphorylated proteins, indicating that phosphotyrosine modifications in bacteria are more prevalent than previously anticipated. The present study demonstrates that  phosphorylation of a metabolite-responsive LacI/GalR family regulator, Cra, negatively affects T3SS expression under glycolytic conditions that are typical for the colonic lumen environment where production of the T3SS is unnecessary. Our data suggest that Cra phosphorylation affects T3SS expression by modulating the expression of , which encodes the major activator of EHEC virulence gene expression. Phosphorylation of the Cra Y47 residue diminishes DNA binding to fine-tune the expression of virulence-associated genes, including those of the locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island that encode the T3SS, and thereby negatively affects the formation of attaching and effacing lesions. Our data indicate that  phosphorylation provides an additional mechanism to control the DNA binding of Cra and other LacI/GalR family regulators, including LacI and PurR. This study describes an initial effort to unravel the role of global phosphotyrosine signaling in the control of EHEC virulence potential. Enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) causes outbreaks of hemorrhagic  and the potentially fatal hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Successful host colonization by EHEC relies on the ability to coordinate the expression of virulence factors in response to environmental cues. A complex network that integrates environmental signals at multiple regulatory levels tightly controls virulence gene expression. We demonstrate that EHEC utilizes a previously uncharacterized phosphotyrosine signaling pathway through Cra to fine-tune the expression of virulence-associated genes to effectively control T3SS production. This study demonstrates that  phosphorylation negatively affects the DNA-binding capacity of Cra, which affects the expression of genes related to virulence and metabolism. We demonstrate for the first time that phosphotyrosine-mediated control affects global transcription in EHEC. Our data provide insight into a hitherto unexplored regulatory level of the global network controlling EHEC virulence gene expression.Copyright © 2018 Robertson et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30250914>PTPN2 as a promoter of colon carcinoma via reduction of inflammasome activation.</a></h2><p>We have recently demonstrated that macrophage-specific loss of Protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) promotes inflammasome activation, resulting in protection from colorectal cancer.

A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse  models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate , and T-cell transfer  models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD.

Clinical trials in iNHL have evaluated idelalisib as monotherapy and as combination therapy with rituximab, bendamustine, and rituximab + bendamustine. When administered to heavily pretreated patients with R/R iNHL, idelalisib monotherapy or combination therapy showed durable antitumor activity accompanied by sustained or improved quality-of-life outcomes. Idelalisib has an acceptable safety profile; however, serious or fatal diarrhea/, hepatoxicity, pneumonitis, and intestinal perforation have occurred in treated patients. Selective inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ with idelalisib is a valuable addition to available treatment options for patients with iNHL, many of whom do not respond to or cannot tolerate chemoimmunotherapy.

However, cellular-intrinsic regulation of NF-κB activity during inflammatory diseases remains incompletely understood. Ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A, GdX) is a small adaptor protein involved in protein folding, biogenesis and transcription. Yet, whether GdX has a role during innate immune response is largely unknown.  To investigate the involvement of GdX in innate immunity, we challenged GdX-deficient mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing, real-time PCR, ELISA, luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, flow cytometry, and structure analyses. To investigate whether GdX functions in inflammatory bowel disease, we generated dendritic cell (DC), macrophage (Mφ), epithelial-cell specific GdX-deficient mice and induced  with dextran sulfate sodium.  GdX enhances DC and Mφ-mediated innate immune defenses by positively regulating NF-κB signaling. GdX-deficient mice were resistant to LPS-induced endotoxin shock and DSS-induced . DC- or Mφ- specific GdX-deficient mice displayed alleviated mucosal inflammation. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by GdX-deficient DCs and Mφ was reduced. Mechanistically, we found that -protein phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2, TC45) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) form a complex with RelA (p65) to mediate its dephosphorylation whereas GdX interrupts the TC45/PP2A/p65 complex formation and restrict p65 dephosphorylation by trapping TC45.

Inflammation score, microvessel density (MVD), and gene expression of VEGF, VEGFR, platelet-derived growth factor, PDGFR, Ang-2, and epidermal growth factor receptor was assessed.Inflammation and MVD were elevated in groups receiving DSS, but were similar between DSS-only and treatment cohorts. Unexpected weight loss was present in the gavaged groups versus DSS only. In treated groups, VEGFR was significantly decreased (P = 0.002) and VEGF gene expression trended down (P = 0.213) versus DSS only. Neither the platelet-derived growth factor/PDGFR pathway nor the alternative pathways, Ang-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, were significantly changed from DSS control in treatment cohorts.This study confirms the association between inflammation and MVD. Antiangiogenic receptor  kinase inhibitors suppressed the VEGF/VEGFR pathway but the expected decrease in colonic MVD did not follow, suggesting possible involvement of other angiogenic pathway(s).

A variant in protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is associated with reduced risk of developing IBD, but promotes the onset of autoimmune disorders. While the role of PTPN22 in modulating molecular pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis is well studied, its impact on shaping the intestinal microbiota has not been addressed in depth.

In order to understand how inflammation contributes to CRC development, the present study focused on SHP-2, a  phosphatase encoded by PTPN11 gene in which polymorphisms have been shown to be markers of  susceptibility. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11 gene (E76 residue) have been found in certain sporadic CRC. Results shown herein demonstrate that SHP-2 expression was markedly increased in sporadic human adenomas but not in advanced colorectal tumors. SHP-2 silencing inhibited proliferative, invasive and tumoral properties of both intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) transformed by oncogenic KRAS and of human CRC cells. IEC-specific expression of a SHP-2E76K activated mutant in mice was not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis but markedly promoted tumor growth under the ApcMin/+ background. Conversely, mice with a conditional deletion of SHP-2 in IECs developed -associated adenocarcinomas with age, associated with sustained activation of Wnt/β-catenin, NFκB and STAT3 signalings in the colonic mucosae. Moreover, SHP-2 epithelial deficiency considerably increased tumor load in ApcMin/+ mice, shifting tumor incidence toward the colon. Overall, these results reveal that SHP-2 can exert opposing functions in the large intestine: it can promote or inhibit tumorigenesis depending of the inflammatory context.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290648>Relation of the IGF/IGF1R system to autophagy in  and colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS), as a chronic inflammatory disorder has a potential role in the development of inflammatory and cancerous complications of the colonic tissue. The interaction of DNA damage and inflammation is affected by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. The IGF1R pathway has been reported to regulate autophagy, as well, but sometimes through a bidirectional context. Targeting the IGF1R-autophagy crosstalk could represent a promising strategy for the development of new antiinflammatory and anticancer therapies, and may help for subjects suffering from MetS who are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, therapeutic responses to targeted therapies are often shortlived, since a signaling crosstalk of IGF1R with other receptor  kinases or autophagy exists, leading to acquired cellular resistance to therapy. From a pharmacological point of view, it is attractive to speculate that synergistic beneﬁts could be achieved by inhibition of one of the key effectors of the IGF1R pathway, in parallel with the pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy machinery, but cautiousness is also required, because pharmacologic IGF1R modulation can initiate additional, sometimes unfavorable biologic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26969090>Adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib for high-risk, non-metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (ECOG-ACRIN E2805): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 trial.</a></h2><p>Renal-cell carcinoma is highly vascular, and proliferates primarily through dysregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. We tested sunitinib and sorafenib, two oral anti-angiogenic agents that are effective in advanced renal-cell carcinoma, in patients with resected local disease at high risk for recurrence.In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients at 226 study centres in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients had pathological stage high-grade T1b or greater with completely resected non-metastatic renal-cell carcinoma and adequate cardiac, renal, and hepatic function. Patients were stratified by recurrence risk, histology, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and surgical approach, and computerised double-blind randomisation was done centrally with permuted blocks. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 54 weeks of sunitinib 50 mg per day orally throughout the first 4 weeks of each 6 week cycle, sorafenib 400 mg twice per day orally throughout each cycle, or placebo. Placebo could be sunitinib placebo given continuously for 4 weeks of every 6 week cycle or sorafenib placebo given twice per day throughout the study. The primary objective was to compare disease-free survival between each experimental group and placebo in the intention-to-treat population. All treated patients with at least one follow-up assessment were included in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between April 24, 2006, and Sept 1, 2010, 1943 patients from the National Clinical Trials Network were randomly assigned to sunitinib (n=647), sorafenib (n=649), or placebo (n=647). Following high rates of toxicity-related discontinuation after 1323 patients had enrolled (treatment discontinued by 193 [44%] of 438 patients on sunitinib, 199 [45%] of 441 patients on sorafenib), the starting dose of each drug was reduced and then individually titrated up to the original full doses. On Oct 16, 2014, because of low conditional power for the primary endpoint, the ECOG-ACRIN Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended that blinded follow-up cease and the results be released. The primary analysis showed no significant differences in disease-free survival.

The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were hypertension (105 [17%] patients on sunitinib and 102 [16%] patients on sorafenib), hand-foot syndrome (94 [15%] patients on sunitinib and 208 [33%] patients on sorafenib), rash (15 [2%] patients on sunitinib and 95 [15%] patients on sorafenib), and fatigue 110 [18%] patients on sunitinib [corrected]. There were five deaths related to treatment or occurring within 30 days of the end of treatment; one patient receiving sorafenib died from infectious  while on treatment and four patients receiving sunitinib died, with one death due to each of neurological sequelae, sequelae of gastric perforation, pulmonary embolus, and disease progression. Revised dosing still resulted in high toxicity.Adjuvant treatment with the VEGF receptor  kinase inhibitors sorafenib or sunitinib showed no survival benefit relative to placebo in a definitive phase 3 study. Furthermore, substantial treatment discontinuation occurred because of excessive toxicity, despite dose reductions. These results provide a strong rationale against the use of these drugs for high-risk kidney cancer in the adjuvant setting and suggest that the biology of cancer recurrence might be independent of angiogenesis.US National Cancer Institute and ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, Pfizer, and Bayer.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These data indicate that normal intestinal development and homeostatic maintenance can occur in the presence of either FAK or Pyk2, but that both kinases are necessary for epithelial repair following injury. In contrast, mice lacking both FAK and Pyk2 develop spontaneous  with 100% penetrance by 4 weeks of age. Normal colonic phenotype and function are restored upon treatment of the double knockout mice with antibiotics, implicating commensal bacteria or bacterial products in the etiology of the spontaneous  exhibited by these mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560787>A role for interleukin 17A in IBD-related neuroplasticity.</a></h2><p>Changes to the structure and function of the innervation of the gut contribute to symptom generation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, delineation of the mechanisms of these effects has proven difficult. Previous work on sympathetic neurons identified interleukin (IL)-17A as a novel neurotrophic cytokine. Since IL-17A is involved in IBD pathogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that IL-17A contributes to neuroanatomical remodeling during IBD.Immunohistochemistry for  hydroxylase was used to identify sympathetic axons in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  and controls. Axon outgrowth from sympathetic neurons in response to incubation in cytokines or endoscopic patient biopsy supernatants was quantified.DSS-induced  led to an increase in  hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the inflamed colon but not the spleen. Colonic supernatants from mice with  and biopsy supernatants from Crohn's disease patients increased axon outgrowth from mouse sympathetic neurons compared to supernatants from uninflamed controls. An antibody that neutralized IL-17A blocked the ability of DSS-induced  and Crohn's disease supernatants to induce axon extension.These findings identify IL-17A as a potential mediator of neuroanatomical remodeling of the gut innervation during IBD.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26101224>The Presystemic Interplay between Gut Microbiota and Orally Administered Calycosin-7-O-β-D-Glucoside.</a></h2><p>Presystemic interactions with gut microbiota might play important roles in the holistic action of herbal medicines in their traditional oral applications. However, research interests usually focus on biologic activities of the in vivo available herb-derived components and their exposure in circulation. In this study, we illustrated the importance of studying the presystemic interplay with gut microbiota for understanding the holistic actions of medicinal herbs by using calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (C7G), the most abundant flavonoid and chemical marker in Astragali Radix, as a model compound. When C7G was orally administrated to rats, calycosin-3'-O-glucuronide (G2) was the major circulating component in the blood together with a minor calycosin but not C7G. Rat gut microbiota hydrolyzed C7G in vitro rapidly and produced its aglycone calycosin. Calycosin exhibited higher permeability than C7G and further underwent extensive glucuronidation to yield 3'-glucuronide as the dominant metabolite. Bioactivity assays revealed that G2 exhibited similar or more potent proangiogenic effects than calycosin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor II-induced blood vessel loss model in zebrafish. More interestingly, the incubation of C7G with gut microbiota from both normal and colitic rats showed a probiotics-like effect through stimulating the growth of the beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, C7G interacts reciprocally with gut microbiota after oral dosing, which makes it not only an angiogenic prodrug but also a modulator of gut microbiota.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27926694>Involvement of Activated Cdc42 Kinase1 in  and Colorectal Neoplasms.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Activated Cdc42 kinase1 (ACK1) is a non-receptor  kinase which is critical for cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Genomic amplification of ACK1 has been reported in multiple human cancers. We aimed to investigate ACK1 protein expression in colorectal mucosa with inflammation and neoplasm, and to evaluate its correlation with disease activity and severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 250 individuals who underwent total colonoscopy were collected randomly from January 2007 to May 2013 in Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, China. Colorectal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained by endoscopy from 78 patients with ulcerative  (UC), 22 with Crohn's disease (CD), 20 with infectious , 26 with non-IBD and noninfectious , 16 with sporadic adenomas, 4 with dysplasia-associated lesions or masses, 10 with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), 4 with UC-related CRC, 10 with hyperplastic polyps, and 60 without colonic abnormalities. ACK1 protein levels were determined immunohistochemically. The correlations of ACK1 expression with disease activity and severity were also evaluated. RESULTS Significantly increased ACK1 expression was observed in epithelial cells of colorectal mucosa with inflammation and dysplasia compared to controls (P<0.05). ACK1 expression correlated with clinical activity in IBD (χ²=4.57, P=0.033 for UC; χ²=5.68, P=0.017 for CD), as well as grade of dysplasia in preneoplastic lesions (P<0.05). No significant differences in ACK1 expression were found between UC and CD, or between IBD and non-IBD conditions (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS ACK1 protein is increased extensively in  and colorectal dysplasia. ACK1 overexpression may play a role in colorectal inflammation and neoplasms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26411766>Postranslational Modification of Ion Channels in Colonic Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Voltage-gated ion channels are key regulators of cell excitability.

Lots of genes have been identified resulting in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease. Any polymorphism leading to functional modifications in  kinase-2 may precipitate excessive immune response in the intestinal mucosa. The aim of our study is to investigate the involvement of  kinase-2 polymorphisms in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Turkish population.Four single nucleotide polymorphisms in  kinase-2 (rs280523, rs2304256, rs280519 and rs280496) were genotyped in 60 Crohn's disease, 151 ulcerative  patients and 89 unrelated healthy controls. These polymorphisms were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction.The presence of genotype (CC) in rs2304256 and (AA) in rs280519 were found to increase the susceptibility to ulcerative  (P=0.024, 0.025, respectively). rs2304256 (CA) and rs280519 (AG) have provided protection against ulcerative  (P=0.021, 0.012, respectively). rs280519 (AG) was protective against Crohn's disease (P=0.045). rs2304256 (CC) increased the susceptibility to inflammatory Crohn's disease (P=0.014). The presence of rs2304256 (A) increased the susceptibility to perianal Crohn's disease (P=0.03). Both rs280519 and rs2304256 polymorphisms were associated with the requirement of corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy in ulcerative .This study is the first demonstration of the single marker association of  kinase-2 polymorphisms with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease in Turkish population. They may be effective in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease in our population.

In this study, we investigated the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC since gankyrin is overexpressed in sporadic colorectal cancers. We analyzed gene expression of colon tissues obtained from 344 patients with IBD and CAC and found that expression of gankyrin was much higher in colonic mucosa of patients with refractory IBD than in those with IBD in remission. Expression of gankyrin was upregulated in inflammatory cells as well as tumor cells in colonic mucosa of patients with CAC. Over-expressing studies utilizing tagged ganlyrin-cDNA identified physical interaction between ganlyrin and Src homology 2-containing protein  phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). Importantly, the interaction between ganlyrin and SHP-1 leads to inhibition of STAT3 activation and to enhancement of TNF-α and IL-17 in inflammatory cells. To further address the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC, we created mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Vil-Cre;Gankyrinf/f) and deletion of gankyrin in myeloid and epithelial cells (Mx1-Cre;Gankyrinf/f). Gankyrin deficiency in myeloid cells, but not in epithelial cells, reduced the activity of mitogen activated protein kinase and the expression of stem cell markers, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. These findings provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CAC and suggest that gankyrin is a promising target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against CAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320600>Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 mediates trauma-induced intestinal injury and multi-organ failure.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated intestinal epithelial apoptosis initiates gut injury, alters the intestinal barrier, and can facilitate bacterial translocation leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, have been linked to intestinal apoptosis. Similarly, intestinal hyperpermeability and gut failure occur in critically ill patients, putting the gut at the center of SIRS pathology. Regulation of apoptosis and immune-modulatory functions have been ascribed to Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 (TNK1), whose activity is regulated merely by expression. We investigated the effect of TNK1 on intestinal integrity and its role in MODS. TNK1 expression induced crypt-specific apoptosis, leading to bacterial translocation, subsequent septic shock, and early death. Mechanistically, TNK1 expression in vivo resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of p65, and release of IL-6 and TNF-α. A TNF-α neutralizing antibody partially blocked development of intestinal damage. Conversely, gut-specific deletion of TNK1 protected the intestinal mucosa from experimental  and prevented cytokine release in the gut. Finally, TNK1 was found to be deregulated in the gut in murine and porcine trauma models and human inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, TNK1 might be a target during MODS to prevent damage in several organs, notably the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26783323>A novel human autoimmune syndrome caused by combined hypomorphic and activating mutations in ZAP-70.</a></h2><p>A brother and sister developed a previously undescribed constellation of autoimmune manifestations within their first year of life, with uncontrollable bullous pemphigoid, , and proteinuria. The boy had hemophilia due to a factor VIII autoantibody and nephrotic syndrome. Both children required allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which resolved their autoimmunity. The early onset, severity, and distinctive findings suggested a single gene disorder underlying the phenotype. Whole-exome sequencing performed on five family members revealed the affected siblings to be compound heterozygous for two unique missense mutations in the 70-kD T cell receptor ζ-chain associated protein (ZAP-70). Healthy relatives were heterozygous mutation carriers. Although pre-HCT patient T cells were not available, mutation effects were determined using transfected cell lines and peripheral blood from carriers and controls. Mutation R192W in the C-SH2 domain exhibited reduced binding to phosphorylated ζ-chain, whereas mutation R360P in the N lobe of the catalytic domain disrupted an autoinhibitory mechanism, producing a weakly hyperactive ZAP-70 protein. Although human ZAP-70 deficiency can have dysregulated T cells, and autoreactive mouse thymocytes with weak Zap-70 signaling can escape tolerance, our patients' combination of hypomorphic and activating mutations suggested a new disease mechanism and produced previously undescribed human ZAP-70-associated autoimmune disease.© 2016 Chan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25339668>Lyn deficiency leads to increased microbiota-dependent intestinal inflammation and susceptibility to enteric pathogens.</a></h2><p>The Lyn  kinase governs the development and function of various immune cells, and its dysregulation has been linked to malignancy and autoimmunity. Using models of chemically induced  and enteric infection, we show that Lyn plays a critical role in regulating the intestinal microbiota and inflammatory responses as well as protection from enteric pathogens. Lyn(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) , characterized by significant wasting, rectal bleeding, colonic pathology, and enhanced barrier permeability. Increased DSS susceptibility in Lyn(-/-) mice required the presence of T but not B cells and correlated with dysbiosis and increased IFN-γ(+) and/or IL-17(+) colonic T cells. This dysbiosis was characterized by an expansion of segmented filamentous bacteria, associated with altered intestinal production of IL-22 and IgA, and was transmissible to wild-type mice, resulting in increased susceptibility to DSS. Lyn deficiency also resulted in an inability to control infection by the enteric pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium. Lyn(-/-) mice exhibited profound cecal inflammation, bacterial dissemination, and morbidity following S. Typhimurium challenge and greater colonic inflammation throughout the course of C. rodentium infection. These results identify Lyn as a key regulator of the mucosal immune system, governing pathophysiology in multiple models of intestinal disease.Copyright © 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174704>New and Unexpected Biological Functions for the Src-Homology 2 Domain-Containing Phosphatase SHP-2 in the Gastrointestinal Tract.</a></h2><p>SHP-2 is a  phosphatase expressed in most embryonic and adult tissues. SHP-2 regulates many cellular functions including growth, differentiation, migration, and survival. Genetic and biochemical evidence show that SHP-2 is required for rat sarcoma viral oncogene/extracellular signal-regulated kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by most  kinase receptors, as well as by G-protein-coupled and cytokine receptors. In addition, SHP-2 can regulate the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, nuclear factor-κB, phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase/Akt, RhoA, Hippo, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. Emerging evidence has shown that SHP-2 dysfunction represents a key factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular in chronic inflammation and cancer. Variations within the gene locus encoding SHP-2 have been associated with increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative  and gastric atrophy. Furthermore, mice with conditional deletion of SHP-2 in intestinal epithelial cells rapidly develop severe . Similarly, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SHP-2 induces hepatic inflammation, resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and development of tumors in aged mice. However, the SHP-2 gene initially was suggested to be a proto-oncogene because activating mutations of this gene were found in pediatric leukemias and certain forms of liver and colon cancers. Moreover, SHP-2 expression is up-regulated in gastric and hepatocellular cancers. Notably, SHP-2 functions downstream of cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA), the major virulence factor of , and is associated with increased risks of gastric cancer. Further compounding this complexity, most recent findings suggest that SHP-2 also coordinates carbohydrate, lipid, and bile acid synthesis in the liver and pancreas.

Psychological stress has been postulated to affect the clinical symptoms and recurrence of IBD. The exact molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that psychological stress promotes neutrophil infiltration into colon tissues in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  model. The psychological stress resulted in abnormal expression of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22) and neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL2) and overactivation of the STAT3 inflammatory signaling pathway. Under chronic unpredictable stress, the adrenergic nervous system was markedly activated, as the expression of  hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, in bone marrow and colonic epithelium was enhanced, especially in the myenteric ganglia. The β-AR agonist isoproterenol mimicked the effects of psychological stress on neutrophilia, neutrophil infiltration, and colonic damage in DSS-induced . The β1-AR/β2-AR inhibitor propranolol reduced the numbers of the neutrophils in the circulation, suppressed neutrophil infiltration into colonic tissues, and attenuated the colonic tissue damage promoted by chronic stress. Propranolol also abolished stress-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil chemokines. Our data reveal a close linkage between the β1-AR/β2-AR activation and neutrophil trafficking and also suggest the critical roles of adrenergic nervous system in exacerbation of inflammation and damage of colonic tissues in experimental . The current study provides a new insight into the mechanisms underlying the association of psychological stress with excessive inflammatory response and pathophysiological consequences in IBD. The findings also suggest a potential application of neuroprotective agents to prevent relapsing immune activation in the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS  model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced  phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated -associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

The goal of the current study was to explore the effects of adelmidrol, an analog of the anti-inflammatory fatty acid amide signaling molecule palmitoylethanolamide, in mice subjected to experimental . Additionally, to clarify whether the protective action of adelmidrol is dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we investigated the effects of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, on adelmidrol action. Adelmidrol (10 mg/kg daily, o.s.) was tested in a murine experimental model of  induced by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, were significantly increased in colon tissues after dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid administration. Immunohistochemical staining for ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP)ribose showed a positive staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with adelmidrol decreased diarrhea, body weight loss, and myeloperoxidase activity. Adelmidrol treatment, moreover, reduced nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase expression; proinflammatory cytokine release; and the incidence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP)ribose in the colon. It also decreased the upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Adelmidrol treatment produced a reduction of Bax and an intensification of Bcl-2 expression. This study clearly demonstrates that adelmidrol exerts important anti-inflammatory effects that are partly dependent on PPARγ, suggesting that this molecule may represent a new pharmacologic approach for inflammatory bowel disease treatment.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27467733>Genotype-Phenotype Associations of the CD-Associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphism within the Gene Locus Encoding Protein  Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 22 in Patients of the Swiss IBD Cohort.</a></h2><p>Protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) plays an important role in immune cell function and intestinal homeostasis.

The clinical characteristics were analysed for an association with the presence of the PTPN22 SNP rs2476601 genotypes 'homozygous variant' (AA), 'heterozygous' (GA) and 'homozygous wild-type' (GG).13 patients (0.6%) were homozygous variant (AA) for the PTPN22 polymorphism, 269 (13.3%) heterozygous variant (GA) and 1'746 (86.1%) homozygous wild-type (GG). In CD, AA and GA genotypes were associated with less use of steroids and antibiotics, and reduced prevalence of vitamin D and calcium deficiency. In UC the AA and GA genotype was associated with increased use of azathioprine and anti-TNF antibodies, but significantly less patients with the PTPN22 variant featured malabsorption syndrome (p = 0.026).Our study for the first time addressed how presence of SNP rs2476601 within the PTPN22 gene affects clinical characteristics in IBD-patients.

For this, we used a rat model of experimental  and also collected samples from colons of IBD patients. Samples were taken from both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the same colon; the total RNA was isolated, and the mRNA and microRNA expressions were monitored. We have determined that AXL is highly induced in active-inflamed colon, which is accompanied with reduced expression of AXL-regulating microRNAs. In addition, the expression of genes responsible for inducing or maintaining mesenchymal phenotype, such as SNAI1, ZEB2, VIM, MMP9, and HIF1 were all significantly induced in the active-inflamed colon of IBD patients while the epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1) was downregulated.

The recombinant plasmids were then transfected into HEK293 cells. Affinity purification and LC-MS/MS were applied to identify the proteins interacting with S100A8 or S100A9. Bioinformatics analysis was used to seek the gene ontology of the interacting proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was applied to confirm the proteins interacted with S100A8 or S100A9.  Results: Fourteen proteins including pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM), nucleophosmin (NPM1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), which potentially interacted with S100A8, were successfully identified by Flag-tag affinity purification followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Six proteins, such as  3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon (14-3-3ε) and PKM, which potentially interacted with S100A9, were successfully identified. Gene ontology analysis of the identified proteins suggested that proteins interacted with S100A8 or S100A9 were involved in several biological pathways, including canonical glycolysis, positive regulation of NF-κB transcription factor activity, negative regulation of apoptotic process, cell-cell adhesion, etc. Co-IP experiment confirmed that PKM2 can interact with both S100A8 and S100A9, and 14-3-3ε can interact with S100A8.  Conclusion: PKM2 is identified to interact with both S100A8 and S100A9, while 14-3-3ε can interact with S100A9.

Recent studies show that development of UC correlates with the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here, we investigated whether VEGFR1-TK signaling induces healing of UC via accumulation of Tregs or not.Acute  was induced in C57/Bl6N (wild-type [WT]) and VEGFR1 T K knockout (VEGFR1 T K) mice by administration of 2.0% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).Total colon length in VEGFR1 T K mice was shorter than that in WT mice. The ulcer length and the disease activity index (DAI) score were significantly higher in VEGFR1 T K mice than in WT mice, whereas CD31 mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower. Accumulation of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) VEGFR1 Tregs was lower in VEGFR1 T K mice, as was expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. The survival rate of WT mice treated with an anti-folate receptor 4 (FR4) antibody was 40%, while that of WT mice treated with control IgG was 90%. Moreover, WT mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) showed significantly shorter colon length than WT with control antibody. In VEGFR1 T K, infiltration of Foxp3 Tregs expressing VEGFR1 and CXCR4 into ulcerated areas was lower than that in WT mice.VEGFR1-TK signaling plays a critical role in UC healing and angiogenesis via accumulation of VEGFR1CXCR4Foxp3 Tregs in ulcerated tissue.

Excessive inflammasome activation results in severe inflammatory conditions, but physiological IL-1β secretion is necessary for intestinal homeostasis. Here, we have described a mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation by  phosphorylation of NLRP3 at Tyr861. We demonstrated that protein  phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22), variants in which are associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, dephosphorylates NLRP3 upon inflammasome induction, allowing efficient NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL-1β release. In murine models, PTPN22 deficiency resulted in pronounced , increased NLRP3 phosphorylation, but reduced levels of mature IL-1β. Conversely, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that carried an autoimmunity-associated PTPN22 variant had increased IL-1β levels.

However, it remains unclear how mTOR regulates metabolic status to promote polarization of these cells. Here we show that an mTOR-Semaphorin 6D (Sema6D)-Peroxisome proliferator receptor γ (PPARγ) axis plays critical roles in macrophage polarization. Inhibition of mTOR or loss of Sema6D blocked anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization, concomitant with severe impairments in PPARγ expression, uptake of fatty acids, and lipid metabolic reprogramming. Macrophage expression of the receptor Plexin-A4 is responsible for Sema6D-mediated anti-inflammatory polarization. We found that a  kinase, c-Abl, which associates with the cytoplasmic region of Sema6D, is required for PPARγ expression. Furthermore, Sema6D is important for generation of intestinal resident CX3CR1 macrophages and prevents development of .

Defects in this defense system may lead to inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Downstream of  kinases 1 (Dok-1) and its closest homolog, Dok-2, are preferentially expressed in immune cells, and play essential roles in the negative regulation of multiple signaling pathways in both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the function of these proteins in intestinal homeostasis remained unclear. Here we show that Dok-1/-2 double knockout (DKO) mice were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  compared with Dok-1 or Dok-2 single KO and wild type (WT) mice. Furthermore, DSS-treated Dok-1/-2 DKO mice exhibited increased colonic tissue damage accompanied by reduced proliferation of the epithelial cells relative to WT controls, suggesting that Dok-1/-2 DKO mice have defects in the repair of intestinal epithelial lesions. In addition, the levels of the Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-22, which have protective roles in DSS-induced , were reduced in DSS-treated Dok-1/-2 DKO mice compared with WT mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Dok-1 and Dok-2 negatively regulate intestinal inflammation, apparently through the induction of IL-17A and IL-22 expression.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Under inflammatory conditions, we report that the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A is  phosphorylated (p-Y280) in association with loss of barrier function. While barely detectable Y280 phosphorylation was observed in confluent monolayers of human intestinal epithelial cells under basal conditions, exposure to cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL-22, or IL-17A, resulted in compromised barrier function in parallel with increased p-Y280. Phosphorylation was Src kinase dependent, and we identified Yes-1 and PTPN13 as a major kinase and phosphatase for p-JAM-A Y280, respectively. Moreover, cytokines IL-22 or IL-17A induced increased activity of Yes-1. Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 rescued cytokine-induced epithelial barrier defects and inhibited phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 in vitro. Phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 and increased permeability correlated with reduced JAM-A association with active Rap2. Finally, we observed increased phosphorylation of Y280 in colonic epithelium of individuals with ulcerative  and in mice with experimentally induced . These findings support a novel mechanism by which  phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 regulates epithelial barrier function during inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230865>ErbB4 signaling stimulates pro-inflammatory macrophage apoptosis and limits colonic inflammation.</a></h2><p>Efficient clearance of pro-inflammatory macrophages from tissues after resolution of a challenge is critical to prevent prolonged inflammation. Defects in clearance can contribute to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, and thus may be therapeutically targetable. However, the signaling pathways that induce termination of pro-inflammatory macrophages are incompletely defined. We tested whether the ErbB4 receptor  kinase, previously not known to have role in macrophage biology, is involved in this process. In vitro, pro-inflammatory activation of cultured murine and human macrophages induced ErbB4 expression; in contrast, other ErbB family members were not induced in pro-inflammatory cells, and other innate immune lineages (dendritic cells, neutrophils) did not express detectable ErbB4 levels. Treatment of activated pro-inflammatory macrophages with the ErbB4 ligand neuregulin-4 (NRG4) induced apoptosis. ErbB4 localized to the mitochondria in these cells. Apoptosis was accompanied by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and was dependent upon the proteases that generate the cleaved ErbB4 intracellular domain fragment, suggesting a requirement for this fragment and mitochondrial pathway apoptosis. In vivo, ErbB4 was highly expressed on pro-inflammatory macrophages but not neutrophils during experimental DSS  in C57Bl/6 mice. Active inflammation in this model suppressed NRG4 expression, which may allow for macrophage persistence and ongoing inflammation. Consistent with this notion, NRG4 levels rebounded during the recovery phase, and administration of exogenous NRG4 during  reduced colonic macrophage numbers and ameliorated inflammation. These data define a novel role for ErbB4 in macrophage apoptosis, and outline a mechanism of feedback inhibition that may promote resolution of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399411>Inhibition of Hematopoietic Cell Kinase Activity Suppresses Myeloid Cell-Mediated Colon Cancer Progression.</a></h2><p>Aberrant activation of the SRC family kinase hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) triggers hematological malignancies as a tumor cell-intrinsic oncogene. Here we find that high HCK levels correlate with reduced survival of colorectal cancer patients. Likewise, increased Hck activity in mice promotes the growth of endogenous colonic malignancies and of human colorectal cancer cell xenografts. Furthermore, tumor-associated macrophages of the corresponding tumors show a pronounced alternatively activated endotype, which occurs independently of mature lymphocytes or of Stat6-dependent Th2 cytokine signaling. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic reduction of Hck activity suppresses alternative activation of tumor-associated macrophages and the growth of colon cancer xenografts.

Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are critical in regulating these interactions. Multiple genetic loci are associated with IBD, but altered functions for most, including in the rs713875 MTMR3/HORMAD2/LIF/OSM region, are unknown. We identified a previously undefined role for myotubularin-related protein 3 (MTMR3) in amplifying PRR-induced cytokine secretion in human macrophages and defined MTMR3-initiated mechanisms contributing to this amplification. MTMR3 decreased PRR-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and autophagy levels, thereby increasing PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, autocrine IL-1β secretion, NFκB signaling, and, ultimately, overall cytokine secretion. This MTMR3-mediated regulation required the N-terminal pleckstrin homology-GRAM domain and Cys413 within the phosphatase domain of MTMR3. In MTMR3-deficient macrophages, reducing the enhanced autophagy or restoring NFκB signaling rescued PRR-induced cytokines. Macrophages from rs713875 CC IBD risk carriers demonstrated increased MTMR3 expression and, in turn, decreased PRR-induced PtdIns3P and autophagy and increased PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, signaling, and cytokine secretion. Thus, the rs713875 IBD risk polymorphism increases MTMR3 expression, which modulates PRR-induced outcomes, ultimately leading to enhanced PRR-induced cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479789>The phosphatase DUSP2 controls the activity of the transcription activator STAT3 and regulates TH17 differentiation.</a></h2><p>Deregulation of the TH17 subset of helper T cells is closely linked with immunological disorders and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which TH17 cells are regulated remains elusive. Here we found that the phosphatase DUSP2 (PAC1) negatively regulated the development of TH17 cells. DUSP2 was directly associated with the signal transducer and transcription activator STAT3 and attenuated its activity through dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 and Ser727. DUSP2-deficient mice exhibited severe susceptibility to experimental , with enhanced differentiation of TH17 cells and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In clinical patients with ulcerative , DUSP2 was downregulated by DNA methylation and was not induced during T cell activation.

Variations within the gene loci encoding protein  phosphatases (PTPs) have been associated with the onset of inflammatory bowel disease. PTPs modulate the activity of their substrates by dephosphorylation of  residues and are critical for the regulation of fundamental cellular signaling processes. Evidence emerges that expression levels of PTPN2, PTPN11, and PTPN22 are altered in actively inflamed intestinal tissue. PTPN2 seems to be critical for protecting intestinal epithelial barrier function, regulating innate and adaptive immune responses and finally for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. These observations have been confirmed in PTPN2 knockout mice in vivo. Those animals are clearly more susceptible to intestinal and systemic inflammation and feature alterations in innate and adaptive immune responses. PTPN22 controls inflammatory signaling in lymphocytes and mononuclear cells resulting in aberrant cytokine secretion pattern and autophagosome formation. PTPN22 deficiency in vivo results in more severe  demonstrating the relevance of PTPN22 for intestinal homeostasis in vivo. Of note, loss of PTPN22 promotes mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced cytokine secretion but limits secretion of nuclear factor κB-associated cytokines and autophagy in mononuclear cells. Loss of PTPN11 is also associated with increased  severity in vivo. In summary, dysfunction of those PTPs results in aberrant and uncontrolled immune responses that result in chronic inflammatory conditions. This way, it becomes more and more evident that dysfunction of PTPs displays an important factor in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation, in particular inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007730>Denitrase activity of  reduces the oxidized compound 3-nitrotyrosine in mice liver with .</a></h2><p>The oxidation of  to 3-nitrotyrosine is irreversible, and due to this characteristic, 3-nitrotyrosine is used as a marker for oxidative stress in a range of diverse chronic and degenerative diseases.

Using paired genetic and epigenetic data, we delineate methylation quantitative trait loci; VMP1/microRNA-21 methylation associates with two polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with a known IBD susceptibility variant. Separated cell data shows that IBD-associated hypermethylation within the TXK promoter region negatively correlates with gene expression in whole-blood and CD8 T cells, but not other cell types.

In these locations ILC respond to tissue perturbations by producing factors that promote tissue repair and improve barrier integrity. We show that mice lacking the Tec kinase ITK have impaired intestinal tissue integrity, and a reduced ability to restore homeostasis after tissue damage. This defect is associated with a substantial loss of Type 2 ILC (ILC2) in the intestinal lamina propria. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow ILC2 precursors confirms a cell-intrinsic role for ITK. Intestinal ILC2 numbers in Itk mice are restored by the administration of IL-2 complexes, also leading to improved intestinal tissue damage repair. Reduced Bcl-2 expression in intestinal Itk ILC2 is also restored to WT levels after IL-2 complex treatment, indicating a tissue-specific role for ITK in ILC2 survival in the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26628631>The role of B-cell receptor inhibitors in the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</a></h2><p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a malignancy of mature auto-reactive B cells. Genetic and functional studies implicate B-cell receptor signaling as a pivotal pathway in its pathogenesis. Full B-cell receptor activation requires tumor-microenvironment interactions in lymphoid tissues. Spleen  kinase, Bruton's  kinase, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) δ isoform are essential for B-cell receptor signal transduction but also mediate the effect of other pathways engaged in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in the tissue-microenvironment. Orally bioavailable inhibitors of spleen  kinase, Bruton's  kinase, or PI3Kδ, induce high rates of durable responses. Ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's  kinase, and idelalisib, a selective inhibitor of PI3Kδ, have obtained regulatory approval in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibrutinib and idelalisib are active in patients with high-risk features, achieving superior disease control in difficult-to-treat patients than prior best therapy, making them the preferred agents for chronic lymphocytic leukemia with TP53 aberrations and for patients resistant to chemoimmunotherapy. In randomized trials, both ibrutinib, versus ofatumumab, and idelalisib in combination with rituximab, versus placebo with rituximab improved survival in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Responses to B-cell receptor inhibitors are mostly partial, and within clinical trials treatment is continued until progression or occurrence of intolerable side effects. Ibrutinib and idelalisib are, overall, well tolerated; notable adverse events include increased bruising and incidence of atrial fibrillation on ibrutinib and , pneumonitis and transaminase elevations on idelalisib. Randomized trials investigate the role of B-cell receptor inhibitors in first-line therapy and the benefit of combinations.

PTPN22 is critically involved in controlling immune cell activation and thereby plays an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Although in B and T cells the mechanism showing how PTPN22 affects cell signalling pathways is well studied, its role in myeloid cells remains less defined. Regulation of the innate immune system plays an essential role in the intestine, and levels of PTPN22 in myeloid cells are drastically reduced in the intestine of inflammatory bowel disease patients.

TNF-α polymorphisms are mostly located in its promoter region and play a significant role in disease susceptibility and severity. We therefore sought to investigate TNFA -863C/A (rs1800630) polymorphism association with RA activity in our Pakistani study group.A total of 268 human subjects were enrolled. Among them, 134 were RA patients and 134 were controls. In this study the physical parameters of RA patients were collected, and the disease activity was measured by DAS28. The genotypes were determined following the allele-specific PCR along with the pre-requisite internal amplification controls. Subsequently, data were analyzed statistically for any significant association including χ/Fisher's exact test using GraphPad prism 6 software.We found that the TNF-α -863 C/A (rs1800630) variant was not differentially segregated between cases and controls in either genotype frequency, with χ of 2.771 and a -value of 0.2502, or allele frequency, with χ of 2.741 and a -value of 0.0978, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 0.7490 (0.5317-1.055).The lack of positive association of TNF-α -863(rs1800630) polymorphism in our study group implies that TNF-α -863 polymorphism is not a susceptible marker to RA and cannot serve as a genetic factor for screening RA patients in Pakistan. There might be other factors that may influence disease susceptibility. However, further investigations on additional larger and multi-regional population samples are required to determine the consequences of genetic variations for disease prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30504685>Nitric Oxide Is Involved in Activation of Toll-Like Receptor 4 Signaling through  Nitration of Src Homology Protein  Phosphatase 2 in Murine Dextran Sulfate-Induced .</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  is characterized by colonic mucosal bleeding and ulceration, often with repeated active and remission stages. One factor in ulcerative  development is increased susceptibility to commensal bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

In this study, we investigated whether NO enhances the development of  in mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and inflammation in cells treated with low-dose LPS. An NO donor, NOC18, induced  and increased CD14 protein and nitrotyrosine levels in colonic macrophages from mice treated with DSS for 7 d (molecular weight: 5000). In the mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line RAW264.7 stimulated with 3 ng/mL LPS, NO activated the CD14-TLR4-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) axis. Low-dose LPS stimulation did not change the levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation, CD14, inducible NO synthase, interleukin (IL)-6, or NF-κB. In addition, low-dose LPS increased phosphorylation of src homology protein  phosphatase 2 (SHP2), a negative regulator of STAT3 phosphorylation. However, NO decreased SHP2 phosphorylation and significantly activated the downstream signaling molecules. NO increased SHP2 nitration in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and DSS-treated mice. These results indicate that SHP2 nitration in macrophages might be involved in activation of the CD14-TLR4-NF-κB axis through STAT3 signaling in mice with DSS-induced .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259915>Severe acute  related to levodopa treatment.</a></h2><p>The first case of severe drug-induced gastrointestinal injury related to levodopa is described.

Each of these proteins contains a JAK homology pseudokinase (JH2) domain that regulates the adjacent protein kinase domain (JH1). JAK1/2 and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed whereas JAK3 is found predominantly in hematopoietic cells. The Janus kinase family is regulated by numerous cytokines including interleukins, interferons, and hormones such as erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and growth hormone. Ligand binding to cytokine and hormone receptors leads to the activation of associated Janus kinases, which then mediate the phosphorylation of the receptors. The SH2 domain of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) binds to the receptor phosphotyrosines thereby promoting STAT phosphorylation by the Janus kinases and consequent activation. STAT dimers are translocated to the nucleus where they participate in the regulation of the expression of thousands of proteins. JAK-STAT dysregulation results in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative , and Crohn disease. JAK-STAT dysregulation also plays a role in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and other myeloproliferative illnesses. An activating JAK2 V617F mutation occurs in 95% of people with polycythemia vera and in a lower percentage of people with other neoplasms. JAK1/3 signaling participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory afflictions while JAK1/2 signaling participates in the development of several malignancies including leukemias and lymphomas as well as myeloproliferative neoplasms. Tofacitinib is a pan-JAK inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ruxolitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we observed that azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate treatments induced increasingly severe colorectal mucosal inflammation and the intratumoural accumulation of CAFs. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 and FGF-3 were detected in infiltrating cells, and FGFR4, the specific receptor for FGF-1 and FGF-3, was detected in colon cancer tissues. The phosphorylation of FGFR4 enhanced the production of metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Mek)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), which was accompanied by excessive vessel generation and cell proliferation. Moreover, we separated CAFs, pericarcinoma fibroblasts (PFs), and normal fibroblasts (NFs) from human colon tissue specimens to characterize the function of CAFs. We observed that CAFs secrete more FGF-1/-3 than NFs and PFs and promote cancer cell growth and angiogenesis through the activation of FGFR4, which is followed by the activation of Mek/Erk and the modulation of MMP-7 expression. The administration of FGF-1/-3-neutralizing antibodies or the treatment of cells with FGFR4 siRNA or the FGFR4 inhibitor PD173074 markedly suppressed colon cancer cell proliferation and neovascularization. These observations suggest a crucial role for CAFs and FGF signaling in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer. The inhibition of the FGF signaling pathway may be a useful strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.© 2015 The Authors.

Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induces  in mice with symptoms similar to ulcerative . However, the mechanism of DSS-induced  is unknown. We investigated the mechanism of DSS-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions and barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro and mouse colon in vivo. DSS treatment resulted in disruption of tight junctions, adherens junctions and actin cytoskeleton leading to barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cell monolayers. DSS induced a rapid activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the inhibition or knockdown of JNK2 attenuated DSS-induced tight junction disruption and barrier dysfunction. In mice, DSS administration for 4 days caused redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins from the epithelial junctions, which was blocked by JNK inhibitor. In Caco-2 cell monolayers, DSS increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) by 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA/AM) or thapsigargin attenuated DSS-induced JNK activation, tight junction disruption and barrier dysfunction. Knockdown of apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (Ask1) or MKK7 blocked DSS-induced tight junction disruption and barrier dysfunction. DSS activated c-Src by a Ca2+ and JNK-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of Src kinase activity or knockdown of c-Src blocked DSS-induced tight junction disruption and barrier dysfunction. DSS increased  phosphorylation of occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), E-cadherin and β-catenin. SP600125 abrogated DSS-induced  phosphorylation of junctional proteins.

Src homology 2 domain-containing  phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is known to inhibit acute inflammation but its role in chronic inflammation-associated cancer remains unclear. The role of SHP2 in T cells in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  and azoxymethane-DSS-induced -associated carcinogenesis was examined using SHP2CD4-/- conditional knockout mice. SHP2 deficiency in T cells aggravated  with increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ and IL-17A. In contrast, the SHP2CD4-/- mice developed much fewer and smaller tumors than wild type mice with higher level of IFN-γ and enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells in the tumor and peritumoral areas. At the molecular level, STAT1 was hyper-phosphorylated in T cells lacking SHP2, which may account for the increased Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ secretion. IFN-γ neutralization or IFN-γ receptor knockout but not IL-17A neutralization, abrogated the anti-tumor effect of SHP2 knockout with lowered levels of perforin 1, FasL and granzyme B. Finally, the expression of granzyme B was negatively correlated with the malignancy of colon cancer in human patients. In conclusion, these findings suggest a new strategy to treat -associated cancer via targeting SHP2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710114>Circadian rhythm disruption impairs tissue homeostasis and exacerbates chronic inflammation in the intestine.</a></h2><p>Endogenous circadian clocks regulate 24-h rhythms of physiology and behavior.

Studies of CD4(+) T cells from Itk(-/-) and Itk(-/-)Rlk(-/-) mice have indicated differential roles of ITK and RLK in Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation and cytokine production. However, these findings are confounded by the complex T cell developmental defects in these mice.

In vitro Th polarization experiments indicate that PRN694 is a potent inhibitor of Th1 and Th17 differentiation and cytokine production. Using a T cell adoptive transfer model of , we find that in vivo administration of PRN694 markedly reduces disease progression, T cell infiltration into the intestinal lamina propria, and IFN-γ production by colitogenic CD4(+) T cells. Consistent with these findings, Th1 and Th17 cells differentiated in the presence of PRN694 show reduced P-selectin binding and impaired migration to CXCL11 and CCL20, respectively.

However, instead of displaying self-destruction phenotypes, Cd47(-/-) mice manifest no, or only mild, macrophage phagocytosis toward self-cells except under the nonobese diabetic background. Studying our recently established Sirpα-KO (Sirpα(-/-)) mice, as well as Cd47(-/-) mice, we reveal additional activation and inhibitory mechanisms besides the CD47-SIRPα axis dominantly controlling macrophage behavior. Sirpα(-/-) mice and Cd47(-/-) mice, although being normally healthy, develop severe anemia and splenomegaly under chronic , peritonitis, cytokine treatments, and CFA-/LPS-induced inflammation, owing to splenic macrophages phagocytizing self-red blood cells. Ex vivo phagocytosis assays confirmed general inactivity of macrophages from Sirpα(-/-) or Cd47(-/-) mice toward healthy self-cells, whereas they aggressively attack toward bacteria, zymosan, apoptotic, and immune complex-bound cells; however, treating these macrophages with IL-17, LPS, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα, but not IFNγ, dramatically initiates potent phagocytosis toward self-cells, for which only the Cd47-Sirpα interaction restrains. Even for macrophages from WT mice, phagocytosis toward Cd47(-/-) cells does not occur without phagocytic activation. Mechanistic studies suggest a PKC-Syk-mediated signaling pathway, to which IL-10 conversely inhibits, is required for activating macrophage self-targeting, followed by phagocytosis independent of calreticulin Moreover, we identified spleen red pulp to be one specific tissue that provides stimuli constantly activating macrophage phagocytosis albeit lacking in Cd47(-/-) or Sirpα(-/-) mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567680>TAM receptor-dependent regulation of SOCS3 and MAPKs contributes to proinflammatory cytokine downregulation following chronic NOD2 stimulation of human macrophages.</a></h2><p>Microbial-induced cytokine regulation is critical to intestinal immune homeostasis. Acute stimulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), the Crohn's disease-associated sensor of bacterial peptidoglycan, induces cytokines. However, cytokines are attenuated after chronic NOD2 and pattern recognition receptor stimulation of macrophages; similar attenuation is observed in intestinal macrophages. The role of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) receptors in regulating chronic pattern recognition receptor stimulation and NOD2-induced outcomes has not been examined. Moreover, TAM receptors have been relatively less investigated in human macrophages. Whereas TAM receptors did not downregulate acute NOD2-induced cytokines in primary human macrophages, they were essential for downregulating signaling and proinflammatory cytokine secretion after chronic NOD2 and TLR4 stimulation. Axl and Mer were similarly required in mice for cytokine downregulation after chronic NOD2 stimulation in vivo and in intestinal tissues. Consistently, TAM expression was increased in human intestinal myeloid-derived cells. Chronic NOD2 stimulation led to IL-10- and TGF-β-dependent TAM upregulation in human macrophages, which, in turn, upregulated suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression. Restoring suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression under TAM knockdown conditions restored chronic NOD2-mediated proinflammatory cytokine downregulation. In contrast to the upregulated proinflammatory cytokines, attenuated IL-10 secretion was maintained in TAM-deficient macrophages upon chronic NOD2 stimulation. The level of MAPK activation in TAM-deficient macrophages after chronic NOD2 stimulation was insufficient to upregulate IL-10 secretion; however, full restoration of MAPK activation under these conditions restored c-Fos, c-Jun, musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog K, and PU.1 binding to the IL-10 promoter and IL-10 secretion. Therefore, TAM receptors are critical for downregulating proinflammatory cytokines under the chronic NOD2 stimulation conditions observed in the intestinal environment.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026110>Repurposing Nilotinib for Cytomegalovirus Infection Prophylaxis after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Single-Arm, Phase II Trial.</a></h2><p>Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRa) is a critical receptor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) entry into cells, leading to subsequent infection.

In addition, the mutation rate for SHP2 is the highest for colorectal cancer (CRC) among solid tumors. The E76K GOF mutation is the most common and active SHP2 mutation; however, the pathogenic effects and function of this mutation in CRC tumor progression have not been well characterized. The Wnt/β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling pathway is crucial for CRC, and excessive activation of this pathway has been observed in several tumors. We used Ptpn11 conditional knock-in mice to study this GOF mutation in -associated CRC (CAC) and used the CRC cell lines HT29 and HCT116 to determine the relationship between SHP2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

In a murine  model, the helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri prevents  via induction of regulatory dendritic cells (DCs). The mechanism driving the development of these regulatory DCs is unexplored. There is decreased expression of the intracellular signaling pathway spleen  kinase (Syk) in intestinal DCs from H. polygyrus bakeri-infected mice. To explore the importance of this observation, it was shown that intestinal DCs from DC-specific Syk(-/-) mice were powerful inhibitors of murine , suggesting that loss of Syk was sufficient to convert these cells into their regulatory phenotype. DCs sense gut flora and damaged epithelium via expression of C-type lectin receptors, many of which signal through the Syk signaling pathway. It was observed that gut DCs express mRNA encoding for C-type lectin (CLEC) 7A, CLEC9A, CLEC12A, and CLEC4N. H. polygyrus bakeri infection downmodulated CLEC mRNA expression in these cells. Focusing on CLEC7A, which encodes for the dectin-1 receptor, flow analysis showed that H. polygyrus bakeri decreases dectin-1 expression on the intestinal DC subsets that drive Th1/Th17 development. DCs become unresponsive to the dectin-1 agonist curdlan and fail to phosphorylate Syk after agonist stimulation. Soluble worm products can block CLEC7A and Syk mRNA expression in gut DCs from uninfected mice after a brief in vitro exposure.

Many components in the IL-22-pSTAT3 pathway have been identified as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and some of them are considered as promising therapeutic targets. However, new perspectives are still needed to understand IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling for effective clinical interventions in IBD patients. Here, we revealed activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), recently identified to be upregulated in patients with active IBD, as a crucial player in the epithelial IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling cascade. We found ATF3 is central to intestinal homeostasis and provides protection during . Loss of ATF3 led to decreased crypt numbers, more shortened colon length, impaired ileal fucosylation at the steady state, and lethal disease activity during DSS-induced  which can be effectively ameliorated by rectal transplantation of wild-type colonic organoids. Epithelial stem cells and Paneth cells form a niche to orchestrate epithelial regeneration and host-microbe interactions, and IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling is a key guardian for this niche. We found ATF3 is critical for niche maintenance as ATF3 deficiency caused compromised stem cell growth and regeneration, as well as Paneth cell degeneration and loss of anti-microbial peptide (AMP)-producing granules, indicative of malfunction of Paneth/stem cell network. Mechanistically, we found IL-22 upregulates ATF3, which is required to relay IL-22 signaling leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent AMP induction. Intriguingly, ATF3 itself does not act on STAT3 directly, instead ATF3 regulates pSTAT3 by negatively targeting protein  phosphatases (PTPs) including SHP2 and PTP-Meg2. Furthermore, we identified ATF3 is also involved in IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in T cells and loss of ATF3 leads to reduced capacity of Th17 cells to produce their signature cytokine IL-22 and IL-17A.

PTPN22 was included since it's located in the same genetic region as MAGI3. Gene expression levels were investigated in relation to genotype, inflammatory status, phenotype, and medical treatment.The two strongest allelic associations were observed between IBD and SNPs in MAGI2 (rs6962966) and MAGI3 (rs1343126). Another MAGI3 SNP marker (rs6689879) contributed to increased ileal MAGI3 expression level in non-IBD controls. Furthermore, association between inflammation and decreased expression levels of MAGI3, PTEN, and TJP1 in colonic IBD as well as UC mucosa, and between inflammation and increased expression of PTPN22 in colonic IBD mucosa, was observed.Our findings lend support to a genetic basis for modulation of intestinal epithelial barrier in IBD, and we have identified MAGI3 as a new candidate gene for IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28690878>The Guanine-Nucleotide Exchange Factor Caldag Gefi Fine-Tunes Functional Properties of Regulatory T Cells.</a></h2><p>Using quantitative phosphopeptide sequencing of unstimulated versus stimulated primary murine Foxp3 regulatory and Foxp3 conventional T cells (Tregs and Tconv, respectively), we detected a novel and differentially regulated  phosphorylation site within the C1 domain of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor CalDAG GEFI. We hypothesized that the Treg-specific and activation-dependent reduced phosphorylation at Y523 allows binding of CalDAG GEFI to diacylglycerol, thereby impacting the formation of a Treg-specific immunological synapse. However, diacylglycerol binding assays of phosphomutant C1 domains of CalDAG GEFI could not confirm this hypothesis. Moreover, CalDAG GEFI mice displayed normal Treg numbers in thymus and secondary lymphoid organs, and CalDAG GEFI Tregs showed unaltered  suppressive capacity when compared to CalDAG GEFI Tregs. Interestingly, when tested , CalDAG GEFI Tregs displayed a slightly reduced suppressive ability in the transfer  model when compared to CalDAG GEFI Tregs. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9-generated CalDAG GEFI Jurkat T cell clones showed reduced adhesion to ICAM-1 and fibronectin when compared to CalDAG GEFI-competent Jurkat T cells. Therefore, we speculate that deficiency in CalDAG GEFI impairs adherence of Tregs to antigen-presenting cells, thereby impeding formation of a fully functional immunological synapse, which finally results in a reduced suppressive potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936146>T-Cell-Specific PTPN2 Deficiency in NOD Mice Accelerates the Development of Type 1 Diabetes and Autoimmune Comorbidities.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies have identified  as an important non-MHC gene for autoimmunity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce  expression have been linked with the development of various autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes. The  phosphatase PTPN2 attenuates T-cell receptor and cytokine signaling in T cells to maintain peripheral tolerance, but the extent to which PTPN2 deficiency in T cells might influence type 1 diabetes onset remains unclear. NOD mice develop spontaneous autoimmune type 1 diabetes similar to that seen in humans. In this study, T-cell PTPN2 deficiency in NOD mice markedly accelerated the onset and increased the incidence of type 1 diabetes as well as that of other disorders, including  and Sjögren syndrome. Although PTPN2 deficiency in CD8 T cells alone was able to drive the destruction of pancreatic β-cells and the onset of diabetes, T-cell-specific PTPN2 deficiency was also accompanied by increased CD4 T-helper type 1 differentiation and T-follicular-helper cell polarization and increased the abundance of B cells in pancreatic islets as seen in human type 1 diabetes. These findings causally link PTPN2 deficiency in T cells with the development of type 1 diabetes and associated autoimmune comorbidities.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130074>Enterohemorrhagic  Tir inhibits TAK1 activation and mediates immune evasion.</a></h2><p>Many pathogens infect hosts through various immune evasion strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms by which pathogen proteins modulate and evade the host immune response remain unclear. Enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) is a pathological strain that can induce mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (Erk, Jnk and p38 MAPK) and NF-κB pathway activation and proinflammatory cytokine production, which then causes diarrheal diseases such as hemorrhagic  and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is a key regulator involved in distinct innate immune signalling pathways. Here we report that EHEC translocated intimin receptor (Tir) protein inhibits the expression of EHEC-induced proinflammatory cytokines by interacting with the host  phosphatase SHP-1, which is dependent on the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor -based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). Mechanistically, the association of EHEC Tir with SHP-1 facilitated the recruitment of SHP-1 to TAK1 and inhibited TAK1 phosphorylation, which then negatively regulated K63-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 and downstream signal transduction. Taken together, these results suggest that EHEC Tir negatively regulates proinflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of TAK1, which is essential for immune evasion and could be a potential target for the treatment of bacterial infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28287113>Loss of T-cell protein  phosphatase in the intestinal epithelium promotes local inflammation by increasing colonic stem cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>T-cell protein  phosphatase (TC-PTP) has a critical role in the development of the immune system and has been identified as a negative regulator of inflammation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TC-PTP locus have been associated with increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in patients. To further understand how TC-PTP is related to IBDs, we investigated the role of TC-PTP in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier using an in vivo genetic approach. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of TC-PTP was achieved in a mouse model at steady state and in the context of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced . Knockout (KO) of TC-PTP in IECs did not result in an altered intestinal barrier. However, upon DSS treatment, IEC-specific TC-PTP KO mice displayed a more severe  phenotype with a corresponding increase in the immune response and inflammatory cytokine profile. The absence of TC-PTP caused an altered turnover of IECs, which is further explained by the role of the  phosphatase in colonic stem cell (CoSC) proliferation. Our results suggest a novel role for TC-PTP in regulating the homeostasis of CoSC proliferation. This supports the protective function of TC-PTP against IBDs, independently of its previously demonstrated role in intestinal immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194881>Experimental  in IL-10-deficient mice ameliorates in the absence of PTPN22.</a></h2><p>Interleukin (IL)-10 plays a key role in controlling intestinal inflammation. IL-10-deficient mice and patients with mutations in IL-10 or its receptor, IL-10R, show increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) controls immune cell activation and the equilibrium between regulatory and effector T cells, playing an important role in controlling immune homoeostasis of the gut. Here, we examined the role of PTPN22 in intestinal inflammation of IL-10-deficient (IL-10 ) mice. We crossed IL-10 mice with PTPN22 mice to generate PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice and induced  with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In line with previous reports, DSS-induced acute and chronic  was exacerbated in IL-10 mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. However, PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice developed milder disease compared to IL-10 mice. IL-17-promoting innate cytokines and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells were markedly increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but did not provide a protctive function. CXCL1/KC was also increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but therapeutic injection of CXCL1/KC in IL-10 mice did not ameliorate . These results show that PTPN22 promotes intestinal inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of PTPN22 might be beneficial in patients with IBD and mutations in IL-10 and IL-10R.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327403>Pharmacology, efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Orally bioavailable inhibitors of the  kinases (TYKs), also referred to as Janus kinases (JAKs), are being evaluated for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative  (UC), and other chronic inflammatory disorders. To date, three JAK inhibitors have been tested in patients with moderate-to-severe CD: tofacitinib (pan-JAK inhibitor), filgotinib (JAK1 inhibitor) and upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). Clinical development of tofacitinib was discontinued in CD because the primary endpoint of clinical remission in the phase II induction and maintenance trials was not met, although outcomes may have been influenced by trial design flaws and a high placebo rate was noted. In contrast, filgotinib did meet its primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 10 in the phase II FITZROY trial, in addition to several other clinically important secondary outcomes, spurring a subsequent larger phase III trial. Following promising results for upadacitinib in its phase II trial, larger phase III trials were also initiated to corroborate the efficacy results. Although JAK inhibitors appear to have an acceptable safety profile, higher rates of infections compared to placebo were noted. Overall, JAK inhibitors constitute a new promising class of drugs, given the efficacy signals observed in pivotal clinical trials in several chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we review the existing evidence on the pharmacology, safety and efficacy of JAK-STAT inhibitors that are currently under investigation for the treatment of patients with CD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism has remained obscure, but we demonstrate that IL-22 acts via  kinase 2 (Tyk2), a member of the Jak family. Using a mouse model for , we show that Tyk2 deficiency is associated with an altered composition of the gut microbiota and exacerbates inflammatory bowel disease. Colitic Tyk2(-/-) mice have less p-STAT3 in colon tissue and their IECs proliferate less efficiently. Tyk2-deficient primary IECs show reduced p-STAT3 in response to IL-22 stimulation, and expression of IL-22-STAT3 target genes is reduced in IECs from healthy and colitic Tyk2(-/-) mice. Experiments with conditional Tyk2(-/-) mice reveal that IEC-specific depletion of Tyk2 aggravates . Disease symptoms can be alleviated by administering high doses of rIL-22-Fc, indicating that Tyk2 deficiency can be rescued via the IL-22 receptor complex. The pivotal function of Tyk2 in IL-22-dependent  was confirmed in Citrobacter rodentium-induced disease. Thus, Tyk2 protects against acute  in part by amplifying inflammation-induced epithelial IL-22 signaling to STAT3.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27311871>Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive large B-cell lymphoma in a patient treated with azathioprine for ulcerative .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286804>New insights into the interplay between autophagy, gut microbiota and inflammatory responses in IBD.</a></h2><p>One of the most significant challenges of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research is to understand how alterations in the symbiotic relationship between the genetic composition of the host and the intestinal microbiota, under impact of specific environmental factors, lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using  and  models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria.

Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501515>Loss of PTPN22 abrogates the beneficial effect of cohousing-mediated fecal microbiota transfer in murine .</a></h2><p>Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is a very efficient approach for the treatment of severe and recurring C. difficile infections. However, the beneficial effect of FMT in other disorders such as ulcerative  (UC) or Crohn's disease remains unclear. Furthermore, it is currently unknown how disease-associated genetic variants in donors or recipients influence the effect of FMT. We found that bacteria-transfer from wild-type (WT) donors via cohousing was efficient in inducing recovery from  in WT mice, but not in mice deficient in protein- phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), a known risk gene for several chronic inflammatory diseases. Also cohousing of PTPN22-deficient mice with diseased WT mice failed to induce faster recovery.

Galectins, defined by shared consensus amino acid sequence and affinity for β-galactosides, are critical modulators of the inflammatory response. However, the relevance of the galectin network in the pathogenesis of human IBD has not yet been explored. Here, we analyzed the expression of relevant members of the galectin family in intestinal biopsies, and identified their contribution as novel mucosal markers in IBD. Colonic biopsies were obtained from 59 IBD patients (22 CD and 37 UC), 9 patients with gut rejection after transplantation, 8 adult celiac patients, and 32 non-IBD donors. Galectin mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and qPCR using specific primers for individual galectins. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to analyze galectin expression in individual intestinal samples. Expression of common mucosal-associated galectins (Gal-1, -3, -4, -9) is dysregulated in inflamed tissues of IBD patients compared with non-inflamed IBD or control samples. LDA discriminated between different inflammation grades in active IBD and showed that remission IBD samples were clusterized with control samples. Galectin profiling could not distinguish CD and UC. Furthermore, inflamed IBD was discriminated from inflamed tissue of rejected gut in transplanted patients and duodenum of celiac patients, which could not be distinguished from control duodenum samples. The integrative analysis of galectins discriminated IBD from other intestinal inflammatory conditions and could be used as potential mucosal biomarker.© 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26073142>Myenteric expression of nerve growth factor and the p75 neurotrophin receptor regulate axonal remodeling as a consequence of colonic inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Nerve growth factor (NGF) levels increase in response to inflammation of the mammalian colon. The precise cellular sources of colonic NGF synthesis, however, remain elusive. Using lines of transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the NGF promoter, we found a subpopulation of adendritic EGFP(+) neurons in the myenteric plexus. These colonic EGFP(+) neurons display positive immunostaining for calretinin but not nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) two biomarkers of mouse myenteric neurons. A loss of NGF expression in null mutant postnatal mice does not affect the survival of these EGFP(+) neurons. Induction of colonic inflammation confirms local increases in NGF mRNA/protein levels, which coincide with heightened detection of EGFP by myenteric neurons. Though NOS1(+) myenteric neurons display positive immunostaining for trkA (the receptor required for NGF binding/signaling), transgenic overexpression of NGF by smooth muscle cells in the colon does not alter the survival, somal size, or axonal density of trkA-expressing NOS1(+) myenteric neurons. Mice lacking functional p75NTR (the second receptor required for NGF binding) exhibit significantly less axonal damage among NOS1(+) myenteric neurons, in response to chemically induced colonic inflammation. Likewise, trkA-expressing sympathetic axons that innervate the myenteric ganglia display less damage in the absence of p75NTR. These data are the first to implicate calretinin(+) myenteric neurons as a source of NGF in the murine colon, and that in response to colonic inflammation, increases in NGF can exaggerate damage of intrinsic NOS1(+) axons and extrinsic sympathetic axons that co-express trkA and p75NTR.Copyright © 2015.

The IFN-producing capacity of pDCs is regulated by specific inhibitory receptors, yet none of the known receptors are conserved in evolution. We report that within the human immune system, receptor protein  phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) is expressed specifically on pDCs. Surface PTPRS was rapidly downregulated after pDC activation, and only PTPRS(-) pDCs produced IFN-α. Antibody-mediated PTPRS crosslinking inhibited pDC activation, whereas PTPRS knockdown enhanced IFN response in a pDC cell line. Similarly, murine Ptprs and the homologous receptor phosphatase Ptprf were specifically co-expressed in murine pDCs. Haplodeficiency or DC-specific deletion of Ptprs on Ptprf-deficient background were associated with enhanced IFN response of pDCs, leukocyte infiltration in the intestine and mild . Thus, PTPRS represents an evolutionarily conserved pDC-specific inhibitory receptor, and is required to prevent spontaneous IFN production and immune-mediated intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Increasing evidence has shown that sprouting of  hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-IR) fibers toward sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia maintains and exacerbates the neuropathic and inflammatory pain, as well as colonic inflammation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether electroacupuncture could alleviate the visceral and secondary somatic hyperalgesia in  rats by suppressing the TH-IR expression in related dorsal root ganglia. After trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid irritation, rats developed inflammatory tissue damage in the distal colon, which was accompanied by visceral hypersensitivity and secondary hind paw hyperalgesia, as indicated by enhanced visceromotor response to colorectal distension and decreased mechanical and thermal withdrawal latency of the hind paw. Additionally, excessive TH-IR fibers sprouted toward calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive sensory neurons, and TH-IR neurons also increased in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia of  rats. Both electroacupuncture and guanethidine attenuated visceral and referred hind paw hyperalgesia by inhibiting the over-expression of TH-IR neurons and fibers in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia. Moreover local inflammatory damage in the distal colon was restored after 7 days of electroacupuncture intervention. These results suggest that electroacupuncture relieved visceral and referred hind paw hypersensitivity in  rats by inhibiting TH expression in the sixth lumbar dorsal root ganglia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor α (PILRα), well conserved in almost all mammals, is an inhibitory receptor containing immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motifs in the cytoplasmic domain. PILRα is mainly expressed on myeloid cells and plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation. In the present study, we investigated the function of PILRα in inflammatory bowel disease using PILRα-deficient mice. When mice were orally administered dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), colonic mucosal injury and inflammation were significantly exacerbated in DSS-treated PILRα-deficient mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that neutrophil and macrophage cell numbers were higher in the colons of DSS-treated PILRα-deficient mice than in those of WT mice. Blockade of CXCR2 expressed on neutrophils using a CXCR2 inhibitor decreased the severity of  observed in PILRα-deficient mice. These results suggest that PILRα negatively regulates inflammatory  by regulating the infiltration of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2015.

CLRs play important roles in host defense against infection by fungi and bacteria by recognizing specific carbohydrate components of these pathogens. However, these immune receptors also make important contributions to immune homeostasis of mucosa and skin in mammals by recognizing components of microbiota, as well as by recognizing self-components such as alarmins from dead cells and noncanonical non-carbohydrate ligands. CLR deficiency not only induces hypersensitivity to infection, but also causes dysregulation of muco-cutaneous immune homeostasis, resulting in the development of allergy, inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumors. In this review, we introduce recent discoveries regarding the roles of myeloid CLRs in the immune system exposed to the environment, and discuss the roles of these lectin receptors in the development of , asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and cancer. Although some CLRs are suggested to be involved in the development of these diseases, the function of CLRs and their ligands still largely remain to be elucidated.©2019 The Authors.

Very little is known about the influence of gal-3 in inflammatory bowel disease. We, therefore, investigated the impact of gal-3 on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  in a mouse model.Colonic lamina propria fibroblasts of healthy controls were used for co-incubation studies of gal-3 with gal-1, TGF-β1, IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-10. Acute and chronic DSS  was induced by 3% DSS in drinking water in female Balb/c mice weighing 20-22 g. Recombinant gal-3 was expressed by the pET vector system and used for a 5-day treatment in different concentrations intraperitoneally. The distal third of the colon was used for histologic analysis. Colonic cytokine expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR.In vitro, gal-3 induced IL-8 secretion was significantly reduced by co-incubation with IL-10 (5 ng/ml) and IL-4 (10 ng/ml). Acute DSS-induced  was ameliorated by gal-3 treatment as indicated by increased colonic length and reduced weight loss compared to that of controls. In acute and chronic , gal-3 treatment resulted in a significant suppression of colonic IL-6.Gal-3 significantly reduces inflammation in acute and chronic DSS  in mice indicating a potential role in intestinal inflammation.© 2015 S.
