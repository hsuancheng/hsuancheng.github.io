However, specific changes in brain energetics in the early stages of AD are poorly known. The aim of this study was to investigate cerebral energy metabolism in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse prior to amyloid plaque formation. Acutely isolated cerebral cortical and hippocampal slices of 3-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 and wild-type control mice were incubated in media containing [U-C]glucose, [1,2-C] or [U-C]glutamine, and tissue extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The ATP synthesis rate of isolated whole-brain  was assessed by an on-line luciferin-luciferase assay. Significantly increased C labeling of intracellular lactate and alanine and decreased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity were observed from cerebral cortical slices of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice incubated in media containing [U-C]glucose. No changes in glial [1,2-C] metabolism were observed. Cerebral cortical slices from APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice exhibited a reduced capacity for uptake and oxidative metabolism of glutamine. Furthermore, the ATP synthesis rate tended to be decreased in isolated whole-brain  of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice. Thus, several cerebral metabolic changes are evident in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse prior to amyloid plaque deposition, including altered glucose metabolism, hampered glutamine processing and mitochondrial dysfunctions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608360>The 18-kDa Translocator Protein Inhibits Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 Expression via Inhibition of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species.</a></h2><p>Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein and is abundantly expressed in a variety of organ and tissues. To date, the functional role of TSPO on vascular endothelial cell activation has yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA, 250 nM), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), was used to induce vascular endothelial activation. Adenoviral TSPO overexpression (10-100 MOI) inhibited PMA-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in a dose dependent manner. PMA-induced VCAM-1 expressions were inhibited by Mito-TEMPO (0.1-0.5 μM), a specific mitochondrial antioxidants, and cyclosporin A (1-5 μM), a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, implying on an important role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the endothelial activation. Moreover, adenoviral TSPO overexpression inhibited mitochondrial ROS production and manganese superoxide dismutase expression. On contrasts, gene silencing of TSPO with siRNA increased PMA-induced VCAM-1 expression and mitochondrial ROS production. Midazolam (1-50 μM), TSPO ligands, inhibited PMA-induced VCAM-1 and mitochondrial ROS production in endothelial cells. These results suggest that mitochondrial TSPO can inhibit PMA-induced endothelial inflammation via suppression of VCAM-1 and mitochondrial ROS production in endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28506467>Apoptosis of bovine granulosa cells: Intracellular pathways and differentiation.</a></h2><p>Follicular atresia in granulosa and theca cells occurs by apoptosis through weak hormonal stimulation. We have previously proposed an in vitro model to study this process by inducing apoptosis in BGC-1, a bovine granulosa cell line, and in primary cultures from ovaries with or without corpus luteum (CPGB+ and CPGB-, respectively), with different doses of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs (leuprolide  (LA) as agonist and antide as antagonist). BGC-1 represent immature granulosa cells, whereas CPGB represent different degrees of luteinization. Our aim was to evaluate the intracellular pathways involved in the GnRH regulation of apoptosis in BGC-1. Treatment with LA 100nM but not with antide led to an increase in BAX over BCL-2 expression, showing antagonism of antide. All treatments inhibited phospholipase-D (PLD) activity compared to control, implying agonist behavior of antide. Progesterone in vitro production and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) expression revealed different degrees of luteinization: BGC-1 were immature, whereas CPGB+ were less differentiated than CPGB-. We concluded that LA-induced apoptosis in BGC-1 occurs by activation of the mitochondrial pathway and by inhibition of PLD activity and that antide might work both as an antagonist of the intrinsic pathway and as an agonist of the extrinsic protection pathway by inhibiting PLD activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was widely employed to treat osteoporosis and some epidemiological studies showed that HRT regimes including progesterone analogs such as medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) decreased risk of glial tumors. Tibolone is a unique progesterone analog employed in HRT with tissue specific estrogenic effects and stimulates gene expressions very similar to those induced by MPA. Tibolone's pro-estrogenic effects occur particularly in bone and brain and both MPA and tibolone inhibit AKR1C enzymes, which involve in temozolomide chemoresistance. Hence, we aimed to investigate interactions between MPA, tibolone and temozolomide in modification of glioma cell growth and fine structure.For our studies, we have particularly chosen C6 rat glioma cell line due to several reasons: i) We previously showed that MPA reduced growth and induced procarbazine-sensitization in C6 cells; ii) temozolomide has a triazene-type molecular structure like procarbazine; iii) other groups previously showed that C6 glioma cell line is more resistant to temozolomide than human glioma cells; hence it may provide a native model of chemoresistance. Monolayer plating efficacy, soft agar colony growth, 3D-spheroid S-phase (as determined by BrdU-labeling) and electron microscopical analyses were performed to assess mutual interactions between MPA, tibolone and temozolomide.MPA inhibited clonogenic growth of C6 glioma and this effect is augmented by both tibolone and temozolomide. MPA and tibolone inhibited DNA synthesis in C6 glioma spheroids to similar levels which can be achieved with temozolomide. Electron microscopical analyses revealed synergisms between MPA, tibolone and temozolomide involved mitochondrial proliferation, condensation, mitophagy and autophagy.MPA and tibolone shall be studied in further experimental models of glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the anti-cancer effect of this compound on human lung cancer cells has not yet been thoroughly elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AB23A on the cell viability and apoptosis in human lung cancer A549 and NCI-H292 cells. The results indicated that AB23A inhibited the growth of A549 and NCI-H292 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner, however, there was only weak cytotoxicity on normal bronchial epithelial cells. The induction of apoptosis by AB23A was demonstrated by DAPI and annexin-V-FITC/PI staining. Further investigation revealed that AB23A decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and up regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Meanwhile, the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activated caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP were observed. In addition, AB23A increased the release of cytochrome c from  and the translocation of apoptotic inducing factor (AIF) into nuclei. Taken together, these results indicated that AB23A induced apoptosis by activating the intrinsic pathway, and suggested that AB23A can be used as a potential modulating agent in lung cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We here study their structure-activity relationship upon human melanoma cells for first time. To this end, human melanoma A375 cells were incubated with Justicidin B and its 4-methoxylated or 4-glycosylated derivatives to evaluate their selective cytotoxicity and study their effects on cell cycle distribution, caspase activation, apoptosis induction using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, cell morphology and western blot analysis. Diphyllin methyl ether (GI = 3.66 μM) and Justicidin B (GI = 1.70 μM) caused an elevation of both early and late apoptosis populations whereas Diphyllin apioside (GI = 0.84 μM) and its  (GI= 0.39 μM) enhanced late apoptosis population only (Annexin V-positive/PI-positive). All induced cell cycle arrest at S phase and classic morphological indicators of apoptosis (blebbing, apoptotic bodies, and nuclear fragmentation) accompanied with an elevation of cells with low DNA content (sub-G1). All compounds increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio by enhancing Bax expression which evidences the involvement of the  (intrinsic pathway) in the apoptotic process. These caspase-3/7 results evidence that 4-methoxylation or 4-O-glycosylation of Justicidin B -a caspase independent mitochondrial apoptosis-inducer- triggers caspase-3/7 activation at different times (24h vs. 48h, respectively). Interestingly, the methoxylation causes attenuation of Bcl-2 protein expression contrarily to Diphyllin methyl ether or the O-glycosylated derivatives. Finally, the compounds exhibited significantly less toxicity when tested in adult human dermal fibroblasts and their GI in melanoma Sk-Mel-5 cells was not influenced by MDR1/Pgp inhibitors. This study may inform the synthesis of future Diphyllin derivatives with different apoptosis mechanism of action towards human melanoma cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765851>The BRAF Inhibitor Vemurafenib Activates Mitochondrial Metabolism and Inhibits Hyperpolarized Pyruvate-Lactate Exchange in BRAF-Mutant Human Melanoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Understanding the impact of BRAF signaling inhibition in human melanoma on key disease mechanisms is important for developing biomarkers of therapeutic response and combination strategies to improve long-term disease control. This work investigates the downstream metabolic consequences of BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib, the molecular and biochemical processes that underpin them, their significance for antineoplastic activity, and potential as noninvasive imaging response biomarkers. H NMR spectroscopy showed that vemurafenib decreases the glycolytic activity of BRAF-mutant (WM266.4 and SKMEL28) but not BRAF (CHL-1 and D04) human melanoma cells. In WM266.4 cells, this was associated with increased , glycine, and myo-inositol levels and decreased fatty acyl signals, while the bioenergetic status was maintained. C NMR metabolic flux analysis of treated WM266.4 cells revealed inhibition of de novo lactate synthesis and glucose utilization, associated with increased oxidative and anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase mitochondrial metabolism and decreased lipid synthesis. This metabolic shift was associated with depletion of hexokinase 2, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 4 in BRAF-mutant but not BRAF cells and, interestingly, decreased BRAF-mutant cell dependency on glucose and glutamine for growth. Further, the reduction in MCT1 expression observed led to inhibition of hyperpolarized C-pyruvate-lactate exchange, a parameter that is translatable to in vivo imaging studies, in live WM266.4 cells. In conclusion, our data provide new insights into the molecular and metabolic consequences of BRAF inhibition in BRAF-driven human melanoma cells that may have potential for combinatorial therapeutic targeting as well as noninvasive imaging of response.

Mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, create a futile cycle of nutrient oxidation without generating ATP. Regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and associated cellular bioenergetics has been recently identified as a promising target for anticancer therapy. Here, we show that SR4 is a novel mitochondrial uncoupler that causes dose-dependent increase in mitochondrial respiration and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. These effects were reversed by the recoupling agent 6-ketocholestanol but not cyclosporin A and were nonexistent in mitochondrial DNA-depleted HepG2 cells. In isolated mouse liver , SR4 similarly increased oxygen consumption independent of adenine nucleotide translocase and uncoupling proteins, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and promoted swelling of valinomycin-treated  in potassium  medium. Mitochondrial uncoupling in HepG2 cells by SR4 results in the reduction of cellular ATP production, increased ROS production, activation of the energy-sensing enzyme AMPK, and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Global analysis of SR4-associated differential gene expression confirms these observations, including significant induction of apoptotic genes and down-regulation of cell cycle, mitochondrial, and oxidative phosphorylation pathway transcripts at 24 h post-treatment. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the previously reported indirect activation of AMPK and in vitro anticancer properties of SR4 as well as its beneficial effects in both animal xenograft and obese mice models could be a direct consequence of its mitochondrial uncoupling activity.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339895>Role of WW Domain-containing Oxidoreductase WWOX in Driving T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Maturation.</a></h2><p>Whether tumor suppressor WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase) stimulates immune cell maturation is largely unknown. Here, we determined that Tyr-33-phosphorylated WWOX physically binds non-phosphorylated ERK and IκBα in immature acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 T cells and in the naïve mouse spleen. The IκBα·ERK·WWOX complex was shown to localize, in part, in the . WWOX prevents IκBα from proteasomal degradation. Upon stimulating MOLT-4 with ionophore A23187/phorbol myristate , endogenous IκBα and ERK undergo rapid phosphorylation in <5 min, and subsequently WWOX is Tyr-33 and Tyr-287 de-phosphorylated and Ser-14 phosphorylated. Three hours later, IκBα starts to degrade, and ERK returns to basal or non-phosphorylation, and this lasts for the next 12 h. Finally, expression of CD3 and CD8 occurs in MOLT-4 along with reappearance of the IκBα·ERK·WWOX complex near 24 h. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by U0126 or IκBα degradation by MG132 prevents MOLT-4 maturation. By time-lapse FRET microscopy, IκBα·ERK·WWOX complex exhibits an increased binding strength by 1-2-fold after exposure to ionophore A23187/phorbol myristate  for 15-24 h. Meanwhile, a portion of ERK and WWOX relocates to the nucleus, suggesting their role in the induction of CD3 and CD8 expression in MOLT-4.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26475290>Impaired energy metabolism of the taurine‑deficient heart.</a></h2><p>Taurine is a β-amino acid found in high concentrations in excitable tissues, including the heart. A significant reduction in myocardial taurine content leads to the development of a unique dilated, atrophic cardiomyopathy. One of the major functions of taurine in the heart is the regulation of the respiratory chain. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that taurine deficiency-mediated defects in respiratory chain function lead to impaired energy metabolism and reduced ATP generation. We found that while the rate of glycolysis was significantly enhanced in the taurine-deficient heart, glucose oxidation was diminished. The major site of reduced glucose oxidation was pyruvate dehydrogenase, an enzyme whose activity is reduced by the increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio and by decreased availability of pyruvate for oxidation to acetyl CoA and changes in [Mg2+]i. Also diminished in the taurine-deficient heart was the oxidation of two other precursors of acetyl CoA, endogenous fatty acids and exogenous . In the taurine-deficient heart, impaired citric acid cycle activity decreased both  oxidation and endogenous fatty acid oxidation, but reductions in the activity of the mitochondrial transporter, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, appeared to also contribute to the reduction in fatty acid oxidation. These changes diminished the rate of ATP production, causing a decline in the phosphocreatine/ATP ratio, a sign of reduced energy status. The findings support the hypothesis that the taurine-deficient heart is energy starved primarily because of impaired respiratory chain function, an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio and diminished long chain fatty acid uptake by the . The results suggest that improved energy metabolism contributes to the beneficial effect of taurine therapy in patients suffering from heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338208>The cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of phagocytes in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.</a></h2><p>Phagocytes have been proved to play vital roles in the innate immune response. However, the cellular characteristics of phagocytes in invertebrates, especially in molluscs, remain largely unknown. In the present study, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was employed to sort the phagocytes from the non-phagocytic haemocytes of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The cytochemical staining analysis revealed that phagocytes were positive staining for α-naphthyl  esterase and myeloperoxidase, while negative staining for toluidine blue and periodic acid-Schiff. The non-phagocytic haemocytes exhibited positive staining for periodic acid-Schiff, weak positive staining for toluidine blue, but negative staining for α-naphthyl  esterase and myeloperoxidase. In addition, phagocytes exhibited ultrastructural cellular features similar to those of macrophages, with large cell diameter, rough cell membrane and extended pseudopodia revealed by the scanning electron microscopy, while the non-phagocytic haemocytes exhibited small cell diameter, smooth cell surface and round spherical shape. Transmission electron microscopy further demonstrated that phagocytes were abundant of cytoplasmic bodies and , while non-phagocytic haemocytes were characterized as the comparatively large cell nucleus with contorted and condensed heterochromatin adherent to the nuclear envelope. Moreover, compared with non-phagocytic haemocytes, phagocytes exhibited significantly higher levels of intracellular cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon-like protein and interleukin-17, and significantly higher abundance of lysosome and reactive oxygen species, which were of great importance to the activation of immune response and pathogen clearance. Taken together, these findings revealed the different cytochemical and ultrastructural features between phagocytes and non-phagocytic haemocytes in C. gigas, which would provide an important clue to investigate the mechanism of phagocytosis underlying the innate immune response.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The cellular death mechanism was studied by evaluating the translocation of phosphatidylserine (Annexin V); overproduction of reactive oxygen species [2'-7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay]; release of Cytochrome C; activation of caspase-3 and -9, and regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε proteins by Western Blot analysis. For the evaluation of the safety of Kf-EtOAc, the Ames test, Micronucleus assay, and acute toxicity study were determined.Kf-EtOAc exhibited selective cytotoxic activity against prostate cell lines as follows: PC-3, LNCaP, and PrEC (IC = 1.36 ± 0.05; 2.06 ± 0.02, and 127.05 ± 0.07 μg/mL, respectively). The F82-P2 fraction (rich in coumaric acid and palmitic acid) obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation of Kf-EtOAc also demonstrated selective cytotoxic activity against PC-3 cells (IC = 1.05 ± 0.06 μg/mL). Kf-EtOAc induces apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway; this mechanism of cell death was confirmed after observing that the extract produces phosphatidylserine translocation, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, release of Cytochrome C at mitochondrial level, and activation of caspase-3 and -9. It was also observed that Kf-EtOAc produces significant downregulation of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε and induces DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest. In addition, Kf-EtOAc is non-genotoxic in vitro by Ames test and non-genotoxic in vivo by Micronucleus assay, and no signs of toxicity or death were reported after the administration of a single acute exposure of 2000 mg/kg.K. flammea is a potential candidate for the development of new drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, to propose their use in clinical trials, additional studies are required to understand their pharmacokinetic behavior, as well as the development of a suitable pharmaceutical form.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Methods to identify distinct DAG pools have proven difficult because biochemical fractionation affects the pools, and concentrations are limiting. Here, we validate the use of a genetically encoded DAG biosensor in living plant cells. The sensor is composed of a fusion between yellow fluorescent protein and the C1a domain of protein kinase C (YFP-C1aPKC) that specifically binds DAG, and was stably expressed in suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells and whole Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Confocal imaging revealed that the majority of the YFP-C1aPKC fluorescence did not locate to membranes but was present in the cytosol and nucleus. Treatment with short-chain DAG or PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-), a phorbol ester that binds the C1a domain of PKC, caused the recruitment of the biosensor to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that the biosensor works and that the basal DAG concentration in the cytoplasmic leaflet of membranes (i.e. accessible to the biosensor) is in general too low, and confirms that the known pools in plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum and  are located at the luminal face of these compartments (i.e. inaccessible to the biosensor). Nevertheless, detailed further analysis of different cells and tissues discovered four novel DAG pools, namely at: (i) the trans-Golgi network; (ii) the cell plate during cytokinesis; (iii) the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells in the transition zone, and (iv) the apex of growing root hairs. The results provide new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of DAG in plants and offer a new tool to monitor this in vivo.© The Author 2017.

The importance of  has been recognized in cytotoxic mechanism of heavy metals on Leydig cells these years. But it is still poorly known. Our previous study reported that dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) located on the  was significantly decreased in Leydig cells exposed to cadmium, which suggested that DLD might be involved in the cytotoxic effects. Therefore, the altered expression of DLD was validated in rats and R2C cells exposed to cadmium, manganese and lead, and the role of DLD in the steroid synthesis pathway cAMP/PKA-ERK1/2 was investigated in this study. With a low expression of DLD, heavy metals dramatically reduced the levels of steroid hormone by inhibiting the activation of cAMP/PKA, PKC signaling pathway and the steroidogenic enzymes StAR, CYP11A1 and 3β-HSD. After knockdown of DLD in R2C cells, progesterone synthesis was reduced by 40%, and the intracellular concentration of cAMP, protein expression of StAR, 3β-HSD, PKA, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were also decreased. These results highlight that DLD is down-regulation and related to steroid biosynthesis in Leyig cells exposed to heavy metals; cAMP/PKA act as downstream effector molecules of DLD, which activate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 to initiate the steroidogenesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is the primary means of energy generation in the healthy myocardium, but direct noninvasive quantification of metabolic fluxes is challenging due to the low concentration of most metabolites. Hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides the opportunity to measure cellular metabolism in real time in vivo. The aim of this work was to noninvasively measure myocardial TCA cycle flux (VTCA) in vivo within a single minute.Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] was administered at different concentrations in healthy rats. (13)C incorporation into [1-(13)C]acetylcarnitine and the TCA cycle intermediate [5-(13)C]citrate was dynamically detected in vivo with a time resolution of 3s. Different kinetic models were established and evaluated to determine the metabolic fluxes by simultaneously fitting the evolution of the (13)C labeling in , acetylcarnitine, and citrate. VTCA was estimated to be 6.7±1.7 μmol·g(-1)·min(-1) (dry weight), and was best estimated with a model using only the labeling in citrate and acetylcarnitine, independent of the precursor. The TCA cycle rate was not linear with the citrate-to- metabolite ratio, and could thus not be quantified using a ratiometric approach. The (13)C signal evolution of citrate, i.e. citrate formation was independent of the amount of injected , while the (13)C signal evolution of acetylcarnitine revealed a dose dependency with the injected . The (13)C labeling of citrate did not correlate to that of acetylcarnitine, leading to the hypothesis that acetylcarnitine formation is not an indication of mitochondrial TCA cycle activity in the heart.Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] is a metabolic probe independent of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. It allows the direct estimation of VTCA in vivo, which was shown to be neither dependent on the administered  dose nor on the (13)C labeling of acetylcarnitine.

Multiple components of mitochondrial complex I, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, are expressed in this stage, but electron transfer through complex I is not essential. Here we investigate the role of the parasite's second NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, NDH2, which is composed of a single subunit that also localizes to the mitochondrion. While inducible knockdown of NDH2 had a modest growth effect in bloodstream forms, NDH2 null mutants, as well as inducible knockdowns in a complex I deficient background, showed a greater reduction in growth. Altering the NAD/NADH balance would affect numerous processes directly and indirectly, including  production. Indeed, loss of NDH2 led to reduced levels of , which is required for several essential pathways in bloodstream form T. brucei and which may have contributed to the observed growth defect. In conclusion our study shows that NDH2 is important, but not essential, in proliferating bloodstream forms of T. brucei, arguing that the mitochondrial NAD/NADH balance is important in this stage, even though the mitochondrion itself is not actively engaged in the generation of ATP.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Here we show that when FAO was reduced approximately 90% by pharmacological inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) with low concentrations of etomoxir, the proliferation rate of various cancer cells was unaffected. Efforts to pharmacologically inhibit FAO more than 90% revealed that high concentrations of etomoxir (200 μM) have an off-target effect of inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain. Surprisingly, however, when FAO was reduced further by genetic knockdown of CPT1, the proliferation rate of these same cells decreased nearly 2-fold and could not be restored by  or octanoic acid supplementation. Moreover, CPT1 knockdowns had altered mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitochondrial coupling, whereas cells in which CPT1 had been approximately 90% inhibited by etomoxir did not. Lipidomic profiling of  isolated from CPT1 knockdowns showed depleted concentrations of complex structural and signaling lipids. Additionally, expression of a catalytically dead CPT1 in CPT1 knockdowns did not restore mitochondrial coupling. Taken together, these results suggest that transport of at least some long-chain fatty acids into the  by CPT1 may be required for anabolic processes that support healthy mitochondrial function and cancer cell proliferation independent of FAO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429322>Photo and Nutritional Regulation of Euglena Organelle Development.</a></h2><p>Euglena can use light and CO, photosynthesis, as well as a large variety of organic molecules as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth. Light induces the enzymes, in this case an entire organelle, the chloroplast, that is required to use CO as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth. Ethanol, but not malate, inhibits the photoinduction of chloroplast enzymes and induces the synthesis of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes that comprise the unique metabolic pathway leading to two carbon, ethanol and , assimilation. In resting, carbon starved cells, light mobilizes the degradation of the storage carbohydrate paramylum and transiently induces the mitochondrial proteins required for the aerobic metabolism of paramylum to provide the carbon and energy required for chloroplast development. Other mitochondrial proteins are degraded upon light exposure providing the amino acids required for the synthesis of light induced proteins. Changes in protein levels are due to increased and decreased rates of synthesis rather than changes in degradation rates. Changes in protein synthesis rates occur in the absence of a concomitant increase in the levels of mRNAs encoding these proteins indicative of photo and metabolic control at the translational rather than the transcriptional level. The fraction of mRNA encoding a light induced protein such as the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein of photosystem II, (LHCPII) associated with polysomes in the dark is similar to the fraction associated with polysomes in the light indicative of photoregulation at the level of translational elongation. Ethanol, a carbon source whose assimilation requires carbon source specific enzymes, the glyoxylate cycle enzymes, represses the synthesis of chloroplast enzymes uniquely required to use light and CO as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth. The catabolite sensitivity of chloroplast development provides a mechanism to prioritize carbon source utilization. Euglena uses all of its resources to develop the metabolic capacity to utilize carbon sources such as ethanol which are rarely in the environment and delays until the rare carbon source is no longer available forming the chloroplast which is required to utilize the ubiquitous carbon source, light and CO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767280>Carnosine and Histidine Supplementation Blunt Lead-Induced Reproductive Toxicity through Antioxidative and -Dependent Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Lead (Pb)-induced reproductive toxicity is a well-characterized adverse effect associated with this heavy metal. It has been found that Pb exposure is associated with altered spermatogenesis, increased testicular degeneration, and pathological sperm alterations. On the other hand, it has been reported that Pb-induced reproductive toxicity is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and diminished antioxidant capacity in the reproductive system. Hence, administration of antioxidants as protective agents might be of value against Pb-induced reproductive toxicity. This study was designed to investigate whether carnosine (CAR) and histidine (HIS) supplementation would mitigate the Pb-induced reproductive toxicity in male rats. Animals received Pb (20 mg/kg/day, oral, 14 consecutive days) alone or in combination with CAR (250 and 500 mg/kg/day, oral, 14 consecutive days) or HIS (250 and 500 mg/kg/day, oral, 14 consecutive days). Pb toxicity was evident in the reproductive system by a significant increase in tissue markers of oxidative stress along with severe histopathological changes, seminal tubule damage, tubular desquamation, low spermatogenesis index, poor sperm parameters, and impaired sperm mitochondrial function. It was found that CAR and HIS supplementation blunted the Pb-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the rat reproductive system. Thereby, antioxidative and -protective properties serve as primary mechanisms for CAR and HIS against Pb-induced reproductive toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28477464>Novel purification of 1'S-1'-Acetoxychavicol  from Alpinia galanga and its cytotoxic plus antiproliferative activity in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW480.</a></h2><p>Alpinia galanga (L.) Willd. is a valuable medicinal crop found in specific tropical regions of southeast Asia. Its crude extracts are well known for their wide medicinal properties and many compounds identified from these extracts are of great interest currently. 1'S-1'-Acetoxychavicol  (ACA) obtained from rhizomes of A.galanga is one such well-illustrated compound. This study strives to progress and simplifies the purification protocol for ACA from A.galanga rhizomes. It also studies the cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity of ACA against Dukes' type B, colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW480). HPLC standardisation was carried out for purification of ACA from rhizomes of Alpinia galanga. MTT assay was executed to estimate the IC value of ACA against SW480 cell line. This value was used to study the apoptosis, nuclear morphological changes and mitochondrial membrane permeability using Acridine orange/ethidium bromide, DAPI, and JC-1 staining. The DNA fragmentation assay was used to substantiate the nuclear fragmentation of DNA observed in the DAPI staining. Further, cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry to study the exact stage of the cell cycle where SW480 cells are arrested due to ACA, western blot analysis of relevant genes were done to further understand at molecular level. A comprehensive 1.89g of 1'S-1'-Acetoxychavicol  (ACA) was recovered from 500g of A.galanga rhizomes. ACA significantly suppressed the proliferation of SW480 cells at an IC of 80μM (48h). The mode of SW480 cell death due to ACA was initially identified as apoptosis and cell cycle halted at G/G checkpoint with considerable DNA damage and mitochondrial depolarization. The expression of p21 was increased and concomitantly Cyclin D was downregulated in ACA treated in comparison to control. This study suggests that 1'S-1'-Acetoxychavicol  has potent anti-colorectal adenocarcinoma activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here two members of this family, Ymc2p from S. cerevisiae and BOU from Arabidopsis, have been thoroughly characterized. These proteins were overproduced in bacteria and reconstituted into liposomes. Their transport properties and kinetic parameters demonstrate that Ymc2p and BOU transport glutamate, and to a much lesser extent L-homocysteinesulfinate, but not other amino acids and many other tested metabolites. Transport catalyzed by both carriers was saturable, inhibited by mercuric chloride and dependent on the proton gradient across the proteoliposomal membrane. The growth phenotype of S. cerevisiae cells lacking the genes ymc2 and agc1, which encodes the only other S. cerevisiae carrier capable to transport glutamate besides aspartate, was fully complemented by expressing Ymc2p, Agc1p or BOU. Mitochondrial extracts derived from ymc2Δagc1Δ cells, reconstituted into liposomes, exhibited no glutamate transport at variance with wild-type, ymc2Δ and agc1Δ cells, showing that S. cerevisiae cells grown in the presence of  do not contain additional mitochondrial transporters for glutamate besides Ymc2p and Agc1p. Furthermore,  isolated from wild-type, ymc2Δ and agc1Δ strains, but not from the double mutant ymc2Δagc1Δ strain, swell in isosmotic ammonium glutamate showing that glutamate is transported by Ymc2p and Agc1p together with a H. It is proposed that the function of Ymc2p and BOU is to transport glutamate across the mitochondrial inner membrane and thereby play a role in intermediary metabolism, C1 metabolism and mitochondrial protein synthesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting product, 5-taurinomethyluridine tRNA, increases the interaction between the UUG codon and AAU anticodon of tRNA, thereby improving the decoding of the UUG codon. We have shown that the protein most affected by the taurine conjugation product is ND6, which is a subunit of complex I of the respiratory chain. Thus, taurine deficiency exhibits reduced respiratory chain function. Based on these findings, we proposed that the taurine deficient heart is energy deficient. To test this idea, hearts were perfused with buffer containing  and glucose as substrates. The utilization of both substrates, as well as the utilization of endogenous lipids, was significantly reduced in the taurine deficient heart. This led to a 25% decrease in ATP production, an effect primarily caused by diminished aerobic metabolism and respiratory function. In addition, inefficient oxidative phosphorylation causes a further decrease in ATP generation. The data support the idea that reductions in energy metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation, ATP generation and high energy phosphate content, contribute to the severity of the cardiomyopathy. The findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that taurine deficiency and reduced myocardial energy content increases mortality of the taurine deficient, failing heart. The clinical implications of these findings are addressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541249>Long-living budding yeast cell subpopulation induced by ethanol/ and respiration.</a></h2><p>Budding yeast generate heterogeneous cells that can be separated into 2 distinctive cell types: short-living low density (LD) and long-living high density (HD) cells by density gradient centrifugation. We found that ethanol and  induce formation of HD cells, and mitochondrial respiration is required. From their transcriptomes and metabolomes, we found up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HD cells involved in the RGT2/RGT1 glucose sensing pathway and its down-stream genes encoding hexose transporters. For HD cells, we determined an abundance of various carbon sources including glucose, lactate, pyruvate, trehalose, mannitol, mannose, and galactose. Other up-regulated DEGs in HD cells were involved in the TORC1-SCH9 signaling pathway and its down-stream genes involved in cytoplasmic translation. We also measured an abundance of free amino acids in HD cells including valine, proline, isoleucine, and glutamine. These characteristics of the HD cell transcriptome and metabolome may be important conditions for maintaining a long-living phenotype.© The Author(s) 2019.

Few studies focused on the pathophysiological features and treatments in metabolic diseases after severe trauma and shock. Vascular reactivity is significantly decreased after severe trauma and shock. Improving the vascular reactivity with arginine vasopressin (AVP) and phorbol-12 myristate-13- (PMA) is beneficial to trauma and shock. Whether the cardiovascular function and treatment responses have the own features in hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic patients after traumatic hemorrhagic shock is not known. Using hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic and healthy rats, we compared the change patterns in cardiovascular function including vascular reactivity, tissue perfusion, and the hemodynamics after hemorrhagic shock and their responses to AVP, PMA, and common antishock agents including dopamine and norepinephrine. A same degree of hemorrhagic shock (40% hemorrhage or mean arterial pressure maintained at 40 mm Hg for 2 h) resulted in a more obvious decrease in vascular reactivity, hemodynamics, tissue perfusion, and mitochondrial function of liver and kidney in hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic rats, and a more rapidly natural death than in healthy rats. The effectiveness of AVP and PMA in these diseased rats was lower than in healthy rats. The effective dosage of common antishock agents including norepinephrine, dopamine, and AVP in healthy rats was wider than that in these diseased rats. Among the antishock agents used in the current study, AVP had the best effect in improving animal survival and vascular reactivity both in healthy and in diseased rats. These findings suggest that hypertensive, diabetic, and hyperlipidemic rats have a worse vascular reactivity and organ function than the healthy rats after traumatic hemorrhagic shock, which result in the worse treatment responses and effects to vasoactive agents. Lower dose of AVP can be recommended as the first-line antishock agents for these diseased rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108233>Mitoketoscins: Novel mitochondrial inhibitors for targeting ketone metabolism in cancer stem cells (CSCs).</a></h2><p>Previous studies have now well-established that epithelial cancer cells can utilize ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate and aceto-) as mitochondrial fuels, to actively promote tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. The two critical metabolic enzymes implicated in this process are OXCT1 and ACAT1, which are both mitochondrial proteins. Importantly, over-expression of OXCT1 or ACAT1 in human breast cancer cells is sufficient to genetically drive tumorigenesis and/or lung metastasis, validating that they indeed behave as metabolic "tumor promoters". Here, we decided to target these two enzymes, which give cancer cells the ability to recycle ketone bodies into Acetyl-CoA and, therefore, to produce increased ATP. Briefly, we used computational chemistry ( drug design) to select a sub-set of potentially promising compounds that spatially fit within the active site of these enzymes, based on their known 3D crystal structures. These libraries of compounds were then phenotypically screened for their effects on total cellular ATP levels. Positive hits were further validated by metabolic flux analysis. Our results indicated that four of these compounds effectively inhibited mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Two of these compounds also induced a reactive glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells. Most importantly, using the mammosphere assay, we showed that these compounds can be used to functionally inhibit cancer stem cell (CSC) activity and propagation. Finally, our molecular modeling studies directly show how these novel compounds are predicted to bind to the active catalytic sites of OXCT1 and ACAT1, within their Coenzyme A binding site. As such, we speculate that these mitochondrial inhibitors are partially mimicking the structure of Coenzyme A. Thus, we conclude that OXCT1 and ACAT1 are important new therapeutic targets for further drug development and optimization. We propose that this new class of drugs should be termed "", to reflect that they were designed to target ketone re-utilization and mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30841648>The Extracts of  L.

Here, we prepared .  ethanol extract (AAEE) and its subfractions including petroleum ether (AAEE-Pe) and ethyl  (AAEE-Ea) and investigated their antitumor effect on human hepatoma BEL-7404 cells and mouse hepatoma H22 cells. The cell viability of hepatoma cells was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis, cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of proteins in the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways were detected by Western blot. AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea exhibited potent cytotoxicity for both BEL-7404 cells and H22 cells through the induction of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea significantly reduced Δψm, increased the release of cytochrome c, and promoted the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in BEL-7404 and H22 cells. AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea significantly upregulated the levels of ROS and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Further, AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea significantly inhibited tumor growth in the H22 tumor mouse model and improved the survival of tumor mice without side effects. These results suggest that AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea inhibited the growth of hepatoma cells through induction of apoptosis, which might be mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial-dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28743817>Bacterial Signaling Nucleotides Inhibit Yeast Cell Growth by Impacting Mitochondrial and Other Specifically Eukaryotic Functions.</a></h2><p>We have engineered  to inducibly synthesize the prokaryotic signaling nucleotides cyclic di-GMP (cdiGMP), cdiAMP, and ppGpp in order to characterize the range of effects these nucleotides exert on eukaryotic cell function during bacterial pathogenesis. Synthetic genetic array (SGA) and transcriptome analyses indicated that, while these compounds elicit some common reactions in yeast, there are also complex and distinctive responses to each of the three nucleotides. All three are capable of inhibiting eukaryotic cell growth, with the guanine nucleotides exhibiting stronger effects than cdiAMP. Mutations compromising mitochondrial function and chromatin remodeling show negative epistatic interactions with all three nucleotides. In contrast, certain mutations that cause defects in chromatin modification and ribosomal protein function show positive epistasis, alleviating growth inhibition by at least two of the three nucleotides. Uniquely, cdiGMP is lethal both to cells growing by respiration on  and to obligately fermentative petite mutants. cdiGMP is also synthetically lethal with the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibitor hydroxyurea. Heterologous expression of the human ppGpp hydrolase Mesh1p prevented the accumulation of ppGpp in the engineered yeast and restored cell growth. Extensive  interactions between bacterial signaling molecules and eukaryotic gene function occur, resulting in outcomes ranging from growth inhibition to death. cdiGMP functions through a mechanism that must be compensated by unhindered RNR activity or by functionally competent . Mesh1p may be required for abrogating the damaging effects of ppGpp in human cells subjected to bacterial infection. During infections, pathogenic bacteria can release nucleotides into the cells of their eukaryotic hosts. These nucleotides are recognized as signals that contribute to the initiation of defensive immune responses that help the infected cells recover. Despite the importance of this process, the broader impact of bacterial nucleotides on the functioning of eukaryotic cells remains poorly defined. To address this, we genetically modified cells of the eukaryote  (baker's yeast) to produce three of these molecules (cdiAMP, cdiGMP, and ppGpp) and used the engineered strains as model systems to characterize the effects of the molecules on the cells. In addition to demonstrating that the nucleotides are each capable of adversely affecting yeast cell function and growth, we also identified the cellular functions important for mitigating the damage caused, suggesting possible modes of action. This study expands our understanding of the molecular interactions that can take place between bacterial and eukaryotic cells.Copyright © 2017 Hesketh et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383867>Glycerol supports growth of the Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms in the absence of glucose: Analysis of metabolic adaptations on glycerol-rich conditions.</a></h2><p>The bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei (BSF), the parasite protist causing sleeping sickness, primarily proliferate in the blood of their mammalian hosts. The skin and adipose tissues were recently identified as additional major sites for parasite development. Glucose was the only carbon source known to be used by bloodstream trypanosomes to feed their central carbon metabolism, however, the metabolic behaviour of extravascular tissue-adapted parasites has not been addressed yet. Since the production of glycerol is an important primary function of adipocytes, we have adapted BSF trypanosomes to a glucose-depleted but glycerol-rich culture medium (CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc) and compared their metabolism and proteome to those of parasites grown in standard glucose-rich conditions (CMM_Glc). BSF were shown to consume 2-folds more oxygen per consumed carbon unit in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc and were 11.5-times more sensitive to SHAM, a specific inhibitor of the plant-like alternative oxidase (TAO), which is the only mitochondrial terminal oxidase expressed in BSF. This is consistent with (i) the absolute requirement of the mitochondrial respiratory activity to convert glycerol into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as deduced from the updated metabolic scheme and (ii) with the 1.8-fold increase of the TAO expression level compared to the presence of glucose. Proton NMR analysis of excreted end products from glycerol and glucose metabolism showed that these two carbon sources are metabolised through the same pathways, although the contributions of the  and succinate branches are more important in the presence of glycerol than glucose (10.2% versus 3.4% of the excreted end products, respectively). In addition, metabolomic analyses by mass spectrometry showed that, in the absence of glucose, 13C-labelled glycerol was incorporated into hexose phosphates through gluconeogenesis. As expected, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of glycerol kinase expression abolished glycerol metabolism and was lethal for BSF grown in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc. Interestingly, BSF have adapted their metabolism to grow in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc by concomitantly increasing their rate of glycerol consumption and decreasing that of glucose. However, the glycerol kinase activity was 7.8-fold lower in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc, as confirmed by both western blotting and proteomic analyses. This suggests that the huge excess in glycerol kinase that is not absolutely required for glycerol metabolism, might be used for another yet undetermined non-essential function in glucose rich-conditions. Altogether, these data demonstrate that BSF trypanosomes are well-adapted to glycerol-rich conditions that could be encountered by the parasite in extravascular niches, such as the skin and adipose tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27175572>Investigation of cadmium-induced apoptosis and the protective effect of N-acetylcysteine in BRL 3A cells.</a></h2><p>The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of cadmium (Cd)‑induced apoptosis and determine the protective effect of N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) in BRL 3A cells. The BRL 3A cells were treated with 0, 10, 20 or 40 µmol/l cadmium  (CdAc2) for 12 h. Another two groups of cells were preincubated with 2 mmol/l NAC for 30 min, and then either incubated with 20 µmol/l CdAc2 for 12 h, or treated with NAC alone. The levels of apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) were measured using flow cytometry. Mitochondrial ultrastructural changes were detected using transmission electron microscopy. The protein levels of caspase‑3, caspase‑9, poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase‑8, and Fas ligand (FasL) protein were measured using immunoblotting. As the dose of Cd increased, there was a significant increase in the apoptotic ratio, a significant decrease in ΔΨm, mitochondrial swelling and degeneration, and blurring, deformation and eventual collapse of the mitochondrial cristae. The protein levels of caspase‑3, caspase‑9 and PARP decreased, whereas the levels of cleaved caspase‑3, cleaved caspase‑9, cleaved caspase‑8 and FasL increased dose‑dependently in relation to Cd. NAC effectively inhibited these changes. Cd induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial and FasL pathways in the BRL 3A cells, and NAC exerted a protective effect against Cd‑induced damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425668> and Autophagy Dysfunction in Glucocorticoid-Induced Ocular Hypertension/Glaucoma Mice Model.</a></h2><p>: This study is aimed to investigate the effects of periocular steroids induction on intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and trabecular meshwork (TM) ultrastructure in glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension mice model. : Dexamethasone-21- (Dex-Ace) was administered through periocular conjunctival fornix injection every 3 days in C57BL/6J mice.

Autophagy was evaluated with immunoblotting in TM tissues. : Dex-Ace rapidly and significantly induced IOP, which peaked at week 4. The absolute increase in IOP in the Dex-Ace-treated mice was 8.1 ± 1.4 mmHg, a 60% induction ( < .0001) compared with that in the vehicle-treated mice. The IOP sustained a higher level in the Dex-Ace group from week 4 to week 8. Dex-Ace treatment decreased the number of RGCs in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that high IOP resulted in optic neuropathy. In addition, Dex-Ace thickened trabecular beams and decreased intertrabecular spaces, with marked accumulation of fibrillar and amorphous granular extracellular material. Moreover, Dex-Ace induced swollen and elongated  in TM cells.

It has been widely reported for its antioxidant properties; however, very little is known for its exact mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of anticancer action for different A. lappa root extracts. Arctium lappa root was extracted with ethanol, hexane and ethyl , then examined for in vitro anticancer activity against cancerous HeLa, MCF-7, Jurkat cell lines and non-cancerous 3T3 cell lines. Induction of apoptosis was determined by cellular morphological changes, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), caspase-3/7 activity and DNA fragmentation. The active compounds present in the most potent root extracts were identified by LC-ESI-MS. Among all the extracts, ethyl  root extract has the highest potency with IC of 102.2 ± 42.4 μg/ml, followed by ethanolic root extract in Jurkat T cells, at 24 h. None of the extracts were cytotoxic against 3T3 cells, suggesting that the extracts were selective against cancerous cells only. Both ethyl  and ethanolic root extracts exhibited significant morphological changes in Jurkat T cells, including the detachment from adjacent cells, appearance of apoptotic bodies and cells shrinkage. The extracts treated cells also displayed an increase in caspase-3/7 activity and alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential. Only ethyl  root extract at IC induced DNA fragmentation in Jurkat T cells. LC-ESI-MS analysis of the extract revealed the presence of 8 compounds, of which only 6 compounds with various biological activities reported. These findings suggest that the ethyl  extract of A. lappa had strong anticancer potential and induced intrinsic apoptosis via loss of ΔΨ and activation of caspase-3/7 This study can provide new insight to the discovery of new promising lead compound in chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we have used (1) H and (13) C NMR spectroscopy after injection of [1-(13) C]glucose and [1,2-(13) C] to examine neuronal and astrocytic metabolism in the early reperfusion phase after unilateral HI brain injury in 7-day-old rat pups, exploring the effects of HI on mitochondrial function and the potential protective effects of melatonin on brain metabolism. One hour after hypoxia-ischemia, astrocytic metabolism was recovered and glycolysis was normalized, whereas mitochondrial metabolism in neurons was clearly impaired.

We use methanol to extract VTT in four different solvents: 1-butanol, n-hexane, ethyl , and water. These four preliminary extracts were used to treat human prostate cancer DU145 cells in vitro. We use the flow cytometry to check the cell survival situation. Finally, we found the ethyl  layer roughing product (referred VTEA) in human prostate cancer apoptotic effects of cell line DU-145. In the present studies, we use the crude extract of VTT to examine whether or not it can induce apoptosis of DU145 cells in vitro. Viability assays for extracts of VTT treatment showed that it had dose-dependent effect on human prostate cancer DU145 cells. We also found that the extract of VTT induces time-dependent mitochondrial and intrinsic-dependent apoptosis pathways. The in vitro cytotoxic effects were investigated by cell cycle analysis and the determination of apoptotic DNA fragmentation in DU145 cells. The cell cycle analysis showed that extracts of VTT induced a significant increase in the number of cells in G /G phase.

Through in vitro plant cell culture it is possible to modify CB lipid profiles and to study the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway on a subcellular level, evaluating fundamental aspects to enhance in vitro fatty acid production in a specific and controlled way. In this research, culture media was supplemented with , biotin, pyruvate, bicarbonate and glycerol at three different concentrations and the effects on the biomass production (g/L), cell viability, and fatty acids profile and production was evaluated in in vitro cell suspensions culture. It was found that biotin stimulated fatty acid synthesis without altering cell viability and cell growth. It was also evident a change in the lipid profile of cell suspensions, increasing middle and long chain fatty acids proportion, which are unusual to those reported in seeds; thus implying that it is possible to modify lipid profiles according to the treatment used. According to the results of sucrose gradients and enzyme assays performed, it is proposed that cacao cells probably use the pentose phosphate pathway,  being the key organelle in the carbon flux for the synthesis of reductant power and fatty acid precursors.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, some fundamental features of Eat1 are still not understood, which hampers the rational engineering of efficient production strains. The cellular location of Eat1 in yeast is one of these features. To reveal its location, Eat1 was fused with yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) to allow intracellular tracking. Despite the current assumption that bulk ethyl  production occurs in the yeast cytosol, most of Eat1 localized to the  of  CBS 2359  We then compared five bulk ethyl -producing yeasts in iron-limited chemostats with glucose as the carbon source. All yeasts produced ethyl  under these conditions. This strongly suggests that the mechanism and location of bulk ethyl  synthesis are similar in these yeast strains. Furthermore, an  analysis showed that Eat1 proteins from various yeasts were mostly predicted as mitochondrial. Altogether, it is concluded that Eat1-catalyzed ethyl  production occurs in yeast . This study has added new insights into bulk ethyl  synthesis in yeast, which is relevant for developing efficient production strains. Ethyl  is a common bulk chemical that is currently produced from petrochemical sources. Several Eat1-containing yeast strains naturally produce large amounts of ethyl  and are potential cell factories for the production of bio-based ethyl . Rational design of the underlying metabolic pathways may result in improved production strains, but it requires fundamental knowledge on the function of Eat1. A key feature is the location of Eat1 in the yeast cell. The precursors for ethyl  synthesis can be produced in multiple cellular compartments through different metabolic pathways. The location of Eat1 determines the relevance of each pathway, which will provide future targets for the metabolic engineering of bulk ethyl  production in yeast.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27915162>High-fat diet induces metabolic changes and reduces oxidative stress in female mouse hearts.</a></h2><p>After an acute myocardial infarction, obese patients generally have a better prognosis than their leaner counterparts, known as the "obesity paradox". In addition, female sex is associated with a lower risk of cardiac ischemic events and smaller infarct size compared to males. The objective of the present work was to study the metabolic phenotype and mitochondrial function associated to female sex and short-term high-fat diet. H NMR spectra of mice heart extracts were analysed by mRMR variable selection and linear discriminant analysis was used to evaluate metabolic changes. In separate experiments, O consumption and HO production were measured from isolated  as well as serum oxidation susceptibility. Fingerprinting showed that male hearts contained more myo-inositol, taurine and glutamate than female hearts. HFD reduced the levels of creatine, taurine citrate and . Profiling showed increased alanine and fumarate in HFD suggesting altered glycolitic and Krebs cycle pathways. Female mice contained less glucose than males. Female sex nor HFD altered  oxygen consumption but both conditions reduced the amount of HO produced in an additive manner. Serum of females had lower oxidation susceptibility than serum from males but there were no differences associated with HFD. In conclusion, female sex and short-term HFD have an effect on the myocardial metabolic pattern and reduce the amount of HO produced by  in an additive manner suggesting different mechanisms of action. This could explain, at least in part, the protection afforded by female sex and the "obesity paradox".Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

SIRT3 increases oxidative stress resistance and prevents mitochondrial decay associated with ageing in response to caloric restriction. However, the effects of SIRT3 on oxidative damage and ageing are not well understood. We investigated the physiological functions of porcine SIRT3 on the damage and ageing in porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFFs).Overexpression and knockdown of SIRT3 were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. All cells were treated with three different stress reagents 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA), methanesulfonic acid methylester (MMS), and tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP), respectively, and then examined by flow cytometry following JC-1 (5, 5', 6, 6'-tetrachloro-1, 1', 3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide) staining.SIRT3 overexpression enhanced the ability of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) to reduce cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further decreased the damage to the membranes and the organelles of the cells, especially to . It inhibited the initial decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, and prevented the decrease of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and activity of Nampt. In contrast, SIRT3 knockdown reduced the ability of SOD2 to increase cellular ROS which was directly correlated with stress-induced oxidative damage and ageing in PFFs.Our findings identify one function of SIRT3 in PFFs was to dampen cytotoxicity, and, therefore, to decrease oxidative damage and attenuate ageing possibly by enhancing the activity of SOD2.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Intravenous (i.v.) lipid emulsion may overcome this energy depletion, but doses larger than currently recommended may be needed for rescue effect. In this randomized study with anesthetized pigs, we compared the effect of a large dose, 4 mL/kg, of i.v. 20% Intralipid ( n = 7) with Ringer's  ( n = 6) on cardiovascular recovery after a cardiotoxic dose of bupivacaine. We also examined mitochondrial respiratory function in myocardial cell homogenates analyzed promptly after needle biopsies from the animals. Bupivacaine plasma concentrations were quantified from plasma samples. Arterial blood pressure recovered faster and systemic vascular resistance rose more rapidly after Intralipid than Ringer's  administration ( p < 0.0001), but Intralipid did not increase cardiac index or left ventricular ejection fraction. The lipid-based mitochondrial respiration was stimulated by approximately 30% after Intralipid ( p < 0.05) but unaffected by Ringer's . The mean (standard deviation) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of total bupivacaine was greater after Intralipid (105.2 (13.6) mg·min/L) than after Ringer's  (88.1 (7.1) mg·min/L) ( p = 0.019). After Intralipid, the AUC of the lipid-un-entrapped bupivacaine portion (97.0 (14.5) mg·min/L) was 8% lower than that of total bupivacaine ( p < 0.0001). To conclude, 4 mL/kg of Intralipid expedited cardiovascular recovery from bupivacaine cardiotoxicity mainly by increasing systemic vascular resistance. The increased myocardial mitochondrial respiration and bupivacaine entrapment after Intralipid did not improve cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29442309>Lead-induced changes of cytoskeletal protein is involved in the pathological basis in mice brain.</a></h2><p>Lead poisoning is a geochemical disease. On the other hand, lead is highly carcinogenic and exhibits liver and kidney toxicity. This element can also cross the blood-brain barrier, reduce learning and memory ability and damage the structure of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. To further investigate the mechanism of lead neurotoxicity, 4-week-old Kunming mice were used to explore the effects of different concentrations of Pb (0, 2.4, 4.8 and 9.6 mM) for 9 days. In this study, pathological and ultrastructural changes in brain cells of the treated group were related to damages to , chromatin and the nucleus. Lead content in blood was tested by atomic absorption spectroscopy, which showed high lead concentrations in the blood with increasing doses of lead. Distribution of lead in nerve cells was analysed by transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Data showed the presence of lead in nucleopores, chromatin and nuclear membrane of nerve cells in the treatment groups, whereas lead content increased with increasing doses of lead . Finally, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting, which showed a reduction in MAP2 expression with increasing lead doses in the mouse brain. These findings suggest that acute lead poisoning can cause significant dose-dependent toxic effects on mouse brain function and can contribute to better understanding of lead-induced toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330343>Tracer-based assessments of hepatic anaplerotic and TCA cycle flux: practicality, stoichiometry, and hidden assumptions.</a></h2><p>Two groups recently used different tracer methods to quantify liver-specific flux rates. The studies had a similar goal, i.e., to characterize mitochondrial oxidative function. These efforts could have a direct impact on our ability to understand metabolic abnormalities that affect the pathophysiology of fatty liver and allow us to examine mechanisms surrounding potential therapeutic interventions. Briefly, one method couples the continuous infusion of [(13)C] with direct real-time measurements of [(13)C]glutamate labeling in liver; the other method administers [(13)C]propionate, in combination with other tracers, and subsequently measures the (13)C labeling of plasma glucose and/or acetaminophen-glucuronide. It appears that a controversy has arisen, since the respective methods yielded different estimates of the anaplerotic/TCA flux ratio (VANA:VTCA) in "control" subjects, i.e., the [(13)C]- and [(13)C]propionate-derived VANA:VTCA flux ratios appear to be ∼1.4 and ∼5, respectively. While the deep expertise in the respective groups makes it somewhat trivial for each to perform the tracer studies, the data interpretation is inherently difficult. The current perspective was undertaken to examine potential factors that could account for or contribute to the apparent differences. Attention was directed toward 1) matters of practicality, 2) issues surrounding stoichiometry, and 3) hidden assumptions. We believe that the [(13)C] method has certain weaknesses that limit its utility; in contrast, the [(13)C]propionate method likely yields a more correct answer. We hope our discussion will help clarify the differences in the recent reports. Presumably this will be of interest to investigators who are considering tracer-based studies of liver metabolism.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29044214>Limits of aerobic metabolism in cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells exhibit high rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Glycolysis can provide energy and glutaminolysis can provide carbon for anaplerosis and reductive carboxylation to citrate. However, all these metabolic requirements could be in principle satisfied from glucose. Here we investigate why cancer cells do not satisfy their metabolic demands using aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. Based on the typical composition of a mammalian cell we quantify the energy demand and the OxPhos burden of cell biosynthesis from glucose. Our calculation demonstrates that aerobic growth from glucose is feasible up to a minimum doubling time that is proportional to the OxPhos burden and inversely proportional to the  OxPhos capacity. To grow faster cancer cells must activate aerobic glycolysis for energy generation and uncouple NADH generation from biosynthesis. To uncouple biosynthesis from NADH generation cancer cells can synthesize lipids from carbon sources that do not produce NADH in their catabolism, including  and the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Finally, we show that cancer cell lines have an OxPhos capacity that is insufficient to support aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. We conclude that selection for high rate of biosynthesis implies a selection for aerobic glycolysis and uncoupling biosynthesis from NADH generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26254612>Ethylacetate extract from Tetrastigma hemsleyanum induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial caspase-dependent intrinsic pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Ethylacetate extract of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum (EET) has a potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism underlying EET-induced apoptosis remains elusive. As part of our continuing studies, we investigated the apoptosis mechanism of HepG2 cells exposed to different concentrations of EET in vitro. Confocal laser scanning was used to detect the apoptotic morphological changes. Flow cytometer and inverted fluorescence microscope were used to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytosolic Ca(2+) level. Western blotting analysis was used to evaluate the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins. Annexin V/PI staining was used to investigate cell apoptosis. Spectrophotometry was used to detect the activity of caspase family. The results showed that distinct apoptotic morphological changes occurred in HepG2 cells treated by EET. EET caused collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) level, and evoked release of cytochrome c from  in a concentration-dependent manner. The apoptosis was accompanied by a significant activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, but there was no significant change in either the activity or the expression level of caspase-8. Furthermore, EET-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK but not by caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK. Taken together, these overall results demonstrated that EET-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells was mediated by the mitochondrial caspase-dependent intrinsic pathway rather than the death receptor/caspase-8-mediated signaling route.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27292193>Ethyl  extract from Selaginella doederleinii Hieron inhibits the growth of human lung cancer cells A549 via caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway.</a></h2><p>Selaginella doederleinii Hieron has been used as a folk medicine for the treatment of different cancers, especially for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer and trophoblastic tumor in China. Previously, the ethyl  extract from S. doederleinii (SDEA extract) showed favorable anti-cancer potentials. However, the main chemical composition and anticancer mechanism of the SDEA extract were still not very clear. Until now, there are no reports available about the oral toxicity of the extract.The present study was to further elucidate the chemical composition and anti-lung cancer mechanism of the SDEA extract, and evaluate the acute oral toxicity of the extract.The SDEA extract was separated and analysed by HPLC to disclose its main chemicals. The effects of the extract were then investigated in vitro on cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and the molecular mechanism against human lung cancer cells A549 was further studied by western blot assays. The in vivo anti-cancer effect of the extract was evaluated in A549 xenograft mice model by histochemical assay, and tumor growth, microvascular density (MVD) and Ki67 expression were also measured. In addition, acute oral toxicity test of the extract was executed in mice.SDEA extract mainly contained eight biflavonoids. The extract caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and induced cell apoptosis by upregulating Bax, downregulating Bcl-2, activating caspase-9 and caspase-3 and blocked the cell cycle in S phase. The extract reduced expression of antigen Ki67, decreased MVD, and significantly inhibited the tumor growth. The extract did not show apparent oral acute toxicity in healthy mice.The SDEA extract exerted anti-tumor effect through activating mitochondrial pathways and reducing Ki67 expression and MVD. Low oral acute toxicity suggested it a promising chemotherapy agent.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To address this question, we assessed rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in subjects with and without NAFLD by monitoring the rate of (13)C labeling in hepatic [5-(13)C]glutamate and [1-(13)C]glutamate by (13)C MRS during an infusion of [1-(13)C]. We found that rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation were similar between NAFLD and control subjects. We also assessed rates of hepatic pyruvate cycling during an infusion of [3-(13)C]lactate by monitoring the (13)C label in hepatic [2-(13)C]alanine and [2-(13)C]glutamate and found that this flux was also similar between groups and more than 10-fold lower than previously reported. Contrary to previous studies, we show that hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate cycling are not altered in NAFLD and do not account for the hepatic fat accumulation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Wistar rats were divided into groups based on injections received before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cerebral infarction volume was detected by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolim chloride staining, and cell apoptosis was observed by transferase dUTP nick end labeling. We used transmission electron microscopy to observe mitochondrial morphology and determined superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. MtCx43, p-mtCx43, protein kinase C (PKC), and p-PKC expression were detected by Western blot. Compared with those in the IR group, cerebral infarction volumes in the carbenoxolone (CBX) and diazoxide (DZX) groups were obviously smaller, and the apoptosis indices were down-regulated. Mitochondrial morphology was damaged after I/R, especially in the IR and 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD) groups. Similarly, decreased SOD activity and increased MDA were observed after MCAO; CBX, DZX, and phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) reduced mitochondrial functional injury. Expression of mtCx43 and p-mtCx43 and the p-Cx43/Cx43 ratio were significantly lower in the IR group than in the sham group. These abnormalities were ameliorated by CBX, DZX, and PMA.

In order to resolve these problems, new plant tissue sample processing protocols for transmission electron microscopy should be developed. In the present study, we chose the LR-White resin-assisted processing protocol for the ultrastructural observation of different types of plant tissues. Moreover, we explored Oolong tea extract (OTE) as a substitute for UA in staining ultrathin sections of plant samples. The results revealed that there was no significant difference between the OTE double staining method and the traditional double staining method. Furthermore, in some organelles, such as  in root cells of tomatoes and chloroplast in leaf cells of watermelons, the OTE double staining method achieved little better results than the traditional double staining method. Therefore, OTE demonstrated good potentials in replacing UA as a counterstain on ultrathin sections. In addition, sample preparation time was significantly shortened and simplified using LR-White resin. This novel protocol reduced the time for preparing plant samples, and hazardous reagents in traditional method (acetone and UA) were also replaced by less toxic ones (ethanol and OTE).© 2018 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2018 Royal Microscopical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29786737>Anti-amyloidogenic properties of an ethyl  fraction from Actinidia arguta in Aβ-induced ICR mice.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the ameliorating effect of an ethyl  fraction from the fruit Actinidia arguta (EFAA) on amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits in ICR mice.

EFAA treatment reduced the intracellular ROS level and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the , and increased cell viability in Aβ-induced neuroblastoma MC-IXC cells. The administration of EFAA significantly attenuated Aβ-induced learning and memory deficits, which were evaluated by Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. Furthermore, EFAA showed the ameliorating effect of cholinergic functions by increasing acetylcholine (ACh) levels and decreasing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and protected antioxidant systems by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreasing the oxidized glutathione (GSH)/total GSH and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain. Finally, EFAA prevented mitochondrial dysfunction via regulating apoptotic signaling molecules including phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), Bax, and cytochrome c in the brain tissues.

After TPA-treatment, the levels of LAPTM5 mRNA and protein increased and reached a maximum at 18-36 h. In healthy human tissues, LAPTM5 mRNA was expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells and tissues, at low levels in the lung and fetal liver, and was not detected in other non-hematopoietic tissues. LAPTM5 mRNA was detected in immature malignant cells of myeloid lineage, such as K562, HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells, and in unstimulated peripheral T cells, but was absent or barely detectable in lymphoid malignant or non-hematopoietic malignant cells. The LAPTM5 level in HL-60 cells increased more significantly during TPA-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation than during DMSO-induced granulocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of GFP-LAPTM5 or LAPTM5 in HeLa cells exhibited the localization of LAPTM5 to the lysosome. In HeLa cells overexpressing LAPTM5, the Mcl-1 and Bid levels declined markedly and apoptosis was induced via Bak activation, Δψm loss, activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3, and PARP degradation without accompanying necrosis. However, these LAPTM5-induced apoptotic events except for the decline of Bid level were completely abrogated by concomitant overexpression of Mcl-1. The pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) could suppress the LAPTM5-induced apoptotic sub-G1 peak by ~40% but failed to block the induced Δψm loss, whereas the broad-range inhibitor of cathepsins (Cathepsin Inhibitor I) could suppress the LAPTM5-induced apoptotic sub-G1 peak and Δψm loss, by ~22% and ~23%, respectively, suggesting that the LAPTM5-mediated Δψm loss was exerted at least in part in a cathepsin-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of LAPTM5 in HeLa cells induced apoptosis via cleavage of Mcl-1 and Bid by a LAPTM5-associated lysosomal pathway, and subsequent activation of the -dependent caspase cascade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27618007>BL-038, a Benzofuran Derivative, Induces Cell Apoptosis in Human Chondrosarcoma Cells through Reactive Oxygen Species/Mitochondrial Dysfunction and the Caspases Dependent Pathway.</a></h2><p>Chondrosarcoma is a highly malignant cartilage-forming bone tumor that has the capacity to invade locally and cause distant metastasis. Moreover, chondrosarcoma is intrinsically resistant to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The novel benzofuran derivative, BL-038 (2-amino-3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzofuran-4-yl ), has been evaluated for its anticancer effects in human chondrosarcoma cells. BL-038 caused cell apoptosis in two human chondrosarcoma cell lines, JJ012 and SW1353, but not in primary chondrocytes. Treatment of chondrosarcoma with BL-038 also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, BL-038 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and changed mitochondrial-related apoptosis, by downregulating the anti-apoptotic activity members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) and upregulating pro-apoptotic members (Bax, Bak) of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins, key regulators of the apoptotic machinery in cells. These results demonstrate that in human chondrosarcoma cells, the apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of BL-038 are mediated by the intrinsic -mediated apoptotic pathway, which in turn causes the release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), to elicit apoptosis response.

Its toxicological effects are well known as it causes apoptosis of several cell types and tissues. This study aimed to determine the criteria required for early diagnosis of Pb poisoning in the Siberian tiger using a tiger population in China, to identify a safety Pb concentration threshold, and to provide suggestions for preventing Pb poisoning in Siberian tigers. We investigated the apoptotic effects of Pb (0, 32, 64, and 125 μM) for 12-48 h on Siberian tiger fibroblasts in vitro. Typical apoptotic effects were observed after Pb exposure. Pb strongly blocked DNA synthesis in the G0/G1 phase and induced cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Intracellular free calcium (Ca) levels, reactive oxygen species levels, and efflux of extracellular Ca were increased. The mitochondrial membrane potential was lowered. Caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were increased when fibroblasts were treated with 32, 64, and 125 μM Pb. The gene expression levels of Bax, caspase-3, -8, Fas, and p53 were increased, while that of Bcl-2 was decreased. Calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function were disturbed. Ca efflux, oxidative damage, activation of caspases, and regulation of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, -8, Fas, and p53 gene expression played an important role in the apoptotic effects.

In addition, the anti‑carcinogenic effects of EAEHJ were investigated in vitro. The results of the present study demonstrate that both phospholipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane potential were deregulated in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, following treatment with EAEHJ. Treatment with EAEHJ also increased the ratio of pro‑apoptotic B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2)‑associated X protein (Bax) to anti‑apoptotic Bcl‑2, and activated the caspase‑9 signaling pathway. These results suggest that EAEHJ is able to trigger the apoptosis of liver cancer cells via the -dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27539851>Glucose-independent  Metabolism Promotes Melanoma Cell Survival and Tumor Growth.</a></h2><p>Tumors rely on multiple nutrients to meet cellular bioenergetics and macromolecular synthesis demands of rapidly dividing cells. Although the role of glucose and glutamine in cancer metabolism is well understood, the relative contribution of  metabolism remains to be clarified. We show that glutamine supplementation is not sufficient to prevent loss of cell viability in a subset of glucose-deprived melanoma cells, but synergizes with  to support cell survival. Glucose-deprived melanoma cells depend on both oxidative phosphorylation and  metabolism for cell survival.  supplementation significantly contributed to maintenance of ATP levels in glucose-starved cells. Unlike , short chain fatty acids such as butyrate and propionate failed to prevent loss of cell viability from glucose deprivation. In vivo studies revealed that in addition to nucleo-cytoplasmic  assimilating enzyme ACSS2, mitochondrial ACSS1 was critical for melanoma tumor growth in mice. Our data indicate that  metabolism may be a potential therapeutic target for BRAF mutant melanoma.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27183727>[THE OPTIMIZATION OF NUTRITION FUNCTION UNDER SYNDROME OF RESISTANCE TO INSULIN, DISORDER OF FATTY ACIDS' METABOLISM AND ABSORPTION OF GLUCOSE BY CELLS (A LECTURE)].</a></h2><p>The phylogenetic processes continue to proceed in Homo Sapiens. At the very early stages ofphylogenesis, the ancient Archaea that formed  under symbiotic interaction with later bacterial cells conjointly formed yet another system. In this system, there are no cells' absorption of glucose if it is possible to absorb fatty acids from intercellular medium in the form of unesterfied fatty acids or ketonic bodies--metabolites of fatty acids. This is caused by objectively existed conditions and subsequent availability of substrates at the stages ofphylogenesis: , ketonic bodies, fatty acids and only later glucose. The phylogenetically late insulin used after billions years the same dependencies at formation of regulation ofmetabolism offatty acids and cells' absorption of glucose. In order that syndrome ofresistance ceased to exist as afoundation of metabolic pandemic Homo Sapiens has to understand the following. After successful function ofArchaea+bacterial cells and considered by biology action of insulin for the third time in phylogenesis and using biological function of intelligence the content ofphylogenetically earlier palmitic saturated fatty acid infood can't to exceed possibilities of phylogenetically late lipoproteins to transfer it in intercellular medium and blood and cells to absorb it. It is supposed that at early stages of phylogenesis biological function of intelligence is primarily formed to bring into line "unconformities" of regulation of metabolism against the background of seeming relative biological "perfection". These unconformities were subsequently and separately formed at the level of cells in paracrin regulated cenosises of cells and organs and at the level of organism. The prevention of resistance to insulin basically requires biological function of intelligence, principle of self-restraint, bringing into line multiple desires of Homo Sapiens with much less extensive biological possibilities. The "unconformities" of regulation of metabolism in vivo are etiological factors of all metabolic pandemics including atherosclerosis, metabolic arterial hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome Tertiannondatum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28099844> Recapturing by Nuclear Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2 Prevents Loss of Histone Acetylation during Oxygen and Serum Limitation.</a></h2><p>Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolic intermediate with an important role in transcriptional regulation. The nuclear-cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) was found to sustain the growth of hypoxic tumor cells. It generates acetyl-CoA from , but exactly which pathways it supports is not fully understood. Here, quantitative analysis of  metabolism reveals that ACSS2 fulfills distinct functions depending on its cellular location. Exogenous  uptake is controlled by expression of both ACSS2 and the mitochondrial ACSS1, and ACSS2 supports lipogenesis. The mitochondrial and lipogenic demand for two-carbon acetyl units considerably exceeds the uptake of exogenous , leaving it to only sparingly contribute to histone acetylation. Surprisingly, oxygen and serum limitation increase nuclear localization of ACSS2. We find that nuclear ACSS2 recaptures  released from histone deacetylation for recycling by histone acetyltransferases. Our work provides evidence for limited equilibration between nuclear and cytosolic acetyl-CoA and demonstrates that ACSS2 retains  to maintain histone acetylation.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Herein a potent ethyl  fraction (AC68) was newly extracted from AC, and was assessed for its anti-cancer efficacy in progression and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AC68 dose-dependently inhibited the growth and proliferation of two HCC cell lines. The AC68-induced apoptosis was observed by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and decreased survivin, XIAP, and MCL-1 expression via  membrane potential change, as well as elevated numbers of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. AC68 was also found to suppress invasion and migration of HCC cells. Moreover, it inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. In vivo study showed that AC68 significantly inhibited tumor growth in HCC mouse xenograft model, and induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The expression of PCNA was decreased by the treatment of AC68. Taken together, our data demonstrated that AC68 not only induced apoptosis but also inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway. We suggest that AC68 may be a potent chemotherapeutic candidate for the treatment of HCC.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The extensive distribution of BPA in the environment poses risks to humans. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying BPA toxicity as well as its effective detoxification and elimination are not well understood. We have investigated specifically for BPA the notion raised in the literature that the optimal sensing, detoxification, and elimination of xenobiotics requires retinoid (natural derivatives and synthetic analogs of vitamin A) actions. The objective of the study was to explore how retinoids, both those stored in the liver and those originating from recent oral intake, help maintain an optimal xenobiotic detoxification response, affecting mRNA expression and activities of elements of xenobiotic detoxification system upon BPA administration to mice. Wild-type and mice lacking hepatic retinoid stores (Lrat-/-) were acutely treated with BPA (50 mg/kg body weight), with or without oral supplementation with retinyl . Hepatic mRNA expression levels of the genes encoding nuclear receptors and their downstream targets involved in xenobiotic biotransformation, phase I and phase II enzyme activities, and levels of oxidative damage to cellular proteins and lipids in hepatic microsomes,  and cytosol, were assessed. BPA treatment induced hepatic activities needed for its detoxification and elimination in wild-type mice. However, BPA failed to induce these activities in the livers of Lrat-/- mice. Oral supplementation with retinyl  restored phase I and phase II enzyme activities, but accelerated BPA-induced oxidative damage through enhancement of non-mitochondrial ROS production. Thus, the activities of the enzymes involved in the hepatic elimination of BPA require hepatic retinoid stores. The extent of hepatic damage that arises from acute BPA intoxication is directly affected by retinoid administration during the period of BPA exposure and hepatic retinoid stores that have accumulated over the lifetime of the organism.© The Author 2017.

Preliminary investigation carried out on helminth parasites revealed that the crude extract of the plant causes deformity in the surface topography leading to death of the parasites. Therefore, the present study was conducted to identify the specific fraction of the crude leaf extract of the plant responsible for cestocidal efficacy, through biochemical and ultrastructural studies in  exposed to crude extract and its different fractions namely hexane, chloroform, ethyl  and -butanol. A dose dependent efficacy, with highest rate of mortality among -butanol exposed parasites was recorded.

Observations on histochemical distribution of some important tegumental enzymes like adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), alkaline phosphatase (AlkPase), acid phosphatase (AcPase) and 5'Nucleotidase (5'-Nu) revealed a marked diminished stain intensity in the tegument of  exposed to the crude extract and -butanol fraction of the crude extract compared to the control. Highest reduction (77.93%) in the activity of ATPase was observed when the parasites exposed to 6 mg -butanol fraction/ml of PBS.

It is well established that citrullination of histones (e.g., CitH3) facilitates chromatin decondensation during NET formation (NETosis), particularly during calcium-induced NETosis that is independent of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) activation. However, the importance of other forms of histone modifications in NETosis has not been established. We considered that acetylation of histones would also facilitate NETosis. To test this hypothesis, we induced NOX-dependent NETosis in human neutrophils with phorbol myristate  or lipopolysaccharide (from  0128), and NOX-independent NETosis with calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin (from  ) in the presence or absence of two pan histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), belinostat and panobinostat (within their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) range). The presence of these inhibitors increased histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) in neutrophils. Histone acetylation was sufficient to cause a significant increase (~20%) in NETosis in resting neutrophils above baseline values. When acetylation was promoted during NOX-dependent or -independent NETosis, the degree of NETosis additively increased (~15⁻30%). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is essential for baseline NETosis (mediated either by NOX or ); however, HDACis did not promote ROS production. The chromatin decondensation step requires promoter melting and transcriptional firing in both types of NETosis; consistent with this point, suppression of transcription prevented the NETosis induced by the acetylation of histones. Collectively, this study establishes that histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) promotes NETosis at baseline, and when induced by both NOX-dependent or -independent pathway agonists, in human neutrophils. Therefore, we propose that acetylation of histone is a key component of NETosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070143>Modulation of Na+/K+ ATPase Activity by Hydrogen Peroxide Generated through Heme in L. amazonensis.</a></h2><p>Leishmania amazonensis is a protozoan parasite that occurs in many areas of Brazil and causes skin lesions. Using this parasite, our group showed the activation of Na+/K+ ATPase through a signaling cascade that involves the presence of heme and protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Heme is an important biomolecule that has pro-oxidant activity and signaling capacity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as second messengers, which are required in various signaling cascades. Our goal in this work is to investigate the role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated in the presence of heme in the Na+/K+ ATPase activity of L. amazonensis. Our results show that increasing concentrations of heme stimulates the production of H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner until a concentration of 2.5 μM heme. To confirm that the effect of heme on the Na+/K+ ATPase is through the generation of H2O2, we measured enzyme activity using increasing concentrations of H2O2 and, as expected, the activity increased in a dose-dependent manner until a concentration of 0.1 μM H2O2. To investigate the role of PKC in this signaling pathway, we observed the production of H2O2 in the presence of its activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and its inhibitor calphostin C. Both showed no effect on the generation of H2O2. Furthermore, we found that PKC activity is increased in the presence of H2O2, and that in the presence of calphostin C, H2O2 is unable to activate the Na+/K+ ATPase. 100 μM of Mito-TEMPO was capable of abolishing the stimulatory effect of heme on Na+/K+ ATPase activity, indicating that  might be the source of the hydrogen peroxide production induced by heme. The modulation of L. amazonensis Na+/K+ ATPase by H2O2 opens new possibilities for understanding the signaling pathways of this parasite.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411581>Silica nanoparticles and lead  co-exposure triggered synergistic cytotoxicity in A549 cells through potentiation of -dependent apoptosis induction.</a></h2><p>The adverse effects of PM2.5 are the results of combined toxicities of finer particles and their adsorbed toxic pollutants.

Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a well-known olive oil antioxidant, exerts health benefits against vascular diseases by improving endothelial function. However, the HT role in mitochondrial oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction is not clear yet. To investigate the HT effects on mitochondrial ROS production in the inflamed endothelium, we used an  model of endothelial dysfunction represented by cultured endothelial cells, challenged with phorbol myristate  (PMA), an inflammatory, prooxidant, and proangiogenic agent. We found that the pretreatment of endothelial cells with HT (1-30 mol/L) suppressed inflammatory angiogenesis, a crucial aspect of endothelial dysfunction. The HT inhibitory effect is related to reduced mitochondrial superoxide production and lipid peroxidation and to increased superoxide dismutase activity. HT, in a concentration-dependent manner, improved endothelial mitochondrial function by reverting the PMA-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP synthesis, and ATP5 expression. In PMA-challenged endothelial cells, HT also promoted mitochondrial biogenesis through increased mitochondrial DNA content and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A. These results highlight that HT blunts endothelial dysfunction and pathological angiogenesis by ameliorating mitochondrial function, thus suggesting HT as a potential -targeting antioxidant in the inflamed endothelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27133385>Oxysterols in adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and death.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells characterized by self-renewal and cellular differentiation capabilities. Oxysterols comprise a very heterogeneous group derived from cholesterol through enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation. Potent effects in cell death processes, including cytoxicity and apoptosis induction, were described in several cell lines. Very little is known about the effects of oxysterols in MSCs. 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), one of the most important oxysterols, was shown to be cytotoxic to human adipose tissue-derived MSCs. Here, we describe the short-term (24h) cytotoxic effects of cholestan-3α-5β-6α-triol, 3,5 cholestan-7-one, (3α-5β-6α)- cholestane-3,6-diol, 7-oxocholest-5-en-3β-yl , and 5β-6β epoxy-cholesterol, on MSCs derived from human adipose tissue. MSCs were isolated from adipose tissue obtained from three young, healthy women. Oxysterols, with the exception of 3,5 cholestan-7-one and 7-oxocholest-5-en-3β-yl , led to a complex mode of cell death that include apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy, depending on the type of oxysterol and concentration, being cholestan-3α-5β-6α-triol the most effective. Inhibition of proliferation was also promoted by these oxysterols, but no changes in cell cycle were observed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the role of NAA regarding their intermediary metabolism remains poorly understood. Two hypotheses were proposed regarding the fate of aspartate after being released by de-acetylation: (1) aspartate is metabolized in the  of oligodendrocyte lineage cells; (2) aspartate is released to the medium. We report here that aspartoacylase mRNA expression increases when primary rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) differentiate into mature cells in culture. Moreover, characterising metabolic functions of acetyl coenzyme A and aspartate from NAA catabolism in mature oligodendrocyte cultures after 5 days using isotope-labelled glucose after 5-days of differentiation we found evidence of extensive NAA metabolism. Incubation with [1,6-C]glucose followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography analyses of cell extracts and media in the presence and absence of NAA established that the  moiety produced by hydrolysis of NAA does not enter mitochondrial metabolism in the form of acetyl coenzyme A. We also resolved the controversy concerning the possible release of aspartate to the medium: aspartate is not released to the medium by oligodendrocytes in amounts detectable by our methods. Therefore we propose that: aspartate released from NAA joins the cytosolic aspartate pool rapidly and takes part in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which transports reducing equivalents from glycolysis into the  for ATP production and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle at a slow rate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494173>Chloride channel blocker IAA-94 increases myocardial infarction by reducing calcium retention capacity of the cardiac .</a></h2><p>Indanyloxyacetic acid-94 (IAA-94), an intracellular chloride channel blocker, is shown to ablate cardioprotection rendered by ischemic preconditioning (IPC), N (6)-2-(4-aminophenyl) ethyladenosine or the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- and cyclosporin A (CsA) in both ex-vivo and in-vivo ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury.

The main disadvantage, however, is the inability of isolating mutants in non-selectable polygenic traits. Most traits of organisms, however, are non-selectable and polygenic, including industrially important properties of microorganisms. The advent of powerful technologies for polygenic analysis of complex traits has allowed simultaneous identification of multiple causative mutations among many thousands of irrelevant mutations. We now show that this also applies to haploid strains of which the genome has been loaded with induced mutations so as to affect as many non-selectable, polygenic traits as possible. We have introduced about 900 mutations into single haploid yeast strains using multiple rounds of EMS mutagenesis, while maintaining the mating capacity required for genetic mapping. We screened the strains for defects in flavor production, an important non-selectable, polygenic trait in yeast alcoholic beverage production. A haploid strain with multiple induced mutations showing reduced ethyl  production in semi-anaerobic fermentation, was selected and the underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were mapped using pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis after crossing with an unrelated haploid strain.

However, whether taraxerol induced apoptosis and its underlying mechanisms of action is not clear. In the present study, we assess the effects of taraxerol on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and determine the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol and activation of caspases.In this experimental study, we mainly investigated the effect of taraxerol on HeLa cells. We tested cell viability by the MTT assay and morphologic changes, analyzed apoptosis by DAPI staining and flow cytometry. We also determined reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using a Microplate Reader. In addition, the apoptotic proteins were tested by Western blot.Taraxerol enhanced ROS levels and attenuated the MMP (Δψm) in HeLa cells. Taraxerol induced apoptosis mainly via the mitochondrial pathway including the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol and activation of caspases 9 and 3, and anti-poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP). Taraxerol could induce the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. It suppressed the PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway.These results demonstrated that taraxerol induced cell apoptosis through a -mediated pathway in HeLa cells.

In general, tumour cells metabolize glucose, lactate, pyruvate, hydroxybutyrate, , glutamine, and fatty acids at much higher rates than their nontumour equivalents; however, the metabolic ecology of tumours is complex because they contain multiple metabolic compartments, which are linked by the transfer of these catabolites. This metabolic variability and flexibility enables tumour cells to generate ATP as an energy source, while maintaining the reduction-oxidation (redox) balance and committing resources to biosynthesis - processes that are essential for cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Importantly, experimental evidence indicates that metabolic coupling between cell populations with different, complementary metabolic profiles can induce cancer progression. Thus, targeting the metabolic differences between tumour and normal cells holds promise as a novel anticancer strategy.

Cell apoptosis and necrosis are significant to maintain the cell population, and their abnormality can lead to severe diseases including cancer. During cell death, significant changes occur in the intracellular contents and physical properties, such as decrease of esterase activity, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), increase of caspase content, dissipation of membrane asymmetry, and loss of membrane integrity. To detect cell viability, the fluorescent probes have been developed by taking advantage of these biological parameters and using various fluorescence mechanisms. These fluorescent probes can serve as powerful tools to facilitate the research in biology and pathology. In this Account, the representative examples of the fluorescent probes for cell viability during the past decades have been summarized and classified into five types based on the biological changes. The basic principle, design strategy, fluorescence mechanisms, and molecular construction of these fluorescent probes have been discussed. Furthermore, the intrinsic characteristics and merits of these probes have been illustrated. Particularly, this Account describes our recent works for the design and synthesis of the fluorescent probes to detect cell viability in the dual-color and reversible modes. The dual-color and reversible fluorescent probes are highlighted owing to their unique benefits in accurate and dynamic detection of cell viability. In general, the dual-color fluorescent probes were constructed based on the loss of esterase activity during cell death. Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process were exploited for the probe design. The construction of such dual-color probes were realized by the  of the phenyl group on fluorophores. Esterases in healthy cells hydrolyze the  and bring a spectral shift to the probes. Moreover, reversible fluorescent probes for cell viability were designed based on the depolarization of ΔΨ, with relocalization properties dependent on ΔΨ. The probes target  in healthy cells with high ΔΨ, while they are relocalized into the nucleus in unhealthy cells with depolarized ΔΨ. As ΔΨ is reversibly changed according to the cell viability, these probes reversibly detect cell viability. The reversible and simultaneously dual-color fluorescent probes were developed based on the relocalization mode and aggregation-induced emission shift. The probes target  to form aggregates with deep-red emission, while they migrate into the nucleus to present in monomers with green fluorescence. In this manner, the probes enable dual-color and reversible detection of cell viability. Fluorescent probes for cell viability based on sensing the membrane integrity, caspase activity, and membrane symmetry are also presented. High-polarity and large-size fluorescent probes impermeable to the intact lipid bilayer selectively target apoptotic cells with a destructive plasma membrane. Fluorescent probes sensing caspases in a turn-on manner exclusively light up apoptotic cells with caspase expression. Membrane-impermeable probes with high affinity to phosphatidylserine (PS) specifically stain the plasma membrane of dead cells, since PS flip-flops to the outer leaflet of the membrane during cell death. In summary, this Account illustrates the basic principles, design strategies, characteristics, and advantages of the fluorescent probes for cell viability, and it highlights the dual-color and reversible probes, which can promote the development of fluorescent probes, apoptosis studies, drug discovery, and other relative areas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28211872>Rictor/mTORC2 deficiency enhances keratinocyte stress tolerance via mitohormesis.</a></h2><p>How metabolic pathways required for epidermal tissue growth and remodeling influence the ability of keratinocytes to survive stressful conditions is still largely unknown. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) regulates growth and metabolism of several tissues, but its functions in epidermal cells are poorly defined. Rictor is an adaptor protein essential for mTORC2 activity. To explore the roles of mTORC2 in the epidermis, we have conditionally deleted rictor in mice via K14-Cre-mediated homologous recombination and found that its deficiency causes moderate tissue hypoplasia, reduced keratinocyte proliferation and attenuated hyperplastic response to TPA. Noteworthy, rictor-deficient keratinocytes displayed increased lifespan, protection from senescence, and enhanced tolerance to cellular stressors such as growth factors deprivation, epirubicin and X-ray in vitro and radioresistance in vivo. Rictor-deficient keratinocytes exhibited changes in global gene expression profiles consistent with metabolic alterations and enhanced stress tolerance, a shift in cell catabolic processes from glycids and lipids to glutamine consumption and increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistically, the resiliency of rictor-deficient epidermal cells relies on these ROS increases, indicating stress resistance via mitohormesis. Thus, our findings reveal a new link between metabolic changes and stress adaptation of keratinocytes centered on mTORC2 activity, with potential implications in skin aging and therapeutic resistance of epithelial tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30444490> induces decelerated bioenergetic metabolism in human macrophages.</a></h2><p>How  () rewires macrophage energy metabolism to facilitate survival is poorly characterized.

In contrast, infection with the vaccine strain,  BCG, or dead  induced glycolytic phenotypes with greater flux. Furthermore,  reduced the mitochondrial dependency on glucose and increased the mitochondrial dependency on fatty acids, shifting this dependency from endogenous fatty acids in uninfected cells to exogenous fatty acids in infected macrophages.

However, the effect of PKCβII on endothelial dysfunction has not been characterized in cultured endothelial cells. Here, using adenoviral PKCβII gene transfer and pharmacological inhibitors, the role of PKCβII on endothelial dysfucntion was investigated in cultured endothelial cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), p66shc phosphorylation, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte adhesion, which were inhibited by PKCβi (10 nM), a selective inhibitor of PKCβII. PMA increased the phosphorylation of CREB and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which were also inhibited by PKCβi. Gene silencing of CREB inhibited PMA-induced MnSOD expression, suggesting that CREB plays a key role in MnSOD expression. Gene silencing of PKCβII inhibited PMA-induced mitochondrial ROS, MnSOD, and ICAM-1 expression. In contrast, overexpression of PKCβII using adenoviral PKCβII increased mitochondrial ROS, MnSOD, ICAM-1, and p66shc phosphorylation in cultured endothelial cells. Finally, PKCβII-induced ICAM-1 expression was inhibited by Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS scavenger, suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial ROS in PKC-induced vascular inflammation. Taken together, the results suggest that PKCβII plays an important role in PMA-induced endothelial dysfunction, and that the inhibition of PKCβII-dependent p66shc signaling acts as a therapeutic target for vascular inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27045997>N-acetylaspartate catabolism determines cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels and histone acetylation in brown adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Histone acetylation depends on the abundance of nucleo-cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA. Here, we present a novel route for cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA production in brown adipocytes. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a highly abundant brain metabolite catabolized by aspartoacylase yielding aspartate and . The latter can be further used for acetyl-CoA production. Prior to this work, the presence of NAA has not been described in adipocytes. Here, we show that accumulation of NAA decreases the brown adipocyte phenotype. We increased intracellular NAA concentrations in brown adipocytes via media supplementation or knock-down of aspartoacylase and measured reduced lipolysis, thermogenic gene expression, and oxygen consumption. Combinations of approaches to increase intracellular NAA levels showed additive effects on lipolysis and gene repression, nearly abolishing the expression of Ucp1, Cidea, Prdm16, and Ppara. Transcriptome analyses of aspartoacylase knock-down cells indicate deficiencies in acetyl-CoA and lipid metabolism. Concordantly, cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA levels and global histone H3 acetylation were decreased. Further, activating histone marks (H3K27ac and H3K9ac) in promoters/enhancers of brown marker genes showed reduced acetylation status. Taken together, we present a novel route for cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA production in brown adipocytes. Thereby, we mechanistically connect the NAA pathway to the epigenomic regulation of gene expression, modulating the phenotype of brown adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26697948>Amelioration of apoptotic events in the skeletal muscle of intra-nigrally rotenone-infused Parkinsonian rats by Morinda citrifolia--up-regulation of Bcl-2 and blockage of cytochrome c release.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder with the cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability, which lead to abnormal movements and lack of activity, which in turn cause muscular damage. Even though studies have been carried out to elucidate the causative factors that lead to muscular damage in Parkinson's disease, apoptotic events that occur in the skeletal muscle and a therapeutical approach to culminate the muscular damage have not been extensively studied. Thus, this study evaluates the impact of rotenone-induced SNPc lesions on skeletal muscle apoptosis and the efficacy of an ethyl  extract of Morinda citrifolia in safeguarding the myocytes. Biochemical assays along with apoptotic markers studied by immunoblot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the current study revealed that the supplementation of Morinda citrifolia significantly reverted alterations in both biochemical and histological parameters in rotenone-infused PD rats. Treatment with Morinda citrifolia also reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 and blocked the release of cytochrome c from  induced by rotenone. In addition, it augmented the expression of Bcl2 both transcriptionally and translationally. Thus, this preliminary study paves a way to show that the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activities of Morinda citrifolia can be exploited to alleviate skeletal muscle damage induced by Parkinsonism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28030582>Therapeutic Targeting of the  Initiates Excessive Superoxide Production and Mitochondrial Depolarization Causing Decreased mtDNA Integrity.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysregulation is closely associated with excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Altered redox homeostasis has been implicated in the onset of several diseases including cancer. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and proteins are particularly sensitive to ROS as they are in close proximity to the respiratory chain (RC). Mitoquinone (MitoQ), a -targeted redox agent, selectively damages breast cancer cells possibly through damage induced via enhanced ROS production. However, the effects of MitoQ and other triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) conjugated agents on cancer mitochondrial homeostasis remain unknown. The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of -targeted agent [(MTAs) conjugated to TPP+: mitoTEMPOL, mitoquinone and mitochromanol-] on mitochondrial physiology and mtDNA integrity in breast (MDA-MB-231) and lung (H23) cancer cells. The integrity of the mtDNA was assessed by quantifying the degree of mtDNA fragmentation and copy number, as well as by measuring mitochondrial proteins essential to mtDNA stability and maintenance (TFAM, SSBP1, TWINKLE, POLG and POLRMT). Mitochondrial status was evaluated by measuring superoxide production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification and mRNA or protein levels of the RC complexes along with TCA cycle activity. In this study, we demonstrated that all investigated MTAs impair mitochondrial health and decrease mtDNA integrity in MDA-MB-231 and H23 cells. However, differences in the degree of mitochondrial damage and mtDNA degradation suggest unique properties among each MTA that may be cell line, dose and time dependent. Collectively, our study indicates the potential for TPP+ conjugated molecules to impair breast and lung cancer cells by targeting mitochondrial homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26082307>Mitochondrial permeability transition and its regulatory components are implicated in apoptosis of primary cultures of rat proximal tubular cells exposed to lead.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have already demonstrated that  play a key role in Pb-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of rat proximal tubular (rPT) cells. To further clarify the underlying mechanism of Pb-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, this study was designed to investigate the role of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and its regulatory components in Pb-induced apoptosis in rPT cells. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening together with disruption of mitochondrial ultrastructure, translocation of cytochrome c from  to cytoplasm and subsequent caspase-3 activation were observed in this study, suggesting that MPT is involved in Pb-induced apoptosis in rPT cells. Simultaneously, Pb-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis can be significantly inhibited by three MPTP inhibitors (CsA, DIDS, BA), which target different regulatory components of MPTP (Cyp-D, VDAC, ANT), respectively, demonstrating that Cyp-D, VDAC and ANT participate in MPTP regulation during lead exposure. Moreover, decreased ATP levels and increased ADP/ATP ratio induced by lead treatment can be significantly reversed by BA, indicating that Pb-mediated ANT dysfunction resulted in ATP depletion. In addition, up-regulation of VDAC-1, ANT-1 together with down-regulation of Cyp-D, VDAC-2 and ANT-2 at both the levels of transcription and translation were revealed in rPT cells under lead exposure conditions. In conclusion, Pb-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in rPT cells is dependent on MPTP opening. Different expression levels in each isoform of three regulatory components contribute to alteration in their functions, which may promote the MPTP opening.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649621>Mitochondrial Dysfunction Pathway Networks and Mitochondrial Dynamics in the Pathogenesis of Pituitary Adenomas.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrion is a multi-functional organelle, which is associated with various signaling pathway networks, including energy metabolism, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, cell cycles, autophagy, and immunity process. Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway networks, and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling pathways operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest  play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting  are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, gossypol , Yougui pill, T-2 toxin, grifolic acid, cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin.

Cold storage under basic conditions resulted in sufficient chemical stability for use in hyperpolarized (HP) MRI studies. Polarizations and relaxation times of HP [1,3- C ]AcAc were measured in a clinical 3T MRI scanner, and 8 rats were scanned by dynamic HP  C MR spectroscopy of a slab through the kidneys. Four rats were scanned after acute treatment with high dose metformin (125 mg/kg, intravenous), which is known to modulate mitochondrial redox via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. An additional metformin-treated rat was scanned by abdominal 2D CSI (8 mm × 8 mm).Polarizations of 7 ± 1% and 7 ± 3%, and T relaxation times of 58 ± 5 s and 52 ± 3 s, were attained at the C and C positions, respectively. Rapid conversion of HP AcAc to βOHB was detected in rat kidney in vivo, via the C label. The product HP βOHB was resolved from closely resonating . Conversion to βOHB was also detected via 2D CSI, in both kidney as well as liver regions. Metformin treatment resulted in a significant increase (40%, P = 0.01) of conversion of HP AcAc to βOHB.Rapid conversion of HP AcAc to βOHB was observed in rat kidney in vivo and is a promising new non-invasive marker of mitochondrial redox state.

Its potential as a therapeutic target is well recognized, but inhibitors of FASN have not yet been approved for cancer therapy. Orlistat (ORL), an FDA-approved lipase inhibitor, is also an effective inhibitor of FASN. However, ORL is extremely hydrophobic and has low systemic uptake after oral administration. Thus, new strategies are required to formulate ORL for cancer treatment as a FASN inhibitor. Here, we report the development of a nanoparticle (NP) formulation of ORL using amphiphilic bioconjugates that are derived from hyaluronic acid (HA), termed Nano-ORL. The NPs were loaded with up to 20 wt % weight of ORL at greater than 95% efficiency. The direct inhibition of the human recombinant thioesterase domain of FASN by ORL extracted from Nano-ORL was similar to that of stock ORL. Nano-ORL demonstrated a similar ability to inhibit cellular FASN activity when compared to free ORL, as demonstrated by analysis of (14)C- incorporation into lipids. Nano-ORL treatment also disrupted mitochondrial function similarly to ORL by reducing adenosine triphosphate turnover in MDA-MB-231 and LNCaP cells. Nano-ORL demonstrated increased potency compared to ORL toward prostate and breast cancer cells. Nano-ORL decreased viability of human prostate and breast cancer cell lines to 55 and 57%, respectively, while free ORL decreased viability to 71 and 79% in the same cell lines. Moreover, Nano-ORL retained cytotoxic activity after a 24 h preincubation in aqueous conditions. Preincubation of ORL dramatically reduced the efficacy of ORL as indicated by high cell viability (>85%) in both breast and prostate cell lines. These data demonstrate that NP formulation of ORL using HA-derived polymers retains similar levels of FASN, lipid synthesis, and ATP turnover inhibition while significantly improving the cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392313>[Cellular damage of low-dose combined exposure to mercury, lead and cadmium on hippocampal neurons in rats].</a></h2><p> To observe the cellular damage of low-dose combined exposure to Hg, Pb and Cd on hippocampal neurons in rat.  SH-SY5Y cells were randomly divided into 8 groups by 2×2×2 factorial design: control group, Pb exposure group, Hg exposure group, Pb+Hg exposure group, Pb+Cd exposure group, Hg+Cd exposure group and Pb+Cd+Hg exposure group. And the cell viabilities were measured. On this basis, an animal model was established. Twenty eight-week-old SD pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups by random number table, and five in each group: the control group(distilled water), 1-fold metal mixture exposure group (1×MM, poisoning solution containing mercury chloride 0.15 mg/L, lead  trihydrate 25 mg/L, cadmium chloride 7.5 mg/L), 5-fold metal mixture exposure group (5×MM, poisoning solution containing mercury chloride 0.75 mg/L, lead  trihydrate 125.00 mg/L, cadmium chloride 37.50 mg/L), 10-fold metal mixture exposure group (10×MM, poisoning solution containing mercury chloride 1.50 mg/L, lead  trihydrate 250.00 mg/L, cadmium chloride 75.00 mg/L). Pregnant rats drank water until delivery. Twenty male pups were selected and exposed to these metals through breast milk until weaned. The heavy metals dose of poisoning water was adjusted, and then the weaned rats were exposed to heavy metals via drinking poisoning water until adulthood (postnatal day 83). The blood samples and brain hippocampus samples were collected to observe the ultrastructural changes of hippocampus, and to determine the levels of Hg, Pb and Cd in blood. In addition, apoptosis rate and fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in hippocampal neurons were measured.  Cellular factorial design analysis showed that Hg+Pb+Cd (at no observed adverse effect level, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 μmol/L, respectively)had a interaction on cell viability after 48 or 72 hours of combined exposure (<0.05). The results of ultrastructure showed that  decreased, ridges and matrixes gradually dissolved in rat hippocampal neurons of 5×MM group; nuclear chromatin aggregated, more ridges and matrixes dissolved and the  also decreased in rat hippocampal neurons of 10×MM group. The concentration of Hg, Pb and Cd in the blood of 1×MM group, 5×MM group and 10×MM group were higher than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (0.001). There was no significant difference in apoptosis rate between the 1×MM group and the control group. The apoptosis rate of 5×MM group and 10×MM group was higher than that in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species in hippocampal neurons of the 1×MM group and the control group. The fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species in the 5×MM group and the 10×MM group was higher than that in the control group, the difference was statistically significant (<0.05). There was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of [Ca(2+)](i) between the 1×MM group and the control group. The fluorescence intensity values of [Ca(2+)](i) in the 5×MM group and the 10×MM group were higher than the control group, the differences were statistically significant (0.001).  Low-level combined exposure to Hg, Pb, and Cd caused synergistic neurotoxic damage, and the process may be related to the changes of neuronal apoptosis, reactive oxide species, and [Ca(2+)](i) levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26498778>Live-Cell Imaging of  and the Actin Cytoskeleton in Budding Yeast.</a></h2><p>Maintenance and regulation of proper mitochondrial dynamics and functions are necessary for cellular homeostasis.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the beneficial effects of morin in protecting the lead  (PbAc)-induced oxidative stress in rat brain. PbAc intoxication resulted in motor deficit, memory impairment and oxidative stress Further, PbAc administration alters Bax/Bcl-2 expression thereby increases cytochrome c release from the . Treatment with morin at a dose of 40 mg/kg b.wt. significantly restored back the abnormal changes that were noticed in PbAc intoxicated rats. Histopathological sections of cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus showed the extent of neuronal loss in PbAc induced rats and its restoration upon administration of morin. These outcomes imply that morin might be employed therapeutically to chelate toxic metals like Pb, thus possibly lowering PbAc-induced neurotoxicity and tissue damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We studied the effect of ghrelin in human Sertoli cells (hSCs) metabolic phenotype. For that, hSCs were exposed to increasing concentrations of ghrelin (20, 100 and 500 pM) mimicking the levels reported in obese, normal weight, and severely undernourished individuals. The metabolite production/consumption was determined. The protein levels of key glycolysis-related transporters and enzymes were assessed. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured. Mitochondrial complexes protein levels and  membrane potential were also measured. We showed that hSCs express the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. At the concentration present in the plasma of normal weight men, ghrelin caused a decrease of glucose consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential in hSCs, though LDH activity and lactate production remained unchanged, illustrating an alteration of glycolytic flux efficiency. Exposure of hSCs to levels of ghrelin found in the plasma of severely undernourished individuals decreased pyruvate consumption and mitochondrial complex III protein expression. All concentrations of ghrelin decreased alanine and  production by hSCs. Notably, the effects of ghrelin levels found in severely undernourished individuals were more pronounced in hSCs metabolic phenotype highlighting the importance of a proper eating behavior to maintain male reproductive potential. In conclusion, ghrelin acts as an energy status sensor for hSCs in a dose-dependent manner, showing an inverse association with the production of lactate, thus controlling the nutritional support of spermatogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In mammalian cells the central precursor for lipid biosynthesis, cytosolic acetyl CoA (Ac-CoA), is produced by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) from -derived citrate or by acetyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) from . It has been reported that ACLY is the primary enzyme involved in making cytosolic Ac-CoA in cells with abundant nutrients. However, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we have shown that ACLY is not essential for HCMV growth and virally induced lipogenesis. Instead, we found that in HCMV-infected cells glucose carbon can be used for lipid synthesis by both ACLY and ACSS2 reactions. Further, the ACSS2 reaction can compensate for the loss of ACLY. However, in ACSS2-KO human fibroblasts both HCMV-induced lipogenesis from glucose and viral growth were sharply reduced. This reduction suggests that glucose-derived  is being used to synthesize cytosolic Ac-CoA by ACSS2. Previous studies have not established a mechanism for the production of  directly from glucose metabolism. Here we show that HCMV-infected cells produce more glucose-derived pyruvate, which can be converted to  through a nonenzymatic mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563649>Nitidine chloride induces S phase cell cycle arrest and -dependent apoptosis in HaCaT cells and ameliorates skin lesions in psoriasis-like mouse models.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis is a common dermatosis causing considerable inconvenience to 4% of the general population. Traditional psoriasis treatments often cause side effects, drug resistance and complications, necessitating development of safer and more effective treatments. In this study, we screened over 600 natural compounds to identify viability inhibitors of human HaCaT keratinocytes cultured in vitro. The results showed that nitidine chloride was a highly effective inhibitor. Further studies revealed that nitidine chloride inhibited HaCaT proliferation and induced S phase cell cycle arrest; these effects were associated with reduced DNA synthesis, decreased Ki67, cyclin A, and cyclin D1 levels, and increased p53 protein expression. Nitidine chloride also significantly downregulated bcl-2 and upregulated bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3. Mechanistic studies revealed that nitidine chloride-induced apoptosis involved the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. More importantly, in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- (TPA)- and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation models, nitidine chloride inhibited topical edema in mouse ear and back skin, substantially reducing tissue thickness and weight. In some cases, nitidine chloride also ameliorated conditions caused by TPA and IMQ, such as angiogenesis and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells around blood vessels. Additionally, nitidine chloride inhibited the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines in the two animal models. In conclusion, our results are the first to demonstrate that nitidine chloride inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT cells, induces apoptosis partly via the JNK signaling pathway in vitro and ameliorates skin lesions and inflammation in vivo, making it an appropriate candidate for psoriasis treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

While the compounds in EAEPT which possessed the anti-tumor activity were unclear. Peperobtusin A is a phenolic compound, which was isolated from the whole plant of Peperomia tetraphylla. In this work, we found that peperobtusin A had the anti-proliferative effects against human lymphoma U937 cells and induced apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. Peperobtusin A significantly enhanced the formation of intracellular ROS and induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). And peperobtusin A could increase the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, induce the cleavage of Bid, Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 and enhance the level of P-P38. Moreover, peperobtusin A induced the accumulation of cells at S phase. Through using of inhibitors such as antioxidant NAC, pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, p38 MAPK specific inhibitor SB203580, we found that intracellular ROS generation, activation of Caspases and p38 MAPK played very important roles in the apoptosis induced by peperobtusin A in U937 cells.

Administration of EFDM (20 and 50mg/kg body weight) in HFD-induced diabetic mice significantly improved glucose tolerance status in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). In animal experiments using Y-maze, passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests, the cognitive and behavioral disorders in HFD-induced diabetic mice were considerably recovered by regulating cholinergic systems, including acetylcholine (ACh) levels and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, and antioxidant systems, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), oxidized GSH, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Furthermore, HFD-induced abnormal activity of  were also significantly protected by the improvement of the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) signaling pathway with phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate (p-IRS), serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Finally, rutin, orientin, isoorientin, and luteolin-7-O-rutinoside as the main phenolics of EFDM were identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS(2)). These findings suggest that EFDM may have an effect as a multiple preventive substances to reduce diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Astrocytes cultured in ammonia have shown mitochondrial dysfunction and in rat models of liver failure, de novo lactate production in the brain has been observed and has led to a hypothesis of compromised brain metabolism during ALF. In contrast, normal lactate levels are found in cerebral microdialysate of ALF patients and the oxygen: glucose ratio of cerebral metabolic rates remains normal. To investigate this inconsistency we studied the mitochondrial function in brain tissue with respirometry in animal models of hyperammonaemia. Wistar rats with systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide or liver insufficiency induced by 90% hepatectomy were given ammonium or sodium  for 120 min. A cerebral cortex homogenate was studied with respirometry and substrates of the citric acid cycle, uncouplers and inhibitors of the mitochondrial complexes were successively added to investigate the mitochondrial function in detail. In a separate dose-response experiment cortex from healthy rats was incubated for 120 min in ammonium  in concentrations up to 80 mM prior to respirometry. Hyperammonaemia was associated with elevated ICP and increased tissue lactate concentration. No difference between groups was found in total respiratory capacity or the function of individual mitochondrial complexes. Ammonium in concentrations of 40 and 80 mM reduced the respiratory capacity in vitro. In conclusion, acute hyperammonaemia leads to elevated ICP and cerebral lactate accumulation. We found no indications of impaired oxidative metabolism in vivo but only in vitro at extreme concentrations of ammonium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29493120>Mitochondrial Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 3 is Biosignature of Gastric Cancer Progression.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol affects cancer progression, and acetyl-CoA is the primary cholesterogenesis substrate. The previous work has defined cholesterol bioflux via lipoprotein/receptor route is the gastric cancer (GCa) prognosis biosignature. The prognosis importance of acetyl-CoA to cholesterogenesis (mevalonate pathway) in GCa is yet to be defined. Using Kaplan-Meier Plotter web-based gene survival analyzer and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-database analyzed with DBdriver.v2 platform, we revealed acetyl-CoA production and the mevalonate pathway are associated with GCa prognosis. We found mitochondrial-derived acetyl-CoA contributing enzymes (acyl-coA synthetase super-family 3; ACSS3) is the GCa progression confounder. Interestingly, it is not HMGCR (the committee enzyme of mevalonate pathway), but lower mevalonate pathway enzymes (e.g., MVK, LSS, DHCR14A1, SC4MOL, HSD17B7, SC5D) promote GCa patients 5-years overall survival in a differential level. Advanced analyses found ACSS3 is prognosis biosignatures for multiple GCa disease conditions. This report uncovered a higher expression of ACSS3 in tumor comparing to normal parental lesions, which implicates a targeting value for GCa therapy. While knockdown ACSS3 could suppress growth and invasion of GCa cells, of which even more impactful under starvation condition. This is the first report, surprisingly, revealed ACSS3 as important cancer prognosis biomarker. Targeting ACSS3 could be a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer, in this case, GCa.© 2018 The Authors.

Recent studies have revealed the anticancer potential of this plant but not much work has been done on the anticancer chemical constituents actually responsible for its amazing anticancer effects. This prompted us to investigate this plant further for new potent anticancer molecules.The present study was designed to isolate and identify new promising anticancer candidates from the aqueous alcoholic extract of T. cordifolia using bioassay-guided fractionation.The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation and that of new potent anticancer molecule, TC-2 was confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis of its corresponding . The in vitro anti-cancer activity of TC-2 was evaluated by SRB assay and the autophagic activity was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Annexin-V FITC and PI dual staining was applied for the detection of apoptosis. The studies on Mitochondrial Membrane potential and ROS (Reactive oxygen species) production were also done.Bioassay guided fractionation and purification of the aqueous alcoholic stem extract of Tinospora cordifolia led to the isolation of a new clerodane furano diterpene glycoside (TC-2) along with five known compounds i.e. cordifolioside A (β-D-Glucopyranoside,4-(3-hydroxy-1-propenyl)- 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl 3-O-D-apio-β-D-furanosyl) (TC-1), β-Sitosterol(TC-3), 2β,3β:15,16-Diepoxy- 4α, 6β-dihydroxy-13(16),14-clerodadiene-17,12:18,1-diolide (TC-4), ecdysterone(TC-5) and tinosporoside(TC-6). TC-2 emerged as a potential candidate for the treatment of colon cancer.The overall study on the bioassay guided isolation of T.cordifolia identified and isolated a new clerodane furano diterpenoid that exhibited anticancer activity via induction of  mediated apoptosis and autophagy in HCT116 cells.

However, the transcriptional, metabolic, and epigenetic regulation of Trm cell and TIL development and function is largely undefined. Here, we found that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 was specifically required for Trm cell and TIL development and polyfunctionality. Local PD-1 signaling inhibited TIL Bhlhe40 expression, and Bhlhe40 was critical for TIL reinvigoration following anti-PD-L1 blockade. Mechanistically, Bhlhe40 sustained Trm cell and TIL mitochondrial fitness and a functional epigenetic state. Building on these findings, we identified an epigenetic and metabolic regimen that promoted Trm cell and TIL gene signatures associated with tissue residency and polyfunctionality. This regimen empowered the anti-tumor activity of CD8 T cells and possessed therapeutic potential even at an advanced tumor stage in mouse models.

CL is synthesized de novo and undergoes remodeling in the mitochondrial membranes. Perturbation of CL remodeling leads to the rare X-linked genetic disorder Barth syndrome, which shows disparities in clinical presentation. To uncover biochemical modifiers that exacerbate CL deficiency, we carried out a synthetic genetic array screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the yeast CL synthase mutant crd1Δ. The results indicated that crd1Δ is synthetically lethal with mutants in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA levels were decreased in the mutant. The synthesis of acetyl-CoA depends primarily on the PDH-catalyzed conversion of pyruvate in the  and on the PDH bypass in the cytosol, which synthesizes acetyl-CoA from . Consistent with perturbation of the PDH bypass, crd1Δ cells grown on  as the sole carbon source exhibited decreased growth, decreased acetyl-CoA, and increased intracellular  levels resulting from decreased acetyl-CoA synthetase activity. PDH mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in crd1Δ cells, but PDH enzyme activity was not increased, indicating that PDH up-regulation did not compensate for defects in the PDH bypass. These findings demonstrate for the first time that CL is required for acetyl-CoA synthesis, which is decreased in CL-deficient cells as a result of a defective PDH bypass pathway.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30589837>Assessment of prenatal cerebral and cardiac metabolic changes in a rabbit model of fetal growth restriction based on 13C-labelled substrate infusions and ex vivo multinuclear HRMAS.</a></h2><p>We have used a previously reported rabbit model of fetal growth restriction (FGR), reproducing perinatal neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular impairments, to investigate the main relative changes in cerebral and cardiac metabolism of term FGR fetuses during nutrient infusion.FGR was induced in 9 pregnant New Zealand rabbits at 25 days of gestation: one horn used as FGR, by partial ligation of uteroplacental vessels, and the contralateral as control (appropriate for gestation age, AGA). At 30 days of gestation, fasted mothers under anesthesia were infused i.v. with 1-13C-glucose (4 mothers), 2-13C- (3 mothers), or not infused (2 mothers). Fetal brain and heart samples were quickly harvested and frozen down. Brain cortex and heart apex regions from 30 fetuses were studied ex vivo by HRMAS at 4°C, acquiring multinuclear 1D and 2D spectra. The data were processed, quantified by peak deconvolution or integration, and normalized to sample weight.Most of the total 13C-labeling reaching the fetal brains/hearts (80-90%) was incorporated to alanine and lactate (cytosol), and to the glutamine-glutamate pool (). -derived lactate (Lac C2C3) had a slower turnover in FGR brains (~ -20%). In FGR hearts, mitochondrial turnover of -derived glutamine (Gln C4) was slower (-23%) and there was a stronger accumulation of phospholipid breakdown products (glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine, +50%), resembling the profile of non-infused control hearts.Our results indicate specific functional changes in cerebral and cardiac metabolism of FGR fetuses under nutrient infusion, suggesting glial impairment and restricted mitochondrial metabolism concomitant with slower cell membrane turnover in cardiomyocytes, respectively. These prenatal metabolic changes underlie neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular problems observed in this FGR model and in clinical patients, paving the way for future studies aimed at evaluating metabolic function postnatally and in response to stress and/or treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29977232>Enhanced Triacylglycerol Production With Genetically Modified .</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is important in the production of lipids in oleaginous yeast, but other yeast may bypass the  (PDH bypass), converting pyruvate in the cytosol to acetaldehyde, then  and acetyl CoA which is further converted to lipids. Using a metabolic model based on the oleaginous yeast , we found that introduction of this bypass to an oleaginous yeast should result in enhanced yield of triacylglycerol (TAG) on substrate.  (formerly ) is an oleaginous yeast which can produce TAGs from both glucose and xylose. Based on the sequenced genome, it lacks at least one of the enzymes needed to complete the PDH bypass, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD), and may also be deficient in pyruvate decarboxylase and acetyl-CoA synthetase under production conditions. We introduced these genes to  in various combinations and demonstrated that the yield of TAG on both glucose and xylose was improved, particularly at high C/N ratio. Expression of a phospholipid:diacyltransferase encoding gene in conjunction with the PDH bypass further enhanced lipid production. The yield of TAG on xylose (0.27 g/g) in the engineered strain approached the theoretical maximum yield of 0.289 g/g. Interestingly, TAG production was also enhanced compared to the control in some strains which were given only part of the bypass pathway, suggesting that these genes may contribute to alternative routes to cytoplasmic acetyl CoA. The metabolic model indicated that the improved yield of TAG on substrate in the PDH bypass was dependent on the production of NADPH by ALD. NADPH for lipid synthesis is otherwise primarily supplied by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This would contribute to the greater improvement of TAG production from xylose compared to that observed from glucose when the PDH bypass was introduced, since xylose enters metabolism through the non-oxidative part of the PPP. Yield of TAG from xylose in the engineered strains (0.21-0.27 g/g) was comparable to that obtained from glucose and the highest so far reported for lipid or TAG production from xylose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26365852>Does allicin combined with vitamin B-complex have superior potentials than alpha-tocopherol alone in ameliorating lead -induced Purkinje cell alterations in rats?

The subject of this study is to evaluate the antiproliferation effects on oral cancer cells by Nepenthes plants using ethyl  extract of Nepenthes adrianii x clipeata (EANA). Cell viability was detected using MTS assay. Its detailed mechanisms including cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage were explored by flow cytometry or western blotting. For 24 hours EANA treatment, five kinds of oral cancer cells (CAL 27, Ca9-22, OECM-1, HSC-3, and SCC9) show IC values of cell viability ranging from 8 to 17 μg/mL but the viability of normal oral cells (HGF-1) remains over 80%. Subsequently, CAL 27 and Ca9-22 cells with high sensitivity to EANA were chosen to investigate the detailed mechanism. EANA displays the time course and concentration effects for inducing apoptosis based on flow cytometry (subG1 and annexin V analyses) and western blotting [cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP)]. Oxidative stress and DNA damage were induced by EANA treatments in oral cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, mitochondrial superoxide, and γH2AX. All these changes of EANA treatments in oral cancer cells were reverted by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine pretreatment.

In the last decade, MROs have been discovered from a phylogenetically broad range of eukaryotic lineages and these organelles have been revealed to possess diverse metabolic capacities. In this study, the biochemical characteristics of an MRO in the free-living anaerobic protist Cantina marsupialis, which represents an independent lineage in stramenopiles, were inferred based on RNA-seq data. We found transcripts for proteins known to function in one form of MROs, the hydrogenosome, such as pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, iron-hydrogenase, :succinate CoA-transferase, and succinyl-CoA synthase, along with transcripts for acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming). These proteins possess putative mitochondrial targeting signals at their N-termini, suggesting dual ATP generation systems through anaerobic pyruvate metabolism in Cantina MROs. In addition, MROs in Cantina were also shown to share several features with canonical , including amino acid metabolism and an "incomplete" tricarboxylic acid cycle. Transcripts for all four subunits of complex II (CII) of the electron transport chain were detected, while there was no evidence for the presence of complexes I, III, IV, or F1Fo ATPase.

Glucocorticoids are used to treat this chronic disease, however their efficacy is low and new drugs are very much required. 17-oxo-DHA is a cyclooxygenase-2-dependent, electrophilic, α,β-unsaturated keto-derivative of docosahexaenoic acid with anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the action of 17-oxo-DHA alone or in combination with the steroid fluticasone propionate (FP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COPD patients and healthy individuals exposed to lipopolysaccharide. We show that PBMCs from COPD patients released higher levels of TNFα and IL-1β compared to controls. 17-oxo-DHA displayed strong anti-inflammatory effects. The addition of 17-oxo-DHA in combination with FP showed enhanced anti-inflammatory effects through the modulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. 17-oxo-DHA, but not FP, was able to suppress the release of mature IL-1β through inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, 17-oxo-DHA inhibited inflammasome-dependent degradation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Our findings suggest that 17-oxo-DHA in combination with FP or other steroids might achieve higher therapeutic efficacy than steroids alone. Combined treatment might be particularly relevant in those conditions where increased inflammasome activation may lead to GR degradation and steroid-unresponsive inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27801783>Cytotoxicity of 11-epi-Sinulariolide  Isolated from Cultured Soft Corals on HA22T Cells through the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathway and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Natural compounds from soft corals have been increasingly used for their antitumor therapeutic properties.

Cell viability was investigated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and the results demonstrated that 11--SA treatment showed more cytotoxic effect toward HA22T cells. Protein profiling of the 11--SA-treated HA22T cells revealed substantial protein alterations associated with stress response and protein synthesis and folding, suggesting that the  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) play roles in 11--SA-initiated apoptosis. Moreover, 11--SA activated caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death, suggesting that -related apoptosis genes were involved in programmed cell death. The unfolded protein response signaling pathway-related proteins were also activated on 11--SA treatment, and these changes were accompanied by the upregulated expression of  () and  ()  (), the genes encoding transcription factors associated with growth arrest and apoptosis under prolonged ER stress. Two inhibitors, namely salubrinal (Sal) and SP600125, partially abrogated 11--SA-related cell death, implying that the protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-activating transcription factor (ATF) 6-CHOP or the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-cJun signal pathway was activated after 11--SA treatment.

The protective role of arjunolic acid (AA; 2,3,23-trihydroxy olean-12-en-28-oic acid) is studied in the modulation of neutrophil functions in vitro by measuring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Neutrophils were isolated from normal and acute MI mice to find out the efficacy of AA in reducing oxidative stress. Stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) resulted in an oxidative burst of superoxide anion (O2(-)) and enhanced release of lysosomal enzymes. The treatment of neutrophils with PMA induced phosphorylation of Ser345 on p47(phox), a cytosolic component of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, we observed activated ERK induced phosphorylation of Ser345 in MI neutrophils. Treatment with AA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of P47(phox) and ERK in the stimulated controls and MI neutrophils. Oxidative phosphorylation activities in MI cells were lower than in control, while the glycolysis rates were elevated in MI cells compared to the control. In addition, we observed AA decreased intracellular oxidative stress and reduced the levels of O2(-) in neutrophils.

Despite this dramatic reduction in genome size, B. saltans and trypanosomatids still share a significant number of common metabolic traits: glycosomes; a unique set of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway genes; an ATP-PFK which is homologous to the bacterial PPi -PFKs rather than to the canonical eukaryotic ATP-PFKs; an alternative oxidase; three phosphoglycerate kinases and two GAPDH isoenzymes; a pyruvate kinase regulated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; trypanothione as a substitute for glutathione; synthesis of fatty acids via a unique set of elongase enzymes; and a mitochondrial :succinate coenzyme A transferase. B. saltans has lost the capacity to synthesize ubiquinone. Among genes that are present in B. saltans and lost in all trypanosomatids are those involved in the degradation of mureine, tryptophan and lysine. Novel acquisitions of trypanosomatids are components of pentose sugar metabolism, pteridine reductase and bromodomain-factor proteins. In addition, only the subfamily Leishmaniinae has acquired a gene for catalase and the capacity to convert diaminopimelic acid to lysine.© 2016 The Author(s) Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology © 2016 International Society of Protistologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29445224>Lup-20(29)-en-3β,28-di-yl-nitrooxy  affects MCF-7 proliferation through the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in .</a></h2><p>Betulin (BT), a pentacyclic lupine-type triterpenoid natural product, possesses antitumor activity in various types of cancers. However, its clinical development was discouraged due to its low biological activities and poor solubility. We prepared lup-20(29)-en-3β,28-di-yl-nitrooxy  (NBT), a derivative of BT, that was chemically modified at position 3 of ring A and C-28 by introducing a NO-releasing moiety. This study mainly explored the mechanism of NBT in treating breast cancer through the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in . NBT possessed a potent antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, NBT affected cell death through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and autophagy. NBT induced cell cycle arrest in the G/G phase by decreasing the expression of cyclin D1. It also induced mitochondrial apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bax, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and mitochondrial membrane potential loss and leaks of cytochrome c (Cyt C) from  in MCF-7 cells and decreasing the expression of mitochondrial Bcl-2. We further demonstrated whether chloroquine (CQ), which inhibits the degradation of autophagosome induced by NBT, affects the proliferation of MCF-7 cells compared with NBT. The experiments inferred that the combination of NBT and CQ significantly promoted MCF-7 cell  to divide and Cyt C to be released from  to the cytoplasm, resulting in an increased apoptosis rate. The in vivo experiments showed that NBT inhibited the growth of MCF-7 tumor via the apoptosis pathway, and its effect was similar to 5-fluorouracil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771233>The probiotic Propionibacterium freudenreichii as a new adjuvant for TRAIL-based therapy in colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is a well-known apoptosis inducer, which activates the extrinsic death pathway. TRAIL is pro-apoptotic on colon cancer cells, while not cytotoxic towards normal healthy cells. However, its clinical use is limited by cell resistance to cell death which occurs in approximately 50% of cancer cells. Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are also known to specifically induce apoptosis of cancer cells. In accordance, we have shown that food grade dairy propionibacteria induce intrinsic apoptosis of colon cancer cells, via the production and release of SCFA (propionate and ) acting on . Here, we investigated possible synergistic effect between Propionibacterium freudenreichii and TRAIL. Indeed, we hypothesized that acting on both extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways may exert a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect. Whole transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that propionibacterial supernatant or propionibacterial metabolites (propionate and ), in combination with TRAIL, increased pro-apoptotic gene expression (TRAIL-R2/DR5) and decreased anti-apoptotic gene expression (FLIP, XIAP) in HT29 human colon cancer cells. The revealed synergistic pro-apoptotic effect, depending on both death receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5) and caspases (caspase-8, -9 and -3) activation, was lethal on cancer cells but not on normal human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC), and was inhibited by Bcl-2 expression. Finally, milk fermented by P. freudenreichii induced HT29 cells apoptosis and enhanced TRAIL cytotoxic activity, as did P. freudenreichii DMEM culture supernatants or its SCFA metabolites. These results open new perspectives for food grade P. freudenreichii-containing products in order to potentiate TRAIL-based cancer therapy in colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28798698>β-Catenin Knockdown Affects Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Lipid Metabolism in Breast Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>β-catenin plays an important role as regulatory hub in several cellular processes including cell adhesion, metabolism, and epithelial mesenchymal transition. This is mainly achieved by its dual role as structural component of cadherin-based adherens junctions, and as a key nuclear effector of the Wnt pathway. For this dual role, different classes of proteins are differentially regulated via β-catenin dependent mechanisms. Here, we applied a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach to identify proteins modulated after β-catenin knockdown in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. We used a label free analysis to compare trypsin-digested proteins from CTR (shCTR) and β-catenin knockout cells (shβcat). This led to the identification of 98 differentially expressed proteins, 53 of them were up-regulated and 45 down-regulated. Loss of β-catenin induced morphological changes and a significant modulation of the expression levels of proteins associated with primary metabolic processes. In detail, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle were found to be down-regulated, whereas proteins associated to lipid metabolism were found up-regulated in shβcat compared to shCTR. A loss of mitochondrial mass and membrane potential was also assessed by fluorescent probes in shβcat cells with respect to the controls. These data are consistent with the reduced expression of transcriptional factors regulating mitochondrial biogenesis detected in shβcat cells. β-catenin driven metabolic reprogramming resulted also in a significant modulation of lipogenic enzyme expression and activity. Compared to controls, β-catenin knockout cells showed increased incorporation of [1-C] and decreased utilization of [U-C]glucose for fatty acid synthesis. Our data highlight a role of β-catenin in the regulation of metabolism and energy homeostasis in breast cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26240345>Pleiotropic age-dependent effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on epidermal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Tissue homeostasis declines with age partly because stem/progenitor cells fail to self-renew or differentiate. Because mitochondrial damage can accelerate aging, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction impairs stem cell renewal or function. We developed a mouse model, Tg(KRT14-cre/Esr1) (20Efu/J) × Sod2 (tm1Smel) , that generates mitochondrial oxidative stress in keratin 14-expressing epidermal stem/progenitor cells in a temporally controlled manner owing to deletion of Sod2, a nuclear gene that encodes the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2). Epidermal Sod2 loss induced cellular senescence, which irreversibly arrested proliferation in a fraction of keratinocytes. Surprisingly, in young mice, Sod2 deficiency accelerated wound closure, increasing epidermal differentiation and reepithelialization, despite the reduced proliferation. In contrast, at older ages, Sod2 deficiency delayed wound closure and reduced epidermal thickness, accompanied by epidermal stem cell exhaustion. In young mice, Sod2 deficiency accelerated epidermal thinning in response to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-, phenocopying the reduced regeneration of older Sod2-deficient skin. Our results show a surprising beneficial effect of mitochondrial dysfunction at young ages, provide a potential mechanism for the decline in epidermal regeneration at older ages, and identify a previously unidentified age-dependent role for  in skin quality and wound closure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28627452>Engineering of unconventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for efficient succinic acid production from glycerol at low pH.</a></h2><p>Yarrowia lipolytica is considered as a potential candidate for succinic acid production because of its innate ability to accumulate citric acid cycle intermediates and its tolerance to acidic pH. Previously, a succinate-production strain was obtained through the deletion of succinate dehydrogenase subunit encoding gene Ylsdh5. However, the accumulation of by-product  limited further improvement of succinate production. Meanwhile, additional pH adjustment procedure increased the downstream cost in industrial application. In this study, we identified for the first time that acetic acid overflow is caused by CoA-transfer reaction from acetyl-CoA to succinate in  rather than pyruvate decarboxylation reaction in SDH negative Y. lipolytica. The deletion of CoA-transferase gene Ylach eliminated acetic acid formation and improved succinic acid production and the cell growth. We then analyzed the effect of overexpressing the key enzymes of oxidative TCA, reductive carboxylation and glyoxylate bypass on succinic acid yield and by-products formation. The best strain with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ScPCK) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and endogenous succinyl-CoA synthase beta subunit (YlSCS2) overexpression improved succinic acid titer by 4.3-fold. In fed-batch fermentation, this strain produced 110.7g/L succinic acid with a yield of 0.53g/g glycerol without pH control. This is the highest succinic acid titer achieved at low pH by yeast reported worldwide, to date, using defined media. This study not only revealed the mechanism of acetic acid overflow in SDH negative Y. lipolytica, but it also reported the development of an efficient succinic acid production strain with great industrial prospects.Copyright © 2017.

Several biological activities have been ascribed to these compounds. Pentamidine, an aromatic diamidine, is effective in the treatment against Pneumocystis carinii and leishmaniasis, but it can also have severe side effects. New amidine derivatives have been synthesized, among them N,N'-diphenyl-4-methoxy-benzamidine (methoxyamidine), which is effective against Leishmania amazonensis (LD = 20 μM) and Trypanosoma cruzi (LD = 59 nM). In the present study, methoxyamidine toxicity was evaluated in isolated rat liver  at the same range of concentrations that exert antiprotozoal activity. In these organelles, actively oxidizing glutamate + malate inhibited state 3 respiration (25 nmol mg of protein) by ∼15%. The sites of inhibition in the respiratory chain were complex I and the segment between ubiquinone and complex III. Methoxyamidine also stimulated state 4 respiration by ∼32% and ∼43% at 50 and 65 nmol mg of protein, respectively. Its uncoupling effect was confirmed by a dose-dependent increase in oxygen consumption in state 4 respiration that was induced by oligomycin, reaching up to ∼69% (65 nmol mg of protein) and an increase in ATPase activity in intact  by ∼27% and ∼83% at 50 and 65 nmol mg protein, respectively. Swelling that was supported by the oxidation of glutamate + malate in the presence of sodium  was reduced by methoxyamidine by ∼16% and 32% at 50 and 65 nmol mg protein, respectively. Mitochondrial swelling in the absence of substrate and in the presence of K and valinomycin was inhibited by ∼20% at the same concentrations, suggesting that methoxyamidine affects mitochondrial membrane permeability and fluidity. Our data show that methoxyamidine has slight effects on the energy-linked functions of isolated  at concentrations that correspond to the LD against Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi. These findings may prompt further studies that evaluate methoxyamidine toxicity in vivo.Copyright © 2017.

Here we addressed if  are involved in the cytotoxicity of the novel 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative VE-3N [ethyl 6-chloro-5-formyl-2-methyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylate] towards cancer cells by employing hepatic carcinoma (HepG2) cells and isolated rat liver . In HepG2 cells, VE-3N induced mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, ATP depletion, annexin V/propidium iodide double labeling, and Hoechst staining; events indicating apoptosis induction. In isolated rat liver , VE-3N promoted mitochondrial uncoupling by exerting protonophoric actions and by increasing membrane fluidity. Mitochondrial uncoupling was evidenced by an increase in resting respiration, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibition of Ca uptake, stimulation of Ca release, decrease in ATP synthesis, and swelling of valinomycin-treated organelles in hyposmotic potassium  media. Furthermore, uncoupling concentrations of VE-3N in the presence of Ca plus ruthenium red induced the mitochondrial permeability transition process. These results indicate that mitochondrial uncoupling is potentially involved in the VE-3N cytotoxic actions towards HepG2 cells. Considering that hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer, our findings may open a new avenue for the development of VE-3N-based cancer therapies, and help to unravel the cytotoxic mechanisms of 1,4-dihydropyridines towards cancer cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

HD patients exhibit various forms of mitochondrial dysfunction within neurons and peripheral tissues. Cardiolipin (Ptd2Gro) is a polyglycerophospholipid found exclusively in  and is important for maintaining mitochondrial function. We examined if altered Ptd2Gro metabolism was involved in the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with HD. Mitochondrial basal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, ATP coupling efficiency and rate of glycolysis were markedly diminished in Epstein-Barr virus transformed HD lymphoblasts compared to controls (CTRL). Mitochondrial supercomplex formation and Complex I activity within these supercomplexes did not vary between HD patients with different length of CAG repeats and appeared unaltered compared to CTRL. In contrast, in vitro Complex I enzyme activity in mitochondrial enriched samples was reduced in HD lymphoblasts compared to CTRL. The total cellular pool size of Ptd2Gro and its synthesis/remodeling from [(3)H]/[(14)C]oleate were unaltered in HD lymphoblasts compared to CTRL. In addition, the molecular species of Ptd2Gro were essentially unaltered in HD lymphoblasts compared to CTRL. We conclude that compared to CTRL lymphoblasts, HD lymphoblasts display impaired mitochondrial basal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, ATP coupling efficiency and rate of glycolysis with any pathological CAG repeat length, but this is not due to alterations in Ptd2Gro metabolism. We suggest that HD patient lymphoblasts may be a useful model to study defective energy metabolism that does not involve alterations in Ptd2Gro metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755515>Cdk8 and Ssn801 Regulate Oxidative Stress Resistance and Virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans.</a></h2><p> kills 200,000 people worldwide each year. After inhalation, this environmental yeast proliferates either extracellularly or within host macrophages. Under conditions of immunocompromise, cryptococci disseminate from the lungs to the brain, causing a deadly meningoencephalitis that is difficult and expensive to treat. Cryptococcal adaptation to the harsh lung environment is a critical first step in its pathogenesis, and consequently a compelling topic of study. This adaptation is mediated by a complex transcriptional program that integrates cellular responses to environmental stimuli. Although several key regulators in this process have been examined, one that remains understudied in  is the Mediator complex. In other organisms, this complex promotes transcription of specific genes by increasing assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. We focused on the Kinase Module of Mediator, which consists of cyclin C (Ssn801), cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (Cdk8), Med12, and Med13. This module provides important inhibitory control of Mediator complex assembly and activity. Using transcriptomics, we discovered that Cdk8 and Ssn801 together regulate cryptococcal functions such as the ability to grow on  and the response to oxidative stress, both of which were experimentally validated. Deletion of  yielded altered mitochondrial morphology and the dysregulation of genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes.

Here, we analyze the antitumor activity of a novel benzofuran derivative, 2-amino-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-6-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)benzofuran-4-yl  (ACDB), in human chondrosarcoma cells. ACDB increased the cell apoptosis of human chondrosarcomas without harm in chondrocytes. ACDB also enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which was characterized by varieties in the cytosolic calcium levels and induced the expression of glucose-regulated protein (GRP) and calpain. Furthermore, the ACDB-induced chondrosarcoma apoptosis was associated with the upregulation of the B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family members including pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, downregulation of dysfunctional  that released cytochrome C, and subsequent activation of caspases-3. In addition, the ACDB-mediated cellular apoptosis was suppressed by transfecting cells with glucose-regulated protein (GRP) and calpain siRNA or treating cells with ER stress chelators and caspase inhibitors. Interestingly, animal experiments illustrated a reduction in the tumor volume following ACDB treatment.

Guided by the transcriptional profiling, we found that  negatively influenced resistance to stress, promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species, triggered cell death in stationary phase and impaired virulence on maize. We also found that  induced mitochondrial stress by interfering with mitochondrial functions. Notably, the disruption of oxygen perception or inhibition of the electron transport chain also influenced filamentation and mating.

Formaldehyde (FA), a product of methyl group oxidation, is highly cytotoxic. In the cell, there are two pathways of its utilization: assimilation and oxidation. Formaldehyde displays cytotoxicity, and therefore its oxidation is considered as detoxification. The sensitivity to the threshold concentration of FA we regard as an indication of its major role in biosystem functioning. A model of a three-component conjugated redox system is proposed in which the methyl group oxidation pathway is an archaic and conservative donor of protons and electrons, the reduction of O2 serves as an acceptor, and the arginine amino group is used for production of both urea and nitric oxide (the donor and acceptor, respectively). The fourth component of the redox system is glutathione, which maintains redox balance. The three-level system of proton donors includes the oxidation of a methyl group (first level), the oxidation of  in  (second level), and glucose catabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway (third level). The whole redox system is united by the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines, glutathione, thioredoxin, and α-lipoic acid. The central regulatory role in this redox system belongs to glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, which controls FA binding with tetrahydrofolic acid, arginine methylation, and denitrosation of sulfhydryl groups.

Here, we propose a hypothesis of how early mitochondrial adaptations for alcohol metabolism lead to ALD pathogenesis. Acutely, ethanol (EtOH) feeding causes a near doubling of hepatic EtOH metabolism and oxygen consumption within 2 to 3 hours. This swift increase in alcohol metabolism (SIAM) is an adaptive response to hasten metabolic elimination of both EtOH and its more toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde (AcAld). In association with SIAM, EtOH causes widespread hepatic mitochondrial depolarization (mtDepo), which stimulates oxygen consumption. In parallel, voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) in the mitochondrial outer membrane close. Together, VDAC closure and respiratory stimulation promote selective and more rapid oxidation of EtOH first to AcAld in the cytosol and then to nontoxic  in , since membrane-permeant AcAld does not require VDAC to enter . VDAC closure also inhibits mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and ATP release, promoting steatosis and a decrease in cytosolic ATP. After acute EtOH, these changes revert as EtOH is eliminated with little hepatocellular cytolethality. mtDepo also stimulates mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). After chronic high EtOH exposure, the capacity to process depolarized  by mitophagy becomes compromised, leading to intra- and extracellular release of damaged , mitophagosomes, and/or autolysosomes containing mitochondrial damage-associated molecular pattern (mtDAMP) molecules. mtDAMPs cause inflammasome activation and promote inflammatory and profibrogenic responses, causing hepatitis and fibrosis. We propose that persistence of mitochondrial responses to EtOH metabolism becomes a tipping point, which links initial adaptive EtOH metabolism to maladaptive changes initiating onset and progression of ALD.© 2018 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29154903>In vitro mesenchymal-epithelial transition in NIH3T3 fibroblasts results in onset of low-dose radiation hypersensitivity coupled with attenuated connexin-43 response.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) is associated with altered cell adhesion patterns.

Nutritional deprivation followed by repetitive treatment cycles of 3-methylcholanthrene and phorbol-12-myristate-13- with frequent isolation of foci established three progressive strains (NIH3T3.1, NIH3T3x3, NIH3T3x8x3) depicting MET, and one strain (NIH3T3x12) with partial reversion. Alterations in morphology, cell adhesion properties, expression/intracellular localization of cell adhesion proteins, microRNA expression and cellular radiosensitivity were studied in these stably transformed cell strains.All four transformants had increased proliferation rate, saturation density, bipolarity, E-cadherin expression; coupled with reduced cell size/spreading, pseudopodia/migration, and fibroblast marker protein and vimentin. The most aggressive trans-differentiated (phenotypically epithelial) cell strain, NIH3T3x8x3 acquired ~30% higher growth potential associated with more than two-fold reduction in cell size and migration. These phenotypic changes accompanied ~40% reduction in endogenous or radiation-induced connexin-43 expression/mitochondrial translocation. Incidentally, all three progressive strains displayed prominent HRS (α/α: 7.95-37.29) whereas parental (NIH3T3) and reverting (NIH3T3x12) strains lacked HRS and had distinct radiation-induced Cx43 translocation into .Our study shows that trans-differentiating fibroblasts progressively acquiring epithelial features during MET process, display low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity associated with altered Cx43 behaviour.This study demonstrates that MET progression triggers low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity in trans-differentiating cells, which has significant therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In order to minimize the effect of apoptosis against necrotic cell death, A549 cells having the inhibiting effect of caspase 9 by survivin were used in this study.

Indeed, this protease was required for cell survival in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity and for efficient mitochondrial degradation independently of autophagy. In this study, we therefore assessed the role of CatD in -induced mitochondrial alterations. We found that, similar to acetic acid in yeast, -induced apoptosis is not associated with autophagy induction in CRC cells. Moreover, inhibition of CatD with small interfering RNA or pepstatin A enhanced apoptosis associated with higher mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial mass. This effect seems to be specific, as inhibition of CatB and CatL with E-64d had no effect, nor were these proteases significantly released to the cytosol during -induced apoptosis. Using yeast cells, we further show that the role of Pep4p in mitochondrial degradation depends on its protease activity and is complemented by CatD, indicating that this mechanism is conserved. In summary, the clues provided by the yeast model unveiled a novel CatD function in the degradation of damaged  when autophagy is impaired, which protects CRC cells from -induced apoptosis. CatD inhibitors could therefore enhance -mediated cancer cell death, presenting a novel strategy for prevention or therapy of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321700>A novel antioxidant Mito-Tempol inhibits ox-LDL-induced foam cell formation through restoration of autophagy flux.</a></h2><p>A bulk of cholesteryl esters accumulation in macrophage foam cells drives the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis. Evidence now shows that autophagy plays key roles in the degradation of intracellular lipid droplets via autolysosome, and also in the release of intracellular lipids via cholesterol efflux. In this study, we identified that a -targeted antioxidant, Mito-Tempol, has protective effects against cholesteryl esters accumulation by activating autophagy. Mito-Tempol was shown to ameliorate the lipid burden for atherosclerosis, both in vitro and in vivo. In the established in vitro foam cell formation system using oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-loaded THP-1 macrophages, Mito-Tempol prevented intracellular oxidative stress and attenuated lipid accumulation. Mito-Tempol rescued ox-LDL-impaired autophagic flux, thereby facilitating autophagy-mediated lipid degradation in THP-1 macrophages. Meanwhile, Mito-Tempol also increased the efflux of cholesterol via autophagy-dependent ABCA1 and ABCG1 up-regulation. The classical autophagy pathway of mTOR may be one of the effector for the autophagy restoration of Mito-Tempol. Our findings give the first insight that cardiovascular system disease may benefits more from the treatment of Mito-Tempol for its impact of reversing atherosclerosis via autophagy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of A. nilagirica extracts/fractions on inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis in a human monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell line. The crude extracts (A. nilagirica ethyl  extract [ANE] and A. nilagirica methanolic extract [ANA]) showed cytotoxic activity toward THP-1 cells with the IC50 values of 38.21 ± 7.37 and 132.41 ± 7.19 µg/ml, respectively. However, the cytotoxic activity of active fractions (ANE-B and ANM-9) obtained after column chromatography was found to be much more pronounced than their parent extracts. The IC50 values of ANE-B and ANM-9 were found to be 27.04 ± 2.54 µg/ml and 12.70 ± 4.79 µg/ml, respectively, suggesting greater susceptibility of the malignant cells. Cell cycle analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed that inhibition of cell growth by A. nilagirica fractions on THP-1 cells was mediated by apoptosis. Active fractions of A. nilagirica increased the expression levels of caspase-3, -7, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), a critical member of the apoptotic pathway. These results suggested that active fractions of A. nilagirica may play a promising role in growth suppression by inducing apoptosis in human monocytic leukemic cells via -dependent and death receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29926682>[Effect of Astragalus injection on cardiomyocyte apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and expression of connexin in cardiomyopathy rats induced by adriamycin].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of Astragalus injection on cardiomyocyte apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and connexin protein in cardiomyopathy rats induced by adriamycin.Thirty-six male Wister rats were randomly divided into control group (=12), adriamycin(ADR) group (=12) and Astragalus group (=12).

By the end of the 7 week, the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter(LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by echocardiography. Then the rats in the three groups were sacrificed and the left ventricle section was stained by HE, Masson, uranyl /lead citrate respectively, the cardiomyopathy and ultrastructural changes were observed under light microscope and transmission electron microscope. The apoptosis of rat cardiomyocyte were analyzed by TUNEL. The expression of connexin Cx43 and p-Cx43 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78),activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were detected by real time PCR.Compared with control group, LVEDD, LVESD increased and LVEF decreased, myocardial fibers were disordered and edematous, infiltrated by lymphocytes, the  were destroyed and vacuolized, and the number of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was increased(<0.01) in ADR group. The expression of Grp78, ATF-4, CHOP and p-Cx43 were increased, and the expression of Cx43 was decreased in ADR group. However, compared with ADR group, LVEDD, LVESD decreased and LVEF increased, the cardiomyopathy and ultrastructural changes were significantly improved, the number of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was significantly decreased (<0. 01); the expression of Grp78, ATF-4, CHOP and p-Cx43 decreased (<0.01); the expression of Cx43 increased in Astragalus group (<0.01).Astragalus injection may effectively improve the myocardial damage induced by adriamycin, its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the decrease of phosphorylation of CX43 in cardiomyopathy rats induced by adriamycin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228817>Mitochondrial Apoptosis Induced by  Extract in Breast Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p> () commonly known as 'Roman chamomile' is a medicinal plant used for numerous diseases in traditional medicine, although its anticancer activity is unknown. The present study was carried out to investigate the anticancer as well as apoptotic activity of ethyl  fraction of  on different cancerous cell lines. The cells were treated with varying concentrations (0.001- 0.25 mg/mL) of this fraction for 24, 48 and 72 h. Apoptosis induced in MCF-7 cells following treatment with ethyl  fraction was measured using Annexin V/PI, flowcytometry and western blotting analysis. The results showed that  ethyl  fraction revealed relatively high antiproliferative activity on MCF-7 cells; however, it caused minimal growth inhibitory response in normal cells. The involvement of apoptosis as a major cause of the fraction-induced cell death was confirmed by annexin-V/PI assay. In addition, ethyl  fraction triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by decreasing the Bcl-2 as well as increasing of Bax protein expressions and subsequently increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Furthermore, decreased proliferation of MCF-7 cells in the presence of the fraction was associated with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. These findings confirm that ethyl  fraction of  may contain a diversity of phytochemicals which suppress the proliferation of MCF-7 cells by inducing apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28567340>Light and electron microscopic study of the medial collateral ligament epiligament tissue in human knees.</a></h2><p>To examine the normal morphology of the epiligament tissue of the knee medial collateral ligament (MCL) in humans.Several samples of the mid-substance of the MCL of the knee joint from 7 fresh human cadavers (3 females and 4 males) were taken. Examination of the epiligament tissue was conducted by light microscopy and photomicrography on semi-thin sections of formalin fixed paraffin-embedded blocks that were routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Mallory stain and Van Gieson's stain. Electron microscopy of the epiligament tissue was performed on ultra-thin sections incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide and contrasted with 2.5% uranyl , lead nitrate, and sodium citrate.The current light microscopic study demonstrated that the epiligament of the MCL consisted of ﬁbroblasts, ﬁbrocytes, adipocytes, neuro-vascular bundles and numerous multidirectional collagen fibers. In contrast, the ligament body was poorly vascularised, composed of hypo-cellular fascicles which were formed of longitudinal groups of collagen fibers. Moreover, most of the vessels of the epiligament-ligament complex were situated in the epiligament tissue. The electron microscopic study revealed fibroblasts with various shapes in the epiligament substance. All of them had the ultrastructural characteristics of active cells with large nuclei, well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, multiple ribosomes, poorly developed Golgi apparatus, elliptical  and oval lysosomes. The electron microscopy also confirmed the presence of adipocytes, mast cells, myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers and chaotically oriented collagen fibers.Significant differences exist between the normal structure of the ligament and the epiligament whose morphology and function is to be studied further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26730730>Experimental Genome-Wide Determination of RNA Polyadenylation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</a></h2><p>The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. This process has been studied in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using low-throughput (gene-by-gene) and high-throughput (transcriptome sequencing) approaches that recovered poly(A)-containing sequence tags which revealed interesting features of this critical process in Chlamydomonas. In this study, RNA polyadenylation has been studied using the so-called Poly(A) Tag Sequencing (PAT-Seq) approach. Specifically, PAT-Seq was used to study poly(A) site choice in cultures grown in four different media types-Tris-Phosphate (TP), Tris-Phosphate- (TAP), High-Salt (HS), and High-Salt- (HAS). The results indicate that: 1. As reported before, the motif UGUAA is the primary, and perhaps sole, cis-element that guides mRNA polyadenylation in the nucleus; 2. The scope of alternative polyadenylation events with the potential to change the coding sequences of mRNAs is limited; 3. Changes in poly(A) site choice in cultures grown in the different media types are very few in number and do not affect protein-coding potential; 4. Organellar polyadenylation is considerable and affects primarily ribosomal RNAs in the chloroplast and ; and 5.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role played by the three PDHKs PkpA, PkpB and PkpC in carbon source utilization in the reference filamentous fungus , in order to unravel regulatory mechanisms which could prove useful for fungal biotechnological and biomedical applications. PkpA and PkpB were shown to be mitochondrial whereas PkpC localized to the  in a carbon source-dependent manner. Only PkpA was shown to regulate PDH activity. In the presence of glucose, deletion of  and  resulted in reduced glucose utilization, which affected carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and hydrolytic enzyme secretion, due to de-regulated glycolysis and TCA cycle enzyme activities. Furthermore, PkpC was shown to be required for the correct metabolic utilization of cellulose and . PkpC negatively regulated the activity of the glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase (ICL), required for  metabolism. In summary, this study identified PDHKs important for the regulation of central carbon metabolism in the presence of different carbon sources, with effects on the secretion of biotechnologically important enzymes and carbon source-related growth. This work demonstrates how central carbon metabolism can affect a variety of fungal traits and lays a basis for further investigation into these characteristics with potential interest for different applications.Copyright © 2018 Ries et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27306413>EXPRESS: Methylcobalamin ameliorates neuropathic pain induced by vincristine in rats: Effect on loss of peripheral nerve fibers and imbalance of cytokines in the spinal dorsal horn.</a></h2><p>Vincristine, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, often induces painful peripheral neuropathy and there are currently no effective drugs to prevent or treat this side effect. Previous studies have shown that methylcobalamin has potential analgesic effect in diabetic and chronic compression of dorsal root ganglion model; however, whether methylcobalamin has effect on vincristine-induced painful peripheral neuropathy is still unknown.We found that vincristine-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, accompanied by a significant loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers in the plantar hind paw skin and an increase in the incidence of atypical  in the sciatic nerve. Moreover, in the spinal dorsal horn, the activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and the protein expression of p-p65 as well as tumor necrosis factor a was increased, whereas the protein expression of IL-10 was decreased following vincristine treatment. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of methylcobalamin could dose dependently attenuate vincristine-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, which was associated with intraepidermal nerve fibers rescue, and atypical  prevalence decrease in the sciatic nerve. Moreover, methylcobalamin inhibited the activation of NADPH oxidase and the downstream NF-kB pathway. Production of tumor necrosis factor a was also decreased and production of IL-10 was increased in the spinal dorsal horn following methylcobalamin treatment. Intrathecal injection of Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-, a NADPH oxidase activator, could completely block the analgesic effect of methylcobalamin.Methylcobalamin attenuated vincrinstine-induced neuropathic pain, which was accompanied by inhibition of intraepidermal nerve fibers loss and  impairment.

Here we reported the potential role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) in lead -induced mitochondrial toxicity in mouse testicular Sertoli cells TM4 line. We found that lead  treatment significantly reduced the expression level of PGC-1α, but increased the level of MRP1 in  of TM4 cells. To determine the role of PGC-1α and MRP1 in lead -induced mitochondrial toxicity, we then generated PGC-1α stable overexpression and MRP1 stable knockdown TM4 cells, respectively. The lead  treatment caused TM4 cell mitochondrial ultrastructure damages, a decrease in ATP synthesis, an increase in ROS levels, and apoptotic cell death. In contrast, stably overexpressing PGC-1α significantly ameliorated the lead  treatment-caused mitochondrial toxicity and apoptosis. Moreover, it was also found that stably knocking down the level of MRP1 increased the TM4 cell mitochondrial lead-accumulation by 4-6 folds. Together, the findings from this study suggest that PGC-1α and MRP1 plays important roles in protecting TM4 cells against lead-induced mitochondrial toxicity, providing a better understanding of lead-induced mitochondrial toxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The ethyl  extract of D. suffruticosa (EADs) has been shown to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in our previous study. The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in EADs-induced apoptosis and to identify the major compounds in the extract. EADs was found to promote oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells that led to cell death because the pre-treatment with antioxidants α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of the extract (P<0.05). DCFH-DA assay revealed that treatment with EADs attenuated the generation of intracellular ROS. Apoptosis induced by EADs was not inhibited by the use of caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, suggesting that the cell death is caspase-independent. The use of JC-1 dye reflected that EADs caused disruption in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The related molecular pathways involved in EADs-induced apoptosis were determined by GeXP multiplex system and Western blot analysis. EADs is postulated to induce cell cycle arrest that is p53- and p21-dependent based on the upregulated expression of p53 and p21 (P<0.05). The expression of Bax was upregulated with downregulation of Bcl-2 following treatment with EADs. The elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential suggest that EADs-induced apoptosis is -dependent. The expression of oxidative stress-related AKT, p-AKT, ERK, and p-ERK was downregulated with upregulation of JNK and p-JNK. The data indicate that induction of oxidative-stress related apoptosis by EADs was mediated by inhibition of AKT and ERK, and activation of JNK. The isolation of compounds in EADs was carried out using column chromatography and elucidated using the nuclear resonance magnetic analysis producing a total of six compounds including 3-epimaslinic acid, kaempferol, kaempferide, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid and β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside. The cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds was determined using MTT assay. Gallic acid was found to be most cytotoxic against MCF-7 cell line compared to others, with IC50 of 36 ± 1.7 μg/mL (P<0.05). In summary, EADs generated oxidative stress, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by regulating numerous genes and proteins that are involved in the apoptotic signal transduction pathway. Therefore, EADs has the potential to be developed as an anti-cancer agent against breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30737343>Mitochondrial Citrate Transporters CtpA and YhmA Are Required for Extracellular Citric Acid Accumulation and Contribute to Cytosolic Acetyl Coenzyme A Generation in Aspergillus luchuensis mut. .</a></h2><p> mut.

CtpA and YhmA were purified from  and reconstituted into liposomes. The proteoliposomes exhibited only counterexchange transport activity; CtpA transported citrate using countersubstrates, especially -aconitate and malate, whereas YhmA transported citrate using a wider variety of countersubstrates, including citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, malate, -aconitate, and succinate.

The above findings seem to relate to or indicate a shift to non-oxidative metabolic pathways in cancer. In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells may lose the ability to utilize aerobic respiration due to either defective  or hypoxia within the tumor microenvironments. Glucose was shown to be the major energy source in cancer cells where it utilizes aerobic /anaerobic glycolysis with the resultant lactic acid formation. The role of energetic modulations and use of glycolytic inhibitors on cancer/normal cell survival is not clearly established in the literature. We hypothesize that natural intermediates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle will differentially and negatively impact the cancer phenotype in contrast to their no effects on the normal cell phenotype. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate six potential glycolytic modulators namely, Pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, Zn , sodium citrate, fructose diphosphate (FDP) and sodium bicarbonate at μM concentrations on growing A549 (lung cancer) and MRC-5 (normal; human lung fibroblast) cell lines with the objective of determining their influence on visual impact, cell metabolic activity, cell viability and end-point cell survival. Exposed and non-exposed cells were tested with phase-contrast micro-scanning, survival/death and metabolic activity trends through MTT-assays, as well as death end-point determinations by testing re-growth on complete media and T4 cellometer counts. Results showed that oxalic acid and Zn  both influenced the pH of the medium and resulted in differential massive cell debris within the exposure period. Pyruvic acid, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate and FDP did not cause pH changes; however, they caused detectable cell disfigurement and loss of metabolic activity, viability and survival/ death end points with the resultant death of the A549 cell line. The MRC-5 cell line was differentially unaffected by exposure to pyruvic acid, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, FDP and Zn , underwent complete recovery and remained both attached and healthy for 6 weeks upon subculture when transferred to a new complete medium. Oxalic acid did not show differential modulation with the consequent loss of survival and death of the MRC-5 cell line. Phase contrast, metabolic activity, cell counts as well as death end-point findings confirmed our hypothsis. These studies show the potential possibly for exploiting cellular metabolic differences in cancer control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272734>Investigation of metabolic changes in STZ-induced diabetic rats with hyperpolarized [1-13C].</a></h2><p>In the metabolism of  several enzymes are involved, which play an important role in free fatty acid oxidation.

The neurotoxic effects of Pb have been well documented but its effects on the heart are poorly elucidated. We examined the late life cardiac impairments resulting from developmental exposure to Pb. Further, we investigated the protective effect of the nutrient metal mixture containing calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) against Pb-induced long-term effects on cardiac functions.Male albino rats were lactationally exposed to 0.2% Pb- or 0.2% Pb- together nutrient metal mixture as 0.02% in drinking water of the mother from PND 1 to PND 21. The results showed increased levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity at postnatal day (PND) 28 [young], 4 months [adult] and 18 months [old] age group rats. Most notably, exposure to Pb decreased the activities of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), aconitase (Acon), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), xanthine oxidase (XO) and total antioxidant status while the MDA levels increased in all selected age groups of rats. The histological findings showed an age-dependent response to Pb exposure evidenced by extensive degeneration and necrosis in cardiac muscle, disruption in muscle connectivity, hemorrhage, and mononuclear cell infiltration. Co-administration of nutrient metal mixture reversed the Pb-induced cardiac impairments as reflected in the recovery of the chosen sensitive markers of oxidative stress, reduced Pb levels and cardiac tissue changes. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that early-life exposure to Pb continuously influence the cardiac mitochondrial functions from early life to older age and further suggesting that adequate intake of nutrient metals may be potential therapeutic treatment for Pb intoxication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630563>Chemomodulatory effects of  extract via -dependent apoptosis and necroptosis in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>The present study intended to assess the anticancer potential of  ethyl  fraction (AVEAF) in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453) and against -methyl--nitrosourea (MNU) induced mammary carcinoma in Sprague-Dawley rats which resemble the human estrogen dependent breast cancer. The SRB assay showed that the maximum growth inhibition rate of AVEAF on MCF-7 cell was 27.12 at 100 µg/ml. Flow cytometry analysis observed that AVEAF induced the cell cycle arrest at the S phases and decreased in mitochondrial membrane potential on the MCF-7 cells. AVEAF elevated intracellular ROS level in the MCF-7 cells which were reversed with -acetycysteine (2 mM) pretreatment indicating that AVEAF induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis via augmentation of intracellular ROS. Western blotting exhibited that AVEAF increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax while decreasing anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression which promoted the cleavage of caspase-9, PARP1, RIPK 1, and RIPK 3. Additionally, AVEAF exerted anticancer effect on tumor-bearing rats and the tumor inhibition rate is 50%. Data of the study indicate that AVEAF exhibits In Vitro and In Vivo anticancer activities that associate with its ROS-mediated mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and necroptosis in MCF-7 cells and may serve as a potential against breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26607462>Furanodiene enhances the anti-cancer effects of doxorubicin on ERα-negative breast cancer cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>Furanodiene is a natural product isolated from Rhizoma curcumae, and exhibits broad-spectrum anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. Our previous study proved that furanodiene could increase growth inhibition of steroidal agent in ERα-positive breast cancer cells, but whether furanodiene can influence ER status is not clear. In this study, we confirmed that furanodiene down-regulated the ERα protein expression level and inhibited E2-induced estrogen response element (ERE)-driven reporter plasmid activity in ERα-positive MCF-7 cells. Actually, ERα-knockdown cells were more sensitive than ERα positive cells to furanodiene on the cytotoxicity effect. So the anti-cancer effects of furanodiene and non-steroidal agent in breast cancer cells still requires further investigation. Our results showed that furanodiene exposure could enhance growth inhibitory effects of doxorubicin in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells and ERα-low expression 4T1 cells. However, furanodiene did not increase the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in ERα-positive breast cancer cells, non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, macrophage cells, hepatocytes cells, pheochromocytoma cells and cardiac myoblasts cells. Furanodiene enhances the anti-cancer effects of doxorubicin in ERα-negative breast cancer cells through suppressing cell viability via inducing apoptosis in -caspases-dependent and reactive oxygen species-independent manners. These results indicate that furanodiene may be a promising and safety natural agent for cancer adjuvant therapy in the future.Copyright © 2016.

In spite of that, several major aspects of its physiology are still poorly understood. As an acetogenic yeast, minimal oxygen concentrations are able to drive glucose assimilation to oxidative metabolism, in order to produce biomass and , with consequent low yield in ethanol. In the present study, we used disulfiram to inhibit acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity to evaluate the influence of cytosolic  on cell metabolism. D. bruxellensis was more tolerant to disulfiram than Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the use of different carbon sources revealed that the former yeast might be able to export  (or acetyl-CoA) from  to cytoplasm. Fermentation assays showed that acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition re-oriented yeast central metabolism to increase ethanol production and decrease biomass formation. However, glucose uptake was reduced, which ultimately represents economical loss to the fermentation process. This might be the major challenge for future metabolic engineering enterprises on this yeast.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109468>Pharmacological Comparisons Between Cannabidiol and KLS-13019.</a></h2><p>Cannabidiol (CBD) exhibits neuroprotective properties in many experimental systems. However, development of CBD as a drug has been confounded by the following: (1) low potency; (2) a large number of molecular targets; (3) marginal pharmacokinetic properties; and (4) designation as a schedule 1 controlled substance. The present work compared the properties of CBD with a novel molecule (KLS-13019) that has structural similarities to CBD. The design strategy for KLS-13019 was to increase hydrophilicity while optimizing neuroprotective potency against oxidative stress toxicity relevant to hepatic encephalopathy. The protective responses of CBD and KLS-13019 were compared in dissociated rat hippocampal cultures co-treated with toxic levels of ethanol and ammonium . This comparison revealed that KLS-13019 was 31-fold more potent than CBD in preventing neuronal toxicity from the combined toxin treatment, while both compounds exhibited complete protective efficacy back to control values. In addition, treatment with KLS-13019 alone was 5-fold less toxic (TC50) than CBD. Previous studies suggested that CBD targeted the Na-Ca exchanger in  (mNCX) to regulate intracellular calcium levels, an important determinant of neuronal survival. After treatment with an inhibitor of mNCX (CGP-37157), no detectable neuroprotection from ethanol toxicity was observed for either CBD or KLS-13019. Furthermore, AM630 (CB2 antagonist) significantly attenuated CBD-mediated neuroprotection, while having no detectable effect on neuroprotection from KLS-13019. Our studies indicated KLS-13019 was more potent and less toxic than CBD. Both compounds can act through mNCX. KLS-13019 may provide an alternative to CBD as a therapeutic candidate to treat diseases associated with oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130074>Loss of UCP2 impairs cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis by promoting a shift toward glucose utilization in brown adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was discovered in 1997 and classified as an uncoupling protein largely based on its homology of sequence with UCP1. Since its discovery, the uncoupling function of UCP2 has been questioned and there is yet no consensus on the true function of this protein. UCP2 was first proposed to be a reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulator and an insulin secretion modulator. More recently, it was demonstrated as a regulator of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which prompted us to investigate its role in the metabolic and thermogenic functions of brown adipose tissue. We first investigated the role of UCP2 in affecting the glycolysis capacity by evaluating the extracellular flux in cells lacking UCP2. We thereafter investigated the role of UCP2 in BAT thermogenesis with positron emission tomography using the metabolic tracers [C]- (metabolic activity), 2-deoxy-2-[F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG, glucose uptake) and 14(R,S)-[F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid [FTHA, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) uptake]. The effect of the β3-adrenoreceptor (ADRB3) selective agonist, CL316,243 (CL), on BAT FDG and FTHA uptakes, as well as C- activity was assessed in UCP2 and UCP2 mice exposed at room temperature or adapted to cold. Our results suggest that despite the fact that UCP2 does not have the uncoupling potential of UCP1, its contribution to BAT thermogenesis and to the adaptation to cold exposure appears crucial. Notably, we found that the absence of UCP2 promoted a shift toward glucose utilization and increased glycolytic capacity in BAT, which conferred a better oxidative/thermogenic activity/capacity following an acute adrenergic stimulation. However, following cold exposure, a context of high-energy demand, BAT of UCP2 mice failed to adapt and thermogenesis was impaired. We conclude that UCP2 regulates BAT thermogenesis by favouring the utilization of NEFA, a process required for the adaptation to cold.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

In Malaysia, it has been widely claimed to be effective in various cancer treatments but scientific evidence is lacking.This study investigates the chemical constituents, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic properties of C. nutans root extracts.The roots were subjected to solvent extraction using methanol and ethyl . The anti-proliferative effects of root extracts were tested at the concentrations of 10 to 50 μg/mL on MCF-7 and HeLa by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for 72 h. Morphological changes were observed under light microscope. Pro-apoptotic effects of root extracts were examined using flow cytometric analysis and RT-PCR. The chemical compositions of root extracts were detected using GC-MS.The proliferation of MCF-7 cells was inhibited with the IC values of 35 and 30 μg/mL, respectively, for methanol and ethyl  root extracts. The average inhibition of HeLa cells was ∼25%. Induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 was supported by chromatin condensation, down-regulation of BCL2 and unaltered expression of BAX. However, only ethyl  extract caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. GC-MS analysis revealed the roots extracts were rich with terpenoids and phytosterols.The results demonstrated that root extracts promote apoptosis by suppressing BCL2 via -dependent or independent manner.

The aim of the present study was to develop paclitaxel hybrid nanomicelles for oral administration to treat resistant breast cancer.Evaluations were performed on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, drug-resistant breast cancer MCF-7/Adr cells, and in MCF-7/Adr-xenografted BALB/c nude mice. The nanomicelles were composed of the polymer soluplus, d-α-tocopheryl polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), and dequalinium (DQA). The constructed paclitaxel hybrid nanomicelles were ~65 nm in size.The nanomicelles improved cellular uptake and anticancer efficacy in the resistant breast cancer cells and induced -mediated apoptosis. The mechanism of the apoptosis-inducing effect was related to the co-localization of the nanomicelles with ; the activation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, cytochrome C, and apoptotic enzymes caspase 9 and 3; and the inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Oral administration of paclitaxel hybrid nanomicelles had the same anticancer efficacy as the intravenous injection of taxol in resistant breast cancer-bearing mice.

In this article, classical isolation and structure identification were used in a study on Caper Euphorbia Seed. Subsequently, MTT and wound healing assays, flow cytometry, western blotting, Hoechst 33258 staining and fluorescence microscopy examination were applied to investigate the anticancer activity of the obtained compounds. In a result, lathyrol-3-phenyl- -5,15-diacetate (deoxy Euphorbia factor L1, DEFL1) was isolated from Caper Euphorbia Seed. Moreover, the NMR signals were totally assigned. DEFL1 showed potent inhibition against lung cancer A549 cells, with an IC value of 17.51 ± 0.85 μM. Furthermore, DEFL1 suppressed wound healing of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanically, DEFL1 induced apoptosis, with involvement of an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), release of cytochrome , activity raise of caspase-9 and 3. Characteristic features of apoptosis were observed by fluorescence microscopy.

However, its source is unclear. Here, we report that pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis and key node in central carbon metabolism, quantitatively generates  in mammals. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced in the context of nutritional excess, such as during hyperactive glucose metabolism. Conversion of pyruvate to  occurs through two mechanisms: (1) coupling to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (2) neomorphic enzyme activity from keto acid dehydrogenases that enable function as pyruvate decarboxylases. Further, we demonstrate that de novo  production sustains Ac-CoA pools and cell proliferation in limited metabolic environments, such as during mitochondrial dysfunction or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) deficiency. By virtue of de novo  production being coupled to mitochondrial metabolism, there are numerous possible regulatory mechanisms and links to pathophysiology.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Death of the endothelial cells of the choroid may cause abnormal deposits including unesterified and esterified cholesterol beneath RPE cells and within Bruch's membrane that contribute to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most prevalent cause of blindness in older people. Translocator protein (TSPO) is a cholesterol-binding protein that is involved in mitochondrial cholesterol transport and other cellular functions. We have investigated the role of TSPO in choroidal endothelial cells. Immunocytochemistry showed that TSPO was localized to the  of choroidal endothelial cells. Choroidal endothelial cells exposed to TSPO ligands (Etifoxine or XBD-173) had significantly increased cholesterol efflux, higher expression of cholesterol homeostasis genes (, , ,  and ), and reduced biosynthesis of cholesterol and phospholipids from [C], when compared to untreated controls. Treatment with TSPO ligands also resulted in reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased antioxidant capacity, and reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and VEGF) induced by oxidized LDL.

Cytotoxic properties of hexane, ethyl  and methanol extracts were carried out against MCF-7 cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Ethyl  extract showed good cytototoxic activities compared to hexane and methanol extracts. Methyl caffeate was isolated from the ethyl  extract using column chromatography. Cytotoxic properties of methyl caffeate was investigated against MCF-7, A549, COLO320, HepG-2 and Vero cells. The compound showed potent cytotoxic properties against MCF-7 cells compared to A549, COLO320 and HepG-2 cells. Methyl caffeate significantly reduced cell proliferation and increased formation of fragmented DNA and apoptotic body in MCF-7 cells.

The tubers are edible and have often been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurvedic medicine to treat cancer, diabetes, thyroid disease, and inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of D. bulbifera on HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells and to unravel the plausible mechanisms underlying its apoptotic effects. The ethanol crude and fractions (hexane, ethyl  and water) of D. bulbifera were subjected to cell viability MTT assay against various cancer cell lines. The lowest IC50 of the extract and fractions on selected cancer cells were selected for further apoptosis assay and western blot analysis. HCT116 cancer cells were treated with D. bulbifera and stained with Annexin/PI or Hoechst 33342/PI for preliminary confirmation of apoptosis. The dissipation of  membrane potential (MMP) was determined by flow cytometry. The protein expressions of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2 family, caspases, Fas, PARP, ERK1/2 and JNK were detected by western blot analysis. Moreover, the HCT116 cells were treated with UO126 and SP600125 inhibitors to verify the involvement of ERK1/2 and JNK protein expressions in inducing apoptotic cell death. Based on the result, D. bulbifera ethyl  fraction (DBEAF) exhibited the most compelling cytotoxicity on HCT116 cells with an IC50 of 37.91 ± 1.30 µg/mL. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed by phosphatidylserine externalization and chromatin condensation. Depolarization of MMP further conferred the induction of apoptosis was through the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Activation of caspase cascades (caspase-3, -9, -8 and -10) was elicited followed by the observation of cleaved PARP accumulation in DBEAF-treated cells. Furthermore, death receptor, Fas was activated upon exposure to DBEAF. Collective apoptotic evidences suggested the involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by DBEAF in HCT116 cells. Interestingly, the attenuation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation accompanied by the activation of JNK was detected in DBEAF-treated cells. In conclusion, the findings revealed that DBEAF induced apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways involving ERK1/2 and JNK.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Accurate measurement of acetylation stoichiometry on a proteome-wide scale remains challenging. Most methods employ a comparison of chemically acetylated peptides to native acetylated peptides, however, the potentially large differences in abundance between these peptides presents a challenge for accurate quantification. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the most widely used quantitative proteomic methods. Here we show that serial dilution of SILAC-labeled peptides (SD-SILAC) can be used to identify accurately quantified peptides and to estimate the quantification error rate. We applied SD-SILAC to determine absolute acetylation stoichiometry in exponentially-growing and stationary-phase wild-type and Sirtuin deacetylase CobB-deficient cells. To further analyze CobB-regulated sites under conditions of globally increased or decreased acetylation, we measured stoichiometry in phophotransacetylase (Δ) and  kinase (Δ) mutant strains in the presence and absence of the Sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide. We measured acetylation stoichiometry at 3,669 unique sites and found that the vast majority of acetylation occurred at a low stoichiometry. Manipulations that cause increased nonenzymatic acetylation by acetyl-phosphate (AcP), such as stationary-phase arrest and deletion of , resulted in globally increased acetylation stoichiometry. Comparison to relative quantification under the same conditions validated our stoichiometry estimates at hundreds of sites, demonstrating the accuracy of our method. Similar to Sirtuin deacetylase 3 (SIRT3) in , CobB suppressed acetylation to lower than median stoichiometry in WT, Δ, and Δ cells. Together, our results provide a detailed view of acetylation stoichiometry in  and suggest an evolutionarily conserved function of Sirtuin deacetylases in suppressing low stoichiometry acetylation.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363853>PGC-1α controls mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in lead-induced neurotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Due to its role in regulation of mitochondrial function, PGC1α is emerging as an important player in ageing and neurodegenerative disorders. PGC1α exerts its neuroprotective effects by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and functioning. However, the precise regulatory role of PGC1α in the control of mitochondrial dynamics (MD) and neurotoxicity is still unknown. Here we elucidate the role of PGC1αin vitro and in vivo in the regulatory context of MB and MD in response to lead (II)  as a relevant model of neurotoxicity. We show that there is an adaptive response (AR) to lead, orchestrated by the BAP31-calcium signalling system operating between the ER and . We find that this hormetic response is controlled by a cell-tolerated increase of PGC1α expression, which in turn induces a balanced expression of fusion/fission genes by binding to their promoters and implying its direct role in regulation of MD. However, dysregulation of PGC1α expression through either stable downregulation or overexpression, renders cells more susceptible to lead insult leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Our data provide novel evidence that PGC1α expression is a key regulator of MD and the maintenance of tolerated PGC1α expression may offer a promising strategy for neuroprotective therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26352325>Characterization of glucose-related metabolic pathways in differentiated rat oligodendrocyte lineage cells.</a></h2><p>Although oligodendrocytes constitute a significant proportion of cells in the central nervous system (CNS), little is known about their intermediary metabolism.

We report that differentiated oligodendrocyte lineage cells avidly metabolize glucose in the cytosol and pyruvate derived from glucose in the . The labelling patterns of metabolites obtained after incubation with [1,2-(13)C]glucose demonstrated that the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is highly active in oligodendrocytes (approximately 10% of glucose is metabolized via the PPP as indicated by labelling patterns in phosphoenolpyruvate). Mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses of metabolites after incubation of cells with [1-(13)C]lactate or [1,2-(13)C]glucose, respectively, demonstrated that anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation, which was thought to be exclusive to astrocytes, is also active in oligodendrocytes. Using [1,2-(13)C], we show that oligodendrocytes convert  into acetyl CoA which is metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Analysis of labelling patterns of alanine after incubation of cells with [1,2-(13)C] and [1,2-(13)C]glucose showed catabolic oxidation of malate or oxaloacetate.

It has been established that angiotensin II type-2 receptor (AT2R) activation is neuroprotective in central nervous system diseases like stroke and AD. However, the involvement of AT2R in NADPH oxidase (NOX)-mediated microglia activation is still elusive. Therefore, the present study investigated the role of AT2R in angiotensin II (Ang II) or Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced microglia activation in BV2 cells, primary microglia, p47 knockout (p47KO) microglia, and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with Ang II or PMA induced a significant ROS generation and promoted pro-inflammatory microglia in a NOX-dependent manner. In contrast, AT2R activation by CGP42112A (CGP) inhibited NOX activation, ROS production, and pro-inflammatory microglia activation, while promoting the immunoregulatory microglia. This inhibitory effect of AT2R on NOX and pro-inflammatory activation was attenuated by AT2R antagonist, PD123319. Essentially, NOX inhibition (by DPI) or scavenging cellular ROS (by NAC) or p47KO microglia were immune to Ang II- or PMA-induced pro-inflammatory microglia activation. Mechanistically, AT2R, via activation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), prevented the Ang II- or PMA-induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation and phosphorylation of p47, an effect that was reversed by the addition of PP2A inhibitor, Okadaic acid (OA). Importantly, PKC inhibitor, Rottlerin, inhibited the Ang II- or PMA-induced p47 phosphorylation and ROS generation to the similar extent as AT2R activation. In addition, AT2R activation or p47KO prevented ROS production, pro-inflammatory microglial activation, and sickness behavior in mice model of neuroinflammation. Therefore, the present findings suggested that AT2R, via PP2A-mediated inhibition of PKC, prevents the NOX activation, ROS generation, and subsequent pro-inflammatory activation of microglia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28316020>β-Hydroxybutyrate Boosts Mitochondrial and Neuronal Metabolism but is not Preferred Over Glucose Under Activated Conditions.</a></h2><p>The ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), is metabolised by the brain alongside the mandatory brain fuel glucose. To examine the extent and circumstances by which βOHB can supplement glucose metabolism, we studied guinea pig cortical brain slices using increasing concentrations of [U-C]D-βOHB in conjunction with [1-C]D-glucose under conditions of normo- and hypoglycaemia, as well as under high potassium (40 mmol/L K) depolarization in normo- and hypoglycaemic conditions. The contribution of βOHB to synthesis of GABA was also probed by inhibiting the synthesis of glutamine, a GABA precursor, with methionine sulfoximine (MSO). [U-C]D-βOHB at lower concentrations (0.25 and 1.25 mmol/L) stimulated mitochondrial metabolism, producing greater total incorporation of label into glutamate and GABA but did not have a similar effect in the cytosolic compartment where labelling of glutamine was reduced at 1.25 mmol/L [U-C]D-βOHB. At higher concentrations (2.5 mmol/L) [U-C]D-βOHB inhibited metabolism of [1-C]D-glucose, and reduced total label incorporation and total metabolite pools. When glucose levels were reduced, βOHB was able to partially restore the loss of glutamate and GABA caused by hypoglycaemia, but was not able to supplement levels of lactate, glutamine or alanine or to prevent the increase in aspartate. Under depolarizing conditions glucose was the preferred substrate over βOHB, even in hypoglycaemic conditions where comparatively less βOHB was incorporated except into aspartate isotopomers. Inhibition of glutamine synthesis with MSO had no significant effect on incorporation of label from [U-C]D-βOHB into GABA C2,1 indicating that the majority of this GABA was synthesized in GABAergic neurons from [U-C]D-βOHB rather than from Gln C4,5 imported from astrocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28166796>Coenzyme Q partially restores pathological alterations in a macrophage model of Gaucher disease.</a></h2><p>Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene which encodes lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). In GD, partial or complete loss of GCase activity causes the accumulation of the glycolipids glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine in the lysosomes of macrophages. In this manuscript, we investigated the effects of glycolipids accumulation on lysosomal and mitochondrial function, inflammasome activation and efferocytosis capacity in a THP-1 macrophage model of Gaucher disease. In addition, the beneficial effects of coenzyme Q (CoQ) supplementation on cellular alterations were evaluated. Chemically-induced Gaucher macrophages were developed by differentiateing THP-1 monocytes to macrophages by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and then inhibiting intracellular GCase with conduritol B-epoxide (CBE), a specific irreversible inhibitor of GCase activity, and supplementing the medium with exogenous GlcCer. This cell model accumulated up to 16-fold more GlcCer compared with control THP-1 cells.Chemically-induced Gaucher macrophages showed impaired autophagy flux associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, inflammasome activation and impaired efferocytosis. All abnormalities were partially restored by supplementation with CoQ.These data suggest that targeting  function and oxidative stress by CoQ can ameliorate the pathological phenotype of Gaucher cells. Chemically-induced Gaucher macrophages provide cellular models that can be used to investigate disease pathogenesis and explore new therapeutics for GD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429316>C2 metabolism in Euglena.</a></h2><p>Euglenoids are able to assimilate fatty acids and alcohols with various carbon-chain lengths, and ethanol is known to be one of the best carbon sources to support the growth of Euglena gracilis.

The unique glyoxylate and glycolate metabolism during photorespiration is also discussed in this chapter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302532>A rapid method of whole cell sample preparation for scanning electron microscopy using neodymium chloride.</a></h2><p>The quality of electron microscopy (EM) visualization of biological objects is constantly improving, primarily with the usage of more complex technologies, such as serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, and array tomography. Here we suggest a new rapid method of whole cell sample preparation for scanning EM using neodymium chloride treatment followed by staining with lead . This variant of sample preparation does not require separate fixation, complete dehydration, and metal sputtering. By means of SEM in the back-scattered electron mode, in the neodymium-treated preparations, we visualized various morphological structures in human cells (nuclei with nucleoli, cytoskeleton, ) and microbial cells (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans) preserving their species-specific shape and size. Thus, the suggested method provides additional information combining capabilities of SEM in visualizing cellular surface and transmission EM in detecting intracellular structures. Moreover, biological sample preparation with neodymium and lead is fast, informative, and cost-saving indicating a potential for its practical use for environmental SEM, and can be effectively combined with optical microscopy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We prepared  root (SBR) extracts using different solvents. The total flavonoid and total phenol contents of each extract were measured, and the ROS damage protection was evaluated by analyzing linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LHP)-induced LPO in rat lung . Moreover, evaluating diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion radical, and hydroxyl radical scavenging abilities and using metal chelating assays were used to determine in vitro antioxidant activity. The ethyl  (EtOAc) extract showed high ROS scavenging ability, and four compounds were subsequently isolated and purified from this extract: baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A. Baicalein in rat lung  the most significant LHP-induced LPO inhibition was shown and extracted with EtOAc that contained the highest amount of baicalein. Thus, baicalein and the EtOAc extract of SBR may be efficient in conferring ROS damage protection and inhibiting LHP-induced LPO in rat lung . Additional studies are warranted to investigate their use as antioxidant therapy for respiration infections, nutrition supplements, and lead compounds in pharmaceuticals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26655911>Stratification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Based on  Utilization.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly form of liver cancer that is increasingly prevalent. We analyzed global gene expression profiling of 361 HCC tumors and 49 adjacent noncancerous liver samples by means of combinatorial network-based analysis. We investigated the correlation between transcriptome and proteome of HCC and reconstructed a functional genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) for HCC. We identified fundamental metabolic processes required for cell proliferation using the network centric view provided by the GEM. Our analysis revealed tight regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) and highly significant deregulation of fatty acid oxidation in HCC. We predicted mitochondrial  as an emerging substrate for FAB through upregulation of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS1) in HCC. We analyzed heterogeneous expression of ACSS1 and ACSS2 between HCC patients stratified by high and low ACSS1 and ACSS2 expression and revealed that ACSS1 is associated with tumor growth and malignancy under hypoxic conditions in human HCC.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of the extracts obtained from the seeds of A. cearensis in primary cultures of cerebellar cells subjected to excitotoxicity induced by glutamate and brain  submitted to oxidative stress.and methods: Primary cultures of cerebellar cells were treated with the ethanol (ETAC), hexane (EHAC), dichloromethane (EDAC) and ethyl  (EAAC) extracts of the seeds of A.cearensis and subjected to excitotoxicity induced by glutamate (10µM).  isolated from rat brains were submitted to oxidative stress and treated with ETAC.Only the EHAC extract reduced cell viability by 30% after 72h of treatment. Morphological analyses by Immunofluorescence showed positive staining for glutamine synthetase, β-III tubulin, GFAP and IBA1 similar to control cultures, indicating a better preservation of astrocytes, neurons and microglia, after excitotoxic damage induced by glutamate in cerebellar cultures treated with the extracts. The ETAC extract also protected  isolated from rat brains from oxidative stress, reducing the swelling, dissipation of the membrane potential, ROS production and calcium influx.Thus, this study suggests that the seed extracts from A. Cearensis exhibit neuroprotective potential against oxidative stress and excitotoxicity induced by glutamate and can be considered a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Macroscopic changes of stomach were recorded and some of the worms collected. Based on number of parasites present in the stomach, they were divided into light infection, mild infection, and severe infection. Parasites were collected, and worms identification of the species was confirmed on the basis of light microscope examination with reference to keys. Tissues fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and processed and plastic embedded; ultrathin sections of 60-70 nm were cut and stained with uranyl  and lead citrate; electron microscopic observations showed that, in light infection some changes were observed in gastric cells such as dilatation and vesiculation of the endoplasmic reticulum, large numbers of lipid granules, mitochondrial swelling, nuclear chromatin margination, and some nucleus showed washed out appearance. Other cells showed some alterations in , dilatation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, loss of both free and bound ribosomes, vesiculation in cytoplasm, and increase Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles. The inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and predominantly eosinophils were identified. In moderate infection, the cellular pattern of gastric mucosa replaced with inflammatory cells. The marked increase of macrophages and other inflammatory cell was observed. A particular finding in our study was the presence of globule leukocyte in the moderate stage. Moreover, scant formation and distribution of collagen fibers as well as fibroblasts were also noted. In severe infection, the most obvious observation was marked distribution of collagen fibers around the mucosal cells. The fibroblastic cells with elongated nucleus and extensive indentation were noticed. In conclusion, the result of our study revealed P. clausa could be a cause of gastritis and according to cellular pattern of inflammatory reaction, with the increase of worm burden and development of infection, chronic gastritis was stabilized.

CRC increased risk has been associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota, with decreased production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs produced in the human colon are the major products of bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary fiber and starch. While colonocytes use the three major SCFAs, namely , propionate and butyrate, as energy sources, transformed CRC cells primarily undergo aerobic glycolysis. Compared to normal colonocytes, CRC cells exhibit increased sensitivity to SCFAs, thus indicating they play an important role in cell homeostasis. Manipulation of SCFA levels in the intestine, through changes in microbiota, has therefore emerged as a potential preventive/therapeutic strategy for CRC. Interest in understanding SCFAs mechanism of action in CRC cells has increased in the last years. Several SCFA transporters like SMCT-1, MCT-1 and aquaporins have been identified as the main transmembrane transporters in intestinal cells. Recently, it was shown that  promotes plasma membrane re-localization of MCT-1 and triggers changes in the glucose metabolism. SCFAs induce apoptotic cell death in CRC cells, and further mechanisms have been discovered, including the involvement of lysosomal membrane permeabilization, associated with  dysfunction and degradation. In this review, we will cover the current knowledge on the transport of SCFAs by CRC cells and their effects on CRC metabolism and survival. The impact of increasing SCFA production by manipulation of colon microbiota on the prevention/therapy of CRC will also be addressed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151243>Polytrichum commune L.ex Hedw ethyl  extract-triggered perturbations in intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis regulates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Polytrichum commune L.ex Hedw (PCLH), a moss of Bryopsida, has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine and shown to possess anticancer activities. Previous studies have indicated its anti-leukemia effect but the potential mechanisms have not been fully explained.The present study aimed to further investigate the efficacy of PCLH ethyl  fraction (PC-EEF) and the associated mechanisms in human leukemia cells.Phytochemical analysis of PC-EEF was performed by spectrophotometry and HPLC. MTT analysis and trypan blue exclusion assay were adopted to examine its cytotoxicity on a panel of leukemia cells (K562, U937, HL-60 and K562/DOX cells) and non-cancerous cells (human PBMCs). Anti-proliferative effect was monitored by colony formation assay and EdU incorporation assay. Ultrastructural alterations on K562 cell membrane surface were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Changes on plasma membrane integrity, cell membrane potential, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscope was performed to assess [Ca(2+)]i level, mitochondrial injury and cytochrome c release. Apoptosis-associated protein expression was analyzed by western blot. The role of Ca(2+) in PC-EEF-induced cell death was investigated by Ca(2+) chelating reagent BAPTA-AM.PC-EEF possessed relatively high flavonoid content (about 88.84 ± 0.89%) and showed significant cytotoxicity to human leukemia cells. PC-EEF could cause obvious cell morphological deformation, membrane integrity loss and membrane depolarization. Meanwhile, PC-EEF treatment could dramatically potentiate perturbations in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Subsequently, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, cytochrome c release and Bcl-2/Bax down-regulation were all observed. Consistent with these results, PC-EEF treatment resulted in significant activation of caspase 3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation and apoptosis. Moreover, PC-EEF-caused cytotoxicity, membrane damage, mitochondrial injury and apoptosis were remarkably reversed by BAPTA-AM.PC-EEF damaged the membrane system and triggered Ca(2+)-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis, which may provide some new insights into its efficacy against human leukemia cells.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Diabetes-mellitus affects peripheral nerves and is known to cause fatty liver disease. Electron microscopy (EM) provides the resolution required to observe changes in fine subcellular structures caused by such physiological and pathological processes, but samples are observed in vacuum. Environmental capsule EM can directly observe cells in a more natural aqueous environment, but the size-limited capsules restrict cell culturability. The recently developed atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM) has an open, 35 mm sample dish, allowing the culture of primary cells, including neurons, on the electron-transparent film window fabricated in its base. The system's inverted scanning electron microscope observes aldehyde-fixed cells or tissues from below through the silicon nitride film; the optical microscope located above allows direct correlation of fluorescence labeling. To observe fixed biological samples, damage due to low dose electron radiation is minimized in three ways. First, knock on damage that pushes out atoms is decreased by the low accelerating voltage of 10-30 kV. Second, increased radical generation due to the decreased acceleration voltage is countered by the addition of a radical scavenger, glucose or ascorbic acid, to the sample solution. Third, the large volume (max. 2 ml) of aqueous buffer surrounding the sample has a high specific heat capacity, minimizing the temperature increase caused by irradiation. Using ASEM, we have developed protocols for heavy metal staining in solution to selectively visualize intracellular structures. Various EM staining methods served as a starting point. Uranyl  preferably stains proteins and nucleic acid, and prior tannic acid treatment enhances membranes. Osmium tetroxide is suggested to enhance lipids, especially oil droplets. Imaging primary-culture neurons stained with platinum blue or uranyl  revealed growth cones, synapses, and 50-500 nm spines, together with neurite backbones and their associated structures. Correlative microscopy with immuno-fluorescence labeling suggested that these were mainly microtubule associated objects; some showed signs of a fission process and were, thus, possibly . Liver tissue excised from the ob/ob type 2 diabetes model mouse, was stained with osmium tetroxide and observed using ASEM. Swollen bright balls occupied a large area of the cytoplasm and could be distinguished from vacuoles, suggesting that they are oil droplets. In some of the images, oil-like droplets were pressing surrounding structures, including sinusoids, significant for blood circulation in the liver. Based on these studies, ASEM combined with metal staining methods promises to allow the study of various mesoscopic-scale phenomena of cells and tissues immersed in natural aqueous environment in the near future. The quick nature of ASEM could facilitate not only the precise imaging for neuroscience but also the diagnosis of fatty liver disease and related diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The neuroprotective effects of these triterpenoids were investigated in the present study, in which the okadaic acid induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were used as an Alzheimer's disease cell model in vitro. The cell model was established with all trans-retinoic acid (5 µmol/L, 4 d) and okadaic acid (40 nmol/L, 6 h) treatments to induce tau phosphorylation and synaptic atrophy. Subsequently, the neuroprotective effects of these triterpenic acids were evaluated in vitro by this cell model. Results from the Western blot and morphology analysis suggested that compounds 3-6 had the better neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, we tested the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential of these compounds in SH-SY5Y cells by flow cytometry technology to investigate the potential neuroprotective mechanism of these compounds. All of the results indicated that maybe the mechanism of compounds 5 and 6 is to protect the cell from mitochondrial oxidative stress injuries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901665>Multi-target antidiabetic mechanisms of mexicanolides from Swietenia humilis.</a></h2><p>Swietenia humilis seeds are consumed in Mexico to treat type 2 diabetes; the antihyperglycemic effect of this species was previously demonstrated and related to the presence of tetranortriterpenoids of the mexicanolide class.The present investigation was conducted to determine the mechanism of action of selected mexicanolides, including 2-hydroxy-destigloyl-6-deoxyswietenine  (1), methyl-2-hydroxy-3-β-tigloyloxy-1-oxomeliac-8(30)-enate (2) and humilinolide H (3), using in vivo experiments with hyperglycemic mice, and cell-based models.Nicotinamide-streptozotocin hyperglycemic mice (50-130 mg/kg, i.p.) were used to build antihyperglycemic drug-response curves using an oral glucose tolerance test model. In vitro studies were carried out on INSE1, H4IIE and C2C12 cells to assess insulin secretion, glucose-6-phosphatase inhibition, glucose uptake and mitochondrial bioenergetics, respectively.The combination of the decoction of S. humilis or 2-hydroxy-destigloyl-6-deoxyswietenine  (mexicanolide 1) with glibenclamide resulted in a reduction of the antihyperglycemic effect while a significant increase was observed when they were dosed with metformin. These effects were related to K SUR blockade, insulin secretion in INSE1 cells, and modulation of 5-HT receptors. Furthermore, mexicanolides 1-3 inhibited glucose-phosphatase in H4IIE cells, and enhanced glucose uptake and spare respiratory capacity in C2C12 myotubes.S. humilis mexicanolides interact with pharmacological targets at pancreas (K channels), liver (glucose-6-phosphatase), and skeletal muscle ( and possibly glucose transporters) to modulate glucose homeostasis, and could be a promising resource to treat type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019.

The natural capacity of the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus to produce volatile esters at high rate and at elevated temperatures make it a potentially valuable production platform for industrial biotechnology. Here, we identify the native localization of ethyl  biosynthesis in K. marxianus and use this information to develop a multiplexed CRISPRi system for redirecting carbon flux along central metabolic pathways, increasing ethyl  productivity. First, we identified the primary pathways of precursor and  ester biosynthesis. A genetic knockout screen revealed that the alcohol acetyltransferase Eat1 is the critical enzyme for ethyl, isoamyl, and phenylethyl  production. Truncation studies revealed that high ester biosynthesis is contingent on Eat1 mitochondrial localization. As ethyl  is formed from the condensation of ethanol and acetyl-CoA, we modulated expression of the TCA cycle and electron transport chain genes using a highly multiplexed CRISPRi approach. The simultaneous knockdown of ACO2b, SDH2, RIP1, and MSS51 resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in ethyl  productivity over the already high natural capacity. This work demonstrates that multiplexed CRISPRi regulation of central carbon flux, supported by a fundamental understanding of pathway biochemistry, is a potent strategy for metabolic engineering in nonconventional microorganisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263848>Phaleria macrocarpa (Boerl.) fruit induce G/G and G/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through -mediated pathway in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell.</a></h2><p>Phaleria macrocarpa (Scheff) Boerl, is a well-known folk medicinal plant in Indonesia. Traditionally, P. macrocarpa has been used to control cancer, impotency, hemorrhoids, diabetes mellitus, allergies, liver and hearth disease, kidney disorders, blood diseases, acne, stroke, migraine, and various skin diseases.The purpose of this study was to determine the in situ cytotoxicity effect P. macrocarpa fruit ethyl  fraction (PMEAF) and the underlying molecular mechanism of cell death.MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with PMEAF for 24h. Cell cycle and viability were examined using flow cytometry analysis. Apoptosis was determined using the Annexin V assay and also by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis protein profiling was detected by RayBio® Human Apoptosis Array.The AO/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with PMEAF were showed apoptotic cell death. The cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry analysis revealed that the accumulation of PMEAF treated MDA-MB-231 cells in G/G and G/M-phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, the PMEAF exert cytotoxicity by increased the ROS production in MDA-MB-231 cells consistently stimulated the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆) and induced apoptosis cell death by activation of numerous signalling proteins. The results from apoptosis protein profiling array evidenced that PMEAF stimulated the expression of 9 pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bid, caspase 3, caspase 8, cytochrome c, p21, p27, p53 and SMAC) and suppressed the 4 anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, XIAP and survivin) in MDA-MB-231 cells.The results indicated that PMEAF treatment induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells through intrinsic mitochondrial related pathway with the participation of pro and anti-apoptotic proteins, caspases, G/G and G/M-phases cell cycle arrest by p53-mediated mechanism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To date, little is known about its mechanisms of action. Here we examined the cytotoxic effect of asiatic acid on HepG2 cells and elucidated some of the underlying mechanisms. Asiatic acid induced rapid cell death, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dissipation, ATP depletion and cytochrome c release from  to the cytosol in HepG2 cells. In  isolated from mouse liver, asiatic acid treatment significantly stimulated the succinate-supported state 4 respiration rate, dissipated the MMP, increased Ca(2+) release from Ca(2+)-loaded , decreased ATP content and promoted cytochrome c release, indicating the uncoupling effect of asiatic acid. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by succinate-supported mitochondrial respiration was also significantly inhibited by asiatic acid. In addition, asiatic acid inhibited Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling but did not induce mitochondrial swelling in hyposmotic potassium  medium which suggested that asiatic acid may not act as a protonophoric uncoupler. Inhibition of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) or blockade of adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) attenuated the effect of asiatic acid on MMP dissipation, Ca(2+) release, mitochondrial respiration and HepG2 cell death. When combined inhibition of UCPs and ANT, asiatic acid-mediated uncoupling effect was noticeably alleviated. These results suggested that both UCPs and ANT partially contribute to the uncoupling properties of asiatic acid. In conclusion, asiatic acid is a novel mitochondrial uncoupler and this property is potentially involved in its toxicity on HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the physiological role of proton beam radiation are not well understood, and many studies are still being conducted regarding these mechanisms. To determine the effects of proton beams on mitochondrial biogenesis, we investigated: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mass; the gene expression of mitochondrial transcription factors, functional regulators, and dynamic-related regulators; and the phosphorylation of the signaling molecules that participate in mitochondrial biogenesis. Both the mtDNA/nuclear DNA (nDNA) ratio and the  staining assays showed that proton beam irradiation increases mitochondrial biogenesis in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)-induced aggressive HT-29 cells. Simultaneously, proton beam irradiation increases the gene expression of the mitochondrial transcription factors PGC-1α, NRF1, ERRα, and mtTFA, the dynamic regulators DRP1, OPA1, TIMM44, and TOM40, and the functional regulators CytC, ATP5B and CPT1-α. Furthermore, proton beam irradiation increases the phosphorylation of AMPK, an important molecule involved in mitochondrial biogenesis that is an energy sensor and is regulated by the AMP/ATP ratio. Based on these findings, we suggest that proton beam irradiation inhibits metastatic potential by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and function in TPA-induced aggressive HT-29 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940531>Single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse carotid body glomus cells.</a></h2><p>Carotid body (CB) glomus cells mediate acute oxygen sensing and the initiation of the hypoxic ventilatory response, yet the gene expression profile of these cells is not available. We demonstrate that the single cell RNA-Seq method is a powerful tool for identifying highly expressed genes in CB glomus cells. Our single cell RNA-Seq results characterized novel CB glomus cell genes, including members of the G protein-coupled receptor signalling pathway, ion channels and atypical mitochondrial electron transport chain subunits. A heterologous cell-based screening identified  (which is known to affect CB glomus cell activity) as an agonist for the most highly abundant G protein-coupled receptor (Olfr78) in CB glomus cells. These data established the first transcriptome profile of CB glomus cells, highlighting genes with potential implications in CB chemosensory function.The carotid body (CB) is a major arterial chemoreceptor containing glomus cells whose activities are regulated by changes in arterial blood content, including oxygen. Despite significant advancements in the characterization of their physiological properties, our understanding of the underlying molecular machinery and signalling pathway in CB glomus cells is still limited. To overcome this, we employed the single cell RNA-Seq method by performing next-generation sequencing on single glomus cell-derived cDNAs to eliminate contamination of genes derived from other cell types present in the CB. Using this method, we identified a set of genes abundantly expressed in glomus cells, which contained novel glomus cell-specific genes. Transcriptome and subsequent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analyses identified abundant G protein-coupled receptor signalling pathway components and various types of ion channels, as well as members of the hypoxia-inducible factors pathway. A short-chain fatty acid olfactory receptor Olfr78, recently implicated in CB function, was the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor. Two atypical mitochondrial electron transport chain subunits (Ndufa4l2 and Cox4i2) were among the most specifically expressed genes in CB glomus cells, highlighting their potential roles in -mediated oxygen sensing.

The role of p53 in the cell is determined by the type of imposed oxidative stress, its intensity and duration. The last decade of research has unravelled a dual nature in the function of p53 in mediating the oxidative stress burden. However, this is dependent on the specific properties of the applied stress and thus requires further analysis.A systematic review was performed following an electronic search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases. Articles published in the English language between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2017 were identified and isolated based on the analysis of p53 in skeletal muscle in both animal and cell culture models.Literature was categorized according to the modality of imposed oxidative stress including exercise, diet modification, exogenous oxidizing agents, tissue manipulation, irradiation, and hypoxia. With low to moderate levels of oxidative stress, p53 is involved in activating pathways that increase time for cell repair, such as cell cycle arrest and autophagy, to enhance cell survival. However, with greater levels of stress intensity and duration, such as with irradiation, hypoxia, and oxidizing agents, the role of p53 switches to facilitate increased cellular stress levels by initiating DNA fragmentation to induce apoptosis, thereby preventing aberrant cell proliferation.Current evidence confirms that p53 acts as a threshold regulator of cellular homeostasis. Therefore, within each modality, the intensity and duration are parameters of the oxidative stressor that must be analyzed to determine the role p53 plays in regulating signaling pathways to maintain cellular health and function in skeletal muscle.Acadl: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long chain; Acadm: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, C-4 to C-12 straight chain; AIF: apoptosis-inducing factor; Akt: protein kinase B (PKB); AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATF-4: activating transcription factor 4; ATM: ATM serine/threonine kinase; Bax: BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator; Bcl-2: B cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 2 apoptosis regulator; Bhlhe40: basic helix-loop-helix family member e40; BH3: Borane; Bim: bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death; Bok: Bcl-2 related ovarian killer; COX-IV: cytochrome c oxidase IV; cGMP: Cyclic guanosine monophosphate; c-myc: proto-oncogene protein; Cpt1b: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B; Dr5: death receptor 5; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ERK: extracellular regulated MAP kinase; Fas: Fas Cell surface death receptor; FDXR: Ferredoxin Reductase; FOXO3a: forkhead box O3; Gadd45a: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha; GLS2: glutaminase 2; GLUT 1 and 4: glucose transporter 1(endothelial) and 4 (skeletal muscle); GSH: Glutathione; Hes1: hes family bHLH transcription factor 1; Hey1: hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1; HIFI-α: hypoxia-inducible factor 1, α-subunit; HK2: Hexokinase 2; HSP70: Heat Shock Protein 70; HO: Hydrogen Peroxide; Id2: inhibitor of DNA-binding 2; IGF-1-BP3: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3; IL-1β: Interleukin 1 beta; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; IRS-1: Insulin receptor substrate 1; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinases; LY-83583: 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione; inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase and of cGMP production; Mdm 2/ 4: Mouse double minute 2 homolog (mouse) Mdm4 (humans); mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; MURF1: Muscle RING-finger protein-1; MyoD: Myogenic differentiation 1; MyoG: myogenin; Nanog: Nanog homeobox; NF-kB: Nuclear factor-κB; NO: nitric oxide; NoxA: phorbol-12-myristate-13--induced protein 1 (Pmaip1); NRF-1: nuclear respiratory factor 1; Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; P21: Cdkn1a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (P21); P38 MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases; p53R2: p53 inducible ribonucleotide reductase gene; P66Shc: src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein C1; PERP: p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22; PGC-1α: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; PGM: phosphoglucomutase; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; PKCβ: protein kinase c beta; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog; PTIO: 2-phenyl-4, 4, 5, 5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) has been used as a nitric oxide (NO) scavenger; Puma: The p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis; PW1: paternally expressed 3 (Peg3); RNS: Reactive nitrogen species; SIRT1: sirtuin 1; SCO2: cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein; SOD2: superoxide dismutase 2; Tfam: transcription factor A mitochondrial; TIGAR: Trp53 induced glycolysis repulatory phosphatase; TNF-a: tumor necrosis factor a; TRAF2: TNF receptor associated factor 2; TRAIL: type II transmembrane protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940900>Parkinsonia aculeata (Caesalpineaceae) improves high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance in mice through the enhancement of insulin signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis.</a></h2><p>The search for natural agents that minimize obesity-associated disorders is receiving special attention. Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Caesalpineaceae) has long been used in Brazil as a hypoglycaemic herbal medicine, without any scientific basis.In this context, we aimed to use molecular and physiological methods to study the effect of a hydroethanolic extract partitioned with ethyl  from the aerial parts of Parkinsonia aculeata (HEPa/EtOAc) on insulin resistance in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO).Firstly, C57BL/6J mice were fed either with standard rodent chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 consecutive weeks. Then, the animals were treated with HEPa/EtOAc at two doses (125 and 250mg/kg/day) or metformin (200mg/kg/day) for 16 days. At the end of the experiment, body weight, fat pad weight, fasting serum glucose (FSG), insulin (FSI) and leptin were measured. Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was also calculated. Glucose, insulin and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed. The expression and phosphorylation of IRβ(tyr), Akt(ser473), AMPKα and PGC1α in liver, muscle and adipose tissue were determined by Western blot analyses.Herein we demonstrate for the first time an improvement in insulin resistance following HEPa/EtOAc administration in obese mice, as shown by increased glucose, insulin and pyruvate tolerance, as well as an improvement in FSG, FSI, HOMA-IR and circulating leptin levels, which together are in part due to enhancement of the insulin signaling pathway in its main target tissues. Surprisingly, the increase in activation of the AMPKα-PGC1-α axis by HEPa/EtOAc was similar to that produced by metformin treatment in the liver and muscle tissues.In conclusion, P. aculeata appears to be a source of therapeutic agent against obesity-related complications.Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559597>Effects of Pinacidil and Calcium on Succinate-Energized Rat Heart  in the Presence of Rotenone.</a></h2><p>The effect of pinacidil was studied on calcium-loaded rat heart  (RHM) in the presence of succinate and rotenone. In experiments with pinacidil, the swelling of these  increased in media with NHNO or K-, but the inner membrane potential (ΔΨ) and the respiration in 3 or 2,4-dinitrophenol-stimulated states of these organelles decreased due to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in their inner membrane. These effects were inhibited by cyclosporin A and ADP. It was concluded that the protective effect of pinacidil in the cardiac muscle under ischemia/reperfusion may be associated with both the stimulation of mitochondrial swelling and a decrease in RHM calcium overload resulted in ΔΨ fall due to mild uncoupling effect of pinacidil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27974193>Perinatal exposure to lead (Pb) induces ultrastructural and molecular alterations in synapses of rat offspring.</a></h2><p>Lead (Pb), environmentally abundant heavy-metal pollutant, is a strong toxicant for the developing central nervous system. Pb intoxication in children, even at low doses, is found to affect learning and memorizing, with devastating effects on cognitive function and intellectual development. However, the precise mechanism by which Pb impairs synaptic plasticity is not fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of pre- and neonatal exposure to low dose of Pb (with Pb concentrations in whole blood below 10μg/dL) on the synaptic structure and the pre- and postsynaptic proteins expression in the developing rat brain. Furthermore, the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was analyzed. Pregnant female Wistar rats received 0.1% lead  (PbAc) in drinking water from the first day of gestation until weaning of the offspring, while the control animals received drinking water. During the feeding of pups, mothers from the Pb-group were continuously receiving PbAc. Pups of both groups were weaned at postnatal day 21 and then until postnatal day 28 received only drinking water. 28-day old pups were sacrificed and the ultrastructural changes as well as expression of presynaptic (VAMP1/2, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin-1, SNAP25, syntaxin-1) and postsynaptic (PSD-95) proteins were analyzed in: forebrain cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Our data revealed that pre- and neonatal exposure to low dose of Pb promotes pathological changes in synapses, including nerve endings swelling, blurred and thickened synaptic cleft structure as well as enhanced density of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic area. Moreover, synaptic  were elongated, swollen or shrunken in Pb-treated animals. These structural abnormalities were accompanied by decrease in the level of key synaptic proteins: synaptotagmin-1 in cerebellum, SNAP25 in hippocampus and syntaxin-1 in cerebellum and hippocampus. In turn, increased level of synaptophysin was noticed in the cerebellum, while the expression of postsynaptic PSD-95 was significantly decreased in forebrain cortex and cerebellum, and raised in hippocampus. Additionally, we observed the lower level of BDNF in all brain structures in comparison to control animals. In conclusion, perinatal exposure to low doses of Pb caused pathological changes in nerve endings associated with the alterations in the level of key synaptic proteins. All these changes can lead to synaptic dysfunction, expressed by the impairment of the secretory mechanism and thereby to the abnormalities in neurotransmission as well as to the neuronal dysfunction.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The absorption and fluorescence spectra of EAEC were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. EAEC-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HCT116 and SW620 cells was detected using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG). The photo- and dark toxicities of EAEC were estimated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cellular uptake and localization of EAEC were detected by confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess apoptosis and autophagy. The antitumor activity of EAEC was confirmed in a xenograft model. Finally, effects on the PERK pathway were verified using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. EAEC displayed absorption and fluorescence emission peaks at 660 nm and 678 nm, respectively. EAEC induced ROS production in CRC cells. Assessment of dark toxicity showed that treatment with EAEC alone induced little cytotoxicity in CRC or normal cells but that EAEC-PDT induced significant photocytotoxicity in CRC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After cellular uptake, EAEC was located in the . Treatment with EAEC-PDT reduced xenograft tumor size. Further evaluation suggested that activation of the PERK pathway mediates these effects, as the apoptotic rate and autophagy flux increased markedly after EAEC-PDT. EAEC, a natural photosensitizer extracted from , displays potential utility in PDT of CRC by targeting the PERK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26310111>Mitochondrial uncoupling links lipid catabolism to Akt inhibition and resistance to tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>To support growth, tumour cells reprogramme their metabolism to simultaneously upregulate macromolecular biosynthesis while maintaining energy production. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) oppose this phenotype by inducing futile mitochondrial respiration that is uncoupled from ATP synthesis, resulting in nutrient wasting. Here using a UCP3 transgene targeted to the basal epidermis, we show that forced mitochondrial uncoupling inhibits skin carcinogenesis by blocking Akt activation. Similarly, Akt activation is markedly inhibited in UCP3 overexpressing primary human keratinocytes. Mechanistic studies reveal that uncoupling increases fatty acid oxidation and membrane phospholipid catabolism, and impairs recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of Akt overcomes metabolic regulation by UCP3, rescuing carcinogenesis. These findings demonstrate that mitochondrial uncoupling is an effective strategy to limit proliferation and tumorigenesis through inhibition of Akt, and illuminate a novel mechanism of crosstalk between mitochondrial metabolism and growth signalling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27650398>High-intensity interval training prevents oxidant-mediated diaphragm muscle weakness in hypertensive mice.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is a key risk factor for heart failure, with the latter characterized by diaphragm muscle weakness that is mediated in part by increased oxidative stress. In the present study, we used a deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt mouse model to determine whether hypertension could independently induce diaphragm dysfunction and further investigated the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Sham-treated (n = 11), DOCA-salt-treated (n = 11), and DOCA-salt+HIIT-treated (n = 15) mice were studied over 4 wk. Diaphragm contractile function, protein expression, enzyme activity, and fiber cross-sectional area and type were subsequently determined. Elevated blood pressure confirmed hypertension in DOCA-salt mice independent of HIIT (P < 0.05). Diaphragm forces were impaired by ∼15-20% in DOCA-salt vs. sham-treated mice (P < 0.05), but this effect was prevented after HIIT. Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) protein expression tended to decrease (∼30%; P = 0.06) in DOCA-salt vs. sham- and DOCA-salt+HIIT mice, whereas oxidative stress increased (P < 0.05). Enzyme activity of NADPH oxidase was higher, but superoxide dismutase was lower, with MyHC oxidation elevated by ∼50%. HIIT further prevented direct oxidant-mediated diaphragm contractile dysfunction (P < 0.05) after a 30 min exposure to HO- (1 mM). Our data suggest that hypertension induces diaphragm contractile dysfunction via an oxidant-mediated mechanism that is prevented by HIIT.-Bowen, T.

In addition, the cycle carries released transmitter back to astrocytes, where a minor fraction (~25 %) is degraded (requiring a similar amount of resynthesis) and the remainder returned to the neurons for reuse. The flux in the cycle is intense, amounting to the same value as neuronal glucose utilization rate or 75-80 % of total cortical glucose consumption. This glucose:glutamate ratio is reduced when high amounts of β-hydroxybutyrate are present, but β-hydroxybutyrate can at most replace 60 % of glucose during awake brain function. The cycle is initiated by α-ketoglutarate production in astrocytes and its conversion via glutamate to glutamine which is released. A crucial reaction in the cycle is metabolism of glutamine after its accumulation in neurons. In glutamatergic neurons all generated glutamate enters the  and its exit to the cytosol occurs in a process resembling the malate-aspartate shuttle and therefore requiring concomitant pyruvate metabolism. In GABAergic neurons one half enters the , whereas the other one half is released directly from the cytosol. A revised concept is proposed for the synthesis and metabolism of vesicular and nonvesicular GABA. It includes the well-established neuronal GABA reuptake, its metabolism, and use for resynthesis of vesicular GABA. In contrast, mitochondrial glutamate is by transamination to α-ketoglutarate and subsequent retransamination to releasable glutamate essential for the transaminations occurring during metabolism of accumulated GABA and subsequent resynthesis of vesicular GABA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27847202>Ethyl  extract of Peperomia tetraphylla induces cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in lymphoma U937 cells.</a></h2><p>The current study evaluated the cytotoxicity and the mechanism of apoptotic induction by Peperomia tetraphylla in U937 lymphoma cells. The results showed that P. tetraphylla ethyl  extract (EAEPT) inhibited the cell growth in U937 cells by MTT assay. After the U937 cells were treated with EAEPT, the cells exhibited marked morphological features of apoptosis (Hoechst 33342 staining) and the number of apoptotic cell (Annexin V-FITC/PI staining) increased. The treatment of EAEPT could induce loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increase the ROS level. Moreover, EAEPT treatment resulted in the accumulation of cells at S phase. We found that EAEPT could induce the cleavage of the caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 and Bid. And the treatment of EAEPT could increase expression of Bax and down-regulate the expression of CCNB1, CCND1 and CDK1. The sub-fraction of EAEPT, namely EASub1 demonstrated the highest cytotoxicity activity on U937 cells. It was confirmed that EAEPT could inhibit the growth of U937 cells by blocking the cell cycle and prompted apoptosis via the ROS-medicated  pathway in vitro.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It serves as a structural and catalytic cofactor for numerous proteins, hence maintaining a proper level of cellular zinc is essential for normal functioning of the cell. Zinc homeostasis is sustained through various ways under severe zinc-deficient conditions. Zinc-dependent proteins play an important role in biological systems and limitation of zinc causes a drastic change in their expression. In budding yeast, a zinc-responsive transcription factor Zap1p controls the expression of genes required for uptake and mobilization of zinc under zinc-limiting conditions. It also regulates the polar lipid levels under zinc-limiting conditions to maintain membrane integrity. Deletion of ZAP1 causes an increase in triacylglyerol levels which is due to the increased biosynthesis of  that serves as a precursor for triacylglycerol biosynthesis. In this review, we expanded our recent work role of Zap1p in nonpolar lipid metabolism of budding yeast.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27927723>Coordinated activation of mitochondrial respiration and exocytosis mediated by PKC signaling in pancreatic β cells.</a></h2><p> play a central role in pancreatic β-cell nutrient sensing by coupling their metabolism to plasma membrane excitability and insulin granule exocytosis. Whether non-nutrient secretagogues stimulate  as part of the molecular mechanism to promote insulin secretion is not known. Here, we show that PKC signaling, which is employed by many non-nutrient secretagogues, augments mitochondrial respiration in INS-1E (rat insulinoma cell line clone 1E) and human pancreatic β cells. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-, accelerates mitochondrial respiration at both resting and stimulatory glucose concentrations. A range of inhibitors of novel PKC isoforms prevent phorbol ester-induced respiration. Respiratory response was blocked by oligomycin that demonstrated PKC-dependent acceleration of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Enhanced respiration was observed even when glycolysis was bypassed or fatty acid transport was blocked, which suggested that PKC regulates mitochondrial processes rather than upstream catabolic fluxes. A phosphoproteome study of phorbol ester-stimulated INS-1E cells maintained under resting (2.5 mM) glucose revealed a large number of phosphorylation sites that were altered during short-term activation of PKC signaling. The data set was enriched for proteins that are involved in gene expression, cytoskeleton remodeling, secretory vesicle transport, and exocytosis. Interactome analysis identified PKC, C-Raf, and ERK1/2 as the central phosphointeraction cluster. Prevention of ERK1/2 signaling by using a MEK1 inhibitor caused a marked decreased in phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced mitochondrial respiration. ERK1/2 signaling module therefore links PKC activation to downstream mitochondrial activation. We conclude that non-nutrient secretagogues act, in part,  PKC and downstream ERK1/2 signaling to stimulate mitochondrial energy production to compensate for energy expenditure that is linked to β-cell activation.-Santo-Domingo, J., Chareyron, I., Dayon, L., Galindo, A.

In this study, we investigated methanol, ethyl- and acetone extracts of T. chamaedrys in respect to their anticancer properties in SW480 colorectal cancer cells.Cytotoxicity and proapoptotic potential were assessed by MTT cell viability assay and AO/EB double staining. Molecular mechanisms of induced apoptosis were determined by monitoring Fas receptor protein expression through immunofluorescence, Caspase 8 and 9 activity, as well as concentrations of O spectrophotometrically. Additionally, mRNA expression of biotransformation enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTP1) and membrane transporters (MRP1 and MRP2) involved in drug resistance were investigated by qPCR method. Qualitative analysis of individual phenolic compounds was performed by reversed phase HPLC-MS analysis.Methanol extract shows the best cytotoxicity and selectivity compared to ethyl- and acetone extracts, mainly causing apoptosis of SW480 cells, without affecting normal HaCaT keratinocytes. The increased expression of Fas receptor protein and caspase 8 activity indicate that the death receptor-mediated pathway plays a crucial role in the observed apoptosis. The increased caspase 9 activity and O concentration suggest that  are also involved in the apoptosis. T. chamaedrys methanol extract inhibits mRNA expression of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTP1, MRP1 and MRP2 in SW480 cells.Induction of apoptosis and inhibition of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTP1, MRP1 and MRP2 mRNA expression implies that T. chamaedrys can serve as a valuable source of bioactive compounds as dietary supplements or selective anticancer agents, with the ability to induce apoptosis and modulate drug resistance in colorectal cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

We extend the methodology to account for correlations in protein expression arising from the co-regulation of genes and apply it to study the growth of independent Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in two different growth media. We find the partitioning of flux between fermentation and respiration predicted by our model agrees with recent 13C fluxomics experiments, and that our model largely recovers the Crabtree effect (the experimentally known bias among certain yeast species toward fermentation with the production of ethanol even in the presence of oxygen), while FBA without proteomics constraints predicts respirative metabolism almost exclusively. The comparisons to the 13C study showed improvement upon inclusion of the correlations and motivated a technique to systematically identify inconsistent kinetic parameters in the literature. The minor secretion fluxes for glycerol and  are underestimated by our method, which indicate a need for further refinements to the metabolic model. For yeast cells grown in synthetic defined (SD) medium, the calculated broad distribution of growth rates matches experimental observations from single cell studies, and we characterize several metabolic phenotypes within our modeled populations that make use of diverse pathways. Fast growing yeast cells are predicted to perform significant amount of respiration, use serine-glycine cycle and produce ethanol in  as opposed to slow growing cells. We use a genetic algorithm to determine the proteomics constraints necessary to reproduce the growth rate distributions seen experimentally.

The cells were treated with TPA under various conditions and thereafter exposed to a single lethal dose of gamma radiation. Morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis were followed up to 72 h of post-irradiation time. Acute exposure to low concentration of TPA resulted in delay in the onset of radiation-induced apoptosis (determined as morphological changes and rate of mitochondrial demise) by 24-48 h as compared to the irradiated, sham TPA-treated cells. The time course of this delay correlated well with confinement of the p53 protein to the cytoplasm and increase in bcl-2 levels at the nuclear periphery of irradiated cells. Our results indicate that confinement of p53 in the cytoplasm is one of the potential mechanisms by which TPA interferes with the process of radiation-induced apoptosis in human lymphocytes.</p></html>
