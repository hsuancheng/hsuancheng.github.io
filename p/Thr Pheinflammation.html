In Lewis rats this epitope induces experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, and is a model of MS. Structure-activity studies have shown that Lys(91) and Pro(96) residues are important for encephalitogenicity. Replacement of Lys and/or Pro residues with Arg and/or Ala, respectively, results in suppression of EAE. A potent linear altered peptide ligand of the immunodominant sequence MBP(83-99) has been selected for clinical trial (Nat. Med. 2000, 6, 1167, 1176). In the present report, two cyclic analogues, cyclo(91-99)[Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) and cyclo(87-99)[Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) were designed by NMR and molecular modeling data on human MBP(87-99) epitope (Val(87)-His---Lys-Asn-Ile-Val--Pro-Arg--Pro(99)) and its linear antagonist peptide analogue [Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99). These analogues (altered peptide ligands) inhibited EAE in Lewis rats and decreased  in the spinal cord. In addition, the analogue cyclo(87-99)[Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) induced proliferation of human peripheral blood T-cells. These cyclic MBP(87-99) peptide analogues may lead to the design of potent antagonist mimetics for treating MS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18225564>Antitumor activity of the somatostatin structural derivative (TT-232), against mouse and human melanoma tumor models.</a></h1><p>The somatostatin structural deivative, TT-232, has a special 5'-residue ring structure (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys--NH2) and very different characteristics from the known growth hormone (GH) active somatostatin analogs. TT-232 inhibited tyrosine kinase activity of tumor cell lines and this inhibition correlated well with the inhibition of cell proliferation of a large number of cancer cell lines in vitro and reduces the size of different tumors in animal models in vivo. The antitumor efficacy of TT-232 has been found to be associated with the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, resulting in highly selective elimination of tumor tissue. TT-232 was found to be devoid of GH release inhibitory activity but to possess strong antitumor effects. It binds with a high affinity to SSTR1 and SSTR4. This compound was also found to inhibit  in a number of experimental models.The study compared the antitumor effect of TT-232 in various long-term administration routes: an intermittent (injection) versus continuous (infusion) treatment via subcutaneously inserted 2002 type Alzet osmotic minipumps in two different tumor models (B-16 rodent melanoma and HT-18 human lymphoid melanoma). Treatment with TT-232 started after disease development. The antitumor efficacy of TT-232 was evaluated on the basis of tumor growth inhibition and survival time.In the case of B-16 rodent melanoma, the TT-232 treatments resulted in 35%-39% (injection) and 47%-63% (infusion) tumor growth inhibition, and the infusion treatment an approximately 61% increase in survival time. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of TT-232 on HT-18 lymphoid melanoma tumor proved to be significant, resulting in 41%-63% (injection) and 69%-79% (infusion) decreases in tumor volume and in a 25%-30% increase in survival time (infusion treatments).The results indicate that TT-232 could be a potentially useful therapeutic agent if these data are translated into clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649778>In silico design of small peptides antagonist against leptin receptor for the treatment of obesity and its associated immune-mediated diseases.</a></h1><p>Excess adiposity in obese inhibits negatively impacts immune function and host defence. Obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade, chronic  in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. The impact of metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related co-morbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decades. Thus, treatment of obesity and its associated immune-mediated diseases is challenging due to impaired function of leptin system. These disorders are managed through antibiotics and by cytokines replacement. However, the effectiveness of cytokines coupled to the complexity of the cytokine network leads to severe side-effects, which can still occur after careful preclinical evaluation. In addition, synthetic immunotherapeutics carry a degree of risk, time-consuming and expensive. Hence, the complexity of existing therapy and adverse effects emphasizes the need for an alternative approach for the management of immune dysfunction associated with obesity. Computer-aided small molecule antibody technology has been successful in the design of novel biologicals for the diagnosis of diseases and therapeutic interventions. In this study, the crystal structure of leptin receptor (LEPR) complex with monoclonal antibody (9F8 Fab) was explored to predict Ag-Ab interactions using bioinformatics tools. The LEPR of complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops were mutated with published positive control residues of Ser, , Tyr, Trp, and  to design a set of 678 peptides which were evaluated through Ag-peptide docking, binding free-energies, and interaction energies. Thus, hypothesized novel peptides can be explored as clinically applicable antagonists for the treatment of obesity and associated immune-mediated diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we provide evidence that the neutrophil-derived serine proteases elastase, proteinase 3 and cathepsin G are mainly involved in its degradation and subsequent inactivation. The initially hydrolyzed peptide bonds were detected to be Val(11)-Ala(12) and Leu(19)-(20) (elastase), (78)-Asn(79) (cathepsin G) and Ala(145)-Ser(146) (proteinase 3). The soluble IL-6 receptor elicits a protective effect against the IL-6 inactivation by cathepsin G only. The inactivation of IL-6 by neutrophil-derived serine proteases might act as a feedback mechanism terminating the IL-6-induced activation of neutrophils.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637154>Dissecting the molecular control of endothelial NO synthase by caveolin-1 using cell-permeable peptides.</a></h1><p>In endothelia, NO is synthesized by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which is negatively regulated by caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the primary coat protein of caveolae. We show that delivery of Cav-1 amino acids 82-101 (Cav) fused to an internalization sequence from Antennapedia (AP) blocks NO release in vitro and  and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which the AP-Cav peptide and Cav-1 mediate eNOS inhibition, we subdivided the Cav portion of AP-Cav into three domains (Cav-A, -B, and -C), synthesized five overlapping peptides (AP-Cav-A, -AB, -B, -BC, and -C), and tested their effects on eNOS-dependent activities. Peptides containing the Cav-B domain (amino acids 89-95) induced time- and dose-dependent inhibition of eNOS-dependent NO release in cultured endothelial cells, NO-dependent  in the ear, and hydraulic conductivity in isolated venules. Alanine scanning of AP-Cav-B revealed that -90 and -91 (T90,91) and -92 (F92) are crucial for AP-Cav-B- and AP-Cav-mediated inhibition of eNOS. Mutation of F92 to A92 in the Cav-1 cDNA caused the loss of eNOS inhibitory activity compared with wild-type Cav-1. These data highlight the importance of amino acids 89-95 and particularly F92 in mediating eNOS inhibition by AP-Cav and Cav-1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23873933>Identification of C-terminal phosphorylation sites of N-formyl peptide receptor-1 (FPR1) in human blood neutrophils.</a></h1><p>Accumulation, activation, and control of neutrophils at  sites is partly driven by N-formyl peptide chemoattractant receptors (FPRs). Occupancy of these G-protein-coupled receptors by formyl peptides has been shown to induce regulatory phosphorylation of cytoplasmic serine/threonine amino acid residues in heterologously expressed recombinant receptors, but the biochemistry of these modifications in primary human neutrophils remains relatively unstudied. FPR1 and FPR2 were partially immunopurified using antibodies that recognize both receptors (NFPRa) or unphosphorylated FPR1 (NFPRb) in dodecylmaltoside extracts of unstimulated and N-formyl-Met-Leu- (fMLF) + cytochalasin B-stimulated neutrophils or their membrane fractions. After deglycosylation and separation by SDS-PAGE, excised Coomassie Blue-staining bands (∼34,000 Mr) were tryptically digested, and FPR1, phospho-FPR1, and FPR2 content was confirmed by peptide mass spectrometry. C-terminal FPR1 peptides (Leu(312)-Arg(322) and Arg(323)-Lys(350)) and extracellular FPR1 peptide (Ile(191)-Arg(201)) as well as three similarly placed FPR2 peptides were identified in unstimulated and fMLF + cytochalasin B-stimulated samples. LC/MS/MS identified seven isoforms of Ala(323)-Lys(350) only in the fMLF + cytochalasin B-stimulated sample. These were individually phosphorylated at (325), Ser(328), (329), (331), Ser(332), (334), and (339). No phospho-FPR2 peptides were detected. Cytochalasin B treatment of neutrophils decreased the sensitivity of fMLF-dependent NFPRb recognition 2-fold, from EC50 = 33 ± 8 to 74 ± 21 nM. Our results suggest that 1) partial immunopurification, deglycosylation, and SDS-PAGE separation of FPRs is sufficient to identify C-terminal FPR1 Ser/ phosphorylations by LC/MS/MS; 2) kinases/phosphatases activated in fMLF/cytochalasin B-stimulated neutrophils produce multiple C-terminal tail FPR1 Ser/ phosphorylations but have little effect on corresponding FPR2 sites; and 3) the extent of FPR1 phosphorylation can be monitored with C-terminal tail FPR1-phosphospecific antibodies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17997230>Essential role of mu opioid receptor in the regulation of delta opioid receptor-mediated antihyperalgesia.</a></h1><p>Analgesic effects of delta opioid receptor (DOR) -selective agonists are enhanced during persistent  and arthritis. Although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown, membrane density of DOR was shown to be increased 72 h after induction of , an effect abolished in mu opioid receptor (MOR) -knockout (KO) mice [Morinville A, Cahill CM, Kieffer B, Collier B, Beaudet A (2004b) Mu-opioid receptor knockout prevents changes in delta-opioid receptor trafficking induced by chronic inflammatory pain. Pain 109:266-273]. In this study, we demonstrated a crucial role of MOR in DOR-mediated antihyperalgesia. Intrathecal administration of the DOR selective agonist deltorphin II failed to induce antihyperalgesic effects in MOR-KO mice, whereas it dose-dependently reversed thermal hyperalgesia in wild-type mice. The antihyperalgesic effects of deltorphin II were blocked by naltrindole but not d--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2) (CTOP) suggesting that this agonist was mainly acting through DOR. SNC80-induced antihyperalgesic effects in MOR-KO mice were also attenuated as compared with littermate controls. In contrast, kappa opioid receptor knockout did not affect deltorphin II-induced antihyperalgesia. As evaluated using mice lacking endogenous opioid peptides, the regulation of DOR's effects was also independent of beta-endorphin, enkephalins, or dynorphin opioids known to be released during persistent . We therefore conclude that DOR-mediated antihyperalgesia is dependent on MOR expression but that activation of MOR by endogenous opioids is probably not required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641985>Cy5.5-c(Lys-Ala-His-Trp-Gly---Leu-Asp)NH.</a></h1><p>Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used to monitor biological functions of specific targets in small animals (1-3). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also have high sensitivity, attributable to low background fluorescence, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals. Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (4). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in  and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (5). Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (6). Several families of proteases are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (7-10). The gelatinase family is a subgroup of MMPs consisting of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) (11). Gelatinase expression in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages, is highly regulated. Elevated levels of gelatinases have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (12). A cyclic peptide, c(CTTHWGFTLC)NH (C1), was identified by phage screening to be potent inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (13); however, C1 is readily degraded . A synthetic peptide, c(KAHWGFTLD)NH (C6), was linked with a Cy5.5 NIR dye molecule  the α-NH of Lys to form Cy5.5-C6 for  imaging of MMP-2/-9 activity (14). Cy5.5-C6 is being developed for NIR fluorescence imaging of MMP-2/-9 proteolytic activity in tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727380>Purification and partial characterization of canine S100A12.</a></h1><p>Canine S100A12 (cS100A12) is a calcium-binding protein of the S100 superfamily of EF-hand proteins, and its expression is restricted to neutrophils and monocytes. Interaction of S100A12 with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been suggested to play a central role in . Moreover, S100A12 has been shown to represent a sensitive and specific marker for gastrointestinal  in humans. Only human, porcine, bovine, and rabbit S100A12 have been purified to date, and an immunoassay for the quantification of S100A12 is available only for humans. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a protocol for the purification of S100A12 and to partially characterize this protein in the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) as a prelude to the development of an immunologic method for its detection and quantification in canine serum and fecal specimens. Leukocytes were isolated from canine whole blood by dextran sedimentation, and canine S100A12 was extracted from the cytosol fraction of these cells. Further purification of cS100A12 comprised of ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and strong cation- and anion-exchange column chromatography. Canine S100A12 was successfully purified from canine whole blood. The relative molecular mass of the protein was estimated at 10,379.5 and isoelectric focusing revealed an isoelectric point of 6.0. The approximate specific absorbance of cS100A12 at 280 nm was determined to be 1.78 for a 1 mg/ml solution. The N-terminal AA sequence of the first 15 residues of cS100A12 was -Lys-Leu-Glu-Asp-His-X-Glu-Gly-Ile-Val-Asp-Val--His, and revealed 100% identity with the predicted protein sequence available through the canine genome project. Sequence homology for the 14 N-terminal residues identified for cS100A12 with those of feline, bovine, porcine, and human S100A12 was 78.6%. We conclude that canine S100A12 can be successfully purified from canine whole blood using the described methods.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study examined the effect of non-peptidergic delta-opioid receptor agonists, (+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha-((2R,5R)-4-Allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC80) and (-)dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid salt (SNC86), on the activity of alpha-motoneurons in decerebrate-spinal rats. The flexor reflex was facilitated by C-afferent conditioning inputs, shown by a decrease in mechanical threshold and increase in touch- and pinch-evoked responses. Systemic administration of SNC80 (10 micromol/kg) prevented and reversed the neuronal hyperactivity. We further examined the effect of this agonist on the hypersensitivity of the flexor reflex induced by intraplantar injection of Freund's adjuvant. SNC80 dose-dependently (1, 3, 5 and 10 micromol/kg) increased the mechanical threshold and decreased touch-, pinch- and Abeta-afferent inputs-evoked responses. Similar effects were seen with SNC86 (5 micromol/kg). Pretreatment with either naloxone (20 micromol/kg, i.p.) or (Cyclopropylmethyl)-6,7-dehydro-4,5alpha-epoxy-14beta-ethoxy-5beta-methylindolo [2',3':6',7']morphinan-3-ol hydrochloride (SH378; 5 micromol/kg, intraarterially (i.a.)), a novel selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist, completely abolished the anti-hypersensitivity effect of SNC80. The effect of SNC80 remained following intrathecal administration of mu-opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2) (CTOP; 1.5 nmol). These results indicate that systemic injection of SNC80 exerted antihypersensitivity in models of both acute and tonic nociception and these effects are mediated mainly through a spinal delta-opioid mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11264327>Contribution of endogenous enkephalins to the enhanced analgesic effects of supraspinal mu opioid receptor agonists after inflammatory injury.</a></h1><p>This study examined a mechanism responsible for the enhanced antihyperalgesic and antinociceptive effects of the mu opioid receptor agonist (ORA) [D-Ala(2), NMePhe(4), Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) microinjected in the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) of rats with inflammatory injury induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in one hindpaw. In rats injected with CFA 4 hr earlier, microinjection of the mu opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH(2) (CTAP) in the RVM antagonized both the marginal enhancement of the potency of DAMGO and its antinociceptive effect. The delta opioid receptor antagonist naltriben (NTB) was without effect. In rats injected with CFA 2 weeks earlier, CTAP antagonized the effects of DAMGO to a lesser extent. However, NTB completely prevented the enhancement of the potency of DAMGO, whereas it did not antagonize DAMGO's antinociceptive effects. Microinjection of NTB alone, but not CTAP in the RVM of CFA-treated rats, enhanced the hyperalgesia present in the ipsilateral hindpaw and induced hyperalgesia in the contralateral, uninjured hindpaw. These results suggest that persistent inflammatory injury increased the release in the RVM of opioid peptides with preferential affinity for the delta opioid receptor, which can interact in a synergistic or additive manner with an exogenously administered mu opioid receptor agonist. Indeed, the levels of [Met(5)]enkephalin and [Leu(5)]enkephalin were increased in the RVM and in other brainstem nuclei in CFA-treated rats. This increase most likely presents a compensatory neuronal response of the CNS of the injured animal to mitigate the full expression of inflammatory pain and to enhance the antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic effects of exogenously administered mu opioid receptor analgesics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849391>Effects of rumen-protected methionine supplementation and bacterial lipopolysaccharide infusion on nitrogen metabolism and hormonal responses of growing beef steers.</a></h1><p>Metabolic demand for sulfur-containing AA increases during  in nonruminants. Therefore, Met supplementation may alleviate the negative effects of infection on N balance. Effects of gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and supplemental dietary Met on N balance, serum hormones and haptoglobin, and plasma urea-N and AA were evaluated in 20 Angus-cross steers (BW = 262 +/- 6.3 kg). Treatments (2 x 2 factorial) were infusion of no LPS (-LPS) or a prolonged low dose of LPS (+LPS) and dietary supplementation of no (-MET) or 14 g/d (+MET) of rumen-protected Met (providing 7.9 g/d of dl-Met). Steers were adapted to a roughage-based diet (DMI = 1.4% of BW daily) and supplemental Met for 14 d, and were then infused (1 mL/min via intravenous catheter) with LPS on d 1 (2 microg/kg of BW) and 3 (1 microg/kg of BW) of a 5-d collection period. Blood was collected on d 1, before LPS infusion, and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after LPS challenge. Diet samples, feed refusals, feces, and urine were collected daily for 5 d. Rectal temperature and serum concentrations of cortisol, prolactin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and haptoglobin increased, whereas thyroxine and triiodothyronine decreased for +LPS vs. -LPS steers (LPS x h; P < 0.01). Plasma urea-N was greater for +LPS than -LPS steers (LPS; P = 0.03), and serum IGF-1 was not affected (P > or = 0.26) by LPS or Met. Plasma concentrations of , Lys, Leu, Ile, , Trp, Asn, Glu, and Orn decreased, plasma Ala increased, and Gly and Ser initially increased, then declined in +LPS vs. -LPS steers (LPS x h; P < or = 0.04). Plasma Met was greater for +MET than -MET steers before LPS infusion, but declined in +MET steers after LPS infusion (LPS x Met x h; P < 0.01). By design, DMI was not different, but DM digested was less (P = 0.04) for +LPS than -LPS steers. Infusion of LPS did not affect (P > or = 0.24) N intake, fecal N excretion, or N digested, but resulted in greater (P < 0.01) urinary N excretion and less (P < 0.01) N retention. The absence of an LPS x Met interaction (P = 0.26) for N retention indicates that supplemental Met does not improve the N utilization of growing beef steers exposed to a gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. Decreases in plasma concentrations of several essential AA in +LPS steers suggest that metabolic demand for these AA likely increased in steers exposed to endotoxin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16078128>Effect of intraperitoneal application of an endotoxin inhibitor on survival time in a laparoscopic model of peritonitis in rats.</a></h1><p>Gram-negative sepsis due to fecal peritonitis is a hazardous disease with a high percentage having a lethal course. The inflammatory effects are induced by endotoxin release. We performed this study to evaluate the potential of direct intraperitoneal application of an endotoxin inhibitor in a laparoscopic peritonitis model in rats. The human feces specimen was prepared, and a standard fecal specimen (0.5 ml/kg b.w.) was applied via minilaparotomy. The rats were randomized to two studies. First, rats were randomized to three groups to define the survival time: (1) rats without further manipulation; (2) rats with laparoscopic lavage using NaCl; (3) rats with laparoscopic lavage using endotoxin inhibitor. Second, rats underwent the same procedure used in the first part of the study and an additional group with only NaCl lavage without peritonitis was randomized. To evaluate the immunologic or biochemical effects, animals were killed at a standard time of 20 hours until the postmortem examination was established. Interleukins 6 and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl group levels in plasma and particularly in peritoneal fluid were assayed. The first part of the experiment showed significantly increased survival after endotoxin inhibitor lavage. In the second part, administration of endotoxin inhibitor intraperitoneally caused a significant reduction of IL-6 in the peritoneal fluid, in contrast to that in the other groups. Laparoscopic application of endotoxin inhibitor intraperitoneally thus produced a beneficial effect on survival and reduction of IL-6 in peritoneal fluid. Hence, it is possible to influence the  cascade by causing intraperitoneal endotoxin inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14670807>Loss of vasomotor responsiveness to the mu-opioid receptor ligand endomorphin-1 in adjuvant monoarthritic rat knee joints.</a></h1><p>Endomorphin-1 is a short-chain neuropeptide with a high affinity fo the mu-opioid receptor and has recently been localized in acutely inflamed knee joints where it was found to reduce . The present study examined the propensity of endomorphin-1 to modulate synovial blood flow in normal and adjuvant-inflamed at knee joints. Under deep urethane anesthesia, endomorphin-1 was topically applied to exposed normal and 1 wk adjuvant monoarthritic knee joints (0.1 ml bolus; 10(-12)-10(-9) mol). Relative changes in articular blood flow were measured by laser Doppler perfusion imaging and vascular resistances in response to the opioid were calculated. In normal knees, endomorphin-1 caused a dose-dependent increase in synovial vascular resistance and this effect was significantly inhibited by the specific mu-opioid receptor antagonist d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-O n--Pen-Th amide (CTOP) (P < 0.0001, 2-factor ANOVA, n = 5-7). One week after adjuvant , the hypoaemic effect of endomorphin-1 was completely abolished (P < 0.0001, 2-factor ANOVA, n = 5-7). Immunohistochemical analysis of normal and adjuvant-inflamed joints showed a ninefold increase in endomorphin-1 levels in the monoarthritic knee compared with normal control. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed a moderate number of mu-opioid receptors in normal knees; however, mu-opioid receptors were almost undetectable in arthritic joints. These findings demonstrate that peripheral administration of endomorphin-1 reduces knee joint blood flow and this effect is not sustainable during advanced . The loss of this hypoaemic response appears to be due to down regulation of mu-opioid receptors as a consequence of endomorphin-1 accumulation within the arthritic joint.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10095048>Effects of opioid receptor antagonists on the effects of i.v. morphine on carrageenin evoked c-Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord.</a></h1><p>This study performed in freely moving rats evaluated the ability of specific opioid receptor antagonists to reverse the inhibitory effects of morphine on carrageenin-induced c-Fos expression in the spinal cord. Our study focused on the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I-II), which is the main termination site of nociceptive primary afferent fibers and is rich in opioid receptors. In order to replicate clinical routes of administration, all agents were administered intravenously (i.v.). As previously demonstrated, pre-administered i.v. morphine (3 mg/kg) produced a marked decrease (58+/-5%) in the number of Fos-LI neurones measured at 2 h after intraplantar (i.pl.) carrageenin (6 mg/150 microl) and yet was without influence on peripheral oedema. This decrease in c-Fos expression was completely blocked by combined administration of morphine with the mu-opioid receptor antagonist, [D--Cys-Tyr-D-Orn--Pen--NH2] (CTOP-1+1 mg/kg). Naltrindole (NTI-1+1 mg/kg), a delta-opioid receptor antagonist partially blocked the effects of systemic morphine, so that the inhibitory effects of morphine after NTI injection are now 40+/-4%. However, this effect of NTI was weak since the depressive effects of morphine were still highly significant (p<0.001). In contrast, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI-1+1 mg/kg), a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, had no significant effect on the effects of morphine. These results indicate the major contribution of mu-opioid receptors to the antinociceptive effects of systemic morphine at the level of the superficial dorsal horn. The observed effect of NTI is not necessarily related to a direct action of morphine on delta-opioid receptors and some possible actions of this antagonist are discussed.Copyright 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15312782>Involvement of opioid receptors in electroacupuncture-produced anti-hyperalgesia in rats with peripheral .</a></h1><p>Our previous study showed that electroacupuncture (EA) significantly attenuated inflammatory hyperalgesia. It has also been reported that EA analgesia in uninjured animals is mediated by mu and delta opioid receptors at 2-15 Hz and by kappa opioid receptor at 100 Hz. Because persistent pain changes neural response to external stimulation, we hypothesized that (1) the mechanisms of EA anti-hyperalgesia may be different under conditions of persistent pain and that (2) combining EA with a sub-effective dose of morphine could enhance EA anti-hyperalgesia. Hyperalgesia, decreased paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus, was induced by subcutaneously injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paws of rats. Selective antagonists against mu (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen-ThrNH2, CTOP), delta (naltrinodole, NTI) and kappa (nor-binaltorphimine, BNI) opioid receptors were administered intrathecally 10 min before each of two EA treatments at acupoint Huantiao (GB30), one immediately post and the other 2 h post-CFA. Morphine was given (i.p.) 40 min before the second EA treatment. PWL was measured before and 2.5 and 5 h post-CFA. Both 10 and 100 Hz EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia were blocked spinally by mu- and delta- but not kappa-receptor antagonists. EA combined with a sub-threshold dose of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) enhanced anti-hyperalgesia additively (10 Hz EA) or synergistically (100 Hz EA) compared to that produced by each component alone. These results suggest selective involvement of mu and delta, but not kappa, receptors in EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia in rats. A combined EA and opioid drug protocol may provide an improved treatment strategy for inflammatory pain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12122501>Pharmacological characterisation of the somatostatin analogue TT-232: effects on neurogenic and non-neurogenic  and neuropathic hyperalgesia.</a></h1><p>The putative anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity of the heptapeptide somatostatin analogue TT-232 ( D--Cys-Tyr- D--Lys-Cys--NH(2)) was investigated in the rat and mouse, as well as its effect on neuropathic hyperalgesia, gastric ulceration and the release of sensory neuropeptides. In the rat, carrageenin-induced paw oedema was inhibited dose dependently by TT-232 (3x2.5-20 microg/kg i.v.). Evans blue accumulation induced by intraarticular bradykinin injection (0.5 nmol in 0.1 ml) was slightly, but significantly inhibited by a single TT-232 dose (5-20 microg/kg). Cutaneous neutrophil accumulation over a 3-h period after intradermal (i.d.) injection of carrageenin (1 mg/site) or interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta, 3 pmol/site) was inhibited significantly by TT-232 (3x80 microg/kg i.v.), while diclofenac (3x10 mg/kg i.v.) elicited significant inhibition only in the IL-1beta test. In the mouse, TT-232 potently decreased oedema formation induced by 2.5% capsaicin applied topically to the ear. Mechano-nociception in the rat hind-paw during neuropathic pain induced by partial sciatic nerve injury (model of Seltzer) was measured using the Randall-Selitto test. TT-232 (5-20 microg/kg i.p. on the 7th day after the operation) dose-dependently inhibited the mechano-nociceptive hyperalgesia. In vitro release of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and somatostatin from the isolated rat trachea in response to electrical field stimulation (40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s) of its nervous elements was inhibited significantly by 500 nM TT-232. The role of G protein-coupled receptors in the effect of TT-232 was indicated by the prevention of its inhibitory action on the release of sensory neuropeptides by incubation the tissue for 1 or 6 h with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml). The release of sensory neuropeptides to in response to electrical nerve stimulation was not inhibited by a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (50 microM). TT-232 (up to 5 mg/kg i.p.) did not induce mucosal lesions in either the stomach or the duodenum. These data suggest that TT-232, a somatostatin analogue devoid of endocrine effects, is a promising lead molecule in the search for novel, broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23139417>The phosphocholine-binding pocket on C-reactive protein is necessary for initial protection of mice against pneumococcal infection.</a></h1><p>Human C-reactive protein (CRP) protects mice from lethal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection when injected into mice within the range of 6 h before to 2 h after the administration of pneumococci. Because CRP binds to phosphocholine-containing substances and subsequently activates the complement system, it has been proposed that the antipneumococcal function of CRP requires the binding of CRP to phosphocholine moieties present in pneumococcal cell wall C-polysaccharide. To test this proposal experimentally, in this study, we utilized a new CRP mutant incapable of binding to phosphocholine. Based on the structure of CRP-phosphocholine complexes, which showed that (66), (76), and Glu(81) formed the phosphocholine-binding pocket, we constructed a CRP mutant F66A/T76Y/E81A in which the pocket was blocked by substituting Tyr for (76). When compared with wild-type CRP, mutant CRP bound more avidly to phosphoethanolamine and could be purified by affinity chromatography using phosphoethanolamine-conjugated Sepharose. Mutant CRP did not bind to phosphocholine, C-polysaccharide, or pneumococci. Mutant CRP was free in the mouse serum, and its rate of clearance in vivo was not faster than that of wild-type CRP. When either 25 μg or 150 μg of CRP was administered into mice, unlike wild-type CRP, mutant CRP did not protect mice from lethal pneumococcal infection. Mice injected with mutant CRP had higher mortality rates than mice that received wild-type CRP. Decreased survival was due to the increased bacteremia in mice treated with mutant CRP. We conclude that the phosphocholine-binding pocket on CRP is necessary for CRP-mediated initial protection of mice against lethal pneumococcal infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23547469>[Peptide fragments of chemokine domain of fractalkine: effect on human monocyte migration].</a></h1><p>Leukocyte chemotaxis to the area of tissue damage is mediated by chemokines. According to the primary structure, chemokines are divided into four families, fractalkine (CX3CL1) is the only one member of CX3C family and the only membrane-bound chemokine. Fractalkine molecule includes the extracellular N-terminal chemokine domain, mucin-like rod, the transmembrane and the intracellular domains. In membrane-bound state fractalkine has the properties of an adhesion molecule. Chemokine domain of fractalkine (CDF) is released from cell membrane by proteolysis, and this soluble form acts as a chemoattractant for leukocytes expressing fractalkine receptor CX3CR1. Fractalkine is involved in development of a number of pathological processes caused by , and therefore a search for fractalkine inhibitors is very important. For this purpose we identified several antigenic determinants--the fragments of CDF, and the following peptides were synthesized--P41-52 H-Leu-Glu--Arg-Gln-His-Arg-Leu--Cys-Ala-Asp-NH2, P53-60 H-Pro-Lys-Glu-Gln-Trp-Val-Lys-Asp-NH2 and P60-71 H-Asp-Ala-Met-Gln-His-Leu-Asp-Arg-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-NH2. The peptide effects on adhesion and migration of human peripheral blood monocytes expressing fractalkine receptors were investigated. In the presence of CDF and P41-52 we observed the increased adhesion and migration of monocytes compared with spontaneous values. Peptides P53-60 and P60-71 significantly inhibited monocyte adhesion and migration stimulated by CDF. Since the chemotactic activity of chemokines was shown to be dependent on their binding to glycosaminoglycans of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, the effect ofpeptides on the interaction of CDF with heparin was analyzed by ELISA. Peptide P41-52 competed with CDF for heparin binding, while peptides P53-60 and P60-71 had no significant activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1985958>Leukocyte chemoattractant peptides from the serpin heparin cofactor II.</a></h1><p>Heparin cofactor II (HC) is a plasma serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that inhibits the coagulant proteinase alpha-thrombin. We have recently demonstrated that proteolysis of HC by catalytic amounts of polymorphonuclear leukocyte proteinases (elastase or cathepsin G) generates leukocyte chemotaxins (Hoffman, M., Pratt, C. W., Brown, R. L., and Church, F. C. (1989) Blood 73, 1682-1685). One of four peptides produced when HC is degraded by neutrophil elastase has chemotactic activity for both monocytes and neutrophils with maximal migration comparable to formyl-Met-Leu-, the "gold standard" bacterially derived chemotaxin. The amino-terminal sequence of this HC peptide is Asp--His-Lys-Glu-Asn--Val-... and the peptide corresponds to Asp-39 to Ile-66 of HC. A variety of synthetic peptides derived from this sequence were evaluated for leukocyte migration activity, and a dodecapeptide from Asp-49 to Tyr-60 (Asp-Trp-Ile-Pro-Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr) was identified as the active site for leukocyte chemotactic action. The 12-mer synthetic peptide possesses significant neutrophil chemotactic action at 1 nM (60% of the maximal activity of formyl-Met-Leu-), while a peptide with the reverse sequence has essentially no chemotactic activity. Cross-desensitization experiments also show that pretreatment of neutrophils with a 19-mer peptide (Asn-48 to Ile-66) greatly reduces subsequent chemotaxis to HC-neutrophil elastase proteolysis reaction products. When injected intraperitoneally in mice, the HC-neutrophil elastase digest elicits neutrophil migration. Our results demonstrate that not only does HC function as a thrombin inhibitor, but that limited proteolysis of HC near the amino terminus yields biologically active peptide(s) which might participate in  and in wound healing and tissue repair processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8281987>Peripheral mechanisms of opioid antinociception in : involvement of cytokines.</a></h1><p>It has been shown previously that opioids induce antinociceptive effects at peripheral sites in the presence of inflammatory processes. Besides being elicited by local injection of opioids, such effects can also be obtained by activation of intrinsic opioid mechanisms, e.g. following stress. In the present study the possible role of cytokines in this mechanism was investigated. Unilateral  of the hindpaw of rats was induced by local injection of Freund's complete adjuvant. Intraplantar injection of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or interleukin-6 induced a dose-dependent increase in the threshold in the paw pressure test in the inflamed but not in the non-inflamed paw. This increase was prevented by local injection of naloxone and the mu-opioid receptor specific antagonist CTOP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2) as well as by 3-E7, an universal opioid peptide antibody. In rats pretreated with cyclosporin A to suppress the immune system, the antinociceptive effect of TNF alpha was completely inhibited. In concert with previous studies these data indicate that the tested cytokines release opioid peptides (e.g. beta-endorphin and/or enkephalins) from immune cells of the inflamed tissue which act on opioid receptors present on sensory nerve terminals, resulting in antinociception.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20106595>Nociceptive behaviour upon modulation of mu-opioid receptors in the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus of rats.</a></h1><p>The role of mu-opioid receptors (MORs) in the inflammatory pain processing mechanisms within the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus (VB) is not well understood. This study investigated the effect of modulating MOR activity upon nociception, by stereotaxically injecting specific ligands in the VB. Nociceptive behaviour was evaluated in two established animal models of inflammatory pain, by using the formalin (acute and tonic pain) and the ankle-bend (chronic monoarthritic pain) tests. Control (saline intra-VB injection) formalin-injected rats showed acute and tonic pain-related behaviours. In contrast, intrathalamic administration of [D-Ala(2), N-Me-(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin acetate (DAMGO), a MOR-specific agonist, induced a statistically significant decrease of all tonic phase pain-related behaviours assessed until 30-35min after formalin hind paw injection. In the acute phase only the number of paw-jerks was affected. In monoarthritic rats, there was a noticeable antinociceptive effect with approximately 40min of duration, as denoted by the reduced ankle-bend scores observed after DAMGO injection. Intra-VB injection of D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2) (CTOP), a specific MOR antagonist, or of CTOP followed, 10min after, by DAMGO had no effects in either formalin or ankle-bend tests. Data show that DAMGO-induced MOR activation in the VB has an antinociceptive effect in the formalin test as well as in chronic pain observed in MA rats, suggesting an important and specific role for MORs in the VB processing of inflammatory pain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16624955>Peripheral antinociceptive effects of exogenous and immune cell-derived endomorphins in prolonged inflammatory pain.</a></h1><p>Endomorphins (EMs) are endogenous selective mu-opioid receptor agonists. Their role in inflammatory pain has not been fully elucidated. Here we examine peripheral antinociception elicited by exogenously applied EM-1 and EM-2 and the contribution of EM-containing leukocytes to stress- and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-induced antinociception. To this end, we applied behavioral (paw pressure) testing, radioligand binding, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry in rats with unilateral hindpaw  induced with Freund's adjuvant. EMs injected directly into both hindpaws produced antinociception exclusively in inflamed paws. This was blocked by locally applied mu-receptor-selective (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2) but not kappa-receptor-selective (nor-binaltorphimine) antagonists. Delta-receptor antagonists (naltrindole and N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib--Leu) did not influence EM-1-induced but dose-dependently decreased EM-2-induced antinociception. Antibodies against beta-endorphin, methionine-enkephalin, or leucine-enkephalin did not significantly change EM-2-induced antinociception. Both EMs displaced binding of [3H]-[D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin to mu-receptors in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using [3H]-naltrindole or [(125)I]-[D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin, no detectable delta-binding was found in DRG of inflamed hindlimbs. Numerous beta-endorphin-containing and fewer EM-1- and EM-2-containing leukocytes were detected in subcutaneous tissue of inflamed paws. Leukocyte-depleting serum decreased the number of immigrating opioid-containing immune cells and attenuated swim stress- and CRF-induced antinociception in inflamed paws. Both forms of antinociception were strongly attenuated by anti-beta-endorphin and to a lesser degree by anti-EM-1 and anti-EM-2 antibodies injected into inflamed paws. Together, exogenously applied and immune cell-derived EMs alleviate prolonged inflammatory pain through selective activation of peripheral opioid receptors. Exogenous EM-2 in addition to mu-receptors also activates peripheral delta-receptors, which does not involve actions via other opioid peptides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16200625>Chronic arthritis down-regulates peripheral mu-opioid receptor expression with concomitant loss of endomorphin 1 antinociception.</a></h1><p>To determine whether peripheral administration of the endogenous mu-opioid peptide endomorphin 1 could reduce knee joint pain, using animal models of acute and chronic arthritis.Extracellular electrophysiologic recordings were made of rat knee joint primary afferent nerve activity in response to noxious hyperrotation of the joint. Neuronal activity was assessed before and following local injection of endomorphin 1. Comparisons were made between normal knees and knees with adjuvant-induced monarthritis, tested at 48 hours and 1 week posttreatment. Expression of mu-opioid receptors in the dorsal root ganglia ipsilateral to the chronically inflamed joints was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis.In normal knees, endomorphin 1 caused up to a 75% reduction in joint afferent nerve activity, which was blocked by the mu-opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--amide. The inhibitory effect of endomorphin 1 was sustained in acutely inflamed knees. Conversely, in chronically inflamed joints, endomorphin 1 had no observable effect on the primary afferent nerve firing rate elicited by a noxious mechanical stimulus and, as such, was significantly different from the rate in normal joints. Immunohistochemical and real-time PCR analysis of the L3-L5 dorsal root ganglia ipsilateral to the chronic arthritis lesion revealed a reduction in mu-opioid receptor protein and gene expression compared with that in normal control animals.Taken together, these results provide the first electrophysiologic evidence that selective activation of peripheral mu-opioid receptors reduces normal knee joint mechanosensitivity to a noxious stimulus. Furthermore, the analgesic effect of endomorphin 1 is lost during chronic  due to down-regulation of mu-opioid receptor expression in afferent nerve cell bodies. These findings begin to explain the ambiguous efficacy of peripherally administered mu-opioid drugs in controlling chronic inflammatory joint pain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17379421>Role of peripheral mu-opioid receptors in inflammatory orofacial muscle pain.</a></h1><p>The aims of this project were to investigate whether  in the orofacial muscle alters mu opioid receptor (MOR) mRNA and protein expressions in trigeminal ganglia (TG), and to assess the contribution of peripheral MORs under acute and inflammatory muscle pain conditions. mRNA and protein levels for MOR were quantified by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively, from the TG of naïve rats, and compared with those from the rats treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the masseter. TG was found to express mRNA and protein for MOR, and CFA significantly up-regulated both MOR mRNA and protein by 3 days following the . The MOR protein up-regulation persisted to day 7 and returned to the baseline level by day 14. We then investigated whether peripheral application of a MOR agonist, D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol-enkephalin acetate salt (DAMGO), attenuates masseter nociception induced by masseteric infusion of hypertonic saline (HS) in lightly anesthetized rats. DAMGO (1, 5, 10 microg) or vehicle was administered directly into the masseter 5-10 min prior to the HS infusion. The DAMGO effects were assessed on mean peak counts (MPC) and overall magnitude as calculated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the HS-evoked behavioral responses. Under this condition, only the highest dose of DAMGO (10 microg) significantly reduced MPC, which was prevented when H-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP), a selective MOR antagonist, was co-administered. DAMGO pre-treatment in the contralateral masseter did not attenuate MPC. The same doses of DAMGO administered into CFA-inflamed rats, however, produced a greater attenuation of both MPC and AUC of HS-evoked nocifensive responses. These results demonstrated that activation of peripheral MOR provides greater anti-nociception in inflamed muscle, and that the enhanced MOR effect can be partly explained by significant up-regulation of MOR expression in TG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21403131>Cleavage of the CD11b extracellular domain by the leukocyte serprocidins is critical for neutrophil detachment during chemotaxis.</a></h1><p>The β(2)-integrin CD11b/CD18 mediates the firm adhesion of neutrophils (PMNs) to epithelial monolayers, a key step in PMN transepithelial migration. To complete the transmigration process, adherent PMNs must detach from epithelial monolayer surfaces to move forward. The mechanism that governs the detachment of adherent PMNs, however, is not clear. Here, we present evidence that cleavage of the CD11b extracellular domain containing the ligand-binding I-domain by 3 structural and functional related serine proteases (elastase, proteinase-3 and cathepsin G) serves as a novel mechanism for PMN detachment after the initial cell adhesion. Kinetic studies showed that the cleavage of CD11b is positively correlated with PMN detachment and subsequent transmigration. Moreover, the results demonstrated that elastase, proteinase-3 and cathepsin G all cleaved the purified, functionally active form of CD11b in a pattern similar to the CD11b shedding that occurs during PMN transmigration. Their cleavage sites on purified CD11b were located at (761)-Ala(762) (elastase/proteinase-3) and (760)-(761) (cathepsin G), respectively. CD11b cleavage and PMN detachment and chemotaxis, were impaired in elastase/cathepsin G-deficient Beige mice; this defect could be restored by the addition of extracellular elastase. By illustrating CD11b shedding by elastase, proteinase-3 and cathepsin G as a novel mechanism for PMN detachment, our study provides novel therapeutic targets for controlling .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19342687>Mitocryptide-2: purification, identification, and characterization of a novel cryptide that activates neutrophils.</a></h1><p>Neutrophils are a class of leukocytes involved in innate immunity by monitoring and scavenging invading microorganisms and toxic substances. The actions of neutrophils in damaged tissues are still not well understood, particularly in the early stage of , and as-yet-unknown neutrophil-activating substances are proposed to induce their acute transmigration and activation. Here, we isolated and identified from porcine hearts a neutrophil-activating peptide. Structural analyses indicated that the primary structure of this peptide is formyl-Met--Asn-Ile-Arg-Lys-Ser-His-Pro-Leu-Met-Lys-Ile-Ile-Asn, which is identical to that of the N-terminal pentadecapeptide of porcine mitochondrial cytochrome b; we therefore named the newly isolated peptide "mitocryptide-2" (MCT-2), since we have recently purified and identified mitocryptide-1, a different class of a neutrophil-activating peptide. Synthetic MCT-2 and its human homolog hMCT-2 induced beta-hexosaminidase release in and chemotaxis of HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophilic/granulocytic cells. The induction of beta-hexosaminidase release, chemotaxis, and the increase in the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration by hMCT-2 were completely suppressed by pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of G(i)- or G(o)-type G proteins in the signaling pathways. Moreover, MCT-2 and hMCT-2 also stimulated beta-hexosaminidase secretion in human neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, these peptides partially competed with [(3)H]formyl-Met-Leu- binding to HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophilic/granulocytic cells, presenting the possibility that the receptor for MCT-2 and hMCT-2 is one of the formyl peptide receptors. These results demonstrate that MCT-2 and its human homolog hMCT-2 are cryptides that activate neutrophils, thus suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanisms involving such mitocryptides in innate immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2745979>Human eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor.

This resulted in the isolation of a 10 kDa polypeptide with ECEF activity. Purified material from 21 different preparations enhanced eosinophil killing of antibody-coated Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula by a mean of 206% (increase from 13.2 +/- 7.9% to 40.4 +/- 20.2% of targets killed, p less than 0.0001). Activity was maximal at a concentration of 20 ng ECEF polypeptide/ml and half-maximal between 0.8 and 4 ng/ml. Antibody specific for the 10 kDa polypeptide precipitated ECEF activity from a crude preparation and, by Western blot analysis, reacted only with a 10 kDa species in that preparation. The following N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for the purified polypeptide: Val-Lys-Gln-Ile-Glu-Ser-Lys--Ala--Gln-Lys-Ala-Leu- -Ala- Gly- -Lys-Leu.... Computer search showed that this sequence is unrelated to other known protein sequences. Thus, the ECEF polypeptide is a newly defined monokine, with the ability to enhance eosinophil cytotoxic function in vitro.

The plasma concentrations of free amino acid, ALT, AST, cortisol, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were determined. The rats were randomly divided into normal control, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h groups after administration of endotoxin(8 rats for each group).The total plasma free amino acids concentrations fluctuate within normal range within 24 h after administration of endotoxin. A marked decrease in BCAA (branch-chainamino acid) was observed at 2, 6 and 12 h after administration of endotoxin, but aromatic amino acids (AAA) increased in varying degrees. BCAA/AAA was lower at 2 h and 6 h as compared with that of the normal control, while /Tyr increased obviously at every time point. Lys, Sar, Cys and P-Ser showed no significant changes within 24 h after the administration of endotoxin. , Glu, Orn, His, 3-MH and Ala increased during sepsis, and other amino acids more or less decreased. Plasma concentrations of ALT, AST, cortisol, TNF-alpha and IL-6 obviously increased within 24 h after the administration of endotoxin(P < 0.01). Cortisol peaked at 6 h and IL-6 peaked at 12 h, while TNF-alpha at 2 h.The results suggested that metabolic disorder of plasma free amino acids during sepsis is due to enhancement of skeletal muscle proteolysis and liver overloading.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21565329>Rostral ventromedial medulla μ, but not κ, opioid receptors are involved in electroacupuncture anti-hyperalgesia in an inflammatory pain rat model.</a></h1><p>It has been reported that intracerebroventricular injection of a μ receptor antagonist blocked 2 but not 100Hz electroacupuncture (EA)-produced analgesia in an uninjured animal model. Because persistent pain changes neural response to external stimulation, we hypothesized that the mechanisms of EA anti-hyperalgesia may be different in persistent pain than in health. Hyperalgesia, decreased paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus, was induced by subcutaneously injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paws of rats. Selective antagonists against μ (CTOP: D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen-ThrNH2, 6.25 nmol) and κ (Nor-BIN: nor-binaltorphimine, 10 nmol) opioid receptors were infused into the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) 10 min before a 30-min EA treatment at acupoint Huantiao (GB30) 1h 30 min post-CFA. PWL was measured before and 2.5 post-CFA. Both 10 Hz and 100 Hz EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia were blocked by intra-RVM μ, but not κ, receptor antagonists. Double immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that μ receptor-containing neurons were GABAnergic and that GABAa receptor-containing neurons were serotonergic in the RVM. The results demonstrated an involvement of RVM μ, but not κ, receptors in EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia. In summary, EA may induce release of endogenous endomorphins that activate μ opioid receptors in GABAnergic neurons to suppress the release of GABA. This removes the tonic inhibition of GABA on serotonergic neurons in the RVM, and activation of these serotonergic neurons inhibits pain. EA may be used as complementary treatment for inflammatory pain.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether endogenous peripheral opioid receptors participated in EAA during hyperalgesia elicited by carrageenan-induced . Moreover, we investigated which subtype of opioid receptor was involved in EAA. Carrageenan was subcutaneously administered by intraplanter (i.pl.) injection into the left hind paw. Nociceptive thresholds were measured using the paw pressure threshold (PPT). Rats received 3Hz electroacupuncture (EA) for 1h after carrageenan injection. The nonselective peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone methiodide, was administered by i.pl. injection of the inflamed paw 5min before EA. Also, animals received i.pl. or intravenous (i.v.) injection of selective antagonists against μ(D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen-ThrNH2, CTOP), δ(naltrindole, NTI), or κ (nor-Binaltorphimine, nor-BNI) opioid receptors 1h before EA. PPT decreased significantly 3h after carrageenan injection. EA resulted in significant increases of PPT, moreover, PPT elevations persisted for 9h after carrageenan injection. PPT elevations produced by EA were antagonized by local i.pl. injection of naloxone methiodide at 3 and 5h after cessation of EA. NTI, nor-BNI and CTOP blocked EAA from immediately, 1h, and 3h after EA cessation, respectively. The EAA in the inflamed paw could not be blocked by i.v. injection of NTI, nor-BNI and CTOP.

Recently we determined that both fibrinogen (Fg) and cross-linked fibrin (XL-Fb) are substrates for selected MMPs. Specifically, XL-Fb clots were solubilized by MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) by cleavage at gamma Gly 404-Ala 405, resulting in a D-like monomer fragment. Similarly, MMP-7 (matrilysin) and MT1-MMP (membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase) solubilized XL-Fb clots. However, the molecular mass of fragment D-dimer, obtained after MMP-7 and MT1-MMP degradation of XL-Fb, is similar to that of fragment D-dimer from plasmin degradation ( approximately 186 kDa). In contrast, fragment D-like monomer, from MMP-3 degradation of both fibrinogen (Fg) and XL-Fb, is similar to fragment D from plasmin degradation of Fg ( approximately 94 kDa). Reduced chains from MMP-3, MMP-7, and MT1-MMP digests of Fg and XL-Fb were subjected to direct sequence analyses and D/D-dimer alpha-chain showed cleavage at both alpha Asp 97- 98 and alpha Asn 102-Asn 103. Degradation of the beta-chain resulted in microheterogeneity of cleavage sites at beta Asp 123-Leu 124, beta Asn 137-Val 138, and beta Glu 141-Tyr 142, whereas all three enzymes cleaved the gamma-chain at gamma  83-Leu 84. In both Fg and XL-Fb, several cleavage sites obtained by proteolysis with MMP-3, MMP-7, and MT1-MMP were found to be in very close proximity to those obtained by plasmin on these same substrates. That does not occur with other MMPs such as MMP-1, -2, and -9 and MT2-MMP.

NKG2A (KLRC1) NKG2C (KLRC2), and NKG2D (KLRK1, D12S249E) genes were genotyped in 210 unrelated patients with RA and 298 controls using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. We further investigated the relationships between the genotypes of each single nucleotide polymorphism and the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and bony erosions in RA patients. The major NKG2A c.338-90*A/*A, NKG2C102*Ser/*Ser, and NKG2D72*Ala/*Ala genotypes in RA were significantly associated compared with controls [P = 0.013, odds ratio (OR) = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44-0.91; P < 0.0001, OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.44-2.96; and P = 0.019, OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.45-0.93, respectively]. The minor NKG2A c.338-90*G/*G, NKG2C102*/*, and NKG2D72*/* genotypes showed a risk of RA (P = 0.010, OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.17-3.54; P < 0.0001, OR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.12-0.48; and P = 0.032, OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.05-5.01, respectively) compared with controls. No significance was observed between the inhibitory (NKG2A) or activating (NKG2C and NKG2D) receptor genotypes and the presence of RF, ANA, or bony erosions in RA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1964910>Peripheral kappa-opioid modulation of the formalin response: an electrophysiological study in the rat.</a></h1><p>The activity of single dorsal horn nociceptive neurones was recorded in the spinal cord of halothane anaesthetized rats. S.c. injection of a 5% formalin solution into the receptive field of these neurones resulted in two peaks of neuronal firing over a period of 60 min. Prior administration of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U50488H directly into the site of formalin injection caused a dose-dependent decrease in the size of both the first and second peaks of the response which was naloxone reversible. Injection of U50488H into the contralateral paw had no effect on either peak of the formalin response. Injection of the top dose (100 micrograms) of U50488H had no effect on the electrically evoked A beta- or C-fibre responses of the neurone. Neither morphine nor Tyr-D-Ser(Otbu)-Gly--Leu- (DSTBULET), administered into the receptive field, had any significant effect on either peak of the formalin response. Plasma extravasation in the skin, measured using Evans blue, produced by the formalin injection was not blocked by U50488H. Thus, whilst the spinal responses of this peripheral model of  can be inhibited by peripheral kappa-opioid activation, but not mu- or delta-, plasma extravasation associated with this  is not reduced.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11903921>The tripeptide feG reduces endotoxin-provoked perturbation of intestinal motility and .</a></h1><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal endotoxaemia perturbs motility and causes activation and influx of inflammatory cells into the muscle tissue. Because rat submandibular gland peptide T (SGP-T; -Asp-Ile--Glu-Gly-Gly), its carboxyl-terminal fragment tripeptide, FEG (-Glu-Gly) and its D-isomeric analogue, feG, modulate intestinal anaphylactic reactions, we examined whether these peptides also modulate LPS-induced intestinal endotoxaemia in conscious rats. The disruption of the fasting pattern of intestinal MMCs (migrating motor complexes), induced by intravenous LPS (20 microg kg-1) injection, was prevented by all three peptides. The extravasation of leucocytes into the peritoneal cavity and increased expression of the activation marker CD18 on mesenteric tissue leucocytes (18 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS) were reduced by orally administered feG, which also significantly decreased the number of intestinal tissue leucocytes expressing the integrin CD18. We conclude that feG attenuates both the immediate (intestinal motility) and late ( approximately 18 h) inflammatory reactions provoked by endotoxaemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265713>Persistent inflammatory pain decreases the antinociceptive effects of the mu opioid receptor agonist DAMGO in the locus coeruleus of male rats.</a></h1><p>Persistent inflammatory nociception increases levels of endogenous opioids with affinity for delta opioid receptors in the ventromedial medulla and enhances the antinociceptive effects of the mu opioid receptor (MOPr) agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) [Hurley, R.W., Hammond, D.L., 2001. Contribution of endogenous enkephalins to the enhanced analgesic effects of supraspinal mu opioid receptor agonists after inflammatory injury. J. Neurosci. 21, 2536-2545]. It also increases levels of endogenous opioids that act at MOPr elsewhere in the CNS [Zangen, A., Herzberg, U., Vogel, Z., Yadid, G., 1998. Nociceptive stimulus induces release of endogenous beta-endorphin in the rat brain. Neuroscience 85, 659-662]. This study tested the hypothesis that a sustained release of endogenous opioids leads to a downregulation of MOPr in the locus coeruleus (LC) and induces a state of endogenous opioid tolerance. Four days after injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the left hindpaw of the rat, both the magnitude and duration of the antinociception produced by microinjection of DAMGO in the right LC were reduced. Saturation isotherms demonstrated a 50% decrease in MOPr B(max) in homogenates of the LC from CFA-treated rats; K(d) was unchanged. Receptor autoradiography revealed that this decrease was bilateral. The decreased efficacy of DAMGO in CFA-treated rats most likely results from a decreased number of MOPr in the LC. Microinjection of the MOPr antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP) in the LC did not exacerbate hyperalgesia in the ipsilateral hindpaw or produce hyperalgesia in the contralateral hindpaw of CFA-treated rats. The downregulation in MOPr is therefore unlikely to result from the induction of endogenous opioid tolerance in the LC. These results indicate that persistent inflammatory nociception alters the antinociceptive actions of MOPr agonists in the CNS by diverse mechanisms that are nucleus specific and likely to have different physiological implications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2539460>Peripheral opioid receptors mediating antinociception in . Evidence for involvement of mu, delta and kappa receptors.</a></h1><p>This study examined a possible peripheral site of action of opioids in the modulation of the response to noxious pressure on inflamed tissue. Rats developed a unilateral localized  upon injection of Freund's complete adjuvant into one hindpaw. 4-6 days after inoculation, intraplantar administration of mu, delta and kappa selective agonists [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly-ol5]-en-kephalin (1 micrograms), [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin (40 micrograms) and U-50, 488H (50 micrograms) produced marked antinociceptive effects in inflamed but not noninflamed paws. Equivalent doses applied systemically (s.c. and i.v.) were without effect. Dose dependency and stereospecificity of these effects were demonstrated using (-)- and (+)-morphine and (-)- and (+)-tifluadom. Furthermore, by use of (-)- and (+)-naloxone, dose-dependent and stereospecific antagonism was shown. Lastly, reversal of effects of [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly-Ol5]-enkephalin, [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin and U-50,488H by mu, delta and kappa selective antagonists D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2, ICI 174,864 and nor-BNI, respectively, indicated that these agents interact with discriminable populations of receptors. These observations suggest that several selective opioid agonists can modulate responses to noxious pressure through a peripheral opioid receptor-specific site of action in  and that these receptors possess distinguishable pharmacological characteristics resembling those of mu, delta and kappa receptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h1><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, Lys, Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, Lys, , Ser, Tau,  and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and Tyr) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147416>Decreased pain responses of C-C chemokine receptor 5 knockout mice to chemical or inflammatory stimuli.</a></h1><p>Chemokines are small chemotactic cytokines that elicit many physiological and pathological effects through binding to their corresponding receptors. Recent studies have suggested that C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 5 interacts with μ-opioid receptor and modifies a nociceptive reaction. We examined effects of CCR5 deficiency on pain responses by employing CCR5 knockout (KO) mice. We found that pain responses of CCR5 KO mice to chemical or  stimuli were milder than those of CCR5 wild type (WT) mice. However, there was no remarkable change in thermal nociception. To prove the involvement of CCR5 deletion in lowered nociception, we examined pain reactions with CCR5 WT mice following treatment of a CCR5 antagonist (D-Ala(1)-peptide T-NH(2,) DAPTA). Chemical or inflammatory pain behavior was significantly relieved by intracerebroventricular infusion of the inhibitor. When we assessed expression level of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the periaqueductal gray where the receptors are critical for analgesic effects, immunoreactivity of MOR was significantly higher in CCR5 KO mice than WT mice without change in phosphorylation level of the receptor. Reduced nociceptive responses in CCR5 KO mice were moderated by administration of naloxone and d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP), MOR antagonists. Our data indicate that CCR5 deficiency is related to up-regulation of MOR without an increase in the receptor desensitization which might result in increased analgesic effects against chemical or inflammatory stimuli. Alternatively, higher amount of opioid ligands in CCR5 mice might be linked to these results. Therefore, CCR5 appears to be a therapeutic target for treatment of pain related diseases such as inflammatory hyperalgesia.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our most potent conjugates, [fMLF]PMBN and [fMLF]PMEN, are nonapeptides derived from polymyxin B's (PMB's) cyclic moiety (-Dab-cyclo[Dab-Dab-d--Leu-Dab-Dab-], where Dab is 2,4-diaminobutyric acid) and polymyxin E's (PME's) cyclic moiety (-Dab-cyclo[Dab-Dab-d-Leu-Leu-Dab-Dab-]), respectively, attached to a linear tail comprised of formyl-Met-Leu- (fMLF). The cyclic part binds to gram-negative lipopolysaccharides, rendering the bacterial outer membrane permeable to hydrophobic antibiotics. The tail confers chemotactic and opsonic activities upon the conjugates. These two activities appear to be the basis for the conjugates' antibacterial activities. The conjugates are 8 to 10 times less toxic than the parent PMB or PME antibiotics. Fourteen of 18 mice lethally challenged with erythromycin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae survived following intraperitoneal administration of erythromycin and [fMLF]PMBN, whereas erythromycin or the peptide conjugate alone had no effect. Moreover, the clearance of Klebsiella from blood was markedly enhanced by intravenous injection of the [fMLF]PMEN peptide conjugate compared to the clearance of the organism from the mice treated with buffer alone as a control and was similar to that achieved by the PME antibiotic. Blood clearance was also significantly enhanced by administration of PMEN either alone or in a mixture with fMLF, although the effect was less than that produced by the peptide conjugate. Since resistance to polymyxins, the parent molecules of the synthetic cyclic peptides, is rare, the emergence of bacteria resistant to the antimicrobial properties of the peptide conjugates may be precluded as well.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806643>Protective role of μ opioid receptor activation in intestinal  induced by mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion in mice.</a></h1><p>Intestinal ischemia is a clinical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether activation of μ opioid receptor (μOR) protects from the  induced by intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) in mice. Ischemia was induced by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (45 min), followed by reperfusion (5 hr). Sham-operated (SO) and normal (N) mice served as controls. Each group received subcutaneously 1) saline solution, 2) the μOR selective agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0.01 mg kg(-1) ), 3) DAMGO and the selective μOR antagonist [H-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2] (CTAP; 0.1 mg kg(-1) ), or 4) CTAP alone. I/R induced intestinal  as indicated by histological damage and the significant increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an index of tissue neutrophil accumulation. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA levels were also increased in I/R mice compared with SO. DAMGO significantly reduced tissue damage, MPO activity, and TNF-α mRNA levels in I/R, and these effects were reversed by CTAP. By contrast, DAMGO did not modify IL-10 mRNA levels or gastrointestinal transit. DAMGO's effects are receptor mediated and likely are due to activation of peripheral μORs, because it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. These findings suggest that activation of peripheral μOR protects from the inflammatory response induced by I/R through a pathway involving the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Reduction of acute  might prevent I/R complications, including motility impairment, which develop at a later stage of reperfusion and likely are due to inflammatory cell infiltrates.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323370>Electroacupuncture alleviates affective pain in an inflammatory pain rat model.</a></h1><p>Pain has both sensory-discriminative and emotional-affective dimensions. Previous studies demonstrate that electroacupuncture (EA) alleviates the sensory dimension but do not address the affective. An inflammatory pain rat model, produced by a complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) injection into the hind paw, was combined with a conditioned place avoidance (CPA) test to determine whether EA inhibits spontaneous pain-induced affective response and, if so, to study the possibility that rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) opioids underlie this effect. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g, Harlan) were used. The rats showed place aversion (i.e. affective pain) by spending less time in a pain-paired compartment after conditioning than during a preconditioning test. Systemic non-analgesic morphine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited the affective reaction, suggesting that the affective dimension is underpinned by mechanisms different from those of the sensory dimension of pain. Morphine at 0.5 and at 1 mg/kg did not induce reward. Rats given EA treatment before pain-paired conditioning at GB 30 showed no aversion to the pain-paired compartment, indicating that EA inhibited the affective dimension. EA treatment did not produce reward or aversive effect. Intra-rACC administration of D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen- amide (CTOP), a selective mu opioid receptor antagonist, but not norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI), a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, blocked EA inhibition of the affective dimension. These data demonstrate that EA activates opioid receptors in the rACC to inhibit pain-induced affective responses and that EA may be an effective therapy for both the sensory-discriminative and the affective dimensions of pain.© 2011 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29627244>Jugular arginine infusion relieves lipopolysaccharide-triggered inflammatory stress and improves immunity status of lactating dairy cows.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of jugular l-Arg infusion on performance and immune function during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  of lactating dairy cows. Eight Holstein cows (multiparous, 608.8 ± 31.5 kg) at mid-lactation were randomly assigned to 5-d jugular infusions of control (saline), Arg (3 g/h), LPS (0.033 μg/kg per h), and LPS + Arg (0.033 μg/kg per h of LPS and 3 g/h of Arg) in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 infusion periods separated by 10-d noninfusion periods. Jugular solutions of saline, Arg, LPS, and LPS + Arg were continuously infused using peristaltic pumps for approximately 6 h/d during infusion periods. Milk yield was measured on each day of the infusion period. Milk samples were obtained on the last 2 d of each infusion period, and blood samples were obtained on the last day of each infusion period before infusion (0 h) and at 3 and 6 h. We found that the jugular LPS infusion significantly increased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein, whereas Arg attenuated the increase in IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels and tended to decrease the lipopolysaccharide binding protein level. Arginine alleviated the decrease in dry matter intake and milk fat yield and the increase of somatic cell count induced by LPS. Total casein in milk was decreased during the LPS-induced  period, and jugular Arg infusion significantly increased the content of total casein. In contrast, lactalbumin in milk increased during the LPS-induced  period, whereas jugular Arg infusion significantly decreased the content of lactalbumin. The concentrations of plasma Gly, , Ile, Leu, Arg, , and total free AA were significantly decreased by LPS treatment, but Arg attenuated this tendency. These results indicated that jugular Arg infusion (18 g/d) has protective effects on relieving inflammatory stress and improving immunity status triggered by LPS. In conclusion, Arg could attenuate inflammatory stress and improve milk performance of lactating dairy cows. This protective effect may be due to the ability of Arg to suppress LPS effects and improve immunity status.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, concentrations of opioid peptides are increased in peripheral blood and at the sites of inflammatory reactions.Using flow cytometric assay of whole human blood, we investigated direct effects of endogenous and synthetic opioid peptides on surface expression of complement receptors CD35 and CD11b/CD18 and Fcã receptor III CD16, and superoxide anion generation of neutrophils.The endogenous opioid peptides beta-endorphin(1-31) and met-enkephalin, representing the N-terminal fragment of beta-endorphin(1-31), and the synthetic delta opioid receptor agonists D-Ala(2)-D-Leu(5)-enkephalin and D-Pen(2)-enkephalin produced concentration-dependent stimulation of neutrophil activity. Incubation with met-enkephalin 10(-7) M or beta-endorphin(1-31) 10(-7) M led to an increase in receptor expression of up to 10% (met-enkephalin) and 15% (beta-endorphin(1-31)). After incubation with D-Ala(2)-D-Leu(5)-enkephalin or D-Pen(2/5)-enkephalin, receptor expression was increased by up to 30%. This correlated with concentration-dependent stimulation of the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, as shown by an increase of up to 40% in oxidative burst activity. All effects were abolished after preincubation with naloxone or with the selective delta opioid antagonist naltrindole, whereas the selective micro receptor antagonist d--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2) showed only partial inhibitory effects.Our data suggest a delta opioid receptor-mediated stimulatory effect on neutrophil function. beta-Endorphin(27-31), the C-terminal fragment of beta-endorphin(1-31), did not alter neutrophil function, indicating that beta-endorphin(1-31) mediates its effect on neutrophils via the N-terminal fragment.

Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, Ile, Leu, , Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, , Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, , and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, , and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

To test the hypothesis that cellular mechanisms of chronic pain in the primary afferent also contribute to the development of opiate resistance, we used a recently developed model of the transition of from acute to chronic pain, hyperalgesic priming. Repeated intradermal administration of the potent and highly selective mu-opioid agonist, [d-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), to produce tolerance for its inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) hyperalgesia, simultaneously produced hyperalgesic priming. Conversely, injection of an inflammogen, carrageenan, used to produce priming produced DAMGO tolerance. Both effects were prevented by inhibition of protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon). Carrageenan also induced opioid dependence, manifest as mu-opioid receptor antagonist (d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH(2))-induced hyperalgesia that, like priming, was PKCepsilon and G(i) dependent. These findings suggest that the transition from acute to chronic pain, and development of mu-opioid receptor tolerance and dependence may be linked by common cellular mechanisms in the primary afferent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982101>Probing binding mechanism of interleukin-6 and olokizumab: in silico design of potential lead antibodies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</a></h1><p>Computer-aided antibody engineering has been successful in the design of new biologics for disease diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.
