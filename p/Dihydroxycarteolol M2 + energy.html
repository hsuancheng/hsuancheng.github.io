The intervention was a lipid-based micronutrient supplement; a protein- supplement was also provided if maternal body mass index (kg/) was <20 or gestational weight gain was less than recommendations. Study sites were in rural locations of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guatemala, India, and Pakistan. The primary outcome was length-for-age z score (LAZ), with all anthropometry obtained <48 h post delivery. Because gestational ages were unavailable in DRC, outcomes were determined for all 4 sites from WHO newborn standards (non-gestational-age-adjusted, NGAA) as well as INTERGROWTH-21st fetal standards (3 sites, gestational age-adjusted, GAA).A total of 7387 nonpregnant women were randomly assigned, yielding 2451 births with NGAA primary outcomes and 1465 with GAA outcomes. Mean LAZ and other outcomes did not differ between Arm 1 and Arm 2 using either NGAA or GAA. Mean LAZ (NGAA) for Arm 1 was greater than for Arm 3 (effect size: +0.19; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.30, P = 0.0008). For GAA outcomes, rates of stunting and small-for-gestational-age were lower in Arm 1 than in Arm 3 (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.98, P = 0.0361 and RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.88, P < 0.001, respectively). Rates of preterm birth did not differ among arms.In low-resource populations, benefits on fetal growth-related birth outcomes were derived from nutrition supplements commenced before conception or late in the first trimester.

However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to  metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, acetate, and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM acetate was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM SCFA function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034033>Maternal and Infant Lipid-Based Nutritional Supplementation Increases Height of Ghanaian Children at 4-6 Years Only if the Mother Was Not Overweight Before Conception.</a></h2><p>Few studies have evaluated the long-term effects of nutritional supplementation during the first 1000 d of life. We previously reported that maternal and child lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) increased child length by 18 mo.The aim of this study was to examine the effects of LNS on later growth and body composition at 4-6 y of age.This was a follow-up of children in the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (iLiNS)-DYAD trial in Ghana. Women (n = 1320) at ≤20 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to: 1) iron and folic acid during pregnancy and 200 mg calcium/d for 6 mo postpartum, 2) multiple micronutrients (1-2 RDA of 18 vitamins and minerals) during both periods, or 3) maternal LNS during both periods plus child LNS from 6 to 18 mo. At 4-6 y, we compared height, height-for-age z score (HAZ), and % body fat (deuterium dilution method) between the LNS group and the 2 non-LNS groups combined.Data were available for 961 children (76.5% of live births). There were no significant differences between LNS compared with non-LNS groups in height [106.7 compared with 106.3 cm (mean difference, MD, 0.36; P = 0.226)], HAZ [-0.49 compared with -0.57 (MD = 0.08; P = 0.226)], stunting (< -2 SD) [6.5 compared with 6.3% (OR = 1.00; P = 0.993)], or % body fat [15.5 compared with 15.3% (MD = 0.16; P = 0.630)]. However, there was an interaction with maternal prepregnancy BMI (kg/) (P-interaction = 0.046 before correction for multiple testing): among children of women with BMI < 25 , LNS children were taller than non-LNS children (+1.1 cm, P = 0.017), whereas there was no difference among children of women with BMI ≥ 25 (+0.1 cm; P = 0.874).There was no overall effect of LNS on height at 4-6 y in this cohort, which had a low stunting rate, but height was greater in the LNS group among children of nonoverweight/obese women.

Non-caloric bitter compounds, including quinine, have recently been shown in cell-line and animal studies to stimulate the release of gastrointestinal hormones by activating bitter taste receptors expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and thus, may potentially suppress  intake without providing additional calories. This study aims to evaluate the effects of intraduodenally administered quinine on antropyloroduodenal pressures, plasma CCK and  intake.Fourteen healthy, lean men (25 ± 5 years; BMI: 22.5 ± 2.0 kg/) received on 4 separate occasions, in randomized, double-blind fashion, 60-minute intraduodenal infusions of quinine hydrochloride at doses totaling 37.5 mg ("Q37.5"), 75 mg ("Q75") or 225 mg ("Q225"), or control (all 300 mOsmol). Antropyloroduodenal pressures (high-resolution manometry), plasma CCK (radioimmunoassay), and appetite perceptions/gastrointestinal symptoms (visual analog questionnaires) were measured. Ad libitum  intake (buffet-meal) was quantified immediately post-infusion. Oral quinine taste-thresholds were assessed on a separate occasion using 3-alternative forced-choice procedure.All participants detected quinine orally (detection-threshold: 0.19 ± 0.07 mmol/L). Intraduodenal quinine did not affect antral, pyloric or duodenal pressures, plasma CCK (pmol/L [peak]; control: 3.6 ± 0.4, Q37.5: 3.6 ± 0.4, Q75: 3.7 ± 0.3, Q225: 3.9 ± 0.4), appetite perceptions, gastrointestinal symptoms or  intake (kcal; control: 1088 ± 90, Q37.5: 1057 ± 69, Q75: 1029 ±7 0, Q225: 1077 ± 88).Quinine, administered intraduodenally over 60 minutes, even at moderately high doses, but low infusion rates, does not modulate appetite-related gastrointestinal functions or  intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597355>Mitochondrial Calcium Uptake Is Instrumental to Alternative Macrophage Polarization and Phagocytic Activity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are highly plastic and dynamic cells that exert much of their function through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis depends on a coordinated, finely tuned, and compartmentalized regulation of calcium concentrations. We examined the role of mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in macrophage polarization and function. In primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages, calcium uptake in mitochondria was instrumental for alternative () macrophage polarization. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibition with KB-R7943 or MCU knockdown, which prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake, reduced  polarization, while not affecting classical (M1) polarization. Challenging macrophages with  fragments induced spikes of mitochondrial calcium concentrations, which were prevented by MCU inhibition or silencing. In addition, mitochondria remodelled in  macrophages during phagocytosis, especially close to sites of  internalization. Remarkably, inhibition or knockdown of MCU significantly reduced the phagocytic capacity of  macrophages. KB-R7943, which also inhibits the membrane sodium/calcium exchanger and Complex I, reduced mitochondria energization and cellular ATP levels, but such effects were not observed with MCU silencing. Therefore, phagocytosis inhibition by MCU knockdown depended on the impaired mitochondrial calcium buffering rather than changes in mitochondrial and cellular  status. These data uncover a new role for MCU in alternative macrophage polarization and phagocytic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248020>Behavioral Determinants of Objectively Assessed Diet Quality in Obese Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Interventions to promote healthy pregnancy in women with obesity by improving diet quality have been widely unsuccessful. We hypothesized that diet quality is determined by eating behaviors, but evidence in women with obesity is lacking. We evaluated diet quality and eating behavior in 56 women with obesity (mean ± SEM, 36.7 ± 0.7 kg/, 46% White, 50% nulliparous) early in pregnancy (14.9 ± 0.1 weeks). Diet quality was objectively assessed with food photography over six days and defined by Healthy Eating Index. Eating behaviors were assessed by validated questionnaires. Women reported consuming diets high in fat (38 ± 1% of ) and the HEI was considered "poor" on average (46.7 ± 1.3), and for 71% of women. Diet quality was independently associated with education level ( 0.01), food cravings ( < 0.01), and awareness towards eating ( 0.01). Cravings for sweets and fast foods were positively correlated with respective intakes of these foods ( < 0.01 and  0.04, respectively), whereas cravings for fruits and vegetables did not relate to diet intake. We provide evidence of the determinants of poor diet quality in pregnant women with obesity. Based on this observational study, strategies to improve diet quality and pregnancy outcomes are to satisfy cravings for healthy snacks and foods, and to promote awareness towards eating behaviors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225583>Total  expenditure in patients with colorectal cancer: associations with body composition, physical activity, and  recommendations.</a></h2><p>Total  expenditure (TEE) data in patients with early-stage cancer are scarce, precluding an understanding of  requirements.The objective was to cross-sectionally characterize TEE in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to compare measured TEE with  recommendations. It was hypothesized that TEE would differ according to body mass, body composition, and physical activity level (PAL) and current  recommendations would have poor individual-level accuracy.Patients with newly diagnosed CRC had resting  expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry and TEE by doubly labeled water. Hypermetabolism was defined as REE > 110% of that predicted from the Mifflin St.-Jeor equation. Body composition was assessed via DXA. Physical activity was determined as the ratio of TEE to REE (TEE:REE) (PAL) and residual activity  expenditure (RAEE). TEE was compared with  recommendations of 25-30 kcal/d and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) using Bland-Altman analyses. Patients were stratified according to median BMI, PAL, and sex-specific ratio of fat mass (FM) to fat-free mass (FFM).Twenty-one patients (M:F 14:7; mean ± SD BMI: 28.3 ± 4.9 kg/, age: 57 ± 12 y) were included. Most (n = 20) had stage II-III disease; 1 had stage IV. Approximately half (n = 11) were hypermetabolic; TEE was not different in those with hypermetabolism and REE as a percentage of predicted was not correlated with TEE. Mean ± SD TEE was 2473 ± 499 kcal/d (range: 1562-3622 kcal/d), or 29.7 ± 6.3 kcal/kg body weight (range: 20.4-48.5 kcal/kg body weight). Mean ± SD PAL was 1.43 ± 0.27. The  recommendation of 25 kcal/kg underestimated TEE (-12.6% ± 16.5%, P = 0.002); all  recommendations had wide limits of agreement (the smallest was DRI with measured PAL: -21.2% to 29.3%). Patients with higher BMI and FM:FFM had higher bias using kilocalories per kilogram recommendations; bias from several recommendations was frequently lower (i.e. underestimation) in patients with higher PAL and RAEE.TEE variability was not reflected in  recommendations and error was related to body weight, body composition, and physical activity.

The association between sodium intake and obesity is unclear, with few studies assessing sodium intake using 24-h urine collection.Our objective was to assess the association between usual 24-h sodium excretion and measures of adiposity among US adults.Cross-sectional data were analyzed from a sample of 730 nonpregnant participants aged 20-69 y who provided up to 2 complete 24-h urine specimens in the NHANES 2014 and had data on overweight or obesity [body mass index (kg/) ≥25] and central adiposity [waist circumference (WC): >88 cm for women, >102 cm for men]. Measurement error models were used to estimate usual sodium excretion, and multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to assess its associations with measures of adiposity, adjusting for sociodemographic, health, and dietary variables [i.e.,  intake or sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake]. All analyses accounted for the complex survey sample design.Unadjusted mean ± SE usual sodium excretion was 3727 ± 43.5 mg/d and 3145 ± 55.0 mg/d among participants with and without overweight/obesity and 3653 ± 58.1 mg/d and 3443 ± 35.3 mg/d among participants with or without central adiposity, respectively. A 1000-mg/d higher sodium excretion was significantly associated with 3.8-units higher BMI (95% CI: 2.8, 4.8) and a 9.2-cm greater WC (95% CI: 6.9, 11.5 cm) adjusted for covariates. Compared with participants in the lowest quartile of sodium excretion, the adjusted prevalence ratios in the highest quartile were 1.93 (95% CI: 1.69, 2.20) for overweight/obesity and 2.07 (95% CI: 1.74, 2.46) for central adiposity.

However, PCA requires arbitrary ad hoc decisions for selecting food variables in interpreting dietary patterns and does not easily accommodate covariates. Sparse latent factor models can be utilized to address these issues.The objective of this study was to compare Bayesian sparse latent factor models with PCA for identifying dietary patterns among young adults.Habitual food intake was estimated in 2730 sedentary young adults from the Training Interventions and Genetics of Exercise Response (TIGER) Study [aged 18-35 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/): 26.5 ± 6.1] who exercised <30 min/wk during the previous 30 d without restricting caloric intake before study enrollment. A food-frequency questionnaire was used to generate the frequency intakes of 102 food items. Sparse latent factor modeling was applied to the standardized food intakes to derive dietary patterns, incorporating additional covariates (sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI). The identified dietary patterns via sparse latent factor modeling were compared with the PCA derived dietary patterns.Seven dietary patterns were identified in both PCA and sparse latent factor analysis. In contrast to PCA, the sparse latent factor analysis allowed the covariate information to be jointly accounted for in the estimation of dietary patterns in the model and offered probabilistic criteria to determine the foods relevant to each dietary pattern. The derived patterns from both methods generally described common dietary behaviors. Dietary patterns 1-4 had similar food subsets using both statistical approaches, but PCA had smaller sets of foods with more cross-loading elements between the 2 factors. Overall, the sparse latent factor analysis produced more interpretable dietary patterns, with fewer of the food items excluded from all patterns.Sparse latent factor models can be useful in future studies of dietary patterns by reducing the intrinsic arbitrariness involving the choice of food variables in interpreting dietary patterns and incorporating covariates in the assessment of dietary patterns.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161966>Monocyte Polarization is Altered by Total-Body Irradiation in Male Rhesus Macaques: Implications for Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure.</a></h2><p>Radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is a common delayed effect of acute ionizing radiation exposure (DEARE) affecting diverse tissues including the heart, lungs, liver and skin, leading to reduced tissue function and increased morbidity. Monocytes, which may be classified into classical (CD14, CD16), intermediate (CD14, CD16) and non-classical (CD14, CD16) subtypes in humans and non-human primates (NHPs), and monocyte-derived macrophages may play an integral role in the pathogenesis of RIF. We tested the hypothesis that moderate to high levels of total-body exposure to radiation would alter monocyte polarization and produce phenotypes that could promote multi-organ fibrosis in a wellestablished NHP model of DEARE. Subjects were 16 young adult male rhesus macaques, ten of which were exposed to high-, 4 Gy X-ray total-body irradiation (TBI) and six that received sham irradiation (control). Total monocytes assessed by complete blood counts were 89% depleted in TBI animals by day 9 postirradiation ( < 0.05), but recovered by day 30 postirradiation and did not differ from control levels thereafter. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted into classical, intermediate and non-classical subsets using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) prior to and at 6 months post-TBI. At 6 months postirradiation, monocyte polarization shifted towards lower classical (92% → 86%) and higher intermediate (7% → 12%) and non-classical monocyte subsets (0.6% → 2%) (all  < 0.05) in TBI animals compared to baseline. No change in monocyte subsets was observed in control animals. Transcriptional profiles in classical and intermediate monocyte subsets were assessed using RNAseq. Classical monocyte gene expression did not change significantly over time or differ cross-sectionally between TBI and control groups. In contrast, significant numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in intermediate monocyte comparisons between the TBI animals and all animals at baseline (304 DEGs), and in the TBI versus control animals at 6 months postirradiation (67 DEGs). Intermediate monocytes also differed between baseline and 6 months in control animals (147 DEGs). Pathway analysis was used to identify genes within significant canonical pathways, yielding 52 DEGs that were specific to irradiated intermediate monocytes. These DEGs and significant canonical pathways were associated with pro-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways that have been noted to induce  macrophage polarization. These findings support the hypothesis that TBI may alter monocyte programming and polarization towards a profibrotic phenotype, providing a novel target opportunity for therapies to inhibit or prevent RIF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30501180>Elucidating CO Chemisorption in Diamine-Appended Metal-Organic Frameworks.</a></h2><p>The widespread deployment of carbon capture and sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy could be facilitated by the development of more -efficient adsorbents. Diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks of the type diamine-M(dobpdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn; dobpdc = 4,4'-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate) have shown promise for carbon-capture applications, although questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms of CO uptake in these materials. Here we leverage the crystallinity and tunability of this class of frameworks to perform a comprehensive study of CO chemisorption. Using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments and van-der-Waals-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations for 13 diamine-M(dobpdc) variants, we demonstrate that the canonical CO chemisorption products, ammonium carbamate chains and carbamic acid pairs, can be readily distinguished and that ammonium carbamate chain formation dominates for diamine-Mg(dobpdc) materials. In addition, we elucidate a new chemisorption mechanism in the material dmpn-Mg(dobpdc) (dmpn = 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane), which involves the formation of a 1:1 mixture of ammonium carbamate and carbamic acid and accounts for the unusual adsorption properties of this material. Finally, we show that the presence of water plays an important role in directing the mechanisms for CO uptake in diamine-M(dobpdc) materials. Overall, our combined NMR and DFT approach enables a thorough depiction and understanding of CO adsorption within diamine-M(dobpdc) compounds, which may aid similar studies in other amine-functionalized adsorbents in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587557>Tracking the Metal-Centered Triplet in Photoinduced Spin Crossover of Fe(phen) with Tabletop Femtosecond M-Edge X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Fe(II) coordination complexes are promising alternatives to Ru(II) and Ir(III) chromophores for photoredox chemistry and solar  conversion, but rapid deactivation of the initial metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state to low-lying (d,d) states limits their performance. Relaxation to a long-lived quintet state is postulated to occur via a metal-centered triplet state, but this mechanism remains controversial. We use femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy to measure the excited-state relaxation of Fe(phen) and conclusively identify a T intermediate that forms in 170 fs and decays to a vibrationally hot T state in 39 fs. A coherent vibrational wavepacket with a period of 249 fs and damping time of 0.63 ps is observed on the T surface, and the spectrum of this oscillation serves as a fingerprint for the Fe-N symmetric stretch. The results show that the shape of the M-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum is sensitive to the electronic structure of the metal center, and the high-spin sensitivity, fast time resolution, and tabletop convenience of XUV transient absorption make it a powerful tool for studying the complex photophysics of transition metal complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185162>Two-Way Cruise Nanosatellite Promotes Metastasis Inhibition by Immunochemotherapy.</a></h2><p>Currently, immunochemotherapy based on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is mainly used for elimination of  macrophages. However, these methods cannot make full use of the positive immune-modulatory effects of macrophages. This study explores a two-way cruise strategy for combining immunotherapy based on TAM phenotype reversal with classical chemotherapy, the nanosatellites (DOX@HFn-PGZL@Res) are proposed to accurately deliver the chemotherapeutic agents and immune activators to their respective target cells. When the delivery system is recruited to tumor microenvironment, the nanosatellites are separated into DOX@HFn and Res@GZL nanoparticles, which can enter cancer cells and -TAMs, respectively. The data show that DOX@HFn-PGZL@Res successfully re-educate  to M1 macrophages, resulting in an activated immune response and inhibition of tumor invasion and metastasis.

We tested the hypothesis that regional body fat deposits (trunk or leg fat) are associated with altered risk of CVD among postmenopausal women with normal BMI.We included 2683 postmenopausal women with normal BMI (18.5 to <25 kg/) who participated in the Women's Health Initiative and had no known CVD at baseline. Body composition was determined by dual  X-ray absorptiometry. Incident CVD events including coronary heart disease and stroke were ascertained through February 2017. During a median 17.9 years of follow-up, 291 incident CVD cases occurred. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors, neither whole-body fat mass nor fat percentage was associated with CVD risk. Higher percent trunk fat was associated with increased risk of CVD [highest vs. lowest quartile hazard ratio (HR) = 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-2.74; P-trend <0.001], whereas higher percent leg fat was associated with decreased risk of CVD (highest vs. lowest quartile HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89; P-trend = 0.008). The association for trunk fat was attenuated yet remained significant after further adjustment for waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. Higher percent trunk fat combined with lower percent leg fat was associated with particularly high risk of CVD (HR comparing extreme groups = 3.33, 95% CI 1.46-7.62).Among postmenopausal women with normal BMI, both elevated trunk fat and reduced leg fat are associated with increased risk of CVD.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Emerging evidence has suggested that UroA modulates  metabolism in various cells. However, UroA's physiological functions related to obesity and insulin resistance remain unclear.Male mice were intraperitoneally administrated either UroA or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle) along with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated via glucose and insulin tolerance tests and acute insulin signaling. The effects of UroA on hepatic triglyceride accumulation, adipocyte size, mitochondrial DNA content, and proinflammatory gene expressions were determined. The impact of UroA on macrophage polarization and mitochondrial respiration were assessed in bone marrow-derived macrophages.Administration of UroA (1) improved systemic insulin sensitivity, (2) attenuated triglyceride accumulation and elevated mitochondrial biogenesis in the liver, (3) reduced adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration into the adipose tissue, and (4) altered M1/ polarization in peritoneal macrophages. In addition, UroA favored macrophage  polarization and mitochondrial respiration in bone marrow-derived macrophages.UroA plays a direct role in improving systemic insulin sensitivity independent of its parental compounds. This work supports UroA's role in the metabolic benefits of ellagic acid-rich foods and highlights the significance of its microbial transformation in the gut.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340872>Women with a low-satiety phenotype show impaired appetite control and greater resistance to weight loss.</a></h2><p>This trial compared weight loss outcomes over 14 weeks in women showing low- or high-satiety responsiveness (low- or high-satiety phenotype (LSP, HSP)) measured by a standardised protocol. Food preferences and  intake (EI) after low and high -density (LED, HED) meals were also assessed. Ninety-six women (n 52 analysed; 41·24 (SD 12·54) years; 34·02 (sd 3·58) kg/) engaged in one of two weight loss programmes underwent LED and HED laboratory test days during weeks 3 and 12. Preferences for LED and HED food (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) and ad libitum evening meal and snack EI were assessed in response to equienergetic LED and HED breakfasts and lunches. Weekly questionnaires assessed control over eating and ease of adherence to the programme. Satiety quotients based on subjective fullness ratings post LED and HED breakfasts determined LSP (n 26) and HSP (n 26) by tertile splits. Results showed that the LSP lost less weight and had smaller reductions in waist circumference compared with HSP. The LSP showed greater preferences for HED foods, and under HED conditions, consumed more snacks (kJ) compared with HSP. Snack EI did not differ under LED conditions. LSP reported less control over eating and reported more difficulty with programme adherence. In conclusion, low-satiety responsiveness is detrimental for weight loss.

However, the molecular mechanism by which metformin delays hepatocarcinogenesis in individuals with hepatic steatosis remains rare. Here, we investigate the preventive efficacy of metformin in a rapid AKT/c-Met-triggered HCC mouse model featuring excessive levels of steatosis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, Oil Red O staining and immunoblotting were applied for mechanistic investigations. Pharmacological and biochemical strategies were employed to illuminate molecular evidence for HCC cell lines. The results show that metformin obstructs the malignant transformation of hepatocytes in AKT/c-Met mice. Mechanistically, metformin reduces the expression of phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and two forms of proto-oncogenes, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, in AKT/c-Met mice. Moreover, metformin ameliorates FASN-mediated aberrant lipogenesis and HK2/PKM2-driven ATP generation in vivo. Furthermore, metformin represses the expression of FASN and HK-2 by targeting c-Myc in an AMPK-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, metformin is effective at inhibiting PKM2 expression in the presence of an AMPK inhibitor compound C, suggesting that its functioning in PKM2 is AMPK-independent. Our study experimentally validates a novel molecular mechanism by which metformin alleviates enhanced lipogenesis and high  metabolism during hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that metformin may serve as an agent for the prevention of HCC in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Anthropometric measures universally used for the diagnosis of obesity in the general population may not present the same performance in individuals with CKD.to verify the sensitivity and specificity of body mass index (BMI) in relation to the percentage of body fat (%BF) obtained by dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and air displacement plethysmography (PDA) for patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease.BMI was obtained. DEXA and ADP were used to determine %BF and they were considered as gold standard methods.a total of 78 patients were evaluated, with a mean age of 54.4 ± 13.9 years old. There was a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity (55.2%), according to BMI, and high %BF, according to DEXA (69.2%) and ADP (53.8%). BMI showed a statistically significant correlation with the %BF obtained by both methods and in both sexes (p < 0.05). To detect high %BF, a BMI of 25 kg/ had better sensitivity and specificity values for DEXA (73.3% and 66.7%, respectively) and ADP (77.3% and 52.9%, respectively) in men, and for DEXA (79.9% and 46.7%, respectively) in women. However, a BMI of 26 kg/ for ADP in women would be more accurate (70.0% and 73.7%, respectively).the prevalence of patients with excess body fat was high. The conventional cut-off points for BMI were not adequate in these patients and suggested that BMI ≥ 25 kg/ were more accurate for diagnosing obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557201>Adherences to oral nutritional supplementation among hospital outpatients: An online cross-sectional survey in Japan.</a></h2><p>Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are multi-nutrient products used to increase the  and nutrient intakes of patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether or not the adherence of patients varies according to their receiving prescription or over-the-counter ONS. Data were obtained from an online cross-sectional survey conducted with patients in Japan. A total of 107 patients who matched the inclusion criteria for the prescription ONS group and 148 who matched the criteria for the over-the-counter ONS group were further analyzed. In the prescription and over-the-counter ONS groups, the main medical reason for ONS consumption were "malnutrition" (48 patients [44.9%] vs. 63 patients [42.6%] p = 0.798], "frailty" (29 patients [27.1%] vs. 36 patients [24.3%] p = 0.663) and "aging" (25 patients [23.4%] vs. 30 patients [20.3%] p = 0.644). The proportion of "No particular disease" for prescription ONS consumption was significantly lower than that for over-the-counter ONS (6 patients [5.6%] vs. 24 patients [16.2%] p = 0.001). The body mass index of the prescription ONS group was significantly higher than that of the over-the-counter ONS group (21.1±4.38 kg/ vs. 19.9±3.75 kg/, p = 0.0161). In the prescription ONS group, all patients were given medical advice by doctors or registered dietitians. In contrast, in the over-the-counter ONS group, only 46 patients (31.1%) were given advice by doctors or registered dietitians (p<0.001). In the prescription ONS group, ONS was taken significantly more times and for a longer duration than in the over-the-counter ONS group (p<0.0001). However, among patients given advice by doctors or registered dietitians, there were no significant differences between the groups. Greater support by the medical team is still needed in order to maximize adherence to supplementation, especially concerning the calories, timing and period, so that benefits can be achieved and sustained.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566478>Penumbra: A spatially distributed, mechanistic model for simulating ground-level incident solar  across heterogeneous landscapes.</a></h2><p>Landscape solar  is a significant environmental driver, yet it remains complicated to model well. Several solar radiation models simplify the complexity of light by estimating it at discrete point locations or by averaging values over larger areas. These modeling approaches may be useful in certain cases, but they are unable to provide spatially distributed and temporally dynamic representations of solar  across entire landscapes. We created a landscape-scale ground-level shade and solar  model called Penumbra to address this deficiency. Penumbra simulates spatially distributed ground-level shade and incident solar  at user-defined timescales by modeling local and distant topographic shading and vegetative shading. Spatially resolved inputs of a digital elevation model, a normalized digital surface model, and landscape object transmittance are used to estimate spatial variations in solar  at user-defined temporal timesteps. The research goals for Penumbra included: 1) simulations of spatiotemporal variations of shade and solar  caused by both objects and topographic features, 2) minimal user burden and parameterization, 3) flexible user defined temporal parameters, and 4) flexible external model coupling. We test Penumbra's predictive skill by comparing the model's predictions with monitored open and forested sites, and achieve calibrated mean errors ranging from -17.3 to 148.1 μmoles//s. Penumbra is a dynamic model that can produce spatial and temporal representations of shade percentage and ground-level solar . Outputs from Penumbra can be used with other ecological models to better understand the health and resilience of aquatic, near stream terrestrial, and upland ecosystems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377611>Mitochondrial targeting nano-curcumin for attenuation on PKM2 and FASN.</a></h2><p>Tumor cells are sensitive to the disturbance of mitochondrial functions. Attenuation of dysfunctional mitochondria by natural compounds is an emerging strategy for the recovery of abnormal  metabolism of cancer. To develop a nano-sized curcumin (CUR) in attenuating the  metabolism of cancer cells, herein, a coral-shaped nano-transporter DNA-FeS-DA nanoparticle was synthesized using double-stranded DNA rich in 'GAG' and 'GC' series as a template and poly-dopamine as an adhesive. CUR was successfully loaded to DNA-FeS-DA with a molar ratio of ssDNA: CUR of 1:16, forming CUR@DNA-FeS-DA. This nano-curcumin can readily enter mitochondrion in MCF-7 cancer cells. The CUR@DNA-FeS-DA nanocomposite displays desirable photothermal effect and stability, while its CUR can be released gradually in the weak acid environment. The expression of both pyruvate kinase  and fatty acid synthase in the MCF-7 cancer cells were noticeably inhibited by CUR@DNA-FeS-DA. Given the controlled release and mitochondria-targeting properties, this CUR@DNA-FeS-DA nanocomposite is a promising new drug entity for intervening the  metabolism of cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the extent to which high intake of total, animal and plant protein are risk factors for accelerated kidney function decline in older stable post-MI patients.We analysed 2255 post-MI patients (aged 60-80 years, 80% men) of the Alpha Omega Cohort. Dietary data were collected with a biomarker-validated 203-item food frequency questionnaire. At baseline and 41 months, we estimated glomerular filtration rate based on the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations for serum cystatin C [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcysC)] alone and both creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cysC).Mean [standard deviation (SD)] baseline eGFRcysC and eGFRcr-cysC were 82 (20) and 79 (19) mL/min/1.73 . Of all patients, 16% were current smokers and 19% had diabetes. Mean (SD) total protein intake was 71 (19) g/day, of which two-thirds was animal and one-third plant protein. After multivariable adjustment, including age, sex, total  intake, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs and fat intake, each incremental total daily protein intake of 0.1 g/kg ideal body weight was associated with an additional annual eGFRcysC decline of -0.12 (95% confidence interval -0.19 to -0.04) mL/min/1.73 , and was similar for animal and plant protein. Patients with a daily total protein intake of ≥1.20 compared with <0.80 g/kg ideal body weight had a 2-fold faster annual eGFRcysC decline of -1.60 versus -0.84 mL/min/1.73 . Taking eGFRcr-cysC as outcome showed similar results. Strong linear associations were confirmed by restricted cubic spline analyses.A higher protein intake was significantly associated with a more rapid kidney function decline in post-MI patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

Dairy products differ in nutrient content and food matrix, and little is known about how different dairy products affect postprandial triglyceride (TG) concentrations.We investigated the effect of meals with similar amounts of fat from different dairy products on postprandial TG concentrations over 6 h in healthy adults.A randomized controlled cross-over study was performed on 47 subjects (30% men), with median (25th-75th percentile) age of 32 (25-46) y and body mass index of 23.6 (21.0-25.8) kg/. Meals included 1 of butter, cheese, whipped cream, or sour cream, corresponding to 45 g of fat (approximately 60 %). Serum concentrations of TGs (primary outcome), and total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol), insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, and plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (secondary outcomes) were measured before the meal and 2, 4, and 6 h postprandially. Incremental AUC (iAUC) was calculated for the responses, and data were analyzed using a linear mixed model.Sour cream induced a 61% larger TG-iAUC0-6 h compared to whipped cream (P < 0.001), a 53% larger TG-iAUC0-6 h compared to butter (P < 0.001), and a 23% larger TG-iAUC0-6 h compared to cheese (P = 0.05). No differences in TG-iAUC0-6 h between the other meals were observed. Intake of sour cream induced a larger HDL cholesterol-iAUC0-6 h compared to cheese (P = 0.01). Intake of cheese induced a 124% larger insulin iAUC0-6 h compared to butter (P = 0.006). No other meal effects were observed.High-fat meals containing similar amount of fat from different dairy products induce different postprandial effects on serum TGs, HDL cholesterol, and insulin in healthy adults.

Thus, we investigated whether semimechanistic conceptual mathematical models (CMM) developed for cattle in temperate areas could be adopted and adjusted to adequately predict VDMI of stall-fed cattle in the (Sub-)Tropics. The CMM of Conrad et al. (1964) (C1) and Mertens (1987) (M1) were identified and adopted for their simplicity in reflecting physicophysiological VDMI regulation. Both CMM use 2 equations that estimate the physiologically and physically regulated VDMI and retain the lower VDMI prediction as actual VDMI. Furthermore, C1 was modified by increasing the daily average fecal dry matter output from 0.0107 to 0.0116 kg/kg body weight, yielding the modified model C2. For M1, the daily neutral detergent fiber intake capacity was increased from 0.012 to 0.0135 kg/kg body weight and the daily metabolizable  requirements for maintenance from 0.419 to 0.631 MJ/kg0.75 body weight, whereas the metabolizable  requirements for gain was reduced from 32.5 to 24.3 MJ/kg body weight gain, yielding the modified model . Last, also the mean of the physically and physiologically regulated VDMI rather than the lower of both estimates was retained as actual VDMI to generate the models C3 (from C1), C4 (from C2), M3 (from M1), and M4 (from ). The 8 CMM were then evaluated using a data set summarizing results from 52 studies conducted under (sub)tropical conditions. The mean bias, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were used to evaluate adequacy and robustness of all CMM. The M4, C2, and C1 were the most adequate CMM [i.e., lowest mean biases (0.07, -0.22, and 0.14 kg/animal and day, respectively), RMSEP (1.62, 1.93, and 2.0 kg/animal and day, respectively), and CCC (0.91, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively)] and robust of the 8 CMM. Hence, CMM can adequately predict VDMI across diverse stall-fed cattle systems in the (Sub-)Tropics. Adjusting CMM to reflect the differences in feed quality and animal physiology under typical husbandry conditions in the (Sub-)Tropics and those in temperate areas improves the adequacy of their VDMI predictions.© The Author(s) 2019.

As such, materials capable of reversibly capturing this commodity chemical in an -efficient manner are of interest. Recently, we detailed diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks capable of selectively capturing CO through a cooperative insertion mechanism that promotes efficient adsorption-desorption cycling. We therefore sought to explore the ability of these materials to capture CS through a similar mechanism. Employing crystallography, spectroscopy, and gas adsorption analysis, we demonstrate that CS is indeed cooperatively adsorbed in N,N-dimethylethylenediamine-appended M(dobpdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Zn; dobpdc = 4,4'-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate), via the formation of electrostatically paired ammonium dithiocarbamate chains.

A disturbance in the regulation of  metabolism can be a key reason for the formation of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress, which increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this regard, the aim of this study was to identify the relationship of the copy number of mtDNA in adipose tissue from different locations (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), mesentery (Mes), greater omentum (GO)), liver biopsy samples and mononuclear blood cells (MNCs) with endothelial dysfunction markers (eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) and inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, CRP, leptin) in obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m) with and without type 2 diabetes.The study included 88 obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/) treated at the Kaliningrad Region Hospital. The control group consisted of 20 healthy donors. To measure mtDNA copy number we used droplet digital PCR. The concentrations of molecules (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) were measured in plasma using the following sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Quantitative determination of leptin was evaluated by flow-fluorimetry on a «Bio-Plex Protein Assay System». Statistical analysis and graphs were obtained in R Statistical Software (version 3.3.1).The systemic character of chronic subclinical inflammation in obesity is established, and an increase in the level of endothelial dysfunction molecules was observed in the blood plasma. The levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 were positively correlated with increases in BMI, serum glucose and cholesterol levels.The copy number of mtDNA in various fat stores was higher in obese patients with type 2 diabetes than in obese patients without diabetes or in the control subjects and was related to the levels of leptin and proinflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30608497>Sodium titanium oxide bronze nanoparticles synthesized via concurrent reduction and Na-doping into TiO(B).</a></h2><p>A mixed valence compound, sodium titanium oxide bronze (NaxTiO2-B), combines intriguing properties of high electric conductivity and good chemical stability together with a unique one-dimensional tunnel crystal structure available for cation storage. However, this compound has not been studied for a long period because of the strongly reductive condition at high temperature required for its preparation, which limits the morphological control such as the preparation of nanocrystals. For the first time in this paper, the topotactic synthesis of nano-sized NaxTiO2-B with high specific surface area (>130  g-1) from TiO2(B) nanoparticles has been demonstrated. The reaction of metastable TiO2(B) with NaBH4 allows carrier electrons to be doped simultaneously with incorporation of Na+ ions into the interstitial sites of the host Ti-O lattice at relatively low temperature. An electrochemical investigation of Li+- and Na+-ion storage behaviors suggests that the incorporated Na+ ions are mainly placed in the 6-fold coordination sites of bronze. In addition, optical measurements including time-resolved transient spectroscopy revealed that the doped electrons in the NaxTiO2-B nanoparticles are predominantly in the Ti3+ state and behave as a small polaron. The pelletized NaxTiO2-B nanoparticles shows a good electronic conductivity of 1.4 × 10-2 S cm-1 at 30 °C with an activation  of 0.17 eV, which is attributable to the thermal barrier for the polaron hopping.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216575>BMI modifies the effect of dietary fat on atherogenic lipids: a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>SFA intake increases LDL cholesterol whereas PUFA intake lowers it. Whether the lipid response to dietary fat differs between normal-weight and obese persons is of relevance to dietary recommendations for obese populations.We compared the effect of substituting unsaturated fat for saturated fat on LDL cholesterol and apoB concentrations in normal-weight (BMI ≤ 25 kg/) and obese (BMI: 30-45) subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol.We randomly assigned 83 men and women (aged 21-70 y) stratified by BMI (normal: n = 44; obese: n = 39) and elevated LDL cholesterol (mean ± SD, normal weight 4.6 ± 0.9 mmol/L; obese 4.4 ± 0.8 mmol/L) to either a PUFA diet enriched with oil-based margarine ( n = 42) or an SFA diet enriched with butter (n = 41) for 6 wk.Seven-day dietary records showed differences of ∼9  percent (E%) in SFA and ∼4 E% in PUFA between the SFA and PUFA groups. In the total study population, the PUFA diet compared with the SFA diet lowered LDL cholesterol (-0.31 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.15 mmol/L, compared with 0.32 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.47 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and apoB (-0.08 g/L; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.05 g/L, compared with 0.07 g/L; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.10 g/L; P < 0.001). Tests of the BMI × diet interaction were significant for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB ( P values ≤ 0.009). In normal-weight compared with obese participants post-hoc comparisons found that the respective changes in LDL cholesterol were 9.7% (95% CI: 5.3%, 14.2%) compared with 5.3% (95% CI: -0.7%, 11.2%), P = 0.206, in the SFA group, and -10.4% (95% CI: -15.2%, -5.7%) compared with -2.3% (95% CI: -7.4%, 2.8%), P = 0.020, in the PUFA group. ApoB changes were 7.5% (95% CI: 3.5%, 11.4%) compared with 3.0% (95% CI: -1.7%, 7.7%), P = 0.140, in the SFA group, and -8.9% (95% CI: -12.6%, -5.2%) compared with -3.8% (95% CI: -6.3%, -1.2%), P = 0.021, in the PUFA group. Responses to dietary fat were not associated with changes in polyprotein convertase subtisilin/kexin type 9 concentrations.BMI modifies the effect of PUFAs compared with SFAs, with smaller improvements in atherogenic lipid concentrations in obese than in normal-weight individuals, possibly supporting adjustment of dietary recommendations according to BMI.

Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases  expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174214>Fiber Intake Predicts Weight Loss and Dietary Adherence in Adults Consuming Calorie-Restricted Diets: The POUNDS Lost (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies) Study.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary composition on weight loss are incompletely understood. In addition to  intake, fiber intake,  density, macronutrient composition, and demographic characteristics have all been suggested to contribute to weight loss.The primary aim of this analysis was to assess the role of dietary fiber as a predictor of weight loss in participants who consumed calorie-restricted diets (-750 kcal/d from estimated  needs) for 6 mo, using data from the POUNDS Lost (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies) Study-a randomized trial that examined the effects of calorie-restricted diets varying in macronutrient composition on weight loss in adults.Data were randomly partitioned to a training data set (70%) in which the effects of fiber and other weight-loss predictors were identified using adjusted Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and model averaging. The retained predictors were then fit on the testing data set to assess predictive performance.Three hundred and forty-five participants (53.9% female) provided dietary records at baseline and 6 mo. Mean ± SD age and BMI for the full sample was 52.5 ± 8.7 y and 32.6 ± 3.9 kg/, respectively. Mean ± SD (99% CI) weight change at 6 mo for the full sample was -7.27 ± 5.6 kg (-8.05, -6.48 kg). The final, best fit model (R2 = 0.41) included fiber,  density, fat, age, adherence, baseline weight, race, and changes from baseline in carbohydrate, fiber, PUFA, and MUFA intake, but the most influential predictor was fiber intake ($\hat{\beta }$ = -0.37; P < 0.0001). In addition, fiber was strongly associated with adherence to the macronutrient prescriptions (P < 0.0001). Interactions between race and adherence, age, baseline weight, carbohydrate,  density, and MUFAs were also retained in the final model.Dietary fiber intake, independently of macronutrient and caloric intake, promotes weight loss and dietary adherence in adults with overweight or obesity consuming a calorie-restricted diet.

Phase angle (PA) may be a useful marker for sarcopenia in this clinical population reflecting the cellular integrity level. This cross-sectional and prospective study evaluated the association between low PA values and clinical/nutritional variables in cirrhosis with emphasis on sarcopenia.Male patients with cirrhosis (n = 122) were grouped according their PA values (>4.9° or ≤ 4.9°) after performing electrical bioimpedance. Sarcopenia diagnosis was assessed by considering appendicular skeletal muscle mass indexes <7.0 kg/ (dual- X-ray absorptiometry) and non-dominant handgrip strength (HGS) < 27 kg (dynamometry). Logistic regression model was used to examine the correlation between clinical/nutritional variables and PA values and the ROC curve area was calculated to identify the power of PA values in predicting sarcopenia.Sarcopenic patients presented lower HGS (19.57 vs. 30.55, p = 0.000), PA value (4.18 vs. 5.39, p = 0.005), SM (17.17 vs. 22.00 (p = 0.05), reactance (36.76 vs. 51.11, p = 0.023), and albumin (3.10 vs. 3.75, p = 0.037), as well as higher resistance values (512.56 vs. 457.01, p = 0.021) and CRP levels (7.89 vs. 3.53, p = 0.040) than non-sarcopenic patients.

Overweight/obese Malaysian adults (n 128; BMI≥23 kg/) were randomised to the Hipcref (n 65) or control diet (n 63). The intervention group received Hipcref diet charts based on their personal preferences. The control group followed a generalised dietary advice based on Malaysian Dietary Guidelines, 2010. All participants were responsible for preparing their own meals. There was a significant treatment group×time effect on anthropometric parameters (P&lt;0·05) on an intention-to-treat basis. Pairwise comparisons revealed that Hipcref diet participants had significant reduction in weight, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass and percentage body fat at months 3 and 6 compared with baseline (P&lt;0·001). The control group had significant increase in weight and BMI at months 3 and 6 compared with baseline (P&lt;0·05). The Hipcref diet group had higher reduction in fasting insulin, insulin resistance and C-reactive protein levels compared with the control group at month 6 (P&lt;0·05). Post-intervention, compared with the control group, the Hipcref diet group was found to consume significantly higher percentage  from protein, and PUFA, higher -adjusted vitamin E (mg) and fibre (g), and lower total , lower percentage  from fat and carbohydrate (P&lt;0·05). The success of the Hipcref diet on overweight/obese Malaysian adults may be due to the combined effect of the nutrient composition of the Hipcref diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968140>Restricting carbohydrates at breakfast is sufficient to reduce 24-hour exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and improve glycemic variability.</a></h2><p>The breakfast meal often results in the largest postprandial hyperglycemic excursion in people with type 2 diabetes.Our purpose was to investigate whether restricting carbohydrates at breakfast would be a simple and feasible strategy to reduce daily exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia.Adults with physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes [n = 23; mean ± SD age: 59 ± 11 y; glycated hemoglobin: 6.7% ± 0.6%; body mass index (kg/): 31 ± 7] completed two 24-h isocaloric intervention periods in a random order. Participants consumed one of the following breakfasts: 1) a very-low-carbohydrate high-fat breakfast (LCBF; <10% of  from carbohydrate, 85% of  from fat, 15% of  from protein) or 2) a breakfast with dietary guidelines-recommended nutrient profile (GLBF; 55% of  from carbohydrate, 30% of  from fat, 15% of  from protein), with the same lunch and dinner provided. Continuous glucose monitoring was used to assess postprandial glucose responses over 24 h, and visual analog scales were used to assess ratings of hunger and fullness.The LCBF significantly reduced postprandial hyperglycemia after breakfast (P < 0.01) and did not adversely affect glycemia after lunch or dinner. As such, overall postprandial hyperglycemia (24-h incremental area under the glucose curve) and glycemic variability (mean amplitude of glycemic excursions) were reduced with the LCBF (24-h incremental area under the glucose curve: -173 ± 361 mmol/L; P = 0.03; mean amplitude of glycemic excursions: -0.4 ± 0.8 mmol/L · 24 h; P = 0.03) compared with the GLBF. Premeal hunger was lower before dinner with the LCBF than with the GLBF (P-interaction = 0.03).A very-low-carbohydrate high-fat breakfast lowers postbreakfast glucose excursions. The effects of this simple strategy appear to be sufficient to lower overall exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and improve glycemic variability. Longer-term interventions are warranted.

Chimney reconstruction was developed to avoid postoperative complications and turbulent flow in the aortic arch. This study sought to clarify early outcomes of the procedure and verify its haemodynamic advantages using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).Fourteen consecutive patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome or a variant who underwent chimney reconstruction in the Norwood procedure between January 2013 and March 2018 were enrolled. Median age and body weight at the time of operation were 2.5 months and 4.1 kg, respectively. Thirteen patients (93.9%) had been palliated with previous bilateral pulmonary artery (PA) banding. In addition, patient-specific CFD models of neoarches based on postoperative computed tomograms from 6 patients were created and the flow profiles analysed.Survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 76.6%, 67.3% and 67.3%, respectively. No patient developed left PA compression by neoaorta, neoaortic dilation or neoaortic insufficiency. Only 2 patients (14.3%) required surgical intervention for recoarctation. Fontan completion was performed on 5 patients. On CFD analysis, all reconstructed aortic arches showed low  loss (9.16-14.4 mW/) and low wall shear stresses.Chimney reconstruction was a feasible technique when homografts were not readily available. CFD analyses underscored the fact that this technique produced excellent flow profiles. Larger studies should be conducted to clarify long-term outcomes.© The Author(s) 2019.

Intraoperative imaging could add prognostic information, but transoesophageal echocardiography is unsuitable for exploring right heart function. Right ventricular function after PVR was investigated in real time using a novel video-based contactless kinematic evaluation technology (Vi.Ki.E.), which calculates cardiac fatigue and  consumption.Six consecutive patients undergoing PVR at 13.8 ± 2.6 years (range 6.9-19.8) after the repair of tetralogy of Fallot were enrolled. Mean right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume at magnetic resonance imaging were 115.6 ± 16.2 ml/ and 61.5 ± 14.6 ml/, respectively. Vi.Ki.E. uses a fast-resolution camera placed 45 cm above the open chest, recording cardiac kinematics before and after PVR. An algorithm defines cardiac parameters, such as , fatigue, maximum contraction velocity and tissue displacement.There were no perioperative complications, with patients discharged in satisfactory clinical conditions after 7 ± 2 days (range 5-9). Vi.Ki.E. parameters describing right ventricular dysfunction decreased significantly after surgery:  consumption by 45% [271 125 ± 9422 (mm/s)2 vs 149 202 ± 11 980 (mm/s)2, P = 0.0001], cardiac fatigue by 12% (292 671 ± 29 369 mm/s2 vs 258 755 ± 42 750 mm/s2, P = 0.01), contraction velocity by 54% (3412 ± 749 mm/s vs 1579 ± 400 mm/s, P = 0.0007) and displacement by 23% (27 ± 4 mm vs 21 ± 4 mm, P = 0.01). Patients undergoing PVR at lower end-diastolic volumes, had greater functional recovery of Vi.Ki.E. parameters.Intraoperative Vi.Ki.E shows immediate recovery of right ventricular mechanics after PVR with less cardiac fatigue and  consumption, providing novel insights that may have a prognostic relevance for functional recovery.© The Author(s) 2019.

Two microalgal cultivation systems with a NaHCO by-product (SPBP) and a CO bicarbonation absorber (CBAP) were firstly thoroughly introduced. There was a 13.3% decrease in the initial weight ratio of Na CO /NaHCO resulting in a 25.3% increase in the biomass growth rate with CBAP, compared to that of SPBP. Increased sunlight intensity, solution temperature and pH all resulted in both a higher  absorbance and  release, thereby increasing the weight ratio of Na CO /NaHCO during the growth of A. platensis. The biomass growth rate was peaked at 39.9 g m  day when the weight ratio of Na CO /NaHCO was 3.7.

Despite slightly greater weight loss with ICR than with CCR, there were no significant differences between the groups in the expression of 82 preselected genes in adipose tissue implicated in pathways linking obesity to chronic diseases. At the final follow-up assessment (week 50), weight loss was -5.2% ± 1.2% with ICR, -4.9% ± 1.1% with CCR, and -1.7% ± 0.8% with the control regimen (Poverall = 0.01, PICR vs. CCR = 0.89). These effects were paralleled by proportional changes in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes. There were no significant differences between ICR and CCR regarding various circulating metabolic biomarkers.Our results on the effects of the "5:2 diet" indicate that ICR may be equivalent but not superior to CCR for weight reduction and prevention of metabolic diseases.

Here, using 2-bromoacetophenone as the derivatization reagent (BP, 10 mg/mL, 40 °C for 20 min), a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method was established for the quantitative determination of seven short-chain fatty acids in plasma and feces. The analyses were performed on a C column in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. Specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, and stability were observed within the quantitative limits of biological sample analysis. The established method has largely improved the sensitivity by 200- to 2000-fold than that in gas chromatography (GC). Especially for butyrate, the lower quantitative limit of 1 ng/mL, 1600-fold higher in sensitivity than that of GC (1.6 μg/mL), ensured the accurate determination of its low level in blood or feces (88 ± 29 ng/mL in blood, 176 ± 18 μg/g in feces). Then, the validated method was applied for therapeutic studies of berberine in hyperlipidemia hamsters in vivo and screening of 13 compounds (including five metabolites of berberine and eight typical isoquinoline alkaloids) in vitro. After berberine treatment (oral, 200 mg/kg, 2 weeks) to hyperlipidemia hamsters, the levels of butyrate were significantly upregulated in blood (77 ± 10 ng/mL vs. 117 ± 13 ng/mL, *P < 0.05) and feces (132 ± 11 μg/g vs. 547 ± 57 μg/g, ***P < 0.001), which further verified butyrate as an active endogenous metabolite in coordination with berberine to lower the blood lipids. Additionally, the berberine metabolites (M1, , M3), as well as two isoquinoline alkaloids (tetrandrine and dauricine), could also obviously induce the production of SCFAs (butyrate, etc.) in gut microbiota. In total, we have successfully established a new derivative LC-MS/MS method for the targeted quantitative determination of seven SCFAs in biological samples.

These five receptors share high sequence and structure homology; however, the M1, M3, and M5 receptor subtypes signal preferentially through the Gαq/11 subset of G proteins, whereas the  and M4 receptor subtypes signal through the Gαi/o subset of G proteins, resulting in very different intracellular signaling cascades and physiological effects. The structural basis for this innate ability of the M1/M3/M5 set of receptors and the highly homologous /M4 set of receptors to couple to different G proteins is poorly understood. In this study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with thermodynamic analyses of M1 and  receptors coupled to both Gαi and Gαq to understand the structural basis of the M1 receptor's preference for the Gαq protein and the  receptor's preference for the Gαi protein. The MD studies showed that the M1 and  receptors can couple to both Gα proteins such that the M1 receptor engages with the two Gα proteins in slightly different orientations and the  receptor engages with the two Gα proteins in the same orientation. Thermodynamic studies of the free  of binding of the receptors to the Gα proteins showed that the M1 and  receptors bind more strongly to their cognate Gα proteins compared to their non-cognate ones, which is in line with previous experimental studies on the M3 receptor. A detailed analysis of receptor-G protein interactions showed some cognate-complex-specific interactions for the :Gαi complex; however, G protein selectivity determinants are spread over a large overlapping subset of residues. Conserved interaction between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 far away from the G-protein-binding receptor interface was found only in the two cognate complexes and not in the non-cognate complexes. An analysis of residues implicated previously in G protein selectivity, in light of the cognate and non-cognate structures, shaded a more nuanced role of those residues in affecting G protein selectivity. The simulation of both cognate and non-cognate receptor-G protein complexes fills a structural gap due to difficulties in determining non-cognate complex structures and provides an enhanced framework to probe the mechanisms of G protein selectivity exhibited by most GPCRs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152672>Food Type and Lentil Variety Affect Satiety Responses but Not Food Intake in Healthy Adults When Lentils Are Substituted for Commonly Consumed Carbohydrates.</a></h2><p>Lentils have potential to increase satiety and may contribute to a body weight management strategy; however, the effects on satiety of replacing common food ingredients with lentils within food products remain largely unknown.The aim of this study was to determine the effects of replacing wheat and rice with 2 lentil varieties within muffins and chilies on satiety, test-meal food intake, and 24-h  intake.Healthy adults consumed muffins or chilies in which wheat or rice was substituted with green (61.8 g) or red (54 g) lentils in 2 randomized crossover studies (muffin study: n = 24, mean ± SE age: 25.4 ± 0.9 y, BMI (in kg/): 23.2 ± 0.5; chili study: n = 24, age: 25.7 ± 1.0 y, BMI: 23.2 ± 0.5), with ≥1-wk washout periods between study visits and studies. Subjective appetite sensations measured over 180 min were summarized with total area under the curve (AUC), food intake was measured at an ad libitum test meal, and 24-h  intake was measured using weighed food records. Treatment effects were compared within each study using repeated-measures ANCOVA (subjective appetite sensations) and ANOVA (food intake, 24-h  intake).Green, but not red, lentil chili significantly increased fullness AUC (17.5%, P = 0.02) and decreased desire to eat AUC (20.1%, P = 0.02) and prospective food consumption AUC (16.7%, P = 0.04) compared with rice chili, with no significant differences between chili treatments for test-meal food intake or 24-h  intake. Muffin treatments did not significantly differ for any outcomes.Replacing rice with green, but not red lentils within chili increases satiety but does not decrease food intake, whereas replacing wheat with lentils within muffins does not increase satiety or decrease food intake in healthy adults. Further study of the role of lentil replacement in food products in body weight management is warranted.

The subjects responded to a self-administered baseline questionnaire in 1992 and to a follow-up questionnaire seeking information about diabetes in 2002. Their mean ± SD body mass index was 22.6 ± 2.6 kg/ (men) and 22.1 ± 2.7 (women). The intakes of total soy foods, fried soy foods, nonfried soy foods, soy protein, and soy isoflavones were estimated through the use of a validated food-frequency questionnaire administered in 1992. Associations between soy intake and the risk of diabetes were evaluated through the use of Cox proportional hazards models incorporating age, education level, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of hypertension, use of vitamin supplements, menopausal status, and dietary factors including glycemic load, total , total fat, meat, fruit, vegetables, and coffee.During a 10-y follow-up, 438 participants reported physician-diagnosed diabetes. Women in the highest tertile of intakes of total soy foods, fried soy foods, nonfried soy foods, soy protein, and soy isoflavone had significantly lower HRs, after controlling for covariates, than those with the lowest intakes. For example, HRs were 0.45 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.68; P-trend <0.001) for total soy food intake. In men, there were no significant associations between soy intake and the risk of diabetes.These results suggest that a high soy intake may be associated with a lower risk of diabetes in Japanese women.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524936>Chronotype, Social Jet Lag, and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Early Adolescence.</a></h2><p>Inadequate sleep duration and quality increase the risk of obesity. Sleep timing, while less studied, is important in adolescents because increasing evening preferences (chronotypes), early school start times, and irregular sleep schedules may cause circadian misalignment.To investigate associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk in young adolescents.Starting in 1999, Project Viva recruited pregnant women from eastern Massachusetts. Mother-child in-person visits occurred throughout childhood. From January 23, 2012, to October 16, 2016, 804 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years completed 5 days or more of wrist actigraphy, questionnaires, and anthropometric measurements. A cross-sectional analysis using these data was conducted from April 31, 2018, to May 1, 2019.Chronotype, measured via a continuous scale with higher scores indicating greater evening preferences, and social jet lag, measured as the continuous difference in actigraphy sleep midpoint in hours from midnight on weekends vs weekdays, with higher values representing more delayed sleep timing on weekends.Adiposity, measured via anthropometry and dual- x-ray absorptiometry. For a subset of 479 adolescents with blood samples, cardiometabolic risk scores were computed as the mean of 5 sex- and cohort-specific z scores for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, inversely scaled high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and log-transformed triglycerides and homeostatic model of insulin resistance.Among the 804 adolescents in the study, 418 were girls and 386 were boys, with a mean (SD) age of 13.2 (0.9) years. In multivariable models adjusted for age, puberty, season, and sociodemographics, associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity varied by sex. For girls, greater evening preference was associated with a 0.58-cm (95% CI, 0.12-1.03 cm; P = .04 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.16 kg/ (95% CI, 0.01-0.31 kg/; P = .03 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual- x-ray absorptiometry; each hour of social jet lag was associated with a 1.19-cm (95% CI, 0.04-2.35 cm; P = .21 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.45 kg/ (95% CI, 0.09-0.82 kg/; P = .01 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual- x-ray absorptiometry. Associations of social jet lag and evening chronotypes persisted for many measures of adiposity after adjustment for sleep duration and other lifestyle behaviors. By contrast, no associations were observed in boys. There were no associations with the cardiometabolic risk score for either sex, although statistical power was low for this outcome.Evening chronotypes and social jet lag were associated with greater adiposity in adolescent girls but not adolescent boys. Interventions aimed at improving sleep schedules may be useful for obesity prevention, especially in girls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378209>Effects of stocking density during the dry period on dairy cow physiology, metabolism and behaviour.</a></h2><p>The effects of high stocking density during the dry period on dairy cow physiology, behaviour and welfare were investigated. Holstein Friesian cows (n = 48, calving over a seven month period) were dried-off 60 ± 4 d before their expected calving date, and allocated to either high (H) or low (L) stocking density groups. Cows were housed in cubicles from dry-off to 21 d before calving and then moved to straw yards until calving. In cubicle pens, H and L cows had 0.5 vs. 1.0 feed yokes/cow and 1.0 vs. 1.5 cubicles/cow, respectively, and in straw yards, 0.3 m vs. 0.6 m linear feed-face space and 6 m2vs. 12  lying space, respectively. Video observations of feeding behaviour during the 3 h after feed delivery (3 d/week) and agonistic interactions at the feed-face during peak feeding (2 d/week) were made. Daily lying proportion was measured using an accelerometer device throughout the dry period. Concentrations of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCM) at dry-off, d7 and d35 after dry-off and d21 and d7 before calving and the change in  metabolites (glucose, NEFA, BHB) from dry-off to d7 before calving were measured. H cows were less likely to start feeding within 5 min of feed delivery and spent less time feeding compared to L cows, but they engaged in displacements more frequently and spent more time standing in the feed alley. Irrespective of the treatment groups, FGCM concentrations significantly increased from dry-off to d7 after dry-off and remained higher during the dry period. Stocking density did not affect daily lying proportion,  metabolites during the dry period and milk yield during subsequent lactation. This study found that whilst high stocking density during the dry period increased competition at the feed-face and altered feeding behaviour, it did not affect stress responses,  metabolism or subsequent milk yield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488922>Shape-controlled synthesis of porous carbons for flexible asymmetric supercapacitors.</a></h2><p>N-Doped carbon nanomaterials have gained tremendous research interest in  storage because of their high capacitance and chemical stability. Here, N-doped porous carbons (NPCs) with multiple shape-controlled and tunable morphologies are developed through a direct one-step pyrolysis/activation method. Typically, NPC-700-1, which is 5 nm thick and 6 μm wide, shows a high surface area (1591.5  g-1) and hierarchical micro-, meso-, and macroporous architecture. The maximum specific capacitance of the as-prepared carbon nanosheets is 406 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor devices assembled from NPCs and NiCo2O4 deliver a superior  density of 42.7 W h kg-1 at 794.6 W kg-1, and good cycling ability (94% after 10 000 cycles).

When activated, they dedicate a big amount of  and resources to arrange a complex structure called immunological synapse (IS), containing a particular distribution of molecules defined as supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs), and become polarized toward the target cell in a manner that channels the information specifically. This arrangement is symmetrical and requires the polarization of the MTOC and the Golgi to be operational, especially for the proper delivery of lytic granules and the recycling of molecules three dimensionally segregated at the clustered interface. Alternatively, after the productive encounter, T cells need to rearrange again to newly navigate through the tissue, changing back to a motile state called immunological kinapse (IK). In this IK state, the MTOC and the Golgi apparatus are repositioned and recruited at the back of the T cell to facilitate motility, while the established symmetry of the elements of the SMACs is broken and distributed in a different pattern. Both states, IS and IK, are interchangeable and are mainly orchestrated by the MTOC/Golgi complex, being critical for an effective immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319542>Coinage-Metal Bond between [1.1.1]Propellane and M/MCl/MCH (M = Cu, Ag, and Au): Cooperativity and Substituents.</a></h2><p>A coinage-metal bond has been predicted and characterized in the complexes of [1.1.1]propellane (P) and M/MCl/MCH (M = Cu, Ag, and Au). The interaction  varies between -16 and -47 kcal/mol, indicating that the bridgehead carbon atom of P has a good affinity for the coinage atom. The coinage-metal bond becomes stronger in the Ag < Cu < Au sequence. Relative to M, both MCl and MCH engage in a stronger coinage-metal bond, both -Cl and -CH groups showing an electron-withdrawing property. The formation of coinage-metal bonding is mainly attributed to the donation orbital interactions from the occupied C-C orbital into the empty metal orbitals and a back-donation from the occupied  orbital of metal into the empty C-C anti-bonding orbital. In most complexes, the coinage-metal bond is dominated by electrostatic interaction, with moderate contribution of polarization. When P binds simultaneously with two coinage donors, negative cooperativity is found. Moreover, this cooperativity is prominent for the stronger coinage-metal bond.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368422>High calcium intake from fat-free milk, body composition and glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomised crossover clinical trial.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of high-Ca fat-free milk v. low-Ca control diet on adiposity and on glycaemic control. Fourteen subjects with type 2 diabetes (aged 49·5 (sd 8·6) years, BMI 29·4 (sd 4·5) kg/, low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d)) were included in this randomised, crossover clinical trial. Subjects participated in two 12-week experimental sessions (high-Ca fat-free milk (HC) or low-Ca control (LC)) separated by 8-week washout. Subjects daily consumed in the laboratory a breakfast shake containing 700 mg (HC) or 6·4 mg (LC) of Ca. -restricted diets containing 800 mg of dietary Ca/d were prescribed. Dietary records data indicated the consumption of 1200 mg of Ca/d during HC and of 525 mg of Ca/d during LC. There was a greater reduction in body weight, body fat mass, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio after HC.

Little is known about REE and metabolic adaptation among adolescents after bariatric surgery.To examine changes in REE and metabolic adaptation among adolescents at 12 months (12M) after bariatric surgery.Pediatric hospital, Canada.Adolescents undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were followed. Bioelectrical impedance analysis and indirect calorimetry were completed to measure body composition and REE, respectively. Predicted REE was calculated using the Mifflin equation before and after bariatric surgery and a predictive equation using preoperative data.Among 20 patients (15 girls), the mean age and body mass index at surgery were 17.2 ± 0.8 years and 48.7 ± 7.4 kg/, respectively. REE had decreased by 548.3 kcal/d at 12M postoperatively (P < 0.001). Metabolic adaptation, determined by two procedures, was negative and significantly different from baseline (P < 0.05). When stratified by surgery type, REE change at 12M was not significantly different (RYGB, -494.0 ± 260.9 kcal/d, n = 11; SG, -614.6 ± 344.4 kcal/d, n = 9; P = 0.384). Among 13 patients with REE data at 6 and 12M, no statistically significant difference was found (P = 0.368).Predicted and measured REE was 19% and 25% lower at 12M, respectively, irrespective of bariatric surgery type. Metabolic adaptation might predispose adolescents to weight regain after bariatric surgery and warrants careful nutritional management and counseling.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160950>Alkali metal complexes of an enantiopure iminophosphonamide ligand with bright delayed fluorescence.</a></h2><p>The enantiomerically pure ligand ,-diphenyl-,'-bis(()-1-phenylethyl)phosphinimidic amide (; (R)-HPEPIA) was synthesized and subsequently deprotonated with alkali metal precursors to yield dimeric complexes [M{(R)-PEPIA}] (M = Li (), Na (), K (), Rb ()). The cesium compound [M{(R)-PEPIA}] () crystallized as a cocrystal composed of dimeric ([Cs{(R)-PEPIA}] ( ) and 1D-polymeric ([Cs{(R)-PEPIA}]  ) ( ) species in a 1 : 1 ratio. The coordination polymer  features a unique sinus-shaped configuration of repeating -Cs-N-P-N-Cs-N-P-N- units. Unusual photoluminescence (PL) properties were found for solid : in contrast to the fluorescent ligand , the alkali metal complexes show phosphorescence at low temperatures (<100 K) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) above ∼150 K. The latter provides for PL quantum yields up to 36% () at ambient temperature. DFT calculations support that both  and  have similar singlet and triplet excited states with  separations of a few tens of meV. The strongly enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC) in the metal complexes, resulting in TADF, is attributed to their dimeric structure. This suggests that the fluorophore dimerization may serve as a tool to effect ISC for the design of TADF emitters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404952>Effect of Heat Treatment Temperature on Martensitic Transformation and Superelasticity of the TiNi Shape Memory Alloy.</a></h2><p>The martensitic transformation and superelasticity of TiNi shape memory alloy heat-treatment at different temperatures were investigated. The experimental results show that the microstructures of as-cast and heat-treated (723 K) Ni-rich TiNi samples prepared by rapidly-solidified technology are composed of B2 TiNi phase, and TiNi and TiNi phases; the microstructures of heat-treated TiNi samples at 773 and 823 K are composed of B2 TiNi phase, and of B2 TiNi and TiNi phases, respectively. The martensitic transformation of as-cast TiNi alloy is three-stage, A→R→M and R→M transformation during cooling, and two-stage, M→R→A transformation during heating. The transformations of the heat-treated TiNi samples at 723 and 823 K are the A↔R↔M/A↔M transformation during cooling/heating, respectively. For the heat-treated alloy at 773 K, the transformations are the A→R/M→R→A during cooling/heating, respectively. For the heat-treated alloy at 773 K, only a small thermal hysteresis is suitable for sensor devices. The stable  values of 723 and 773 K heat-treated samples with a large  value exhibit high safety in application. The 773 and 823 K heat-treated samples have large stable strain- densities, and are a good superelastic alloy.

Despite extensive research efforts, the detailed activation mechanism of the BM2 proton channel is often elusive. Herein a pH-regulated mechanism of the BM2TM domain has been systematically characterized using multiscale computer simulations, including classical molecular dynamics, constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches. Our simulations reveal a pH-dependent conformational switch from the C-terminal closed to the C-terminal open conformers, and provide the free  of conformational activation coupled to the titration of the His19 tetrad. Importantly, our results confirm the coupling titration between the His19 tetrad and His27 tetrad, and identify that the full-cationic state (His2744+) dominates at the low pH (the His19 tetrad at +2, +3 and +4 charge states). Our QM/MM simulations indicate that the second titratable histidine, His27, could further promote the BM2 acid activation and speed up proton dissociation from the HxxxW motif, thus facilitating proton conduction by BM2. Taken together, a unique "activation-promotion mechanism" about the BM2 proton channel is proposed, and these results may be helpful for the understanding of other similar proton channels and the development of BM2 inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040883>New technologies in the management of overactive bladder: current research and future prospects.</a></h2><p>Overactive bladder is characterized by frequency, urgency (wet or dry) and nocturia. These troublesome symptoms incur both a physiologic and economic cost, expected to be in excess of US$82 billion in the USA and Europe by the year 2020. Second-tier medicinal oral therapies for overactive bladder abound, but the failure rate or discontinuation at 1 year exceeds 50%. Tertiary-tier therapies involve surgical alternatives including neuromodulation of sacral nerve 3 (S) or the posterior tibial nerve as a means to manipulate and ameliorate the above-described voiding symptoms. Sacral neuromodulation has been studied for more than 20 years, but newer, smaller, rechargeable implantable devices are in the forefront of current investigation. Hopes are that modifications to the device will eventually be possible at the patient's home, rather than the physician's office, with close urological/gynecologic supervision and guidance. Another means of surgical intervention for overactive bladder includes the use of a cystoscopy-guided radiofrequency probe by which  disrupts the bladder floor neural voiding plexi.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid used in traditional Chinese medicine, on  expenditure, expression of the UCP1 gene, the cell stress protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), apoptosis genes, and macrophage phenotype (M1 and ) in white and brown adipose tissue in an obese mouse model fed a high-fat diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (n=20) were divided into a high-fat diet group, a normal diet group, a group treated with berberine at 100 mg/kg/d in 0.9% normal saline, and a non-treated group. Whole-body fat mass, blood glucose, insulin resistance, and oxygen expenditure during physical activity were measured. After 16 weeks, the mice were euthanized for examination of liver and adipose tissue. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis genes, thermogenic genes (including UCP1), and IRE1α, were investigated using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), in white and brown adipose tissue. Magnetic cell sorting harvested M1 and  macrophages in adipose tissue. Clodronate liposomes were used to inhibit macrophage recruitment. RESULTS Berberine treatment in mice fed a high-fat diet increased  metabolism, glucose tolerance, and expression of UCP1, and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, macrophage recruitment, and resulted in  macrophage polarization in white adipose tissue. Polarized  macrophages showed reduced expression of apoptotic genes and IRE1α.

In this work, defect-free facilitated transport membranes based on poly(amide-12-b-ethylene oxide) (Pebax-2533) and tetra(-methoxylphenyl)porphyrin cobalt chloride (T(-OCH)PPCoCl) were fabricated in systematically varied compositions for O/N separation. T(-OCH)PPCoCl was introduced as carriers that selectively and reversibly interacted with O and facilitated O transport in the membrane. The T(-OCH)PPCoCl had good compatibility with the Pebax-2533 via the hydrogen bond interaction and formed a uniform and thin selective layer on the substrate. The O separation performance of the thin film composite (TFC) membranes was improved by adding a small amount of the T(-OCH)PPCoCl and decreasing the feed pressure. At the pressure of 0.035 MPa, the O permeability and O/N selectivity of the 0.6 wt % T(-OCH)PPCoCl/Pebax-2533 was more than 3.5 times that of the Pebax-2533 TFC membrane, which reached the 2008 Robeson upper bound.

Recent studies have shown that induction of brown-like adipocytes, also referred to as beige or brite cells, in white adipose tissue (WAT) results in the release of excess  through mitochondrial heat production via uncoupling protein 1. This has potential a therapeutic strategy for obesity and related diseases as well as classical brown adipocytes. In our previous studies, we found that artepillin C (ArtC, 10 mg/kg body weight), a characteristic constituent of Brazilian propolis, significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in inguinal WAT (iWAT) of mice. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that curcumin (Cur, 4.5 mg/kg) also significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in mice. The combined administration of several food-derived factors can enhance their bioactivity and reduce their required functional doses. In this study, we showed that co-administration of Cur and ArtC at lower doses (Cur, 1.5 mg/kg; ArtC, 5 mg/kg) additively induce brown-like adipocyte development in mouse iWAT. Moreover, this induction is associated with the localized production of norepinephrine following accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages in iWAT. These findings suggest that co-administration of Cur and ArtC is significantly effective to reduce the dose and enhance the formation of brown-like adipocyte via a unique molecular mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662502>Ionizing Radiation Promotes Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Lung Epithelial Cells by TGF-β-producing  Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Ionizing radiation induces pulmonary fibrosis, which is a common dose-limiting complication in patients receiving radiotherapy. Fibrosis occurs through the accumulation of large amounts of ECM components, synthesized by myofibroblasts in damaged lung tissue. Epithelial cells serve as one of the cellular sources of myofibroblasts via the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In this study, we investigated the role of TGF-β-secreting  macrophages in association with ionizing radiation-induced EMT.The lung epithelial cell line MLE12, was irradiated and the expression of EMT markers and chemokines was examined. Moreover, the mouse lung macrophage MH-S cell line was cultured with conditioned media from irradiated MLE12 cells, to examine the effects of the secreted factors on the migration ability of macrophages. For the murine pulmonary fibrosis model, mice were locally irradiated and the levels of M1 or  macrophage-related markers and cytokines were measured in bronchoalvelolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue.In MLE12 cells, irradiation directly induced expression of EMT-related markers and secretion of various chemokines, which lead to macrophage migration. Interestingly, the sub-population of macrophages recruited in the lung of mice after thoracic irradiation was  macrophages that expressed Arg-1 and CD206.  macrophages induced the MLE12 to undergo phenotypic conversion to form fibroblast-like cells, which leads to a down-regulation of epithelial markers and an up-regulation of new EMT-related markers. In thoracic irradiated mice, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-4 and IL-10 were increased at 2 weeks, but returned to normal levels from 16 weeks or 24 weeks after irradiation. However, thoracic irradiation led to a rapid increase of TGF-β and IGF-1 levels, which lasted up to 24 weeks. It was confirmed that  macrophages secreted the high levels of TGF-β. Moreover, the elimination of TGF-β from  macrophages attenuated mesenchymal transition of MLE12.TGF-β-secreting  macrophages play an important regulatory role in mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells in the lung of irradiated mice, thus contributing to radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Although it has long been known that CL plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics, recent evidence in the yeast model indicates that CL is also essential for intermediary metabolism. To gain insight into the function of CL in  metabolism in mammalian cells, here we analyzed the metabolic flux of [U-C]glucose in a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line, TAZ-KO, which is CL-deficient because of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the CL-remodeling enzyme tafazzin (TAZ). TAZ-KO cells exhibited decreased flux of [U-C]glucose to [C]acetyl-CoA and  and M4 isotopomers of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase, the predominant enzyme for anaplerotic replenishing of the TCA cycle, was elevated in TAZ-KO cells, which also exhibited increased sensitivity to the pyruvate carboxylase inhibitor phenylacetate. We attributed a decreased carbon flux from glucose to acetyl-CoA in the TAZ-KO cells to a ∼50% decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, which was observed in both TAZ-KO cells and cardiac tissue from TAZ-KO mice. Protein-lipid overlay experiments revealed that PDH binds to CL, and supplementing digitonin-solubilized TAZ-KO mitochondria with CL restored PDH activity to WT levels. Mitochondria from TAZ-KO cells exhibited an increase in phosphorylated PDH, levels of which were reduced in the presence of supplemented CL. These findings indicate that CL is required for optimal PDH activation, generation of acetyl-CoA, and TCA cycle function, findings that link the key mitochondrial lipid CL to TCA cycle function and  metabolism.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302798>Designing dithienothiophene (DTT)-based donor materials with efficient photovoltaic parameters for organic solar cells.</a></h2><p>Three acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A)-type small donor molecules (M1,  and M3) were evaluated for optoelectronic properties through density functional theory calculations. These designed molecules consist of a dithieno [2,3-b:3,2-d] thiophene (DTT) donor group linked with 2-(3-methyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidine)malononitrile acceptor through three different bridge groups. The effect of the donor and three different bridge spacer groups on the designed molecules for opto-electronic properties was evaluated in comparison with the reference molecule R. The reorganization energies of the designed donor molecules suggest very good charge mobility property. The lower value of hole mobility (λ), as compared to electron mobility (λ), revealed that the three designed molecules are best for hole mobility. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) surfaces confirm the transfer of charge from donor to acceptor unit during excitation. The designed molecules show relatively low HOMO values (in the range of -2.19 to -2.36 eV), with strong absorption in UV-Visible region in the range of 459 nm to 500 nm in chloroform solvent. Electron-hole binding  results indicate that the designed molecule  contains the highest amount of charge, which may dissociate into separate charge easily. Among all the studied molecules, the highest open circuit voltage (V) of 3.01 eV (with respect to HOMO-LUMO) was shown by M3. The open circuit voltages (V) of R, M1,  and M3 were 2.91 eV, 3.01 eV, 2.77 eV and 3.02 eV, respectively.

Field characterization began with the M generation. A total of 135 M families were sown in the field resulting in approximately 4,000 plants. Traits related to phenology (days to flowering, days to maturity), plant morphology of vegetative parts (plant height, height of first pod, number of primary branches per plant) and yield (number of seeds per pod, total number of pods per plant, total number of seeds per plant, seed yield and hundred seed weight) were recorded and analyzed to evaluate genetic variability. An evaluation of the efficacy of low-cost TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) to discover mutations in the M generation was undertaken. Mutation screening focused on genes involved in resistance to two important diseases of chickpea;  (AB) and  (FW), as well as genes responsible for early flowering. Analysis of variance showed a highly significant difference among mutant families for all studied traits. The higher estimates of genetic parameters (genotypic and phenotypic coefficient of variation, broad sense heritability and genetic advance) were recorded for number of seeds per plant and yield. Total yield was highly significant and positively correlated with number of pods and seeds per plant. Path analysis revealed that the total number of seeds per plant had the highest positive direct effect followed by hundred seed weight parameter. One cluster from nine exhibited the highest mean values for total number of pods and seeds per plant as well as yield per plant. According to Dunnett's test, 37 M families superior to the control were determined for five agronomical traits. Pilot experiments with low-cost TILLING show that the seed stock used for mutagenesis is homogeneous and that small mutations do not predominate at the dosage used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004153>Long-Term Change in both Dietary Insulinemic and Inflammatory Potential Is Associated with Weight Gain in Adult Women and Men.</a></h2><p>The influence of long-term dietary patterns on weight gain and the underlying potential biological mechanisms are not fully understood.We prospectively examined the association of changes in 2 empirical hypothesis-oriented dietary patterns (insulinemic and inflammatory) and weight gain over 24 y at 4-y intervals.We followed 54,397 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 33,043 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2010), and computed the empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) and empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) scores from food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 y. Both scores are weighted sums of 18 food groups, which characterize dietary insulinemic or inflammatory potential based on plasma levels of insulin response or inflammatory biomarkers. We used multivariable-adjusted linear regression to examine 4-y changes in the dietary scores and weight change within the same period.The mean baseline body mass index (BMI, in kg/) was 25.4. Compared with participants who made minimal dietary changes (quintile 3) over 6 4-y periods; participants who changed their diets toward lower insulinemic or inflammatory potential (quintile 1) gained significantly less weight (in kilograms per 4 y) independent of total  intake, BMI, physical activity, and smoking status: EDIH: -0.65 (95% CI: -0.73, -0.57), EDIP: -0.29 (-0.37, -0.21) among women; and EDIH: -0.60 (-0.71, -0.49), EDIP: -0.19 (-0.27, -0.07) among men. In contrast, those who changed their diets toward higher insulinemic or inflammatory potential (quintile 5) gained significantly more weight: EDIH: 0.43 (0.36, 0.51), EDIP: 0.15 (0.07, 0.23) among women; and EDIH: 0.49 (0.38, 0.59), EDIP: 0.22 (0.11, 0.33) among men (P-trend < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Associations were stronger among individuals who were overweight or obese, younger, less physically active, and had never smoked.High dietary insulinemic and inflammatory potential is associated with substantial long-term weight gain in adult men and women independent of total  intake.

Although sarcopenia has multifactorial causes, it might be partly attributed to a blunted response to anabolic stimuli. Leucine acutely increases muscle protein synthesis, and resistance training (RT) is the strongest stimuli to counteract sarcopenia and was recently shown to improve insulin sensitivity (IS) in frail older women. Discrepancies exist regarding whether chronic supplementation of leucine in conjunction with RT can improve muscle mass and IS.The aim of this double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to determine the effects of leucine supplementation and RT on IS in prefrail and frail older women.Using the Fried criteria, 19 nondiabetic prefrail (1-2 criteria) and frail (≥3 criteria) older women (77.5 ± 1.3 y; body mass index (kg/): 25.1 ± 0.9) underwent a 3-mo intervention of RT 3 times/wk with protein-optimized diet of 1.2 g·kg-1·d-1 and 7.5 g·d-1 of l-leucine supplementation compared with placebo l-alanine. Pre-/postintervention primary outcomes were fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, and 4-h responses to a standard meal of complete liquid formula. Secondary outcomes of resting  expenditure using indirect calorimetry and body composition using dual- X-ray absorptiometry were obtained. Paired t tests analyzed pooled data, and 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA determined supplementation, training, and interaction effects.No significant time, group, or interaction effects were observed for postprandial areas under the curve of serum insulin or plasma glucose or for resting  expenditure in l-leucine compared with l-alanine. Total lean body mass increased and percentage body fat decreased significantly for both groups postintervention (0.76 ± 0.13 and -0.92 ± 0.33 kg, respectively; time effect: P < 0.01).IS was not affected by RT and leucine supplementation in nondiabetic prefrail and frail older women.

Besides alcohol consumption, -containing nonalcoholic beverages may contribute to liver fat accumulation.We aimed to study the consumption of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and their mutual replacement in relation to hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) in middle-aged men and women.In this cross-sectional analysis, HTGC was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Habitual consumption of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages was assessed using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. All beverages were converted to standard servings and to percentage of total  intake (En%). We performed linear regression to examine the association of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages with HTGC, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, ethnicity, physical activity, total  intake, and total body fat. We studied replacement of alcoholic beverages with nonalcoholic beverages per 1 serving/d and per 5 En%/d.After exclusion of individuals with missing values, 1966 participants (47% men) were analyzed, with a mean ± SD age of 55 ± 6 y, BMI of 26 ± 4 kg/, and HTGC of 5.7% ± 7.9%. Each extra alcoholic serving per day was associated with more liver fat (1.09 times; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12). Replacing 5 En% of alcoholic beverages with milk was associated with less liver fat (0.89 times; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), whereas replacement with 5 En% of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with liver fat to an extent similar to alcoholic beverages (1.00 times; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.09).In a population-based cohort, consumption of each extra daily alcoholic beverage was associated with more liver fat. In isocaloric replacement of alcoholic beverages, milk was associated with less liver fat, whereas sugar-sweetened beverages were equally associated with liver fat.

Puerto Rican adults have a higher prevalence of osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency than non-Hispanic whites. However, there is little understanding of lifestyle influences on bone in this population.The aim of this study was to examine associations of dairy intakes with BMD among adults from the Boston Puerto Rican Osteoporosis Study with and without adequate serum vitamin D status.A total of 904 participants in this cross-sectional analysis provided dietary intakes with a culturally tailored food-frequency questionnaire. Dairy food groups were calculated [total dairy, modified dairy (without cream or dairy desserts), fluid dairy (milk + yogurt), cheese, yogurt, and cream and desserts]. BMD (grams per centimeter squared) was measured using dual- X-ray absorptiometry. Vitamin D status was defined as sufficient (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] ≥20 ng/mL) or insufficient (<20 ng/mL). General linear models were used to examine associations between dairy intake and BMD, stratified by vitamin D status.Of the total sample, 73% were women, of whom 87% were postmenopausal. Mean ± SD age was 60.0 ± 7.6 y and mean ± SD body mass index (kg/) was 32.3 ± 6.6. Mean serum 25(OH)D (range: 4-48 ng/mL) was 14.3 ± 3.6 ng/mL in insufficient individuals and 26.0 ± 5.5 ng/mL in sufficient individuals. In the full sample, higher intakes of modified dairy foods (β = 0.0015, P = 0.02) and milk (β = 0.0018, P = 0.04) were associated with higher femoral neck (FN) BMD. Among those who were vitamin D sufficient, higher intakes of total dairy (P = 0.03-0.07), fluid dairy (P = 0.01-0.05), and milk (P = 0.02-0.09) were significantly related to higher FN and lumbar spine BMD, respectively.

A total of 20 growing ostriches, with almost similar body weight (73.4 to 75.8 kg), were individually distributed in outdoor paddocks of ≈ 24  and were randomly allocated into 1 of the following 4 treatments: (1) control/basal diet, (2) low OTM (basal diet + 100 mg/bird/day OTM powder in water), (3) medium OTM (basal diet + 1 g/bird/day OTM powder in water), and (4) high OTM (basal diet + 2 g/bird/day OTM powder in water). The body weight gain and feed conversion efficiency were greater (P < 0.05) in ostriches receiving medium-OTM treatment compared to control during the overall phase of the experiment. Although whole carcass yield, the yield of parts, and the relative weights of internal organs were not affected by experimental treatments, supplementation of higher amounts of OTM (medium- and high-OTM) resulted in a decrease (P < 0.05) in the subcutaneous and abdominal fat contents. Medium- and high-OTM treatments increased (P < 0.05) the villus height/crypt depth ratio in the jejunum and ileum compared with control and low-OTM treatments. Moreover, ostriches receiving the medium-OTM had also higher total tract apparent digestibility of  (P = 0.048), ether extract (P = 0.050), crude fiber (P = 0.063), and higher AMEn (P = 0.094) than the control group. Overall, supplementation of OTM at the level of 1 g/bird/day to the drinking water of growing ostriches fed diets containing the recommended levels of inorganic trace minerals could beneficially affect productive performance, nutrient digestibility, and intestinal morphology.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523295>Nutritional Status as a Risk Factor in COPD.</a></h2><p>The third leading cause of death, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is gaining more and more attention in the literature and clinical practice. Precision medicine, already recognised as a right approach for COPD, requests a special attention to be allocated for nutritional status. Free fat mass index FFMI and visceral fat VFA area measurements should be added to body mass index (BMI) in order to have a complete perspective of the nutritional status and disease prognosis. Prospective medical nutrition therapy should consider caloric intake for achieving a BMI of 20-24 kg/, nutritionally dense, small and frequent meals, choosing the moment for the most important meal when the level of  is the highest for the patient. A resting period before mealtime is adviced. Obesity paradox in COPD means a lower mortality associated with BMI between 25 and 32. This benefit is mainly related to higher muscular mass, as it has been described by some authors. The main objective in nutritional intervention will be to maintain muscular mass, adviced protein intake should be 1.2 g/kg body weight/day, higher vs general population. In the future, nutritional status evaluation should be included in pulmonary rehabilitation process, and a multidisciplinary team is expected to cooperate in order to achieve best pulmonary results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839019>Plasmonic photocatalysis applied to solar fuels.</a></h2><p>The induction of chemical processes by plasmonic systems is a rapidly growing field with potentially many strategic applications. One of them is the transformation of solar  into chemical fuel by the association of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (M NPs) and a semi-conductor (SC). When the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the SC absorption do not match, one limitation of these systems is the efficiency of hot electron transfer from M NPs to SC through the Schottky barrier formed at the M NP/SC interfaces. Here we show that high surface area 1 wt% Au/TiO2-UV100, prepared by adsorption of a NaBH4-protected 3 nm gold sol, readily catalyzes the photoreduction of carbon dioxide with water into methane under both solar and visible-only irradiation with a CH4vs. H2 selectivity of 63%. Tuning Au NP size and titania surface area, in particular via thermal treatments, highlights the key role of the metal dispersion and of the accessible Au-TiO2 perimeter interface on the direct SC-based solar process. The impact of Au NP density in turn provides evidence for the dual role of gold as co-catalyst and recombination sites for charge carriers. It is shown that the plasmon-induced process contributes up to 20% of the solar activity. The plasmon-based contribution is enhanced by a large Au NP size and a high degree of crystallinity of the SC support. By minimizing surface hydroxylation while retaining a relatively high surface area of 120  g-1, pre-calcining TiO2-UV100 at 450 °C leads to an optimum monometallic system in terms of activity and selectivity under both solar and visible irradiation. A state-of-the-art methane selectivity of 100% is achieved in the hot electron process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30990506>Heteronuclear d-d and d-f Ru(ii)/M complexes [M = Gd(iii), Yb(iii), Nd(iii), Zn(ii) or Mn(ii)] of ligands combining phenanthroline and aminocarboxylate binding sites: combined relaxivity, cell imaging and photophysical studies.</a></h2><p>A ligand skeleton combining a 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) binding site and one or two heptadentate N3O4 aminocarboxylate binding sites, connected via alkyne spacers to the phen C3 or C3/C8 positions, has been used to prepare a range of heteronuclear Ru·M and Ru· complexes which have been evaluated for their cell imaging, relaxivity, and photophysical properties. In all cases the phen unit is bound to a {Ru(bipy)2}2+ unit to give a phosphorescent {Ru(bipy)2(phen)}2+ luminophore, and the pendant aminocarboxylate sites are occupied by a secondary metal ion M which is either a lanthanide [Gd(iii), Nd(iii), Yb(iii)] or another d-block ion [Zn(ii), Mn(ii)]. When M = Gd(iii) or Mn(ii) these ions provide the complexes with a high relaxivity for water; in the case of Ru·Gd and Ru·Gd2 the combination of high water relaxivity and 3MLCT phosphorescence from the Ru(ii) unit provides the possibility of two different types of imaging modality in a single molecular probe. In the case of Ru·Mn and Ru·Mn2 the Ru(ii)-based phosphorescence is substantially reduced compared to the control complexes Ru·Zn and Ru·Zn2 due to the quenching effect of the Mn(ii) centres. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy studies on Ru·Mn (and Ru·Zn as a non-quenched control) reveal the occurrence of fast (<1 ns) PET in Ru·Mn, from the Mn(ii) ion to the Ru(ii)-based 3MLCT state, i.e. MnII-(phen˙-)-RuIII → MnIII-(phen˙-)-RuII; the resulting MnIII-(phen˙-) state decays with τ ≈ 5 ns and is non-luminescent. This occurs in conformers when an ET pathway is facilitated by a planar, conjugated bridging ligand conformation connecting the two units across the alkyne bridge but does not occur in conformers where the two units are electronically decoupled by a twisted conformation of the bridging ligand. Computational studies (DFT) on Ru·Mn confirmed both the occurrence of the PET quenching pathway and its dependence on molecular conformation. In the complexes Ru·Ln and Ru·Ln2 (Ln = Nd, Yb), sensitised near-infrared luminescence from Nd(iii) or Yb(iii) is observed following photoinduced -transfer from the Ru(ii) core, with Ru → Nd -transfer being faster than Ru → Yb -transfer due to the higher density of -accepting states on Nd(iii).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607317>Sulfonamide derivatives as  inhibitors: in silico approach.</a></h2><p>Both DHPS (dihydropteroate synthase) and DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) play important physiological roles in the survivability of  (MTB). Sulfonamides are the potent drugs to monitor growth and proliferation of MTBs by inhibiting the activity of DHPS and DHFR which could explain the mechanism of action of these molecules. In this work, 102 heterocyclic sulfonamides (HSF) have been screened by discovery studio molecular docking programme to search the best suitable molecule for the treatment of MTBs. Lipinski's rule of five protocols is followed to screen drug likeness of these molecules and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) filtration has been used to value their toxicity. Only fourteen molecules are found to obey the Lipinski's rule and able to cross the ADMET filter. A small difference between HOMO and LUMO  signifies the electronic excitation  which is essential to calculate molecular reactivity and stability of the best docked compound and easy activation of drug in the protein environment.

Substantial industrial and academic effort has been expended to develop more cost-effective adsorbent- or membrane-based approaches to purify commodity chemicals such as 1,3-butadiene, isobutene, and 1-butene, but the very similar physical properties of these C hydrocarbons make this a challenging task. Here, we examine the adsorption behavior of 1-butene, -2-butene, and -2-butene in the metal-organic frameworks M(dobdc) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; dobdc = 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) and M(-dobdc) (-dobdc = 4,6-dioxidobenzene-1,3-dicarboxylate), which all contain a high density of coordinatively unsaturated M sites. We find that both Co(-dobdc) and Ni(-dobdc) are able to separate 1-butene from the 2-butene isomers, a critical industrial process that relies largely on energetically demanding cryogenic distillation. The origin of 1-butene selectivity is traced to the high charge density retained by the M metal centers exposed within the M(-dobdc) structures, which results in a reversal of the -2-butene selectivity typically observed at framework open metal sites. Selectivity for 1-butene adsorption under multicomponent conditions is demonstrated for Ni(-dobdc) in both the gaseous and the liquid phases via breakthrough and batch adsorption experiments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31025204>Designing of non-fullerene 3D star-shaped acceptors for organic solar cells.</a></h2><p>The design and fabrication of solar cells have recently witnessed the exploration of non-fullerene-based acceptor molecules for higher efficiency.

For weeks 13-26 participants chose to continue with 1-3 VLED d/wk or follow a prescriptive eating plan. Primary outcomes were feasibility and change in BMI expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile (BMI %95th percentile) at 12 wk. Secondary outcomes were diet acceptability, body composition, cardiometabolic risk, vascular structure and function, quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory), and eating behaviors [Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ-C)]. Linear mixed models were used to assess change in outcome measures.Of 45 adolescents invited to participate, 30 adolescents (mean ± SD age: 14.5 ± 1.4 y, female n = 25) with a median BMI of 34.9 (range: 27.7-52.4) were recruited. At 12 wk, 23 participants chose to continue with the VLED 2-3 d/wk, and 21 completed the study, indicating the feasibility of IER. Consistent with intention-to-treat analysis, BMI %95th percentile was reduced at 12 wk (difference in estimated marginal means ± SEMs: -5.6 ± 1.1, P < 0.001) and 26 wk (-5.1 ± 1.9, P = 0.013) compared with baseline. Plasma triglycerides were reduced at 26 wk from baseline (-0.33 ± 0.12 mmol/L, P = 0.03). Body fat percentage reduced between 12 and 26 wk (-1.57% ± 0.76%, P = 0.05).

At the pathway level, classically (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]-polarized, M1) and alternatively (interleukin [IL]-4-polarized, ) polarized macrophages were C-labeled with surprising concordance. Total pools of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an intermediate in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, were equally abundant in LPS- and IL-4-polarized macrophages. Informatic scrutiny of C-isotopologues revealed that LPS-polarized macrophages leverage the pentose phosphate pathway to generate UDP-GlcNAc, whereas IL-4-polarized macrophages rely on intact glucose and mitochondrial metabolism of glucose carbon. Labeling from [C]glucose is competed by unlabeled fatty acids and acetoacetate, underscoring the broad roles for substrate metabolism beyond  conversion. Finally, the LPS-polarized macrophage metabolite itaconate is imported into IL-4-polarized macrophages, in which it reprograms [C]glucose metabolism. Thus, use of fully unsupervised isotope tracing metabolomics in macrophages reveals polarization-state-specific metabolic pathway connectivity, substrate competition, and metabolite allocation among cellular compartments.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Pre- and post-treatment levels in self-reported daily , sleep quality, skin tone/hair thickness/nail growth, cognitive clarity, menstrual pattern, cervical mucus/vaginal lubrication, libido, sexual activity, ability to achieve orgasm, and overall sexual experience were measured.Mean±SD age and baseline BMI among patients were 45.5±6yrs and 25±5.1kg/, respectively. Average weight loss after ovarian PRP was 1kg (p=0.056). After ovarian PRP, superior nail growth, skin tone, and hair thickness was observed by 46.3% of patients [95%CI=35%,57.8%]; the same ratio experienced increased "clarity of thinking" following the procedure. Irregular or absent menses affected 56.3% of patients at enrollment, and menses returned or cyclicity improved in 24.4% after treatment [95%CI=12.9%,39.5%]. Increased post-treatment vaginal lubrication/cervical mucus production was reported by 51.3% of women [95%CI=39.8%, 62.6%] accompanied by increased libido in 55% [95%CI=43.5%,66.2%]. More frequent sexual activity after ovarian PRP was noted from 46.3% of subjects [95%CI=35%, 57.8%] coinciding with a 45% improvement in overall sexual experience before vs. after ovarian PRP [95%CI=33.9%, 56.5%].This investigation is the first to document responses across neurobehavioral and metabolic parameters after ovarian PRP. Injection of PRP-derived growth factors directly into ovarian tissue seems to enable a local signaling milieu favoring development of hormonally active ovarian elements, thus "re-potentiating" low or absent reserve.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30555987>Mechanism of Tetramer Dissociation, Unfolding, and Oligomer Assembly of  -1 Transcription Antiterminators.</a></h2><p>Among Mononegavirales, the Pneumovirus family stands out by its RNA polymerase processivity that relies on a transcription antiterminator, the -1 protein, which also plays a key role in viral particle assembly. Biophysical and structural evidence shows that this RNA-binding tetramer is strongly modulated by a CCCH Zn binding motif. We show that while the global dissociation/unfolding free  is 10 kcal mol, more stable for the respiratory syncytial virus -1, the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) counterpart shows a 7 kcal mol higher intersubunit affinity. Removal of Zn from both homologues leads to an apo-monomer of identical secondary structure that further undergoes a slow irreversible oligomerization. Mutation of the histidine residue of the Zn motif to cysteine or alanine leads directly to large oligomers, strongly suggesting that metal coordination has an exquisite precision for modulating the quaternary arrangement. Zn removal is very slow and requires subdenaturing concentrations of guanidine chloride, suggesting a likely local folding  barrier. Exploring a broad combination of denaturant and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid conditions, we showed that the metapneumovirus protein has to overcome a higher  barrier to trigger Zn removal-driven dissociation, in concordance with a slower dissociation kinetics. In silico modeling of open and close conformations for both -1 tetramers together with interaction  calculations reveals that the gradual opening of protomers decreases the number of intersubunit contacts. Half of the interaction  holding each protomer in the tetramer comes from the CCCH motif, while HMPV--1 harbors additional contacts between the CCCH motif of one subunit and the core domain of a protomer located in trans, allowing the rationalization of the experimental data obtained. Overall, the evidence points at a key role of the CCCH motif in switching between structural and consequently functional alternatives of the -1 protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026294>Hydration and strength development in blended cement with ultrafine granulated copper slag.</a></h2><p>This study aims at evaluating the effect of ultrafine granulated copper slag (UGCS) on hydration development of blended cement and mechanical properties of mortars. The UGCS with the median particle size of 4.78 μm and BET surface area of 1.31 /g was used as a cement replacement to prepare blended cements. Hydration heat emission of blended cement and mechanical performance of mortars were investigated by using isothermal calorimetry and strength tests, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied to the analysis of pozzolanic reaction and hydration products. The results illustrate that UGCS has influence on the hydration heat evolution of blended cement due to its filler effect and pozzolanic reaction. The cumulative hydration heat of blended cement is reduced by partial cement replacement with UGCS. The test mortar prepared by using blended cements with 30 wt. % UGCS shows a retardation of strength development with a low value at early ages (7 days) and a rapid growth at later ages (28 days). The 90-day compressive strength of test mortar is 45.0 MPa close to that of the control mortar (49.5 MPa). The obtained results from XRD and TGA analysis exhibit an increase in calcium hydroxide (CH) consumption and calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) formation in blended cement pastes with curing time. The cement replacement with UGCS induces changes in microstructure of blended cement paste and chemical composition of hydration products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959473>Utilising a milk-based meal replacement programme in a bariatric patient with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>A 45-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (HbA1c 87 mmol/mol) despite 100 units of insulin per day and severe obesity (BMI 40.2 kg/) was referred for bariatric intervention. He declined bariatric surgery or GLP1 agonist therapy. Initially, his glycaemic control improved with dietary modification and better adherence to insulin therapy, but he gained weight. We started a low- liquid diet, with 2.2 L of semi-skimmed milk (equivalent to 1012 kcal) per day for 8 weeks (along with micronutrient, salt and fibre supplementation) followed by 16 weeks of phased reintroduction of a normal diet. His insulin was stopped within a week of starting this programme, and over 6 months, he lost 20.6 kg and his HbA1c normalised. However, 1 year later, despite further weight loss, his HbA1c deteriorated dramatically, requiring introduction of linagliptin and canagliflozin, with good response. Five years after initial presentation, his BMI remains elevated but improved at 35.5 kg/ and his glycaemic control is excellent with a HbA1c of 50 mmol/mol and he is off insulin therapy. Whether semi-skimmed milk is a safe, effective substrate for carefully selected patients with severe obesity complicated by T2DM remains to be determined. Such patients would need frequent monitoring by an experienced multidisciplinary team. Learning points: Meal replacement programmes are an emerging therapeutic strategy to allow severely obese type 2 diabetes patients to achieve clinically impactful weight loss. Using semi-skimmed milk as a meal replacement substrate might be less costly than commercially available programmes, but is likely to require intensive multidisciplinary bariatric clinical follow-up. For severely obese adults with poor diabetes control who decline bariatric surgery or GLP1 agonist therapy, a milk-based meal replacement programme may be an option. Milk-based meal replacement in patients with insulin requiring type 2 diabetes causes rapid and profound reductions in insulin requirements, so rigorous monitoring of glucose levels by patients and their clinicians is necessary. In carefully selected and adequately monitored patients, the response to oral antidiabetic medications may help to differentiate between absolute and relative insulin deficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525326>Correlation between human milk composition and maternal nutritional status</a></h2><p>Human milk is the optimal nutrition for newborns and infants during the first period of their life – from birth to 6-th month.

During a clinic visit, the sleep habits of participants were recorded via a sleep history questionnaire, and BMI and WC measurements were also recorded. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the associations among sleep duration, sleep quality, general obesity (measured by BMI), and abdominal obesity (measured by WC).The authors studied participants who provided data for the variables of interest (N=3778; 1363 men and 2415 women). Of all participants, 3317 (87.8%) were overweight, and 2149 (56.9%) were obese. The mean (SD) BMI was 32.1 (7.2) kg/, and the mean (SD) WC was 103.3 (16.0) cm. Mean sleep duration was 6.3 (1.4) hours for men and 6.4 (1.5) hours for women. Among the men, a significant negative relationship was found between sleep duration and body composition: longer sleep was associated with lower BMI levels but negatively associated with WC in men (β=-1.06; P<.01)]. Sleep quality was positively associated with WC in men (β=1.20; P<.01) and women (β=0.61; P<.05).This study's findings highlight the high rate of overweight and obesity among participants in the Jackson Heart Study. About one-fourth of the participants described themselves as enjoying ideal health. In men, longer sleep duration was associated with lower BMI levels and lower WC; in both men and women, good sleep quality was associated with lower WC. However, more research is needed to examine sleep and body composition as risk factors for disease development in African Americans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598203>Physicochemical parameters - hydration performance relationship of the new endodontic cement MTA Repair HP.</a></h2><p>To characterize the chemical composition and textural parameters of the MTA Repair HP precursor powder and their influence to hydration performance.Un-hydrated precursor material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), laser diffraction (LD), N2 physisorption and field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM).

Although the risk of fractures is higher in underweight people than in overweight people, the accumulation of body fat (especially abdominal fat) can increase the risk of bone loss. This study aimed to evaluate the association between body fat percentage and BMD in normal-weight middle-aged Koreans.This study included 1,992 adults (mean age, 48.7 years; 52.9% women). BMD and body fat were measured using dual- X-ray absorptiometry. Multiple linear regression analyses and analysis of covariance were used to assess the association between BMD and body fat. Body fat percentage was grouped by cut-off values. The cut-off values were 20.6% and 25.7% for men with a body mass index of 18.5-22.9 kg/ , while the cut-off values were 33.4% and 36% for women.Body fat percentage tended to be negatively associated with BMD. Increased body fat percentage was associated with reduced BMD in normal-weight middle-aged adults. The effects of body fat percentage on BMD in normal-weight individuals were more pronounced in men than in women.There was a negative correlation between BMD and body fat percentage in middle-aged Korean men and women with normal body weight. This association was stronger in men than in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175183>The L46P mutant confers a novel allosteric mechanism of resistance toward the influenza A virus  S31N proton channel blockers.</a></h2><p>The Food and Drug Administration-approved influenza A antiviral amantadine inhibits the wild-type (WT) AM2 channel but not the S31N mutant predominantly found in circulating strains. In this study, serial viral passages were applied to select resistance against a newly developed isoxazole-conjugated adamantane inhibitor that targets the AM2 S31N channel. This led to the identification of the novel drug-resistant mutation L46P located outside the drug-binding site, which suggests an allosteric resistance mechanism. Intriguingly, when the L46P mutant was introduced to AM2 WT, the channel remained sensitive toward amantadine inhibition. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free  molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations were performed on WT and mutant channels. It was found that the L46P mutation caused a conformational change in the N terminus of transmembrane residues 22-31 that ultimately broadened the drug-binding site of AM2 S31N inhibitor , which spans residues 26-34, but not of AM2 WT inhibitor amantadine, which spans residues 31-34. The MM-GBSA calculations showed stronger binding stability for  in complex with AM2 S31N compared with  in complex with AM2 S31N/L46P, and equal binding free energies of amantadine in complex with AM2 WT and AM2 L46P. Overall, these results demonstrate a unique allosteric resistance mechanism toward AM2 S31N channel blockers, and the L46P mutant represents the first experimentally confirmed drug-resistant AM2 mutant that is located outside of the pore where drug binds. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: AM2 S31N is a high-profile antiviral drug target, as more than 95% of currently circulating influenza A viruses carry this mutation. Understanding the mechanism of drug resistance is critical in designing the next generation of AM2 S31N channel blockers. Using a previously developed AM2 S31N channel blocker as a chemical probe, this study was the first to identify a novel resistant mutant, L46P. The L46P mutant is located outside of the drug-binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that L46P causes a dilation of drug-binding site between residues 22 and 31, which affects the binding of AM2 S31N channel blockers, but not the AM2 WT inhibitor amantadine.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172175>Effect of different doses of supervised exercise on food intake, metabolism, and non-exercise physical activity: The E-MECHANIC randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Exercise is recommended for weight management, yet exercise produces less weight loss than expected, which is called weight compensation. The mechanisms for weight compensation are unclear.The aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms responsible for compensation.In a randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic research center, adults (n = 198) with overweight or obesity were randomized for 24 wk to a no-exercise control group or 1 of 2 supervised exercise groups: 8 kcal/kg of body weight/wk (KKW) or 20 KKW. Outcome assessment occurred at weeks 0 and 24.  intake, activity, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were measured with doubly labeled water (DLW; with and without adjustments for change in RMR), armband accelerometers, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Appetite and compensatory health beliefs were measured by self-report.A per-protocol analysis included 171 participants (72.5% women; mean ± SD baseline body mass index: 31.5 ± 4.7 kg/). Significant (P < 0.01) compensation occurred in the 8 KKW (mean: 1.5 kg; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.2 kg) and 20 KKW (mean: 2.7 kg; 95% CI: 2.0, 3.5 kg) groups, and compensation differed significantly between the exercise groups (P = 0.01).  intake by adjusted DLW increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the 8 KKW (mean: 90.7 kcal/d; 95% CI: 35.1, 146.4 kcal/d) and 20 KKW (mean: 123.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: 64.5, 182.7 kcal/d) groups compared with control (mean: -2.3 kcal/d; 95% CI: -58.0, 53.5 kcal/d). Results were similar without DLW adjustment. RMR and physical activity (excluding structured exercise) did not differentially change among the 3 groups. Participants with higher compared with lower compensation reported increased appetite ratings and beliefs that healthy behaviors can compensate for unhealthy behaviors. Furthermore, they increased craving for sweet foods, increased sleep disturbance, and had worsening bodily pain.Compensation resulted from increased  intake and concomitant increases in appetite, which can be treated with dietary or pharmacological interventions.

IF groups ate breakfast prior to fasting for 24-h on 3 non-consecutive days/week. Weight, body composition, serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), M1- and -macrophage markers by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were measured following a 12-h overnight fast (fed day, all groups) and a 24-h fast (IF groups only).IF70 resulted in greater weight and fat losses and reductions in serum NEFA versus DR70 and IF100 (P < 0.05) after fed days. Markers of inflammation in serum (TNFα, IL6 and IL10), subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (CD68, CD40 and CD163) were unchanged by DR or IF after fed days. After fasting, NEFA, M1-macrophages (CD40) in adipose tissue, and -macrophages (CD163) in muscle were increased in IF70 and IF100 (all P < 0.05) and the changes in NEFA and mRNA of pan-macrophage marker CD68 in adipose tissue were positively correlated (r = 0.56, P = 0.002).Unlike caloric restriction, IF transiently elevated markers of macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, possibly in response to marked increases in adipose tissue lipolysis.Crown Copyright © 2019.

Positive  balance, e.g. surplus  intake over expenditure, is at the core for developing metabolic syndrome and T2D. Currently available glycemic control drugs come to the market based on their 1-2 years risk-benefit profiles, but most of them do not correct positive  balance and lose efficacy in the long-term. This denouement is destined by a positive  balance of T2D. There is continuous endeavor/investment in new drugs for T2D. In this review, we compared the effects of commonly used oral hypoglycemic agents on  balance and discussed several novel therapeutic targets/approaches for T2D that could potentially correct positive  balance: changing the composition of intestinal host-microbiota to alleviate excess caloric consumption, controlling chylomicron uptake into intestinal lacteals to reduce excessive caloric intake, and activating pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) to ameliorate glucose metabolism and increase  expenditure. We further reviewed how nicotine affects body weight and ameliorates positive  balance, and ways to encourage people to adopt a more healthy lifestyle by exercising more and/or decreasing caloric intake. These potential targets/approaches may hopefully correct positive  balance, delay disease progression, reverse some pathophysiological changes, and eventually prevent and/or cure the disease. Drug development strategies applying new insights into T2D process and therapeutic index to correct positive  balance need to be seriously considered.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217348>Pyruvate kinase  is requisite for Th1 and Th17 differentiation.</a></h2><p>Th1 and Th17 are important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and they depend on glycolysis as a source of . T cell antigen receptor signaling phosphorylates a serine/threonine kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4), and promotes glycolysis. Based on these findings we hypothesized that CaMK4 promotes glycolysis. Camk4-deficient CD4+ T cells and cells treated with a CaMK4 inhibitor had less glycolysis compared with their counterparts. Pull-down of CaMK4 and mass spectrometry identified pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme (PKM), the final rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, as a binding partner. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting showed that CaMK4 interacts directly with PKM2. Camk4-deficient CD4+ T cells displayed decreased pyruvate kinase activity. Silencing or pharmacological inhibition of PKM2 reduced glycolysis and in vitro differentiation to Th1 and Th17 cells, while PKM2 overexpression restored Th17 cell differentiation. Treatment with a PKM2 inhibitor ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and CD4+ T cells treated with PKM2 inhibitor or Pkm2-shRNA caused limited disease activity in an adoptive cell transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our data demonstrate that CaMK4 binds to PKM2 and promotes its activity, which is requisite for Th1 and Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

Although DLW may reveal true physiological differences undetected by respiratory chambers, an alternative possibility is that the expenditure differences resulted from failure to correctly estimate the respiratory quotient (RQ) used in the DLW calculations.To examine  expenditure differences between isocaloric diets varying widely in carbohydrate and to quantitatively compare DLW data with respiratory chamber and body composition measurements within an  balance framework.DLW measurements were obtained during the final 2 wk of month-long baseline (BD; 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein) and isocaloric ketogenic diets (KD; 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat, 15% protein) in 17 men with a BMI of 25-35 kg/. Subjects resided 2 d/wk in respiratory chambers to measure  expenditure (EEchamber). DLW expenditure was calculated using chamber-determined RQ either unadjusted (EEDLW) or adjusted (EEDLWΔRQ) for net  imbalance using diet-specific coefficients. Accelerometers measured physical activity. Body composition changes were measured by dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) which were combined with  intake measurements to calculate  expenditure by balance (EEbal).After transitioning from BD to KD, neither EEchamber nor EEbal were significantly changed (∆EEchamber = 24 ± 30 kcal/d; P = 0.43 and ∆EEbal = -141 ± 118 kcal/d; P = 0.25). Similarly, physical activity (-5.1 ± 4.8%; P = 0.3) and exercise efficiency (-1.6 ± 2.4%; P = 0.52) were not significantly changed. However, EEDLW was 209 ± 83 kcal/d higher during the KD (P = 0.023) but was not significantly increased when adjusted for  balance (EEDLWΔRQ = 139 ± 89 kcal/d; P = 0.14). After removing 2 outliers whose EEDLW were incompatible with other data, EEDLW was marginally increased during the KD by 126 ± 62 kcal/d (P = 0.063) and EEDLW∆RQ was only 46 ± 65 kcal/d higher (P = 0.49).DLW calculations failing to account for diet-specific  imbalance effects on RQ erroneously suggest that low-carbohydrate diets substantially increase  expenditure.

Prevalence estimates of malnutrition among Israeli HD patients have not been reported.To survey nutrition intake in Israeli HD patients; estimate malnutrition risk prevalence; identify risk factors, and characterize malnutrition risk in HD patients.A representative sample of 378 Israeli HD patients treated in hospital HD centers throughout the country were surveyed. Using the 24-h recall method, dietary intake was estimated and the chronologically corresponding biochemistry, anthropometric, and hemodynamic measures were recorded. Four categories of malnutrition risk were defined: "minimal": body mass index (BMI) > 23 kg/ and serum albumin > 3.8 g/dL; "mild": BMI < 23 kg/ and albumin > 3.8 g/dL; "moderate": BMI > 23 kg/ and albumin < 3.8 g/dL; "severe": BMI < 23 k/ and serum albumin < 3.8 g/dL.Elevated malnutrition risk was identified in 175 (46.3%) study participants, who were more likely to require feeding assistance, have major comorbidities, reduced hemoglobin, and elevated C-reactive protein.

The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term impact of  turnover (ET) on fat balance during zero  balance, caloric restriction and overfeeding. In a randomized crossover study, 9 healthy men (BMI: 23.0 ±2.1 kg/, 26.6 ±3.5 y) passed 3x3 days in a metabolic chamber: 3 levels of ET (low, medium and high; physical activity level = 1.3-1.4, 1.5-1.6 and 1.7-1.8) were performed at zero  balance (EB), caloric restriction (CR), and overfeeding (OF) (100%, 75%, 125% of individual  requirement). Different levels of ET were obtained by walking (4 km/h) on a treadmill (0, 165, 330 min). 24-h macronutrient oxidation and relative macronutrient balance (oxidation relative to intake) were calculated and free fatty acids, 24-h insulin and catecholamine secretion were analyzed as determinants of fat oxidation. During EB and OF, 24-h fat oxidation increased with higher ET. This resulted in a higher relative fat balance at medium ET (EB: +17%, OF: +14%) and high ET (EB: +23%, OF: +17%) compared to low ET (all p<0.05). In contrast, CR led to a stimulation of 24-h fat oxidation irrespective of ET (no differences in relative fat balance between ET levels, p>0.05). In conclusion, under highly controlled conditions a higher  turnover improved relative fat balance in young healthy men during overfeeding and  balance compared to a sedentary state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391918>PKM2, function and expression and regulation.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase (PK), as one of the key enzymes for glycolysis, can encode four different subtypes from two groups of genes, although the  subtype PKM2 is expressed mainly during embryonic development in normal humans, and is closely related to tissue repair and regeneration, with the deepening of research, the role of PKM2 in tumor tissue has received increasing attention.

The purpose of this longitudinal study was to identify sex-specific changes in dietary intake and diet quality, and associated changes in body weight and composition during first-year university.Three-hundred and one students (n = 229 females) completed food frequency questionnaires, and had their body weight, body composition, waist and hip circumference measured at the beginning and end of first-year university. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with covariate adjustments were used with variables for sex (between group) and time (within group) to assess these changes.Students gained body weight and fat during the year (p<0.001). Body mass Index (BMI) also significantly increased (p = 0.032). Males gained more weight (Male:3.8 kg; Female:1.8 kg), fat mass (Male:2.7 kg; Female:1.5 kg), lean mass (Male:1.1 kg; Female:0.3 kg) and BMI (Male:1.2 kg/; Female:0.7 kg/; p≤0.001 for interactions), and had greater increases in waist circumference (Male:2.7 cm; Female:1.1 cm) and waist:hip ratio (Male:0.02; Female:0.004; p<0.05 for interactions) than females.  intake remained the same over the year in both sexes, accompanied by an increase in alcohol (ethanol) in both sexes but more so in males than females (p = 0.011 interaction). Diet quality decreased, characterized by a reduced intake of healthy foods/beverages (p<0.05) in both sexes such as yogurt, cheese, oatmeal, breads, rice, pasta, vegetables, green salad, fruits, steak, fish, nuts and milk, and an increased consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages (p<0.05) such as donuts/cakes, fried chicken, beer and liquor. Significant interactions between sexes indicated that males displayed a more adverse and lower quality eating pattern which included greater intakes of donuts/cakes, fried chicken, beer and liquor, as well as decreased intakes of eggs and vegetables compared to females. Lastly, some dietary intake changes significantly correlated with fat mass and waist circumference change indicating that poor dietary choices were associated with increased adiposity.Our study demonstrated that during first-year university, both male and female students undergo unfavorable changes in nutrition and body weight/composition that significantly differ between sexes, with males showing more adverse changes.

In this study, we focused on an osmotic engine model, which is a migration mechanism, and applied it as a negative chemotaxis mechanism to induce liposome displacement. First, we confirmed the osmotic flow across the lipid bilayer and calculated the osmotic flow velocity to be 8.5 fL min-1 μm-2 when a salt concentration difference was applied to the lipid bilayer. Next, we designed and fabricated a microchannel that can trap a giant liposome and apply a salt concentration difference to the front and rear of the liposome. Then, we demonstrated the movement of the liposome by flowing it to the microchannel. The liposome successfully moved in the direction of the lower ion concentration at a speed of 0.6 μm min-1 owing to the osmotic pressure difference. Finally, we visualized the inner flow in the liposome by encapsulating microbeads in the liposome and observed the movement of the microbeads to verify that an osmotic flow was generated on the liposome. As a result, we observed the circulation of the microbeads in the liposome when the concentration difference was applied to the front and rear of the liposome, suggesting that the movement of the liposome was driven by the osmotic flow generated by the osmotic pressure difference. These results indicate that the osmotic-pressure-based migration mechanism has the potential to be utilized as the actuator of molecular robots.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867547>TiO decorated functionalized halloysite nanotubes (TiO@HNTs) and photocatalytic PVC membranes synthesis, characterization and its application in water treatment.</a></h2><p>In this study photocatalyst, TiO@HNTs were prepared by  synthesizing TiO nanoparticles in situ on the  functionalized halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) surface.

In obesity, BIA results were improved: valuecorrected = -valueuncorrected - a(BMI - 30 kg/), a = 0.256 for FFM and a = 0.298 for SMM. SMM accounts for 45% of FFM in women and 49% in men.In obesity, the use of FFM is limited by a systematic error of reference methods. In addition, SMM accounts for about 50% of FFM only.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare BMD and T-scores by DXA and QCT and to evaluate whether these two osteoporosis assessment modalities yield different T-score values in postmenopausal females with obesity and central obesity.This cross-sectional study enrolled 44 postmenopausal females, referred for osteoporosis screening. Anthropometric indices (BMI-body mass index, WC-waist circumference and ICO-index of central obesity) were measured and females underwent assessment of bone mineral density by DXA and QCT.Lumbar spine (LS) T-score values were significantly lower by DXA compared to qCT in females with BMI >25 kg/, (-1.9±1.5 vs. -2.3±1.2; p=0.039), in females with WC>88 cm(-1.9±1.5 vs. -2.4±1.2; p=0.008) and in females with ICO>0.5(-1.96±1.4 vs. -2.5±1.2; p=0.004). However, in normal weight females and in those without central obesity, LS T-scores by DXA were not different than qCT. DXA at lumbar spine and proximal femur revealed osteoporosis in 47.7% and 11.4% respectively, while QCT detected osteoporosis in 61.4% of females (p<0.001). Measures of central obesity; ICO and WC were not associated with QCT bone mineral density (BMD) (r=0.14 and r=0.21, respectively), but were positively associated both with DXALS BMD (r=0.29 and r=0.31; p<0.05) and DXA proximal femur BMD (r=0.41 and r=0.44; p<0.01).Our results suggest that obesity is associated with lower T-scores by DXA compared to QCT. Caution is needed when assessing osteoporosis status in obese postmenopausal females. However, further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm the findings.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103421>Conformational Complexity and Dynamics in a Muscarinic Receptor Revealed by NMR Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>The  muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) is a prototypical GPCR that plays important roles in regulating heart rate and CNS functions. Crystal structures provide snapshots of the M2R in inactive and active states, but the allosteric link between the ligand binding pocket and cytoplasmic surface remains poorly understood. Here we used solution NMR to examine the structure and dynamics of the M2R labeled with CH-ε-methionine upon binding to various orthosteric and allosteric ligands having a range of efficacy for both G protein activation and arrestin recruitment. We observed ligand-specific changes in the NMR spectra of CH-ε-methionine probes in the M2R extracellular domain, transmembrane core, and cytoplasmic surface, allowing us to correlate ligand structure with changes in receptor structure and dynamics. We show that the M2R has a complex  landscape in which ligands with different efficacy profiles stabilize distinct receptor conformations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that antibiotics cause mammalian mitochondrial damage while causing bacterial lethality. Mitochondrial toxicity of azithromycin in human mammary epithelia MCF-12A and fibroblasts were tested by fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. Gene expression and DNA damage were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. We found azithromycin suppressed the mitochondrial membrane potential gradient of MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Ultrastructure exams showed that the antibiotic caused vacuolated and swollen mitochondria with disrupted cristae in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts compared to the morphology of mitochondria in the cells without antibiotic treatment. Fluorescent microscopy also showed azithromycin-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide, after 3 h of culture. The DNA oxidative damage product, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, significantly increased in the media after MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts were cultured in the media containing azithromycin for 24 h. Azithromycin upregulated gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (), glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase 2 (), phosphofructokinase 1 (), pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  (), and glucose transporters in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Lactate production also increased in the culture media. After treatment with azithromycin, healthy MCF-12A and fibroblast cells increased aerobic glycolysis-the "Warburg Effect"-to generate . In summary, azithromycin caused mitochondrial toxicity, ROS overproduction, DNA oxidative damage, upregulation of the  gene, and aerobic glycolysis in healthy mammalian cells. Over-usage of antibiotics could contribute to tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration and aggravate existing mitochondria-associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665502>Proinflammatory Diet Increases Circulating Inflammatory Biomarkers and Falls Risk in Community-Dwelling Older Men.</a></h2><p>The relations between diet, chronic inflammation, and musculoskeletal health are unclear, especially among older men.This study aimed to determine associations of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) with inflammatory biomarkers, musculoskeletal health, and falls risk in community-dwelling older men.The cross-sectional analysis included 794 community-dwelling men, mean age 81.1 ± 4.5 y, who participated in the 5-y follow-up of the Concord Health and Aging in Men Project. Of these, 616 were seen again 3 y later for the longitudinal analysis. -adjusted DII (E-DII) was calculated from a validated diet history questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men. The association between incident falls and E-DII was partly mediated by concentrations of IL-7.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532192>Repolarization of  to M1 Macrophages Triggered by Lactate Oxidase Released from Methylcellulose Hydrogel.</a></h2><p>Deregulated proliferation of tumors is generally associated with altered  metabolism. A high rate of anaerobic glycolysis in solid tumors contributes to an acidification of pH to ∼6.7-7.2 in the tumor microenvironment and lactate accumulation. Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment can be educated by tumor cells. Tumor-derived lactate induces the polarization of  macrophages and promotes tumor invasion and metastasis. However, a particular challenge is to sustain lactate depletion.

The fetal liver, perfused by the nutrient-rich and well-oxygenated blood coming directly from the placenta, is assumed to play a central role in these processes. Earlier studies have linked fetal liver blood flow with maternal nutritional status and response to the maternal oral glucose tolerance test. Our aim was to explore the effect of a regular maternal meal on fetal liver blood flow at two timepoints during the third trimester, representing the start and towards the end of the fetal fat accretion period. We also sought to explore the influence of prepregancy body mass index on how the maternal meal affects fetal liver blood flow.Using ultrasound Doppler, we examined 108 healthy women with singleton pregnancies in gestational weeks 30 and 36. At each visit, the first examination was performed with the participant in a fasting state at 08.30 a.m., followed by a standard breakfast meal of approximately 400 kcal. The examination was repeated after 105 minutes. Umbilical vein and ductus venosus blood flow was estimated from diameter and blood flow velocity measurements. Fetal liver flow was calculated as umbilical vein flow minus ductus venosus flow, and change in liver blood flow as flow after minus before the meal. The total group was divided into a normal-weight group (prepregancy body mass index 18.5-25.0 kg/; n = 83) and an overweight group (prepregancy body mass index >25.0 kg/; n = 21). Four women with prepregancy body mass index <18.5 kg/ were excluded from these analyses. Non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests were used for group comparisons.For the total group, we observed a significant increase in median (10th - 90th percentile) liver flow 28.9 (‒67.9-111.6) ml/min (p = 0.002) following the meal in week 36, but not in week 30, ‒2.63 (‒53.2-65.0) ml/min (p = 0.91). This result in turn yielded a statistically significant increase in delta liver flow from weeks 30 to 36 of 26.0 (‒107.1-146.6) ml/min (p = 0.008). The increase in postprandial liver flow was observed only in the normal-weight group in week 36. Accordingly, the delta liver flow values between the two weight groups were significantly different in week 36 (p = 0.006) but not in week 30 (p = 0.155). Among the normal-weight women, the increase in delta liver blood flow from weeks 30 to 36 was 39.3 (‒83.0-156.1) ml/min (p<0.001); in contrast, we observed no statistically significant change in the overweight group (‒44.5 (‒229.0-123.2) ml/min; p = 0.073). As a substitute for liver size, we divided the delta liver flow values by abdominal circumference and found no changes in the statistical significance results within or between the two weight groups.In our healthy study population, we observed a statistically significant difference in liver blood flow after maternal intake of a regular meal. This effect depended on gestational age and maternal prepregancy body mass index, but apparently was independent of liver size, based on abdominal circumference as a proxy measure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30695080>The effect of 2 walking programs on aerobic fitness, body composition, and physical activity in sedentary office employees.</a></h2><p>The present study examined changes in body composition, maximum oxygen uptake, and physical activity in sedentary office employees prescribed with two different walking programs during a 10-week intervention.68 sedentary employees were randomly assigned to one of three groups: multiple bouts of walking (n = 24 (5 male, 19 female) Age = 46±9, BMI = 30.5±5.78 kg/), continuous walking (n = 22 (6 male, 16 female) Age = 48±9, BMI = 30.6±6.2 kg/) and the control group (n = 22 (5 male, 17 female) Age = 42±10, BMI = 27.5±5.23 kg/). Dual- X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA) assessed body composition and a Bruce protocol treadmill test assessed aerobic fitness at baseline and week 11. At baseline, week 6 and week 11 a waist worn accelerometer measured physical activity and sedentary behavior. Physical activity was measured throughout the program with a wrist worn accelerometer.The results from the mixed-design ANOVA show that fat mass (p < .000) and fat percentage (p < .000) decreased for all three groups as a main effect of time. Sedentary behavior did not change (p>0.05) for all three groups. Moderate intensity physical activity increased significantly from pre-test to week 6 (p<0.05), then decreased from week 6 to post-test (p<0.05), with no significant changes observed from pre-test to post-test (p>0.05) for all groups. No changes in VO2 were observed (p>0.05) for all groups.Continuous or intermittent walking activity produce similar benefits on body weight, fat mass and body fat percentage in sedentary employees. Meanwhile, intermittent walking allowed these sedentary employees to increase lean mass and fat free mass. Intermittent walking could provide at least similar benefits on body composition compared to a continuous walking program.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521887>Multivalency-assisted membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery sensitizes photothermal ablation via inhibition of tumor glycolysis metabolism.</a></h2><p>The success of photothermal therapy (PTT) is often hampered by the thermo-resistance of tumor cells mediated by over-expressed heat shock proteins (HSPs). Herein, we developed a guanidine-rich, spherical helical polypeptide (DPP) with multivalency-assisted strong membrane penetrating capability, which mediated effective RNAi against tumor glycolysis metabolism to sensitize PTT. ICG was loaded into the internal cavity of DPP, and siRNA against pyruvate kinase  (siPKM2) was condensed by DPP to form positively charged nanocomplexes (NCs). The NCs were further coated with human serum albumin to enhance serum stability, prolong blood circulation, and improve tumor targeting. Due to its multivalent topology, DPP exhibited stronger membrane activity yet lower cytotoxicity than its linear analogue (LPP), thus enabling efficient PKM2 silencing in MCF-7 cells in vitro (~75%) and in vivo (~70%). The PKM2 silencing inhibited tumor glycolysis metabolism and further depleted the  supply for HSPs production, thus overcoming the heat endurance of tumor cells to strengthen ICG-mediated photothermal ablation. Additionally, siPKM2-mediated  depletion led to tumor cell starvation, which imparted synergistic anti-cancer effect with PTT. This study therefore provides a promising strategy for designing membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery materials, and it renders a unique RNAi-mediated anti-metabolic mechanism in sensitizing PTT and enabling starvation therapy.Copyright © 2019.

CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μ) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "browning" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase  expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals.

Measuring the flexure of geologic material in response to these Earth tides provides information about the geomechanical properties of rock and sediment. Such measurements are particularly useful for understanding dilation of faults and fractures in competent rock. A new approach to measuring earth tides using fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is presented here. DAS was originally designed to record acoustic vibration through the measurement of dynamic strain on a fiber optic cable. Here, laboratory experiments demonstrate that oscillating strain can be measured with DAS in the microHertz frequency range, corresponding to half-day (M) lunar tidal cycles. Although the magnitude of strain measured in the laboratory is larger than what would be expected due to earth tides, a clear signal at half-day period was extracted from the data. With the increased signal-to-noise expected from quiet field applications and improvements to DAS using engineered fiber, earth tides could potentially be measured in deep boreholes with DAS. Because of the distributed nature of the sensor (0.25 m measurement interval over kilometres), fractures could be simultaneously located and evaluated. Such measurements would provide valuable information regarding the placement and stiffness of open fractures in bedrock. Characterization of bedrock fractures is an important goal for multiple subsurface operations such as petroleum extraction, geothermal  recovery, and geologic carbon sequestration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608843>Protein intake per day and at each daily meal and skeletal muscle mass declines among older community dwellers in Japan.</a></h2><p>To examine associations between protein intake per day and at different meals and skeletal muscle mass declines.Two-year prospective cohort study among older community dwellers.National Institute for Longevity Sciences-Longitudinal Study of Aging (NILS-LSA) in Japan.Older men (n 292) and women (n 363) aged 60-87 years who participated in the baseline (2006-2008) and follow-up studies (2008-2010) of NILS-LSA and did not exhibit low skeletal muscle mass at baseline. Muscle mass was assessed using dual- X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and follow-up. Low muscle mass was defined as skeletal muscle mass index <7·0 kg/ for men and <5·4 kg/ for women at follow-up. Daily protein intake and protein intake at each meal were calculated from 3 d dietary records at baseline and sex-stratified tertiles were determined.Mean (sd) protein intake at breakfast, lunch and dinner was 22·7 (7·8), 26·7 (9·3) and 37·4 (10·5) g for men and 19·3 (6·3), 23·2 (7·3) and 28·5 (7·0) g for women, respectively. After adjusting for age, baseline skeletal muscle mass and other confounders in logistic modelling, greater total protein intake was associated with lower prevalence of skeletal muscle mass decline among men at follow-up (P = 0·024). Particularly, the OR (95 % CI) for high lunchtime protein intake was low (0·11 (0·02, 0·61); P = 0·01).

We examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a low-intensity technology-mediated behavioural intervention to support WLM in adults with obesity after clinically significant weight loss (≥5%) compared to standard lifestyle advice.The NULevel trial was an open-label randomised controlled superiority trial in 288 adults recruited April 2014 to May 2015 with weight loss of ≥5% within the previous 12 months, from a pre-weight loss BMI of ≥30 kg/. Participants were self-selected, and the majority self-certified previous weight loss. We used a web-based randomisation system to assign participants to either standard lifestyle advice via newsletter (control arm) or a technology-mediated low-intensity behavioural WLM programme (intervention arm). The intervention comprised a single face-to-face goal-setting meeting, self-monitoring, and remote feedback on weight, diet, and physical activity via links embedded in short message service (SMS). All participants were provided with wirelessly connected weighing scales, but only participants in the intervention arm were instructed to weigh themselves daily and told that they would receive feedback on their weight. After 12 months, we measured the primary outcome, weight (kilograms), as well as frequency of self-weighing, objective physical activity (via accelerometry), psychological variables, and cost-effectiveness. The study was powered to detect a between-group weight difference of ±2.5 kg at follow-up. Overall, 264 participants (92%) completed the trial. Mean weight gain from baseline to 12 months was 1.8 kg (95% CI 0.5-3.1) in the intervention group (n = 131) and 1.8 kg (95% CI 0.6-3.0) in the control group (n = 133). There was no evidence of an effect on weight at 12 months (difference in adjusted mean weight change from baseline: -0.07 [95% CI 1.7 to -1.9], p = 0.9). Intervention participants weighed themselves more frequently than control participants and were more physically active. Intervention participants reported greater satisfaction with weight outcomes, more planning for dietary and physical activity goals and for managing lapses, and greater confidence for healthy eating, weight loss, and WLM. Potential limitations, such as the use of connected weighing study in both trial arms, the absence of a measurement of  intake, and the recruitment from one region of the United Kingdom, are discussed.There was no difference in the WLM of participants who received the NULevel intervention compared to participants who received standard lifestyle advice via newsletter.

Here, we report that machilin A (MA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor by blocking the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding site of LDHA, suppresses growth of cancer cells and lactate production in various cancer cell types, including colon, breast, lung, and liver cancers. Furthermore, MA markedly decreased LDHA activity, lactate production, and intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels induced by hypoxia-induced LDHA expression in cancer cells, and significantly inhibited colony formation, leading to reduced cancer cell survival. In mouse models inoculated with murine Lewis lung carcinoma, MA significantly suppressed tumor growth as observed by a reduction of tumor volume and weight; resulting from the inhibition of LDHA activity. Subsequently, the suppression of tumor-derived lactic acid in MA-treated cancer cells resulted in decrease of neovascularization through the regulation of alternatively activated macrophages () polarization in macrophages. Taken together, we suggest that the reduction of lactate by MA in cancer cells directly results in a suppression of cancer cell growth. Furthermore, macrophage polarization and activation of endothelial cells for angiogenesis were indirectly regulated preventing lactate production in MA-treated cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505515>The Determinants of the Preferred Walking Speed in Individuals with Obesity.</a></h2><p>The preferred walking speed (PWS), also known as the "spontaneous" or "self-selected" walking speed, is the speed normally used during daily living activities and may represent an appropriate exercise intensity for weight reduction programs aiming to enhance a more negative  balance.The aim of this study was to examine, simultaneously, the energetics, mechanics, and perceived exertion determinants of PWS in individuals with obesity.Twenty-three adults with obesity (age 32.7 ± 6.8 years, body mass index 33.6 ± 2.6 kg/) were recruited. The participants performed 10 min of treadmill familiarization, and PWS was determined. Each subject performed six 5-min walking trials (PWS 0.56, 0.83, 1.11, 1.39, and 1.67 m/s). Gas exchanges were collected and analyzed to obtain the gross  cost of walking (GCw), rated perceived exertion (RPE) was measured using a 6-20 Borg scale, and the external mechanical work (Wext) and the fraction of mechanical  recovered by the pendular mechanism (Recovery) were computed using an instrumented treadmill. Second-order least-squares regression was used to calculate the optimal walking speed (OWS) of each variable.No significant difference was found between PWS (1.28 ± 0.13 m/s) and OWS for GCw (1.28 ± 0.10 m/s), RPE cost of walking (1.38 ± 0.14 m/s), and Recovery (1.48 ± 0.27 m/s; p > 0.06 for all), but the PWS was significantly faster than the OWS for Wext (0.98 ± 0.56 m/s; p < 0.02). Multiple regression (r = 0.72; p = 0.003) showed that ∼52% of the variance in PWS was explained by Recovery, Wext, and height.The main finding of this study was that obese adults may select their PWS in function of several competing demands, since this speed simultaneously minimizes pendular  transduction,  cost, and perceived exertion during walking. Moreover, recovery of mechanical work, external work, and height seem to be the major determinants of PWS in these individuals.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

SDS22 has numerous diverse functions, surprisingly acting as both a PP1 inhibitor and as an activator. Here, we integrate cellular, biophysical, and crystallographic studies to address this conundrum. We discovered that SDS22 selectively binds a unique conformation of PP1 that contains a single metal () at its active site, i.e., SDS22 traps metal-deficient inactive PP1. Furthermore, we showed that SDS22 dissociation is accompanied by a second metal (M1) being loaded into PP1, as free metal cannot dissociate the complex and M1-deficient mutants remain constitutively trapped by SDS22. Together, our findings reveal that M1 metal loading and loss are essential for PP1 regulation in cells, which has broad implications for PP1 maturation, activity, and holoenzyme subunit exchange.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280754>The impact of a Solar Market Garden programme on dietary diversity, women's nutritional status and micronutrient levels in Kalalé district of northern Benin.</a></h2><p>To examine the impacts of a Solar Market Garden 1-year solar-powered drip irrigation (SMG) programme in Kalalé district of northern Benin on mothers' nutritional status and micronutrient levels.Using a quasi-experimental design, sixteen villages were assigned to four groups: (i) SMG women's groups (WG); (ii) comparison WG; (iii) SMG non-WG (NWG); and (iv) comparison NWG. Difference-in-differences (DID) estimates were used to assess impacts on mothers' food consumption, diversity, BMI, prevalence of underweight (BMI < 18·5 kg/) and anaemia, and deficiencies of iron (ID) and vitamin A (VAD).Kalalé district, northern Benin.Non-pregnant mothers aged 15-49 years (n 1737).The SMG programme significantly increased mothers' intake of vegetables (DID = 25·31 percentage points (pp); P < 0·01), dietary diversity (DID = 0·74; P < 0·01) and marginally increased their intake of flesh foods (DID = 10·14 pp; P < 0·1). Mean BMI was significantly increased among SMG WG compared with the other three groups (DID = 0·44 kg/; P < 0·05). The SMG programme also significantly decreased the prevalence of anaemia (DID = 12·86 pp; P < 0·01) but no impacts were found for the prevalence of underweight, ID and VAD.Improving mothers' dietary intake and anaemia prevalence supports the need to integrate gender-based agriculture to improve nutritional status.

This nonrandomized, therapeutic, open, single-arm study investigated the effects of progressive resistance training (PRT) on obesity indices in women with PCOS, and the relationship between obesity indices and telomere content.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 52 with non-PCOS (controls), aged 18 to 37 years, with body mass indexes of 18 to 39.9 kg/, performed three 1-hour sessions of PRT per week, for 16 weeks. Before and after PRT, measures included anthropometric indices and regions of interest of fat mass distribution, quantified by dual- X-ray absorptiometry, metabolic and hormonal parameters, and telomere content. The general linear mixed models were used to determine the effects of PRT.PRT did reduce the waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, and the index of conicity among PCOS (P < .01). However, PRT did not influence regions of interest, body mass index, and WHR. After PRT, the telomere content was associated with regions of interest and anthropometric indices in whole group independent of PCOS (P < .05).Resistance exercise improves obesity indices in PCOS, independent of changes in body weight, and the relationship between telomeres and obesity parameters in PCOS remain to be fully clarified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30624666>Mechanisms of action of a carbohydrate-reduced, high-protein diet in reducing the risk of postprandial hypoglycemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.</a></h2><p>Postprandial hypoglycemia is a risk after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).We speculated that a carbohydrate-reduced, high-protein (CRHP) diet might reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and therefore compared the acute effects of a conventionally recommended (CR) diet and CRHP diet [55/30  percent (E%) carbohydrate and 15/30 E% protein, respectively] in RYGB patients.Ten individuals (2 males, 8 females, mean ± SD age 47 ± 7 y; stable body mass index 31 ± 6 kg/; 6 ± 3 y post-RYGB) with recurrent postprandial hypoglycemia documented by plasma glucose (PG) ≤3.4 mmol/L were examined on 2 d with isoenergetic CRHP or CR diets comprising a breakfast and subsequent lunch meal.Peak PG was significantly reduced on the CRHP diet after breakfast and lunch by 11% and 31% compared with the CR diet. Nadir PG increased significantly on CRHP (by 13% and 9%). Insulin secretion was reduced, and glucagon secretion increased on the CRHP diet after both meals. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secretion were lower after lunch but unaltered after breakfast on CRHP; β-cell function and insulin clearance were unchanged.The CRHP diet lowered glucose excursions and reduced insulin secretion and incretin hormone responses, but enhanced glucagon responses compared with the CR diet.

Muscarinic receptors are targets for multiple neurodegenerative diseases. The challenge has been designing subtype-selective ligands against one of the five muscarinic receptors. We report high-resolution structures of a thermostabilized mutant M receptor bound to a subtype-selective antagonist AF-DX 384 and a nonselective antagonist NMS. The thermostabilizing mutation S110R in M was predicted using a theoretical strategy previously developed in our group. Comparison of the crystal structures and pharmacological properties of the M receptor shows that the Arg in the S110R mutant mimics the stabilizing role of the sodium cation, which is known to allosterically stabilize inactive state(s) of class A GPCRs. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that tightening of the ligand-residue contacts in M receptors compared to M receptors leads to subtype selectivity of AF-DX 384.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30778469>Cu doping in CeO to form multiple oxygen vacancies for dramatically enhanced ambient N reduction performance.</a></h2><p>Here, we report the synthesis of Cu-doped CeO2 nanorods (denoted as Cu-CeO2-x, x represents the mass content (wt%) of the doped Cu) by a facile hydrothermal method, followed by thermal treatment in an H2/Ar atmosphere.

The effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) supplementation to basal diet instead of antibiotics (CSP, Chlortetracycline, sulphonamide dimethazine and procaine penicillin, 1:1:1) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and blood profile in growing pigs were studied. A total of 140 growing pigs (Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) with an average body weight of 27.84 ± 0.42 kg were allotted to four treatments of seven replicates/treatment and five pigs/replicate. The four experimental diets included: CON (basal diet, non-antibiotic, negative control); CSP (CON + CSP 0.1%, positive control); M1 (CON + MCFA 0.15%) and  (CON + MCFA 0.3%). After 5 weeks, the fresh faecal and blood samples were collected from rectum and jugular vein respectively. The average daily gain (ADG) was significantly improved for pigs fed 0.3% MCFAs in relation to basal diet. Meanwhile, CSP supplementation had comparable effect on ADG. The lymphocyte percentage and IgG concentration were higher in blood of pigs-fed MCFAs in relation to that of CON and CSP treatment while white blood cell and red blood cell were not affected. In relation to basal diet and CSP treatment, the digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen and gross  (E) were unaffected with MCFAs supplementation. In conclusion, MCFAs improved growth performance on body weight gain and immune profile.

Defining novel costeffective protocols is important for reducing treatment costs. The study aimed to assess if Capacitive and Resistive  Transfer (TECAR) can reduce edema and the minimum number of sessions needed to observe volume reduction. Forty-eight severely obese subjects (age range: 46-78 years; BMI >40 kg/) with bilateral lower limb lymphedema were divided into three groups undergoing either manual lymphatic drainage, pressure therapy, or TECAR, in addition to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. They were compared to a control group composed by 12 women (age: 67.4 ± 8.9 years, BMI: 44.6 ± 4.1 Kg/) undergoing only the rehabilitation program. A handheld laser scanner 3D system was used for volume measurements. In addition, patients were evaluated with a Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and pain/heaviness of the lower limbs with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). A significant volume reduction was observed after 6 sessions of TECAR: specifically, in the whole limb (PRE: 9.7+2.8 dm3; POST: 9.4+2.8 dm3; p<0.05) and in the thigh (PRE: 3.5+1.3 dm3; POST: 3.3+1.2 dm3; p<0.05). The TUG and VAS for pain showed a significant improvement in all groups.

However, each LCS's unique chemical structure has potential to elicit different sensory, physiological, and behavioral responses that affect body weight.The purpose of this trial was to compare the effects of consumption of 4 LCSs and sucrose on body weight, ingestive behaviors, and glucose tolerance over a 12-wk intervention in adults (18-60 y old) with overweight or obesity (body mass index 25-40 kg/).In a parallel-arm design, 154 participants were randomly assigned to consume 1.25-1.75 L of beverage sweetened with sucrose (n = 39), aspartame (n = 30), saccharin (n = 29), sucralose (n = 28), or rebaudioside A (rebA) (n = 28) daily for 12 wk. The beverages contained 400-560 kcal/d (sucrose treatments) or <5 kcal/d (LCS treatments). Anthropometric indexes,  intake,  expenditure, appetite, and glucose tolerance were measured at baseline. Body weight was measured every 2 wk with  intake, expenditure, and appetite assessed every 4 wk. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were completed every 4 wk to determine study compliance via para-aminobenzoic acid excretion.Of the participants enrolled in the trial, 123 completed the 12-wk intervention. Sucrose and saccharin consumption led to increased body weight across the 12-wk intervention (Δweight = +1.85 ± 0.36 kg and +1.18 ± 0.36 kg, respectively; P ≤ 0.02) and did not differ from each other. There was no significant change in body weight with consumption of the other LCS treatments compared with baseline, but change in body weight for sucralose was negative and significantly lower compared with all other LCSs at week 12 (weight difference ≥ 1.37 ± 0.52 kg, P ≤ 0.008).  intake decreased with sucralose consumption (P = 0.02) and ingestive frequency was lower for sucralose than for saccharin (P = 0.045). Glucose tolerance was not significantly affected by any of the sweetener treatments.Sucrose and saccharin consumption significantly increase body weight compared with aspartame, rebA, and sucralose, whereas weight change was directionally negative and lower for sucralose compared with saccharin, aspartame, and rebA consumption.

Pharmacophore generation has been done to recognize the binding modes of inhibitors in the receptor active site. To observe the stability and flexibility of inhibitors molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been done; Lipinski's rule of five protocols is followed to screen drug likeness and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) filtration is also used to value toxicity.

A specific surface area of 153  g-1 is achieved. With as-prepared hollow CdS nanoboxes as photocatalysts for water splitting to H2 (visible light irradiation), H2 evolution rate is as high as 21 654 μmol g-1 h-1, which is nearly 79 times higher than that of bulk CdS. Such an excellent photocatalytic efficiency is ascribed to the large specific surface area for improving light absorbability and the porous nanostructure for efficiently utilizing excitation light due to the multiple scattering within the hollow framework. Moreover, a smaller band gap (2.30 eV) with a higher conduction band (-0.83 V) presents a strong reducibility, which is beneficial for reducing H2O to H2. A combination of fluorescence spectroscopy (PL), PL lifetimes and the photoelectrochemical technique shows that hollow CdS nanoboxes exhibit lower fluorescence intensity, longer electron lifetime and stronger photocurrent intensity than bulk CdS, implying an improved separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers. This work presents a novel methodology to prepare hollow nanostructures, exhibiting potential applications in the field of  conversion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968129>Maternal obesity and the human milk metabolome: associations with infant body composition and postnatal weight gain.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity is a risk factor for childhood obesity; this is a major public health concern given that ∼40% of pregnant women are either overweight or obese. Whether differences in milk composition in lean compared with obese women contribute to childhood obesity is unclear.We aimed to analyze relationships between maternal obesity and human milk metabolites, infant body composition, and postnatal weight gain.This was a prospective study in which mothers intending to breastfeed exclusively, and their newborn infants, were enrolled at delivery (n = 35 mother-infant pairs). We excluded mothers with diabetes, other medical conditions, or pregnancy complications. Participants were grouped by maternal prepregnancy BMI <25 (lean) or ≥25 kg/ (overweight/obese). We analyzed infant body composition by dual- X-ray absorptiometry and used untargeted liquid chromatography-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure the milk content of 275 metabolites at 1 and 6 mo postpartum.At 1 mo postpartum, 10 metabolites differed between overweight/obese and lean groups with nominal P < 0.05, but none was altered with a false discovery rate <0.25. Many differentially abundant metabolites belonged to the same chemical class; e.g., 4/10 metabolites were nucleotide derivatives, and 3/10 were human milk oligosaccharides. Milk adenine correlated positively with both continuously distributed maternal BMI and with infant adiposity and fat accrual. Analysis of milk composition at 6 mo postpartum revealed 20 differentially abundant metabolites (P < 0.05) in overweight/obese compared with lean women, including 6 metabolites with a false discovery rate of <0.25. At both 1 and 6 mo, human milk abundance of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, which has not previously been described in milk, was positively associated with maternal BMI.Maternal obesity is associated with changes in the human milk metabolome. While only a subset of metabolites correlated with both maternal and infant weight, these point to potential milk-dependent mechanisms for mother-child transmission of obesity.

The 24-h  intake was calculated based on the food consumed for breakfast, followed by an ad libitum lunch, snacks, and dinner. Indirect calorimetry with heart-rate accelerometry was used to measure substrate utilization and 24-h  expenditure. A [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion was used to investigate tissue-specific carbohydrate utilization.The 24-h  balance was -400 kcal (normalized 95% CI: -230, -571 kcal) for the FE trial; this was significantly lower than both the BR trial (492 kcal; normalized 95% CI: 332, 652 kcal) and the BE trial (7 kcal; normalized 95% CI: -153, 177 kcal; both P < 0.01 compared with FE). Plasma glucose utilization in FE (mainly representing liver glucose utilization) was positively correlated with  intake compensation at lunch (r = 0.62, P = 0.03), suggesting liver carbohydrate plays a role in postexercise -balance regulation.Neither exercise  expenditure nor restricted  intake via breakfast omission were completely compensated for postexercise.

Then the releasing profile of the SLA-pDA-IL4 implants was recorded for 1 week and the bioactivity of released IL4 was investigated by ELISA. Then macrophage polarization was investigated via three methods including: (a) surface marker via immunofluorescence; (b) mRNA levels of M1 and  polarization markers via real-time PCR, and (c) cytokine release via ELISA.SEM and EDS revealed that pDA and IL4 were coated successfully on SLA surfaces. The ELISA results showed that IL4 remained its bioactivity on SLA surface and were immobilized on the SLA surface. The immobilization of IL4 through pDA has no significant influence on the attachment, morphology, and proliferation of macrophages, while it increased the /M1 proportion in human macrophages revealed by immunofluorescence. The real-time PCR and ELISA results demonstrated that SLA-pDA-IL4 surface reduced the pro-inflammatory profile compared with SLA-pDA and SLA surfaces.The SLA-pDA-IL4 surfaces described here is able to activate adherent macrophages into  phenotype and reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Immobilization of IL4 via pDA is convenient and effective, thus providing an applicable way to control macrophage behavior upon implant insertion and is anticipated to accelerating further bone integration.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116758>Relationship between DXA measured metrics of adiposity and glucose homeostasis; An analysis of the NHANES data.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a means of determining body composition and body fat distribution at different sites including whole body and trunk-locations where there tends to be high correlation at an individual level.We performed an analysis of DXA-derived metrics of adiposity (truncal fat %,subtotal fat % and total fat %) from the NHANES database and then correlated the findings with markers of insulin resistance. We analyzed the data from DXA scans in NHANES 1999-2004. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and HOMA-β (beta-cell function) were estimated. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated (ρ) between HOMA-IR,HOMA-β and different measures of obesity (Waist circumference(in cm), Body Mass Index (kg/), truncal fat %, subtotal fat % as well as total fat %) to gauge the relationship between markers of glucose homeostasis and DXA derived metrics of obesity. We also performed logarithmic transformation of HOMA-IR as well as HOMA-β to ensure normality of distribution and to meet the criteria for regression analysis. A forward selection model (by outcome and gender) was performed to predict log transformed insulin resistance (log HOMA-IR) as well as log transformed HOMA-β (log HOMA-β,measure of beta cell function) from age, serum triglycerides, HDL, trunk fat % and the SBP (in both males and females separately), after reviewing the spearman correlation coefficients.There were a total of 6147 men and 6369 women who were part of the study cohort. There was a positive correlation between markers of adiposity and log HOMA-IR and log HOMA-β in both males and females.Truncal fat % had the highest nonparametric correlation coefficent with log HOMA-IR among the DXA derived fat% (0.54 in males and 048 in females). In the multivariate analysis, truncal fat % was an independent predictor of logHOMA-IR as well as logHOMA-β. In males, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat % and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.325 (±0.66), F(3,207) = 34.63, p < .01). In females, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat %, SBP, Serum triglyceride and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.307 (±0.65),F(5,198) = 18.9, p < .01).

M1 decreased AhR and CYP1A1, while increased AhRR and ARNT expression.  also decreased AhR and CYP1A1 but had no effect on AhRR expression. siAHRR reversed the inhibitory effect of M1 on AhR and CYP1A1,while inhibitory effect of  was still observed. siNFKB2 reversed inhibitory effect of both mixtures on AhR and CYP1A1 expression and stimulatory effect of M1 on AhRR expression. siAHR reversed stimulatory effect of both mixtures on ERα expression. Stimulatory effect of M1 on cell proliferation was not observed in siAHR, was still observed in siESR1 cells.  had no effect on cell proliferation, however stimulatory effect was appeared in siAHR and siESR1cells. In conclusion: M1 by activation of AhRR and NFkB p52, but  only by activation of NFκB attenuated AhR signalling and ligand-induced CYP1A1 expression. Interaction between AhR and ER following M1 and  exposure is primarily initiated through AhR.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Coordinated ethylene glycols form a hexagonal OH cluster, which works as a template to grow single crystals with high crystallinity. After the liberation of solvated molecules, [M(DOBDC)] shows notably higher surface areas than the reported values and completely different CO and CO separation properties depending on the kinds of unsaturated metal. Therefore, breakthrough experiments using a CO/CO mixed gas show that Mg-MOF has a longer breakthrough time for CO than for CO, whereas Co/Ni-MOFs have longer breakthrough times for CO than for CO. Apart from CO and CO, other gases such as CH, H, and N were almost not adsorbed at all in these materials at 298 K. To reveal the role of unsaturated metal sites, CO and CO adsorption sites are unequivocally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. One of very interesting discoveries is that there are two CO and CO adsorption positions (sites A and B) in the hexagonal channels. Site A is the unsaturated metal center working as Lewis acidic sites, and site B is the secondary adsorption site located between two A sites. A close inspection of crystal structures reveals that unsaturated Co(II) and Ni(II) sites adsorb both CO and CO, whereas the unsaturated Mg(II) sites strongly capture only CO, not CO. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the discrepancy in CO affinity: Co(II) and Ni(II) form strong π-back-donating bonds with CO via electron transfer from the d orbitals of the transition metals to the antibonding molecular orbitals of CO, whereas Mg(II) does not participate in electron transfer or orbital overlap with CO. This observation provides new insight into the synthesis of novel functional materials with high CO/CO separation performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321562>Whole-Genome Sequencing Identifies a Rice Grain Shape Mutant, gs9-1.</a></h2><p>Breeding for genes controlling key agronomic traits is an important goal of rice genetic improvement. To gain insight into genes controlling grain morphology, we screened M plants derived from 1,000 whole-genome sequenced (WGS) M Kitaake mutants to identify lines with altered grain size.In this study, we isolated a mutant, named fast-neutron (FN) 60-4, which exhibits a significant reduction in grain size. We crossed FN60-4 with the parental line Kitaake and analyzed the resulting backcross population. Segregation analysis of 113 lines from the BCF population revealed that the mutant phenotype is controlled by a single semi-dominant locus. Mutant FN60-4 is reduced 20% in plant height and 8.8% in 1000-grain weight compared with Kitaake. FN60-4 also exhibits an 8% reduction in cell number and a 9% reduction in cell length along the vertical axis of the glume. We carried out whole-genome sequencing of DNA pools extracted from segregants with long grains or short grains, and revealed that one gene, LOC_Os09g02650, cosegregated with the grain size phenotype in the BCF and BCF populations. This mutant allele was named grain shape 9-1 (gs9-1). gs9-1 carries a 3-bp deletion that affects two amino acids. This locus is a new allele of the BC12/GDD1/MTD1 gene that encodes a kinesin-like protein involved in cell-cycle progression, cellulose microfibril deposition and gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis. The GA biosynthesis-related gene KO2 is down-regulated in gs9-1. The dwarf phenotype of gs9-1 can be rescued by adding exogenous GA. In contrast to the phenotypes for the other alleles, the gs9-1 is less severe, consistent with the nature of the mutation, which does not disrupt the open reading frame as observed for the other alleles.In this study, we isolated a mutant, which exhibits altered grain shape and identified the mutated gene, gs9-1. Our study reveals that gs9-1 is a semi-dominant gene that carries a two-amino acid mutation. gs9-1 is allelic to the BC12/GDD1/MTD1 gene involved in GA biosynthesis. These results demonstrate the efficiency and convenience of cloning genes from the whole-genome sequenced Kitaake mutant population to advance investigations into genes controlling key agronomic traits in rice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30938721>Mesoporous N-doped graphene prepared by a soft-template method with high performance in Li-S batteries.</a></h2><p>Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries, which have high theoretical capacity, are promising candidates for  storage systems; however, several obstacles, including insulating nature and volumetric expansion of sulfur as well as shuttle effects of polysulfides, impede the commercialization of these batteries. Herein, we utilized mesoporous N-doped graphene (NGM) as a sulfur host, which was synthesized using a type of triblock copolymer, Pluronic F127 (PF127), as a soft template. PF127 not only acted as a spacer to prevent the graphene layers from restacking during the hydrothermal reaction, but also resulted in the formation of high-density wrinkles on the surface of the graphene sheets after annealing. The crumpled NGM with a nitrogen doping content of 4.80 at% had the high specific area and total pore volume of up to 958.72  g-1 and 2.39 cm3 g-1, respectively, providing space for the accommodation and uniform distribution of sulfur in the cathode. Therefore, the sulfur content was increased to 87.2 wt% in the graphene sulfur composite, achieving the discharge capacity of 492.2 mA h g-1TE at 1.08 A g-1TE with a low capacity decay rate of 0.12% per cycle after 400 cycles. Thus, this study provides an effective strategy for enhancing the specific surface area and pore volume of graphene to develop Li-S batteries with high performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537064>Prognostic implications of markers of the metabolic phenotype in human cutaneous melanoma.</a></h2><p>Reprogramming of  metabolism to enhanced aerobic glycolysis has been defined as a hallmark of cancer.To investigate the role of the mitochondrial proteins, β-subunit of the H -ATP synthase (β-F1-ATPase), and heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60), and the glycolytic markers, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), as well as the bioenergetic cellular (BEC) index, in melanoma progression.The expression of  metabolism proteins was assessed on a set of different melanoma cells representing the natural biological history of the disease: primary cultures of melanocytes, radial (WM35) and vertical (WM278) growth phases, and poorly (C81-61-PA) and highly (C8161-HA) aggressive melanoma cells. Cohorts of 63 melanocytic naevi, 55 primary melanomas and 35 metastases were used; and 113 primary melanoma and 33 metastases were used for validation.The BEC index was significantly reduced in melanoma cells and correlated with their aggressive characteristics. Overexpression of HSP60, GAPDH and PKM2 was detected in melanoma human samples compared with naevi, showing a gradient of increased expression from radial growth phase to metastatic melanoma. The BEC index was also significantly reduced in melanoma samples and correlated with worse overall and disease-free survival; the multivariate Cox analysis showed that the BEC index (hazard ratio 0·64; 95% confidence interval 0·4-1·2) is an independent predictor for overall survival.A profound alteration in the mitochondrial and glycolytic proteins and in the BEC index occurs in the progression of melanoma, which correlates with worse outcome, supporting that the alteration of the metabolic phenotype is crucial in melanoma transformation.© 2018 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633522>Chemical  Release Driven Lithiophilic Layer on 1 m Commercial Brass Mesh toward Highly Stable Lithium Metal Batteries.</a></h2><p>It is imperative to explore practical methods and materials to drive the development of high  density lithium metal batteries. The constuciton of nanostructure electrodes and surface engineering on the current collectors are the two most effective strategies to regulate the homogeneous Li plating/stripping to relieve the Li dendrites and infinite volume change problems. Based on the low stacking fault  of the Cu-Zn alloy, we present a novel chemical  release induced surface atom diffusion strategy, which is achieved by the negative Gibbs free  from the surface oxidation reaction and subsequent replacement reaction under thermal treatment in air, to realize a uniform upper ZnO nanoparticles coating. Furthermore, we apply the modified brass mesh as a lithiophilic current collector to decrease the Li deposition nucleation overpotential and effectively restrain the Li dendrite growth. The modified brass current collector achieves a long-term cycling stability of 500 cycles at 2.0 mA cm.

The results obtained by our test showed that the feed ratio between the D and A units had a significant effect on both the electrochemical and the spectroelectrochemical properties of the three polymers. The copolymers exhibited a gradually deepening red color in neutral state with the increase of M1 content and then turned to a transmissive grey color in the oxidation state. Also, three copolymers showed good performance in electrochromic parameters, which mainly consists of optical contrast, response time, and coloration efficiency.

It has been suggested that weight loss may affect SCFA metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized weight-loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal SCFA concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total SCFA concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following weight loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased SCFA concentrations were low (≤5% of ) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in SCFA concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

The Y(NO)·6HO as precursor, uniformly dispersed at the molecular level in casting solution, reacted with OH in a coagulation bath and ambient CO during the phase inversion process. The Y(CO)(OH) NPs were formed in situ and distributed homogeneously in a PES matrix, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and  Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) results. The compatibility of the nanocomposite membranes was improved by an in situ preparation method. With the increase in content of Y-based NPs in composite membranes, the surface hydrophilicity and water permeability first increased from M1 to , and then slightly decreased from M3 to M5, which was mainly related to membrane structure. From M1 to M5, the demixing way changed from instantaneous demixing to delayed demixing process as a result of thermodynamic enhancement and viscosity hindrance in the phase inversion process. A higher demixing rate led to a structure with large finger-like macro-voids, i.e., M1, whereas a lower demixing rate caused the suppression of finger-like macro-voids, i.e., M5. More importantly, the adsorption study indicated that the nanocomposite adsorptive membranes were stable in the treatment of fluoride-containing water, with no leakage of Y-based NPs from membrane matrix to solution. It is expected that the in situ preparation technique could be used to produce next-generation nanocomposite adsorptive membranes with improved comprehensive properties for application in water treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We previously reported that in adolescent girls at-risk for T2D with moderately elevated depression, randomization to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) produced greater decreases in depression at post-treament and greater decreases in fasting/2-h insulin at 1 year, compared to health education (HE). The current study is a secondary analysis of this parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We examined whether decreasing depression explained intervention effects on body composition and insulin outcomes. We hypothesized that decreases in depression would be an explanatory mediator and that indirect effects would be strongest at higher levels of baseline depression.Participants were 12-17 years girls with overweight/obesity and family history of T2D randomized to 6-week group CBT (n = 58) or HE (n = 61). Procedures took place at an outpatient pediatric clinic. At baseline, post-treatment, and 1 year, adolescents completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale to assess depression symptoms; body mass index (BMI [kg/]) was measured from height/fasting weight; insulin resistance was derived from 2-h oral glucose testing. Adiposity was assessed with dual- X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 1 year. Indirect effects of intervention were tested on 1-year changes in BMI, adiposity, and insulin through decreases in depression. Baseline depression was tested as a moderator of mediation.There was an indirect effect of CBT on decreased 1-year fasting insulin via decreases in depression during treatment, among adolescents with more elevated baseline depression.Decreasing elevated depression may be one mechanism in the targeted prevention of T2D in at-risk adolescents.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology 2019.

Outcome measures were assessed at the end of each phase.Fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic acid and oleic acid diets than the palmitic acid diet (all P < 0.01). Fasting HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic acid diet than the palmitic acid and oleic acid diets (P < 0.01). The stearic acid diet resulted in lower lithocholic acid (P = 0.01) and total secondary bile acid (SBA) concentrations (P = 0.04) than the oleic acid diet. All other outcome measures were similar between diets. Lithocholic acid concentrations were positively correlated with fasting LDL-cholesterol concentrations (r = 0.33; P = 0.011). Total SBA, lithocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid concentrations were negatively correlated with fasting HDL cholesterol (r = -0.51 to -0.44; P < 0.01) concentrations and positively correlated with LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol (r = 0.37-0.54; P < 0.01) ratios.Dietary stearic acid and oleic acid had similar effects on fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations and more favorable ones than palmitic acid. Unlike oleic acid, the hypocholesterolemic effect of stearic acid may be mediated by inhibition of intestinal hydrophobic SBA synthesis.

Pens were 585  with 15 m fence line feed bunks. Shade treatments ( shade/animal) were: 1) 1.2  (LS1.2); 2) 2.4  (LS2.4); 3) total shade (9 /animal, TS), and 4) total shade equipped with fans with a capacity for air displacement of 6023 CMM and coverage area of 1,365  (TS+F). Trials lasted 158 and 183 days. In both studies, the average weekly maximum temperature exceeded 34°C.Increasing shade allocation tended (linear effect, p=0.08) to increase average daily gain (ADG), and dry matter intake (DMI, quadratic effect, p=0.03). This effect was most apparent between LS1.2 and LS2.4. Shade allocation, per se, did not affect gain efficiency or estimated dietary net  (NE). Compared with TS, TS+F increased (p<0.05) ADG, gain efficiency, and tended (p=0.06) to increase dietary NE. There was a quadratic effect of shade on longissimus area and marbling score, with values being lower (p<0.01) for LS2.4 than for LS1.2 or TS. Likewise, marbling score was lower for TS+F than for TS. Percentage KPH linearly decreased with increasing shade. In contrast, KPH was greater for TS than for TS+F.Providing more than 2.4  shade/animal will not further enhance feedlot performance. The use of fans in combination with shade increases ADG and gain efficiency beyond that of shade, alone. These enhancements were not associated with increased DMI, but rather, to an amelioration of ambient THI on maintenance  requirement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531665>[Surgical treatment of obesity from the nutritional point - opportunities and dangers].</a></h2><p>Obesity is a civilization disease, which occurrence in the world population is gradually increasing. The basic causes of obesity include a sedentary lifestyle and -rich diet contributing to a positive  balance. Methods of curing obesity contain the lifestyle modification, the pharmacological treatment and the surgical treatment. The bariatric surgery is a therapy that can be used among patients with BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 kg/ with comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, for whom previous treatment has been ineffective. The surgical treatment includes restrictive, limiting absorption and hybrid methods among them the most frequently performed sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Surgical treatment affects the clinical course of many chronic diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus type 2. Unfortunately, this method of treatment is related to complications and is associated with increased risk of many complications, nutritional deficiencies, as well as deterioration of mental health. The potential causes of psychiatric disorders following bariatric surgery include dysbiosis and brain - gut axis dysfunction. After surgery, a dysbiosis is noticed (a reduction of Bifidobacterium spp.) that may increase the risk of depressive disorders occurrence. For this reason, to effective obesity treatment, patients undergoing bariatric surgery should be covered by the longterm care of an interdisciplinary team.© 2018 MEDPRESS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805607> Drinks Induce Acute Cardiovascular and Metabolic Changes Pointing to Potential Risks for Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Case reports suggest a link between  drinks (EDs) and adverse events, including deaths.We examined cardiovascular and metabolic effects of EDs and mixtures providing relevant ingredients of EDs compared to a similarly composed control product (CP) without these components.This randomized, crossover trial comprised 38 adults (19 women, mean BMI 23 kg/, mean age 22 y). We examined effects of a single administration of a commercial ED, the CP, and the CP supplemented with major ED-ingredients at the same concentrations as in the ED.

General linear models were used to obtain the regression coefficients (β) of salt intake associated with BMI. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the ORs and 95% CIs of overweight/obesity associated with a 1-g/d higher dietary salt intake.After adjustment for potential confounding factors including  intake, salt intake 1 g/d higher was associated with BMI higher by 0.28 in Japan, 0.10 in China, 0.42 in the United Kingdom, and 0.52 in the United States, all P values < 0.001. Salt intake 1 g/d higher was associated with odds of overweight/obesity 21% higher in Japan, 4% higher in China, 29% higher in the United Kingdom, and 24% higher in the United States, all P values < 0.05.Salt intake is positively associated with BMI and the prevalence of overweight/obesity in Japan, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This association needs to be further confirmed in well-designed prospective studies with repeated dietary and BMI measurements.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as .Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924838>High-performance supercapacitors based on hierarchically porous carbons with a three-dimensional conductive network structure.</a></h2><p>Clews of polymer nanobelts (CsPNBs) have the advantages of inexpensive raw materials, simple synthesis and large output. Novel clews of carbon nanobelts (CsCNBs) have been successfully prepared by carbonizing CsPNBs and by KOH activation subsequently. From the optimized process, CsCNBs*4, with a specific surface area of 2291  g-1 and a pore volume of up to 1.29 cm3 g-1, has been obtained. Fundamentally, the CsCNBs possess a three-dimensional conductive network structure, a hierarchically porous framework, and excellent hydrophilicity, which enable fast ion diffusion through channels and a large enough ion adsorption/desorption surface to improve electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. The product exhibits a high specific capacitance of 327.5 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 in a three-electrode system. The results also reveal a high-rate capacitance (72.2% capacitance retention at 500 mV s-1) and stable cycling lifetime (95% of initial capacitance after 15 000 cycles). Moreover, CsCNBs*4 provides a high  density of 29.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 345.4 W kg-1 in 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile (TEABF4/AN) electrolyte.

The extent to which young adults' sedentary time (ST) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) relate to adiposity and weight gain remains unclear.The purpose of this study was to examine the relation of ST and MVPA with adiposity and change in adiposity in healthy, nonobese young adults over a 2-y period.Participants were 71 adults aged 20-35 y. Measurements included ST and MVPA by accelerometry and reported  intake at baseline, and anthropometry (%FM) and fat mass (FM) by dual- X-ray absorptiometry at baseline, year 1, and year 2. Associations of baseline ST and MVPA with adiposity were examined with the use of repeated-measures linear regression models, controlling for age, sex, and reported  intake. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.Participants [mean ± SD body mass index (BMI; kg/): 22.6 ± 2.4] engaged in 8.5 ± 1.5 h ST/d and 0.4 ± 0.3 h MVPA/d. At baseline, adults who engaged in ST for ≥8 h/d had higher FM, %FM, and lower MVPA, whereas those who engaged in MVPA for ≥30 min/d had lower FM and %FM. In fully adjusted models, ST was significantly associated with baseline body weight, hip circumference, BMI, FM, and %FM and with year-1 body weight, waist and hip circumference, FM, and %FM, but not with any year-2 adiposity indicators. MVPA was not significantly associated with any adiposity indicators at baseline, year 1, or year 2 in fully adjusted models. Over 2 y, participants significantly increased waist circumference, BMI, FM, and %FM (all P-values <0.05), but there were no associations among baseline ST and MVPA with change in adiposity.Among nonobese young adults, high ST and low MVPA were related to elevated adiposity but did not predict change in adiposity over time.

Here we identify inactivation of the transcriptional regulator PGC-1α as a landmark for experimental nephrotoxic acute kidney injury (AKI) and describe the in vivo consequences of PGC-1α deficiency over inflammation and cell death in kidney injury. Kidney transcriptomic analyses of WT mice with folic acid-induced AKI revealed 1398 up- and 1627 downregulated genes. Upstream transcriptional regulator analyses pointed to PGC-1α as the transcription factor potentially driving the observed expression changes with the highest reduction in activity. Reduced PGC-1α expression was shared by human kidney injury. Ppargc1a mice had spontaneous subclinical kidney injury characterized by tubulointerstitial inflammation and increased Ngal expression. Upon AKI, Ppargc1a mice had lower survival and more severe loss of renal function, tubular injury, and reduction in expression of mitochondrial PGC-1α-dependent genes in the kidney, and an earlier decrease in mitochondrial mass than WT mice. Additionally, surviving Ppargc1a mice showed higher rates of tubular cell death, compensatory proliferation, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB activation, and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration. Specifically, Ppargc1a mice displayed increased M1 and decreased  responses and expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In cultured renal tubular cells, PGC-1α targeting promoted spontaneous cell death and proinflammatory responses. In conclusion, PGC-1α inactivation is a key driver of the gene expression response in nephrotoxic AKI and PGC-1α deficiency promotes a spontaneous inflammatory kidney response that is magnified during AKI. © 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

However, the behavioral and physiological mechanisms linking sleep and alterations in  balance and metabolism are incompletely understood. In rodents, sleep regulation is closely related to appropriate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity, but whether the same is true in humans has remained unknown. The present work examines whether sleep duration and quality are related to BAT volume and activity (measured by 18F-FDG) and BAT radiodensity in humans.A total of 118 healthy adults (69% women, 21.9 ± 2.2 years, body mass index: 24.9 ± 4.7 kg/) participated in this cross-sectional study. Sleep duration and other sleep variables were measured using a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven consecutive days for 24 hours per day. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality. All participants then underwent a personalized cold exposure to determine their BAT volume, activity, and radiodensity (a proxy of the intracellular triglyceride content), using static positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CI) scan.Neither sleep duration nor quality was associated with BAT volume or activity (the latter represented by the mean and peak standardized 18F-FDG uptake values) or radiodensity (all p > .1). The lack of association remained after adjusting the analyses for sex, date of PET/CT, and body composition.Although experiments in rodent models indicate a strong relationship to exist between sleep regulation and BAT function, it seems that sleep duration and quality may not be directly related to the BAT variables examined in the present work.

The aim of this clinical study was to analyze dietary intake of dialysis patients and to determine if it meets their nutritional needs.Clinical study was conducted on 30 randomly selected dialysis patients in the dialysis department of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana. Nutritional interview was conducted unannounced five times over a period of three months with the 24-hour recall method. Results were analyzed with Prodi 6.6 Expert software. Body composition was measured with bioimpedance spectroscopy.Average caloric intake of 30 patients is 14.1 ± 4.7 kcal/kg body weight per day, average protein intake is 0.61 ± 0.19 g/kg body weight per day. The average BMI (body mass index) is 27.9 ± 4.4 kg/, the average LTI (lean tissue index) is 12.5 ± 3.1 kg/, the average FTI (fat tissue index) is 14.2 ± 5.7 kg/ and the average phase angle is 4.2 ± 1.0. Average calorie intake and protein intake are inadequate according to the dietary recommendations for dialysis patients. Anthropometric measurements indicate sarcopenic obesity.According to the aim of the study, we confirmed that caloric and protein intake of dialysis patients were inadequate according to their needs.

However, only few clinical studies have adequately explored the importance of body composition in the nutritional assessment of Chinese patients with IBD.A total of 78 IBD patients were enrolled, and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used to assess malnutrition. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to analyze the body composition of IBD patients and their fat free mass indexes (FFMI) were also calculated. FFMI values <17 kg/ in men and <15 kg/ in women were considered low. Food consumption data were collected using the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.Of the 78 patients, 49 (62.8%) had low-FFMI. Among the patients with PG-SGA <4, 12 (41.4%) had altered body composition with low-FFMI. FFMI negatively correlated with the PG-SGA scores and disease activity. No statistically significant differences in fat free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass were observed between patients in the active phase and patients in remission (p>0.05). However, the fat mass and visceral fat area of patients in remission were higher than those of patients in the active phase (p<0.05). The average  derived from fat, proteins and carbohydrates was 29.6±8.45%, 10.4±1.97% and 60.3±9.33%, respectively.Our study shows that 41.4% of IBD patients had altered body composition despite being well-nourished according to the PG-SGA.

Also, little is known about the comparative efficacy of weight loss interventions that use SMS coupled with brief, technology-mediated contact with health coaches, an important issue when considering the scalability and cost of interventions. We examined the efficacy of a 1-year intervention designed to reduce weight among overweight and obese English- and Spanish-speaking adults via SMS alone (ConTxt) or in combination with brief, monthly health-coaching calls. ConTxt offered 2-4 SMS/day that were personalized, tailored, and interactive. Content was theory- and evidence-based and focused on reducing  intake and increasing  expenditure. Monthly health-coaching calls (5-10 minutes' duration) focused on goal-setting, identifying barriers to achieving goals, and self-monitoring.English- and Spanish-speaking adults were recruited from October 2011 to March 2013. A total of 298 overweight (body mass index [BMI] 27.0 to 39.9 kg/) adults (aged 21-60 years; 77% female; 41% Hispanic; 21% primarily Spanish speaking; 44% college graduates or higher; 22% unemployed) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ConTxt only (n = 101), ConTxt plus health-coaching calls (n = 96), or standard print materials on weight reduction (control group, n = 101). We used computer-based permuted-block randomization with block sizes of three or six, stratified by sex and Spanish-speaking status. Participants, study staff, and investigators were masked until the intervention was assigned. The primary outcome was objectively measured percent of weight loss from baseline at 12 months. Differences between groups were evaluated using linear mixed-effects regression within an intention-to-treat framework. A total of 261 (87.2%) and 253 (84.9%) participants completed 6- and 12-month visits, respectively. Loss to follow-up did not differ by study group. Mean (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) percent weight loss at 12 months was -0.61 (-1.99 to 0.77) in the control group, -1.68 (-3.08 to -0.27) in ConTxt only, and -3.63 (-5.05 to -2.81) in ConTxt plus health-coaching calls. At 12 months, mean (95% CI) percent weight loss, adjusted for baseline BMI, was significantly different between ConTxt plus health-coaching calls and the control group (-3.0 [-4.99 to -1.04], p = 0.003) but not between the ConTxt-only and the control group (-1.07 [-3.05 to 0.92], p = 0.291). Differences between ConTxt plus health-coaching calls and ConTxt only were not significant (-1.95 [-3.96 to 0.06], p = 0.057). These findings were consistent across other weight-related secondary outcomes, including changes in absolute weight, BMI, and percent body fat at 12 months. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that Spanish speakers responded more favorably to ConTxt plus health-coaching calls than English speakers (Spanish contrast: -7.90 [-11.94 to -3.86], p < 0.001; English contrast: -1.82 [-4.03 to 0.39], p = 0.107).

Dual- x-ray absorptiometry-acquired total body mass and composition, and fast gait speed over 400 m was assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months.At baseline, dual- x-ray absorptiometry-acquired total body, fat, and lean masses were 95.9 ± 14.6, 44.6 ± 7.6, and 48.7 ± 9.5 kg, respectively, and 400-m gait speed was 1.17 ± 0.20 m/s. Total body mass was significantly reduced in the WL group (-8.17 [-9.56, -6.77] kg) compared with the WS group (-1.16 [-2.59, 0.27] kg), with 87% of total mass lost as fat (WL: -7.1 [-8.1, -6.1] kg; -15.9% change from baseline). A differential treatment effect was not observed for change in lean mass (WL: -0.81 [-1.40, -0.23] kg vs WS: -0.24 [-0.85, 0.36] kg). Four-hundred-meter gait speed was also unchanged from baseline although trends suggest slightly increased gait speed in the WL group [0.01 (-0.02, 0.04) m/s] compared with the WS group [-0.02 (-0.05, 0.01) m/s].Intentional weight loss using a high-protein diet is effective in producing significant total body mass and fat mass loss, while helping preserve lean body mass and mobility, in relatively high-functioning older adults with obesity.© The Author(s) 2018.

Hence, this study aimed at overweight adolescent boys to explore the effect of high intensity intermittent training (HIIT) on these anti-inflammatory cytokines and body composition parameters. Materials and methods Twenty overweight adolescent boys [aged: 18.0 ± 1.5 years, weight: 81.8 ± 4.3 kg, body mass index (BMI): 27.6 ± 0.8 kg/] completed this study. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups of control (CG, n = 10) and training (TG, n = 10). Subjects in the TG performed their training sessions 3 days/week for 6 weeks. The baseline serum values of IL-4 and IL-13 and anthropometric features were measured 1 day before the beginning of exercise intervention and 1 day after the last training session in a fasting state. Results Six weeks of HIIT significantly increased the baseline serum levels of IL-4 (p = 0.022) and IL-13 (p = 0.014) in overweight adolescent boys. In addition, body weight (BW), BMI and body fat percent (BF%) were reduced in response to HIIT. Moreover, significantly negative correlations were found between changes of IL-4 and IL-13 with changes of BW, BMI and BF%.

Among them, the reaction duration is relatively less investigated. In this work, based on a Cu(ii)-MOF system, the reaction duration was found to play an important role in directing the formation of two different products, (NH2(CH3)2)[Cu12(DDPN)6(H2O)10Cl] (BUT-301) on shorter reaction time and (NH2(CH3)2)2[Cu(DDPN)] (BUT-302) on longer reaction time, when CuCl2 reacted with 3,5-di(3,5-dicarboxylphenyl)nitrobenzene (H4DDPN) in a DMA/MeOH mixed solvent at 120 °C. With increasing the reaction duration, BUT-301 can transform into BUT-302. Both MOFs have three-dimensional (3D) framework structures. BUT-301 is constructed from paddle-wheel Cu2(COO)4 units and DDPN4- ligands as four-connected linkers, while BUT-302 is assembled from mononuclear Cu(ii) centers connecting the ligands as also four-connected linkers but in a monodentate coordination fashion. N2 adsorption confirmed that both MOFs are porous materials with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 1953 and 561  g-1, respectively. Interestingly, both BUT-301 and -302 show selective adsorption properties of C3H4 over C3H6.

There might be differences in the fatty acid (FA) handling in adipose tissue when both ethnicities are exposed to high-fat overfeeding. The objective of the present study was to investigate the molecular adaptation in relation to FA metabolism in response to overfeeding with a high-fat diet (OHFD) in South Asian and Caucasian men. Ten South Asian men (BMI 18-29 kg/) and ten Caucasian men (BMI 22-33 kg/), matched for body fat percentage, aged 20-40 years were included. A weight-maintenance diet (30 % fat, 55 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) was given for 3 d followed by 3 d of overfeeding (150 %  requirement) with a high-fat diet (60 % fat, 25 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) while staying in a respiration chamber. Before and after overfeeding, abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken. Proteins were isolated, analysed and quantified for short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1α (CPT1a), adipose TAG lipase, perilipin A (PLINA), perilipin B, lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid binding protein 4 using Western blotting. OHFD decreased the HADH level (P < 0·05) in Caucasians more than in Asians (P < 0·05), but the baseline and after intervention HADH level was relatively higher in Caucasians. The level of CPT1a decreased in South Asians and increased in Caucasians (P < 0·05). PLINA did not change with diet but the level was higher in South Asians (P < 0·05).

This disease is characterized by inflammation in multiple cell types, including macrophages. M1 macrophage responses are correlated with the progression of obesity or diabetes; therefore, strategies that induce repolarization of macrophages from an M1 to an  phenotype may be promising for the prevention of obesity- or diabetes-associated pathology. Glutamine (the most abundant amino acid in the plasma of humans and many other mammals including rats) is effective in inducing polarization of  macrophages through the glutamine-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pathway and α-ketoglutarate produced via glutaminolysis, whereas succinate synthesized via glutamine-dependent anerplerosis or the γ-aminobutyric acid shunt promotes polarization of M1 macrophages. Interestingly, patients with obesity or diabetes show altered glutamine metabolism, including decreases in glutamine and α-ketoglutarate concentrations in serum but increases in succinate concentrations. Thus, manipulation of macrophage polarization through glutamine metabolism may provide a potential target for prevention of obesity- or diabetes-associated pathology.© 2019 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664291>Synthesis of new multivalent metal ion functionalized mesoporous silica and studies of their enhanced antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activities.</a></h2><p>In the present study, we have reported the synthesis of a transition metal (Me = Ti, V, and Pd) incorporated into MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieves (Si/Me = 20) synthesized by the sol-gel method. Their physicochemical properties were studied in detail by standard techniques like low angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy--dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption studies, and thermogravimetric-differential thermal (TG-DTA) analysis and spectral studies like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis (UV-Visible-DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD patterns prove that the material's phase identity is the same irrespective of metal incorporation. SEM displayed the uniform shape and size of the nanoparticles. The presence of elements such as Ti, V, Pd, Si and O in respective materials is revealed using the EDXS analysis. Around 30% weight loss arose upon calcination from room temperature to 800 °C. BET surface area analysis presented that the parent materials have a high surface area (1024  g-1) which was reduced upon metal incorporation. FT-IR analysis exhibited the framework vibrations of the synthesised materials. UV-Visible-DRS analysis indicated the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions. The multivalent-metal-ion-functionalized mesoporous materials showed significant enhancement in potent antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The antimicrobial activity is because of its low lipophilicity, which no longer allows the materials to enter via the lipid membrane. Thus, the new materials neither obstruct the metal-binding sites nor inhibit the growth of microbe enzymes. Further, the results show that the transition metal ion-containing mesoporous materials possessing good anticancer activity arising from their excessive surface area to volume ratio provided appropriate association with a tumour cell due to the direct penetration of mesoporous materials into the cell wall, causing membrane damage and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659892>Methylammonium-Mediated Crystallization of Cesium-Based 2D/3D Perovskite toward High-Efficiency Light-Emitting Diodes.</a></h2><p>2D/3D perovskites have been successfully applied to high-efficiency light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their large exciton binding  (Eb) caused by the quantum and dielectric confinements.

Our results suggest that appropriate perovskite crystallization can be achieved at room temperature by the regulation of precursor solution, making the perovskite crystallization process easier to control with reduced processing complexity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697622>Association of Obesity and Frailty in Older Adults: NHANES 1999-2004.</a></h2><p>Body composition changes with aging can increase rates of obesity, frailty and impact function. Measuring adiposity using body fat (%BF) or central adiposity using waist circumference (WC) have greater diagnostic accuracy than traditional measures such as body mass index (BMI).This is an observational study.This study focused on older community-dwelling participants.We identified individuals age ≥ 60 years old using the 1999-2004 cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES).The primary analysis evaluated the association between frailty and %BF or WC. Frailty was the primary predictor (robust=referent) and %BF and WC were considered continuous outcomes. Multiple imputation analyses accounted for missing characteristics.Dual  x-ray absorptiometry was used to assess %BF and WC was objectively measured. Frailty was defined using an adapted version of Fried's criteria that was self-reported: (low BMI<18.5kg/; slow walking speed [<0.8m/s]; weakness [unable to lift 10lbs]; exhaustion [difficulty walking between rooms on same floor] and low physical activity [compared to others]). Robust, pre-frail and frail persons met zero, 1 or 2, and ≥3 criteria, respectively.Of the 4,984 participants, the mean age was 71.1±0.2 (SE) years and 56.5% were females. We classified 2,246 (50.4%), 2,195 (40.3%), and 541 (9.2%) individuals as robust, pre-frail and frail, respectively. Percent BF was 35.9±0.13, 38.3±0.20 and 40.0±0.46 in the robust, pre-frail and frail individuals, respectively. WC was 99.5±0.32 in the robust, 100.1±0.43 in pre-frail, 104.7±1.17 in frail individuals. Compared to robust individuals, only frail individuals had greater %BF on average (β=0.97±0.43,p=0.03); however, pre-frail and frail individuals had 2.18 and 4.80 greater WC, respectively (β=2.18±0.64,p=0.002, and β=4.80±1.1,p<0.001).Our results demonstrate that in older adults, frailty and pre-frailty are associated with a greater likelihood of high WC (as dichotomized) and a greater average WC (continuous).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216547>Effects of Weighted Hula-Hooping Compared to Walking on Abdominal Fat, Trunk Muscularity, and Metabolic Parameters in Overweight Subjects: A Randomized Controlled Study.</a></h2><p>Weighted hula-hoops have gained popularity, but whether they indeed reshape the trunk or have beneficial metabolic effects in overweight subjects is unknown.To determine effects of hula-hooping and walking matched for  expenditure on android fat %, trunk muscle mass, and metabolic parameters in a randomized cross-over study.We recruited 55 overweight nondiabetic subjects, who were randomized to hula-hooping (HULA) for 6 weeks using a 1.5-kg weighted hula-hoop followed by walking (WALK) for another 6 weeks or vice versa. The increments in  expenditure were similar by HULA and WALK. Body composition (dual- X-ray absorptiometry) and metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and after HULA and WALK. The primary endpoint was the change in fat % in the android region.A total of 53subjects (waist 92 ± 1 cm, body mass index 28 ± 1 kg/) completed the study. Body weight changed similarly (-0.6 ± 0.2 vs. -0.5 ± 0.2 kg, nonsignificant; HULA vs. WALK). During the intervention the subjects hula-hooped on average 12.8 ± 0.5 min/day and walked 9,986 ± 376 steps/day. The % fat in the android region decreased significantly by HULA but not by WALK (between-group change p < 0.001). Trunk muscle mass increased more by HULA than by WALK (p < 0.05). Waist circumference decreased more by HULA than by WALK (-3.1 ± 0.3 cm vs. -0.7 ± 0.4 cm, p < 0.001; HULA vs. WALK). WALK but not HULA significantly lowered systolic blood pressure and increased HDL cholesterol while HULA significantly decreased LDL cholesterol.Hula-hooping with a weighted hula-hoop can be used to decrease abdominal fat % and increase trunk muscle mass in overweight subjects. Its LDL lowering effect resembles that described for resistance training.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

This study is aimed at evaluating the relationship between liver  gene expression and the oxidative stress network depending on adiposity levels in Zucker rats, an animal model of metabolic syndrome. We observed that liver-specific  expression is reduced in an in vivo model of spontaneous obesity and metabolic syndrome. We also observed that  expression in the liver is positively associated with  and  expressions, two proteins involved in antioxidant protection pathways and inversely related to body weight and plasmatic oxidative status. Interestingly, the  expression is upregulated after  restriction-induced weight loss concomitantly with an improvement in oxidative stress markers.

Triggers of eryptosis include increased cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, oxidative stress, osmotic shock,  depletion and several uremic toxins. Little is known about the pathogenesis of eryptosis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients; furthermore, its relevance in worsening clinical conditions in these patients is still not completely defined.We investigated eryptosis levels in PD patients and its association with inflammatory and clinical parameters.A total of 46 PD patients and 17 healthy subjects (CTR) were enrolled. All eryptosis measurements were made in freshly isolated RBCs using the flow cytometer.Eryptosis was significantly higher in PD patients than that in CTR (p < 0.001). Eryptosis levels did not differ significantly between PD patients with and without diabetes, with and without hypertension, and with and without cardiovascular disease. Eryptosis showed no significant differences between patients treated with continuous ambulatory PD/automated PD, with Kt/Vurea value ≤1.7 and >1.7, with a negative or positive history of peritonitis. On the contrary, eryptosis showed significantly lower levels in PD patients with weekly creatinine clearance ≥45 L/week/1.73  (2.8%, 1.7-4.9 vs. 5.6%, 5.0-13.5; p= 0.049). Eryptosis showed significantly lower levels in PD patients with residual diuresis (n = 23) than that in patients without (3.7%, 2.6-5.6 vs. 5%, 3.1-16; p = 0.03). In these 23 patients, significant negative correlations between percentage of eryptosis and residual glomerular filtration rate (rGFR; Spearman's rho = -0.51, p = 0.01) and diuresis volume (Spearman's rho = -0.43, p = 0.05) were found.The present study demonstrated higher eryptosis levels in PD patients compared to corresponding levels in CTR. Furthermore, important PD comorbidity and main PD parameters do not influence eryptosis. Importantly, our data have reported an increase in eryptosis levels with progressive residual diuresis and rGFR loss, probably due to decreased uremic toxins clearance.© 2019 S.

However, the restacking of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets is still a challenge, which largely restricts their development. Here, we employ the 3D architecture of a Ti3C2Tx aerogel to restrict the restacking of 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. This special structure can not only effectively reduce the restacking of 2D materials, but also accelerate the transport of electrolyte ions in the electrode. The as-prepared Ti3C2Tx aerogel possessed a large special surface area of 108  g-1 and achieved a special capacitance of 349 F g-1 which is retained even at a high scan rate of 2000 mV s-1 in the 3 M H2SO4 electrolyte, indicating an ultrahigh rate capability. Moreover, at a higher current density of 20 A g-1, 90% of the initial capacitance is also retained after 20 000 charging-discharging cycles, revealing an excellent cycling stability.

Little research to date has investigated the interaction between gene and food intake. The aim of the current study is to explore the potential effect of fat mass and obesity-associated protein gene (FTO) rs9939609 and rs9930506 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the pattern of food intake in the Emirati population.Adult healthy Emirati subjects with Body mass index (BMI) of 16-40 kg/ were included in the study. Genotyping for FTO rs9939609(A>T) and rs9930506(A>G) was performed using DNA from saliva samples. Subjects were categorized according to the WHO classification by calculating the BMI to compare different classes. Dietary intake was assessed by a sixty-one-item FFQ that estimated food and beverage intakes over the past year. The daily , macronutrient, and micronutrient consumption were computed.We included 169 subjects in the final analysis (mean age 30.49± 9.1years, 57.4% females). The mean BMI of the study population was 26.19 kg/. Both SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. The rs9939609 AA genotype was significantly associated with higher BMI (p = 0.004); the effect was significant in females (p = 0.028), but not in males (p = 0.184). Carbohydrate intake was significantly higher in AA subjects with a trend of lower fat intake compared to other genotypes. The odds ratio for the AA was 3.78 in the fourth quartile and 2.67 for the A/T in the second quartile of total carbohydrate intake, considering the first quartile as a reference (95% CI = 1.017-14.1 and 1.03-6.88, respectively). Fat intake was significantly lower in the FTO rs9930506 GG subjects. The presence of FTO rs9930506 GG genotype decreased the fat intake in subjects with FTO rs9939609 AA (p = 0.037).The results of this study highlight the interaction of the FTO risk alleles on the food intake in Emirati subjects. The FTO rs9939609 AA subjects had higher carbohydrate and lower fat intake. The latter was accentuated in presence of rs9930506 GG genotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697632>Is Fat Mass Cross-Sectionally Associated with Cortical Aβ Load in the Human Brain?</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to examine the relationship of fat mass (FM) with brain amyloid (Aβ) load in older adults.Data from the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial (MAPT) for Positron emission tomography and dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were used. Linear regressions controlling for appendicular muscle, age, education, clinical dementia rating scale and Apolipoprotein-E were performed to explore the relationships between FM, trunk FM and Aβ-load.Thirty-nine participants (75.7 ± 4.2 years old) with an average BMI of 27.5 ± 4.0 kg/ were analyzed in this study. There were significant and positive associations of both total and trunk FM with Aβ load [0.01 (0.002-0.02) and 0.02 (0.001-0.04), respectively]; however, when adding ApoE-ε4 as a confounder, associations were no longer significant.This study has found associations between FM as measured by DXA and cerebral Aβ load, suggesting that excessive FM might be involved in AD pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696504>A single day of mixed-macronutrient overfeeding does not elicit compensatory appetite or  intake responses but exaggerates postprandial lipaemia during the next day in healthy young men.</a></h2><p>Discrete episodes of overconsumption may induce a positive  balance and impair metabolic control. However, the effects of an ecologically relevant, single day of balanced macronutrient overfeeding are unknown. Twelve healthy men (of age 22 (sd 2) years, BMI 26·1 (sd 4·2) kg/) completed two 28 h, single-blind experimental trials. In a counterbalanced repeated measures design, participants either consumed their calculated daily  requirements ( balance trial (EB): 10 755 (sd 593) kJ) or were overfed by 50 % (overfeed trial (OF): 16 132 (sd 889) kJ) under laboratory supervision. Participants returned to the laboratory the next day, after an overnight fast, to complete a mixed-meal tolerance test (MTT). Appetite was not different between trials during day 1 (P&gt;0·211) or during the MTT in the fasted or postprandial state (P&gt;0·507). Accordingly, plasma acylated ghrelin, total glucagon-like peptide-1 and total peptide YY concentrations did not differ between trials during the MTT (all P&gt;0·335). Ad libitum  intake, assessed upon completion of the MTT, did not differ between trials (EB 6081 (sd 2260) kJ; OF 6182 (sd 1960) kJ; P=0·781). Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were not different between trials (P&gt;0·715). Fasted NEFA concentrations were lower in OF compared with EB (P=0·005), and TAG concentrations increased to a greater extent on OF than on EB during the MTT (P=0·009). The absence of compensatory changes in appetite-related variables after 1 d of mixed macronutrient overfeeding highlights the limited physiological response to defend against excess  intake. This supports the concept that repeated discrete episodes of overconsumption may promote weight gain, while elevations in postprandial lipaemia may increase CVD risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395588>Validity of DXA body volume equations in a four-compartment model for adults with varying body mass index and waist circumference classifications.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this investigation was to determine the validity of 4-compartment (4C) model body fat percent (BF%) estimates when using dual  x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived body volume (BV) equations (4C-DXA1 and 4C-DXA2) in adults with varying body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) classifications. Each model was compared to a criterion 4C model with air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) generated BV (4C-ADP). Participants were categorized as normal weight (n = 40; NW = BMI<25.0kg/); overweight (n = 40; OWBMI = BMI≥25.0 kg/); and overweight with at-risk WC (n = 35; OWBMI+WC = BMI≥25.0 kg/ and WC≥88.0cm for women and 102.0cm for men). 4C-DXA1 produced lower BF% than that derived using the 4C-ADP in NW (CE = -3.0%; p<0.001) while 4C-DXA2 was significantly higher (CE = 4.8%; p<0.001). The SEE and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were lower for 4C-DXA2 (1.24% and ±2.5%, respectively) than 4C-DXA1 (2.59% and ±5.0%, respectively) and proportional bias was present for both (p<0.05). 4C-DXA1 BF% was not significant in OWBMI (CE = -0.5%; p = 0.112) whereas 4C-DXA2 was higher (CE = 4.5%; p<0.001). The SEE and 95% LOA were lower for 4C-DXA2 (1.20% and ±2.9%, respectively) than 4C-DXA1 (1.92% and ±3.9%, respectively) in OWBMI. Proportional bias was present for 4C-DXA1 (p = 0.007), but not 4C-DXA2 (p = 0.832). 4C-DXA1 and 4C-DXA2 produced significantly higher BF% in OWBMI+WC (CE = 2.2 and 2.3%, respectively; both p<0.001). The SEE and 95% LOA remained lower for 4C-DXA2 (1.15% and ±2.5%, respectively) than 4C-DXA1 (1.84% and ±3.8%, respectively). There was proportional bias for 4C-DXA2 (p = 0.020), but not 4C-DXA1 (p = 0.183) in OWBMI+WC. Only one prediction model (i.e., 4C-DXA1 in OWBMI+WC) revealed valid estimates of BF%.

We hypothesized that participants randomly assigned to this meal plan would maintain similar bone density and quality to weight-stable controls, despite significant reductions in body mass.Ninety-six older adults (aged 70.3 ± 3.7 y, 74% women, 27% African American) with obesity [body mass index (kg/): 35.4 ± 3.3] were randomly assigned to a 6-mo hypocaloric, nutritionally complete, higher-protein meal plan targeting ≥1.0 g protein · kg body weight-1 · d-1 [weight-loss (WL) group; n = 47] or to a weight-stability (WS) group targeting 0.8 g protein · kg body weight-1 · d-1, the current Recommended Dietary Allowance (n = 49). The primary outcome was total hip bone mineral density (BMD), with femoral neck BMD, lumbar spine BMD, and lumbar spine trabecular bone score (TBS) as secondary outcomes, all assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 mo with dual- X-ray absorptiometry.Baseline total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine BMDs were 1.016 ± 0.160, 0.941 ± 0.142, and 1.287 ± 0.246 g/cm2, respectively; lumbar TBS was 1.398 ± 0.109. Despite significant weight loss achieved in the WL group (6.6 ± 0.4 kg; 8.6% ± 0.4% of baseline weight), 6-mo regional BMD estimates were similar to those in the WS group (all P > 0.05).

This research aims at utilizing noise through using piezoelectric materials as an approach of conversion to produce green sustainable electric  that can be used to decrease the  consumption from non-renewable sources and utilizing this  in street lighting. The study was carried in three bus stations in Alexandria by having measurements during weekdays and weekends in order to study the noise produced in the selected stations and the amount of electric  that could be produced and utilized in street lighting. The noise level index LDEN was calculated for each of the three selected locations. The equivalent noise level values were always exceeding the limits through the day, evening and night. At daytime they ranged between 75-85 dB which is higher that the permissible limit by 10-20 dB, at evening they ranged from 80-85 dB which is also higher than the permissible limit with 20-25 dB and at the night they ranged from 75-80 dB which is higher by 20-25 dB than the permissible limit. The research concluded that utilizing noise using the piezoelectric material is successful. The electric  produced from an area of 1.45  containing 690 piezoelectric QB220-503YB transducers at each of the selected stations was about 0.024 watt hr. This amount of electric  is too small to be used in an application.

Aging causes primary sarcopenia, while secondary causes include chronic kidney disease (CKD), long-term use of glucocorticoids and obesity. The aim of this study was to evaluate: the prevalence of sarcopenia using guidelines recommended by The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP,2010; EWGSOP2,2018) and the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health (FNIH); and analyse the relationship between sarcopenia and body adiposity in adult renal transplant recipients (RTR) . This was a cross-sectional study in adult RTR (body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5kg/). Body composition was evaluated by dual  x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and anthropometry. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) by CKD-EPI equation. The prevalence of sarcopenia in adult RTR (n=185; 57% men, 50 years and eGFR 55.80±1.52ml/min.) was 7% (FNIH), 11% (EWGSOP2) and 17% (EWGSOP). Low muscle mass, muscle function, and physical performance affected respectively up to 28%, 46% and 10% of the participants. Body adiposity evaluated by anthropometry and by DXA (% trunk fat) was lower in participants with sarcopenia according to EWGSOP and EWGSOP2. Conversely, according to FNIH criteria, RTR with sarcopenia presented higher waist-to-height-ratio. This study suggests that: adult RTR sarcopenia prevalence varies according to the diagnostic criteria; low muscle mass, low muscle function and low physical performance are common conditions; body adiposity association with sarcopenia depends on the criteria used to define this syndrome; and FNIH criteria detected higher adiposity in individuals with sarcopenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657952>Changes in Lean Mass, Absolute and Relative Muscle Strength, and Physical Performance After Gastric Bypass Surgery.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery results in reduced muscle mass as weight is lost, but postoperative changes in muscle strength and performance are incompletely understood.To examine changes in body composition, strength, physical activity, and physical performance following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).In a prospective cohort of 47 adults (37 women, 10 men) aged 45 ± 12 years (mean ± SD) with body mass index (BMI) 44 ± 8 kg/, we measured body composition by dual- X-ray absorptiometry, handgrip strength, physical activity, and physical performance (chair stand time, gait speed, 400-m walk time) before and 6 and 12 months after RYGB. Relative strength was calculated as absolute handgrip strength/BMI and as absolute strength/appendicular lean mass (ALM).Participants experienced substantial 12-month decreases in weight (-37 ± 10 kg or 30% ± 7%), fat mass (-48% ± 12%), and total lean mass (-13% ± 6%).

Insulin sensitivity is impaired by short-term, complete  restriction, but the effects of IER are not well known. In randomised order, fourteen lean men (age: 25 (sd 4) years; BMI: 24 (sd 2) kg/; body fat: 17 (4) %) consumed 24-h diets providing 100 % (10 441 (sd 812) kJ;  balance (EB)) or 25 % (2622 (sd 204) kJ;  restriction (ER)) of estimated  requirements, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g of glucose drink) after fasting overnight. Plasma/serum glucose, insulin, NEFA, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were assessed before and after (0 h) each 24-h dietary intervention, and throughout the 2-h OGTT. Homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) assessed the fasted response and incremental AUC (iAUC) or total AUC (tAUC) were calculated during the OGTT. At 0 h, HOMA2-IR was 23 % lower after ER compared with EB (P<0·05). During the OGTT, serum glucose iAUC (P<0·001), serum insulin iAUC (P<0·05) and plasma NEFA tAUC (P<0·01) were greater during ER, but GLP-1 (P=0·161), GIP (P=0·473) and FGF21 (P=0·497) tAUC were similar between trials. These results demonstrate that severe  restriction acutely impairs postprandial glycaemic control in lean men, despite reducing HOMA2-IR.

Subsets of microcosms were destructively sampled periodically during this period to determine tick survivorship and physiological age. Across all sites tick mortality was low during the winter and increased in the spring and early summer, coincident with increasing  use. Neither  use nor mortality differed significantly between sites with high vs low natural tick density, but we did observe a significant positive relationship between soil organic matter content and the survival of I. scapularis during the spring.

Objective The aim of the present study was to determine the association between nutrition knowledge (NK) and adherence to MDP in Iranian female adolescents. Subjects This cross-sectional study was conducted on 297 female adolescents aged 15-18 years. Methods The participants were interviewed using a valid and structured questionnaire to collect information on socio-demographic, lifestyle and anthropometric variables. Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated 168-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Adherence to MDP was measured by the Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS). Each participant's NK was determined using a 20-item NK questionnaire. Results The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age and body mass index (BMI) of participants were 16.1 ± 0.9 years and 22.3 ± 4.6 kg/, respectively. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] of the NK score and the MSDPS were 80.0 (68.0-87.0) and 15.2 (11.9-19.5), respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of higher adherence to MDP in the highest tertile of the NK score was 2.19 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-3.95; p for trend = 0.009], compared to the lowest tertile after adjusting for age and  intake. In a multivariable-adjusted model, after further adjustment for BMI, mother's/father's education level, mother's/father's employment status, parent's marital status and physical activity, the subjects in the highest tertile of the NK score had higher adherence to MDP compared with those in the lowest tertile (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.09-3.83; p for trend = 0.013). Conclusion Our findings support the hypothesis that a higher NK score is significantly associated with a higher MDP adherence score in Iranian female adolescents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896691>A template-assisted strategy to synthesize a dilute CoNi alloy incorporated into ultramicroporous carbon for high performance supercapacitor application.</a></h2><p>Carbon is widely studied as an electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) electrode material due to its high specific surface area and good electronic conductivity. However, the low capacitance and  density limit its further commercial applications. Herein, we report a facile and novel synthesis of dilute CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded into ultramicroporous carbon (CoNi/UMCs) via a template-assisted strategy using SBA-15 as a template. The CoNi alloy serves as not only the electron collector to decrease the conductivity during tests, but also creates CoNi oxide/oxhydroxide on the alloy surface in an alkali solution, promoting redox reactions in pseudocapacitors, enhancing the performance of supercapacitors. Interestingly, the final morphology of the composite is not transferred from SBA-15 and the ultramicropores absolutely come from sucrose itself. However, the presence of SBA-15 can definitely enlarge the surface area of the CoNi/UMCs. After carefully tailoring the loading of CoNi, we find that 0.95% CoNi/UMCs exhibit a high surface area of 613  g-1 with regular ultramicropores of 0.57 nm. Due to the synergistic effect of porous carbon and CoNi alloy, the unique 0.95% CoNi/UMCs exhibit a high specific capacitance of up to 268 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution and a high capacitance retention ratio of 97.8% after 10 000 cycles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917166>The physicochemical and biomechanical profile of forsterite and its osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells.</a></h2><p>It has been demonstrated that nanocrystalline forsterite powder synthesised using urea as a fuel in sol-gel combustion method had produced a pure forsterite (FU) and possessed superior bioactive characteristics such as bone apatite formation and antibacterial properties. In the present study, 3D-scaffold was fabricated using nanocrystalline forsterite powder in polymer sponge method. The FU scaffold was used in investigating the physicochemical, biomechanics, cell attachment, in vitro biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation properties. For physicochemical characterisation, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),  dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectrometer (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) were used. FTIR, EDX, XRD peaks and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated correlating to FU. The XPS confirmed the surface chemistry associating to FU. The BET revealed FU scaffold surface area of 12.67 /g and total pore size of 0.03 cm3/g. Compressive strength of the FU scaffold was found to be 27.18 ± 13.4 MPa. The human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) characterisation prior to perform seeding on FU scaffold verified the stromal cell phenotypic and lineage commitments. SEM, confocal images and presto blue viability assay suggested good cell attachment and proliferation of hBMSCs on FU scaffold and comparable to a commercial bone substitutes (cBS). Osteogenic proteins and gene expression from day 7 onward indicated FU scaffold had a significant osteogenic potential (p<0.05), when compared with day 1 as well as between FU and cBS. These findings suggest that FU scaffold has a greater potential for use in orthopaedic and/or orthodontic applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305927>Appetite Control Is Improved by Acute Increases in  Turnover at Different Levels of  Balance.</a></h2><p>Weight control is hypothesized to be improved when physical activity and  intake are both high [high  turnover (ET)].The impact of three levels of ET on short-term appetite control is therefore investigated at fixed levels of  balance.In a randomized crossover trial, 16 healthy adults (25.1 ± 3.9 y of age; body mass index, 24.0 ± 3.2 kg/) spent three daylong protocols for four times in a metabolic chamber. Four conditions of  balance (ad libitum  intake, zero  balance, -25% caloric restriction, and +25% overfeeding) were each performed at three levels of ET (PAL 1.3 low, 1.6 medium, and 1.8 high ET; by walking on a treadmill). Levels of appetite hormones ghrelin, GLP-1, and insulin (total area under the curve) were measured during 14 hours. Subjective appetite ratings were assessed by visual analog scales.Compared with high ET, low ET led to decreased GLP-1 (at all  balance conditions: P < 0.001) and increased ghrelin concentrations (caloric restriction and overfeeding: P < 0.001), which was consistent with higher feelings of hunger (zero  balance: P < 0.001) and desire to eat (all  balance conditions: P < 0.05) and a positive  balance during ad libitum intake (+17.5%; P < 0.001).Appetite is regulated more effectively at a high level of ET, whereas overeating and consequently weight gain are likely to occur at low levels of ET. In contrast to the prevailing concept of body weight control, the positive impact of physical activity is independent from burning up more calories and is explained by improved appetite sensations.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921398>A new nutritional risk index for predicting mortality in hemodialysis patients: Nationwide cohort study.</a></h2><p>Protein  wasting (PEW) is a risk factor for death. However, the cutoff vales for PEW are not optimized for early identification of hemodialysis patients with malnutrition. We evaluated the prognosis of Japanese maintenance hemodialysis patients using nutritional indices optimized for them.We analyzed data from a nation-wide prospective cohort study of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy Renal Data Registry to develop and validate a nutritional risk index (n = 48349, 48349, respectively). The association of nutritional factors with one-year death was tested using Cox proportional hazards models. Their cutoff levels were determined from the hazard ratios or receiver operating characteristic curves. Then, risk index was developed using scoring models.Male was 61.4%; average age, 65.7±12.2 years; and diabetes mellitus, 32.8%. Four clinical factors were retained in the final model: low BMI (<20kg/), yes = 3, no = 0; low serum albumin level (young <3.7g/dL; old <3.5g/dL), yes = 4, no = 0; abnormal serum total cholesterol level, low (<130mg/dL) = 1, high (220≥mg/dL) = 2, no = 0; low serum creatinine level (young female, <9.7mg/dL; old female, <8.0mg/dL; young male, <11.6mg/dL; old male, <9.7mg/dL), yes = 4, no = 0. In the validation dataset, medium- and high-risk groups (total score 8 to 10; 11 or more) showed a higher risk of all-cause death than the low-risk group (0 to 7): medium-risk group (10.5%), hazard ratio adjusted for baseline characteristics 1.96 (95% confidence interval 1.77, 2.16); high-risk group (8.2%), 3.91 (3.57, 4.29). The medium- and high-risk groups also showed a higher risk of cardiovascular disease- and infection-caused deaths than the low-risk group.We developed a new nutritional risk index for hemodialysis patients, which may detect patients with malnutrition with a high-risk of death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125522>A Biomimetic Hierarchical Nanointerface Orchestrates Macrophage Polarization and Mesenchymal Stem Cell Recruitment To Promote Endogenous Bone Regeneration.</a></h2><p>The host immune response to bone biomaterials is vital in determining scaffold fates and bone regeneration outcomes. The nanometer-scale interface of biomaterials, which independently controls physical inputs to cells, regulates osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and local immune response. Herein, we fabricated biomimetic hierarchical intrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (HIMC) with a bone-like staggered nanointerface and investigated its immunomodulatory properties and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) recruitment during endogenous bone regeneration. The acquired HIMC potently induced neo-bone formation by promoting CD68CD163  macrophage polarization and CD146STRO-1 host MSC recruitment in critical-sized bone defects. Mechanistically, HIMC facilitated  macrophage polarization and interleukin (IL)-4 secretion to promote MSC osteogenic differentiation. An anti-IL4 neutralizing antibody significantly reduced  macrophage-mediated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Moreover, HIMC-loaded-IL-4 implantation into critical-sized mandible defects dramatically enhanced bone regeneration and CD68CD163  macrophage polarization. The depletion of monocyte/macrophages by clodronate liposomes significantly impaired bone regeneration by HIMC, but did not affect MSC recruitment. Thus, in emulating natural design, the hierarchical nanointerface possesses the capacity to recruit host MSCs and promote endogenous bone regeneration by immunomodulation of macrophage polarization through IL-4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996297>Loss of PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells promotes colitis-associated colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), the key glycolytic enzyme, influence altered  metabolism including glycolysis in cancer. In this study, we found that PKM2 was highly expressed in patients with ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer (CRC). We then investigated the effectiveness of conditionally ablating PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISC) using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC (AOM plus DSS). Tamoxifen-inducible Lgr5-driven deletion of PKM2 in ISC (PKM2-Tx) significantly promoted tumor incidence and size in the colon and lower body weight compared with findings in vehicle-treated mice (PKM2-Veh). Histopathologic analysis revealed considerable high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the colon of PKM2-Tx mice while PKM2-Veh mice had low- and high-grade dysplasia. Loss of PKM2 was associated with dominant expression of PKM1 in Lgr5 ISC and their progeny cells. Further, the organoid-forming efficiency of whole cancer cells or Lgr5 cells obtained from colon polyps of PKM2-Tx mice was significantly increased when compared with PKM2-Veh mice. Cancer organoids from PKM2-Tx mice exhibited increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and a shift of metabolites involved in  metabolism. These findings suggest that loss of PKM2 function in ISC promotes colitis-associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30649213>Changes in blood lipid concentrations associated with changes in intake of dietary saturated fat in the context of a healthy low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet: a secondary analysis of the Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) trial.</a></h2><p>For low-carbohydrate diets, a public health approach has focused on the replacement of carbohydrates with unsaturated fats. However, little research exists on the impacts of saturated fat intake on the lipid profile in the context of whole-food-based low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets.The primary aim of this secondary analysis of the DIETFITS weight loss trial was to evaluate the associations between changes in percentage of dietary saturated fatty acid intake (%SFA) and changes in low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, and triglyceride concentrations for those following a healthy low-carbohydrate (HLC) diet. The secondary aim was to examine these associations specifically for HLC dieters who had the highest 12-month increases in %SFA.In the DIETFITS trial, 609 generally healthy adults, aged 18-50 years, with body mass indices of 28-40 kg/ were randomly assigned to a healthy low-fat (HLF) or HLC diet for 12 months. In this analysis, linear regression, both without and with adjustment for potential confounders, was used to measure the association between 12-month change in %SFA and blood lipids in 208 HLC participants with complete diet and blood lipid data.Participants consumed an average of 12-18% of calories from SFA. An increase of %SFA, without significant changes in absolute saturated fat intake, over 12 months was associated with a statistically significant decrease in triglycerides in the context of a weight-loss study in which participants simultaneously decreased carbohydrate intake. The association between increase in %SFA and decrease in triglycerides was no longer significant when adjusting for 12-month change in carbohydrate intake, suggesting carbohydrate intake may be a mediator of this relationship.Those on a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet who increase their percentage intake of dietary saturated fat may improve their overall lipid profile provided they focus on a high-quality diet and lower their intakes of both calories and refined carbohydrates.

The cognitive tests used were the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB) for Spatial Working Memory (SWM) including the total number of errors (SWMTE) and strategy (SWMS). Included as possible moderators were sleep quality, mood states, perceived stress, and  expenditure. Analyses were performed at baseline and months 12 and 24.After adjustments, there was a significantly greater improvement in working memory assessed by the SWM for CR individuals, compared to AL. At month 24, it was related mostly to lower protein intake, compared to other macronutrients. Changes in SWM were moderated by changes in sleep quality, physical activity, and  expenditure.On the long term, CR in healthy individuals seems to have a slightly positive effect on working memory. The study of brain CR targets opens new possibilities to prevent and treat cognitive deficits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216384>Autologous transplantation of photoactivated subcutaneous adipose tissue improves glucose homeostasis in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence indicates that normal adipose tissue transplantation improves whole-body  metabolism and glucose homeostasis in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Adipose tissue macrophages are associated with glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and obesity in humans, offering a potential target for therapeutics. However, whether transplantation of autologous adipose tissue that changes the macrophage phenotype directly contributes to systemic glucose intolerance has not been determined. We specifically developed our device, with more refined wavelengths of light to activate the macrophage phenotype in isolated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from host HFD mice. Autologous transplantation of photoactivated sWAT into HFD mice significantly reverses the M1 macrophage phenotype into , reduces the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissues of HFD mice, and decreases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, this transplantation reduced blood glucose levels and caused significant improvement in glucose tolerance, which was not shown in sham-operated or nonphotoactivated sWAT-transplanted HFD mice. Moreover, positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher glucose uptake in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal sWAT. These data suggested that the ability of photoactivation to shift Adipose tissue macrophage polarization in HFD mice caused a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and that autologous transplantation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383823>The Need for a New Cut-off Value to Increase Diagnostic Performance of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Compared with Dual- X-ray Absorptiometry to Measure Muscle Mass in Indonesian Elderly.</a></h2><p>the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is affected by the population setting, the type of BIA, and the cut-off point being used.

Here, superatomic molecules MM@Li (M/M = Ti and W) are built with our recently discovered tetrahexahedral superatoms Ti@Li and W@Li. A low- face-sharing bi-tetrahexahedral structure with a high symmetry of D is identified by global minimum structure search and frequency calculations. The number of shared Li atoms amounts to 6, which is rarely seen before. Molecular orbital and chemical bonding analyses reveal that although isolated superatoms Ti@Li and W@Li are nonmagnetic, Ti@Li is an open-shell superatomic molecule with a magnetic moment of 2 μ, whereas for W@Li, the electronic shell remains closed. In both Ti@Li and W@Li, a quadruple superbonding between superatoms is found. Interestingly, an assembly of two hetero-tetrahexahedral superatoms Ti@Li and W@Li also gives a face-sharing bi-tetrahexahedral structure but with a notable dipole moment. This study provides a basic understanding for the superatomic bonding of Ti@Li and W@Li, which may aid their application in developing multi-superatom molecules or even bulk crystals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337202>Comparison of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption of different exercises in normal weight obesity women.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) between different types of exercises in women with normal weight obesity (NWO).Nine university students with NWO having body mass index <25 kg/ and body fat percentage >30% participated in the study. First, continuous exercise (CEx) on an ergometer for 30 minutes at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and interval exercise (IEx) at 80% VO2max for 2 minutes were performed. This was followed by exercise performed at 40% VO2max for 1 minute and at 80% VO2max for 3 minutes, performed 6 times repeatedly for a total of 26 minutes. The accumulation of short duration exercise (AEx) was performed for 3-bouts of 10 minutes each at 60% VO2max.The major findings were as follows:  consumption during the exercises showed no significant difference between CEx, IEx, and AEx; EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx as compared to CEx for all dependent variables (e.g. total oxygen consumption, total calorie, summation of heart rate, and EPOC duration); and the lipid profile showed no significant difference.Our study confirmed that when homogenizing the  expenditure for various exercises in NWO individuals, EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx than in CEx. Therefore, IEx and AEx can be considered as effective exercise methods for increasing  expenditure in NWO females.©2019 The Korean Society for Exercise Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237570>A Mobile System to Improve Quality of Life Via  Balance in Breast Cancer Survivors (BENECA mHealth): Prospective Test-Retest Quasiexperimental Feasibility Study.</a></h2><p> balance is defined as the difference between  expenditure and  intake. The current state of knowledge supports the need to better integrate mechanistic approaches through effective studies of  balance in the cancer population because of an observed significant lack of adherence to healthy lifestyle recommendations. To stimulate changes in breast cancer survivors' lifestyles based on  balance, our group developed the BENECA ( Balance on Cancer) mHealth app. BENECA has been previously validated as a reliable  balance monitoring system.Based on our previous results, the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of BENECA mHealth in an ecological clinical setting with breast cancer survivors, by studying (1) its feasibility and (2) pretest-posttest differences with regard to breast cancer survivor lifestyles, quality of life (QoL), and physical activity (PA) motivation.Eighty breast cancer survivors diagnosed with stage I to IIIA and with a body mass index over 25 kg/ were enrolled in this prospective test-retest quasi-experimental study. Patients used BENECA mHealth for 8 weeks and were assessed at baseline and the postintervention period. Feasibility main outcomes included percentage of adoption, usage, and attrition; user app quality perception measured with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS); satisfaction with the Net Promoter Score (NPS); and barriers and facilitators of its use. Clinical main outcomes included measuring QoL with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire Core 30 (EORT QLQ-C30), PA assessment with accelerometry, PA motivation measure with a Spanish self-efficacy scale for physical activity (EAF), and body composition with dual- x-ray absorptiometry. Statistical tests (using paired-sample t tests) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed.BENECA was considered feasible by the breast cancer survivors in terms of use (76%, 58/76), adoption (69%, 80/116), and satisfaction (positive NPS). The app quality score did not make it one of the best-rated apps (mean 3.71, SD 0.47 points out of 5). BENECA mHealth improved the QoL of participants (global health mean difference [MD] 12.83, 95% CI 8.95-16.71, P<.001), and EAF score (global MD 36.99, 95% CI 25.52-48.46, P<.001), daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (MD 7.38, 95% CI 0.39-14.37, P=.04), and reduced body weight (MD -1.42, 95% CI -1.97 to -0.87, P<.001).BENECA mHealth can be considered feasible in a real clinical context to promote behavioral changes in the lifestyles of breast cancer survivors, but it needs to be enhanced to improve user satisfaction with use and functionality. This study highlights the importance of the use of mobile apps based on  balance and how the QoL of breast cancer survivors can be improved via monitoring.©Mario Lozano-Lozano, Irene Cantarero-Villanueva, Lydia Martin-Martin, Noelia Galiano-Castillo, Maria-José Sanchez, Carolina Fernández-Lao, Paula Postigo-Martin, Manuel Arroyo-Morales.

This energetically favorable reaction drives many energetically unfavorable reactions. An accepted catalytic model of pyrophosphatase shows that a water molecule activated by two divalent cations (M1 and ) within the catalytic center can attack pyrophosphate in an S2 mechanism and thus hydrolyze the molecule. However, our co-crystal structure of  pyrophosphatase with pyrophosphate shows that a water molecule from the solvent may, in fact, be the actual catalytic water. In the co-crystal structure of the wild-type pyrophosphatase with pyrophosphate, the electron density of the catalytic centers of each monomer are different from one another. This indicates that pyrophosphates in the catalytic center are dynamic. Our mass spectroscopy results have identified a highly conserved lysine residue (Lys30) in the catalytic center that is phosphorylated, indicating that the enzyme could form a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate during hydrolysis. Mutation of Lys30 to Arg abolished the activity of the enzyme. In the structure of the apo wild type enzyme, we observed that a Na ion is coordinated by residues within a loop proximal to the catalytic center. Therefore, we mutated three key residues within the loop (K143R, P147G, and K149R) and determined Na and K-induced inhibition on their activities. Compared to the wild type enzyme, P147G is most sensitive to these cations, whereas K143R was inactive and K149R showed no change in activity. These data indicate that monovalent cations could play a role in down-regulating pyrophosphatase activity in vivo. Overall, our results reveal new aspects of pyrophosphatase catalysis and could assist in the design of specific inhibitors of  growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049566>Metabolomics Reveal Altered Postprandial Lipid Metabolism After a High-Carbohydrate Meal in Men at High Genetic Risk of Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene confers one of the strongest genetic predispositions to type 2 diabetes, but diabetes development can be modified by diet.The aim of our study was to evaluate postprandial metabolic alterations in healthy men with a high genetic risk of diabetes, after two meals with varying macronutrient content.The study was conducted in 21 homozygous nondiabetic men carrying the high-risk (HR, n = 8, age: 31.2 ± 6.3 y, body mass index (BMI, kg/) 28.5 ± 8.1) or low-risk (LR, n = 13, age: 35.2 ± 10.3 y, BMI: 28.1 ± 6.4) genotypes at the rs7901695 locus. During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of ) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of ). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics. Metabolic fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer.In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP) = 1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP = 1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP = 1.1-1.3), as well as arachidonic (-36%, VIP = 1.4) and oleic (-63%, VIP = 1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP = 1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP = 1.4-2.2), uric acid (-59%, VIP = 1.5), and pyroglutamic acid (-65%, VIP = 1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP = 1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP = 1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty acid amides were higher (51-508%, VIP = 1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals.In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate lipid metabolism are induced by an HC-meal.
