According to the latter, a direct chlorine transfer to the lanthanide cation, which has been observed previously for fluorine abstraction from fluorobenzene, is not operative for the C6 H5 Cl/Ln(+) couples; rather, chlorine transfer proceeds through an initial coordination of the lanthanide cation to the aromatic ring of the substrate. Both, the product distribution and the chlorine abstraction efficiencies are affected by the bond dissociation  (BDE(Ln(+) Cl)) as well as the promotion energies of Ln(+) to attain a 4f(n)  5d(1)  (1) configuration. In addition, mechanistic aspects of some CH and CC bond activations are presented. Where appropriate, comparison with the previously studied C6 H5 F/Ln(+) systems is made.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A repeated-measures analysis of covariance examined differences in METs while controlling for skill level. : Data indicated a main effect for interval condition ( = 2, 123,  = 94.36,  <.001, 2 = .605). Post hoc -tests demonstrated decreasing performance interval times yielded progressively higher METs ( <.001) across the three conditions (30s = 4.5±0.8 METs, 12s = 6.3±1.3,  = 8.3±1.6). There also was a main effect for sex ( = 1,120,  = 52.28,  <.001 2 = .305). Boys demonstrated higher METs at each performance interval ( <.001). : Skill practice with a maximum of one trial every 30s resulted in the equivalent of at least moderate physical activity (>4.0 METs) and intervals of  demonstrated vigorous physical activity (>7.0 METs).

For example, there are contradicting theoretical reports on the role of the organic methylammonium cation (CH NH ) in the methylammonium lead triiodide (CH NH PbI ) perovskite film. From one side it is reported that the organic cation does not contribute to electronic structure of the CH NH PbI film. From the other side, valence band maximum fluctuations, dependent on the CH NH rotation, have been theoretically predicted. The resonant X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reported here show experimental evidence of nitrogen contribution to the CH NH PbI electronic structure. Moreover, the observed strong resonances of nitrogen with the I 5s and the Pb 5d- levels indicate that the CH NH PbI valence band is extended up to ≈18 eV below the Fermi , and therefore one should also consider these shallow core levels while modeling its electronic structure.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, Nb-doped WO mesoporous films as integrated high-quality cathode are successfully constructed via a facile sol-gel method. Chemical state and crystallinity of the WO based films are significantly influenced by doping concentration. Compared with the pure WO, the optimal Nb-doped film shows improved optical-electrochemical properties with high specific capacity (74.4 mAh g at 2 A g), excellent high-rate capability, large optical contrast (61.7% at 633 nm), and ultra-fast switching speed (3.6 s and 2.1 s for coloring and bleaching process, respectively). These positive features suggest the potential application of Nb-doped WO mesoporous cathode.

The photoelectron spectrum of La(benzene) displays a strong origin band, a short metal-ligand stretching progression, and a weak ring deformation band. Four isomers are considered for La(benzene), and the preferred structure is an inverse sandwich with two La atoms residing on the opposite sides of the benzene ring. The ground electronic state of the inverse sandwich is A (D) with (5d + π*) electron configuration. Ionization removes a La-based  electron and yields a A ion. The spectrum of La(benzene) is similar to the zero-electron kinetic  spectrum reported previously by our group, although the spectral line width is somewhat broader. The measurement of the photoelectron angular distribution of La(benzene) confirms that the ejected electron has largely a p wave character. The metal-ligand bonding of La(benzene) is considerably stronger than that of La(benzene) due to the threefold binding of each La atom in the dilanthanum species and the twofold binding in the monolanthanum complex.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25624483>Charge disproportionation and the pressure-induced insulator-metal transition in cubic perovskite PbCrO3.</a></h1><p>The perovskite PbCrO3 is an antiferromagnetic insulator. However, the fundamental interactions leading to the insulating state in this single-valent perovskite are unclear. Moreover, the origin of the unprecedented volume drop observed at a modest pressure of P = 1.6 GPa remains an outstanding problem. We report a variety of in situ pressure measurements including electron transport properties, X-ray absorption spectrum, and crystal structure study by X-ray and neutron diffraction. These studies reveal key information leading to the elucidation of the physics behind the insulating state and the pressure-induced transition. We argue that a charge disproportionation 3Cr(4+) → 2Cr(3+) + Cr(6+) in association with the -p hybridization on the Pb(2+) is responsible for the insulating ground state of PbCrO3 at ambient pressure and the charge disproportionation phase is suppressed under pressure to give rise to a metallic phase at high pressure. The model is well supported by density function theory plus the correlation  U (DFT+U) calculations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29369106>Evidence-Based Practice in Liposuction.</a></h1><p>The goal of this study is to examine the existing peer reviewed literature comparing modern adjunctive techniques in liposuction including laser-assisted liposuction (LAL) and ultrasound-assisted liposuction (UAL) to standard suction-assisted liposuction (SAL). We intend to interpret these findings into a literature-based clinical application to influence practice patterns.A literature review was conducted using a keyword search in PubMed. Keyword search items included liposuction, lipoplasty, suction assisted liposuction, ultrasound assisted liposuction, laser assisted liposuction, tumescent, liposuction comparison, liposuction review, and combinations therein. Exclusion criteria included articles with a primary focus on histologic effects of  devices, primary animal models, primary opinion papers with no reference to available data, and industry-sponsored publications. Inclusion criteria included articles with direct comparison of liposuction modalities, randomized or blinded studies, and studies with objective outcomes.Twenty-five articles that met the inclusion criteria comparing SAL to UAL or LAL out of 9972 articles identified were obtained. The selected literature was assigned into 3 categories: evidence demonstrating an advantage of 1 modality (SAL, UAL, or LAL) over another, evidence that showed no benefit of 1 modality over another, and evidence that demonstrated risks of complications of 1 modality over another.The benefits of UAL and LAL over SAL include the following: (1) UAL over SAL in the treatment of gynecomastia, (2) LAL and UAL over SAL with decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit in high-volume lipoaspirates, and (3) LAL over SAL with skin tightening in select areas specifically the submental area. Otherwise, the literature demonstrates equivocal results among the described techniques with no clear benefit to set one apart from the other. There appears to be no demonstrable added benefit to the addition of either UAL or LAL that would urge a change in practice patterns outside the exceptions listed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915734>Ce in the +4 oxidation state: Anion photoelectron spectroscopy and photodissociation of small CeOH molecules.</a></h1><p>The anion photoelectron (PE) spectra of a range of small mono-cerium molecular species, along with the CeO and CeO stoichiometric clusters, are presented and analyzed with the support of density functional theory calculations. A common attribute of all of the neutral species is that the Ce centers in both the molecules and clusters are in the +4 oxidation state. In bulk ceria (CeO), an unoccupied, narrow 4f band lies between the conventional valence (predominantly O 2p) and conduction (Ce 5d) bands. Within the CeO, CeOH, and Ce(OH) series, the PE spectra and computational results suggest that the Ce -based molecular orbital is the singly occupied HOMO in CeO but becomes destabilized as the Ce 4f-local orbital becomes stabilized with increasing coordination. CeO, a hyperoxide, undergoes photodissociation with 3.49 eV photon  to form the stoichiometric neutral CeO and O. In the CeO, CeO ,and CeO stoichiometric cluster series, the  destabilization with 4f stabilization is associated with increasing cluster size, suggesting that a bulk-like band structure may be realized with fairly small cluster sizes. The destabilization of the -based molecular orbitals can be rationalized by their diffuse size relative to Ce-O bond lengths in a crystal structure, suggesting that  bands in the bulk may be relegated to the surface.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240127>One-pot synthesis of magnetite nanorods/graphene composites and its catalytic activity toward electrochemical detection of dopamine.</a></h1><p>Magnetite (Fe3O4) nanorods anchored over reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were synthesized through a one-pot synthesis method, where the reduction of GO and in-situ generation of Fe3O4 nanorods occurred concurrently. The average head and tail diameter of Fe3O4 nanorods anchored over the rGO matrix are found to be 32 and 11 nm, respectively, and morphology, structure and diameter of bare Fe3O4 nanorods were not altered even after the composite formation with rGO. The increased structural disorders and decrement in the sp(2) domains stimulated the high electrical conductivity and extended catalytic active sites for the prepared rGO/Fe3O4 nanocomposite. The constructed rGO/Fe3O4/GCE sensor exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the electrooxidation of dopamine (DA) with a quick response time of , a wide linear range between 0.01 and 100.55 µM, high sensitivity of 3.15 µA µM(-1) cm(-2) and a lower detection limit of 7 nM. Furthermore, the fabricated sensor exhibited a practical applicability in the quantification of DA in urine samples with an excellent recovery rate. The excellent electroanalytical performances and straight-forward, surfactant and template free preparation method construct the rGO/Fe3O4 composite as an extremely promising material for the diagnosis of DA related diseases in biomedical applications.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

La(C2H2) is identified as a metallacyclopropene and La(C4H6) as a metallacyclopentene. The three-membered ring is formed by concerted H2 elimination and the five-membered cycle by dehydrogenation and C-C bond coupling. Both metallacycles prefer a doublet ground state with a La -based unpaired electron. Ionization of the neutral doublet state of either complex produces a singlet ion state by removing the La-based electron. The ionization allows accurate measurements of the adiabatic ionization  of the neutral doublet state and metal-ligand and ligand-based vibrational frequencies of the neutral and ionic states. Although the La atom is in a formal oxidation state of +2, the ionization energies of these metal-hydrocarbon cycles are lower than that of the neutral La atom. Deuteration has a small effect on the ionization energies of the two cyclic radicals but distinctive effects on their vibrational frequencies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27469390>Reexamination of structures, stabilities, and electronic properties of holmium-doped silicon clusters HoSi n (n = 12-20).</a></h1><p>The total energies, growth patterns, equilibrium geometries, relative stabilities, hardnesses, intramolecular charge transfer, and magnetic moments of HoSi n (n = 12-20) clusters have been reexamined theoretically using two different density functional schemes in combination with relativistic small-core Stuttgart effective core potentials (ECP28MWB) for the Ho atoms. The results show that when n = 12-15, the most stable structures are predicted to be exohedral frameworks with a quartet ground state, but when n = 16-20, they are predicted to be endohedral frameworks with a sextuplet ground state. These trend in stability across the clusters (gauged from their dissociation energies) was found to be approximately the same regardless of the DFT scheme used in the calculations, with HoSi13, HoSi16, HoSi18, and HoSi20 calculated to be more stable than the other clusters. The results obtained for cluster hardness indicated that doping the Ho atom into Si13 and Si16 leads to the most stable HoSi n clusters, while doping Ho into the other Si n clusters increases the photochemical sensitivity of the cluster. Analyses of intracluster charge transfer and magnetic moments revealed that charge always shifts from the Ho atom to the Si n cluster during the creation of exohedral HoSi n (n = 12-15) structures. However, the direction of charge transfer is reversed during the creation of endohedral HoSi n (n = 16-20) structures, which implies that Ho acts as an electron acceptor when it is encapsulated in the Si n cage. Furthermore, when the most stable exohedral HoSi n (n = 12-15) structures are generated, the 4f electrons of Ho are virtually unchanged and barely participate in intracluster bonding. However, in the most stable endohedral HoSi n (n = 16-20) frameworks, a 4f electron does participate in bonding. It does this by transferring to the 5d orbital, which hybridizes with the  and 6p orbitals and then interacts with Si valence sp orbitals. Meanwhile, the total magnetic moments of the HoSi n (n = 16-20) clusters are considerably higher than those of HoSi n (n = 12-15). Interestingly, the endohedral HoSi16 and HoSi20 clusters can be viewed as the most suitable building blocks for novel high-density magnetic storage nanomaterials and for novel optical and optoelectronic photosensitive nanomaterials, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29807430>-Transfer Kinetics for Xe (6p[1/2]) Atoms in Kr, Ar, Ne, and He.</a></h1><p>The kinetic processes for the Xe (6p[1/2]) atoms in Kr, Ar, Ne, and He buffer gases were studied. We found that Kr, Ar, and Ne atoms can be used to switch the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) channel from 3408 nm (6p[1/2]-'[1/2]) to 3680 nm (5d[1/2]-6p[1/2]), while Xe and He atoms do not show such a phenomenon. This ASE channel switch is mainly ascribed to the fast transfer of 6p[1/2] → 5d[1/2]. On the basis of the rate equations for two-state coupling (-transfer processes between the two states are very rapid), the reason why the ASE channel switch effect normally coincides with a double exponential decay of the spontaneous emission at 828 nm (6p[1/2]-[3/2]) is explained. The actual situations in Xe, Ar, Ne, and He follow this rule. However, the strictly single exponential decay of the spontaneous emission at 828 nm and strong ASE channel switch effect simultaneously emerge in Kr. This indicates that the transfer of 6p[1/2] → 5d[1/2] in Kr does not occur via two-state coupling, but via two steps of near-resonance collision through the 5s[3/2] (Kr) state as the intermediate state (6p[1/2] → 5s[3/2] (Kr) → 5d[1/2]). In addition, we found Xe (6p[1/2]) atoms strongly tend to reach the 6p[3/2], 6p[3/2], and 6p[5/2] states through the 5s[3/2] (Kr) state as the intermediate state in Kr. The 5s[3/2] (Kr) state plays a very important role in the -transfer kinetics for the Xe (6p[1/2]) atoms. Kr is probably an excellent buffer gas for laser systems based on Xe.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29938164>Tailoring Surface Frustrated Lewis Pairs of InO (OH) for Gas-Phase Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Reduction of CO by Isomorphous Substitution of In with Bi.</a></h1><p>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) created by sterically hindered Lewis acids and Lewis bases have shown their capacity for capturing and reacting with a variety of small molecules, including H and CO, and thereby creating a new strategy for CO reduction. Here, the photocatalytic CO reduction behavior of defect-laden indium oxide (InO (OH)  ) is greatly enhanced through isomorphous substitution of In with Bi, providing fundamental insights into the catalytically active surface FLPs (i.e., In-OH···In) and the experimentally observed "volcano" relationship between the CO production rate and Bi substitution level. According to density functional theory calculations at the optimal Bi substitution level, the  electron pair of Bi hybridizes with the oxygen in the neighboring In-OH Lewis base site, leading to mildly increased Lewis basicity without influencing the Lewis acidity of the nearby In Lewis acid site. Meanwhile, Bi can act as an extra acid site, serving to maximize the heterolytic splitting of reactant H, and results in a more hydridic hydride for more efficient CO reduction. This study demonstrates that isomorphous substitution can effectively optimize the reactivity of surface catalytic active sites in addition to influencing optoelectronic properties, affording a better understanding of the photocatalytic CO reduction mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28240901>A-Site and B-Site Charge Orderings in an s-d Level Controlled Perovskite Oxide PbCoO.</a></h1><p>Perovskite PbCoO synthesized at 12 GPa was found to have an unusual charge distribution of PbPbCoCoO with charge orderings in both the A and B sites of perovskite ABO.

Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive spectroscopy show that graphene oxide-coated nanocellulose was partially reduced by both thermal treatment, and further reduced by chemical treatment (ascorbic acid). Fractal nanoplatinum with cauliflower-like morphology was formed on the reduced graphene oxide paper using pulsed sonoelectrodeposition, producing a conductive paper with an extremely high electroactive surface area (0.29±0.13cm(2)), confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The platinum surface was functionalized with either glucose oxidase (via chitosan encapsulation) or a RNA aptamer (via covalent linking) for demonstration as a point of care biosensor. The detection limit for both glucose (0.08±0.02μM) and E. coli O157:H7 (≈4 CFUmL(-1)) were competitive with, or superior to, previously reported devices in the biosensing literature. The response time ( for glucose and 12min for E. coli) were also similar to silicon biochip and commercial electrode sensors. The results demonstrate that the nanocellulose-graphene-nanoplatinum material is an excellent paper-based platform for development of electrochemical biosensors targeting small molecules or whole cells for use in point of care biosensing.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Of these, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) has garnered significant attention due to its record breaking efficiencies, however, there are growing concerns surrounding its long-term stability. Many of the excellent properties seen in hybrid perovskites are thought to derive from the  electronic configuration of lead, a configuration seen in a range of post-transition metal compounds. In this review we look beyond MAPI to other ns solar absorbers, with the aim of identifying those materials likely to achieve high efficiencies. The ideal properties essential to produce highly efficient solar cells are discussed and used as a framework to assess the broad range of compounds this field encompasses. Bringing together the lessons learned from this wide-ranging collection of materials will be essential as attention turns toward producing the next generation of solar absorbers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354123>Matrix Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Studies for the Products of Lead Atom Reactions with Ethane and Halomethanes.</a></h1><p>The insertion products of laser-ablated Pb atom reactions with ethane and mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrahalomethanes in excess argon were prepared and identified from their matrix infrared spectra on the basis of DFT computed frequencies and observed isotopic shifts. Unlike the lighter elements in group 14, the heaviest member lead exists primarily in the oxidation state 2+ using 6p orbitals in reaction products due to relativistic contraction of the  orbital. The C-Pb-X (X = H, F, Cl) bond is close to a right angle, indicating that Pb contributes mostly p-character to the C-Pb and Pb-X bonds. The lead reaction product with ethane is CHCH-Pb-H. The lower  product in the CHFCl reaction is CHF-PbCl, which is photoisomerized to CHCl-PbF. A lead methylidene (CCl-PbCl) was identified only in reactions with CCl. The relatively small  difference between the insertion and methylidene products in the tetrachloride system allows photochemical conversion from the insertion product to the unusual 3+ Pb oxidation-state methylidene. In this case Pb uses three p orbitals in bonding and C is sp hybridized leaving spin paired but not bonding by symmetry single electrons in the C 2p orbital perpendicular to the CCl plane and in the Pb  orbital. More often lead uses 6p orbitals in bonding due to the high electronic promotion  for  electrons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28388376>How Much and What Type of Protein Should a Critically Ill Patient Receive?</a></h1><p>Protein loss, manifested as loss of muscle mass, is observed universally in all critically ill patients. Depletion of muscle mass is associated with impaired function and poor outcomes. In extreme cases, protein malnutrition is manifested by respiratory failure, lack of wound healing, and immune dysfunction. Protecting muscle loss focused initially on meeting  requirements. The assumption was that protein was being used (through oxidation) as an  source. In healthy individuals, small amounts of glucose (approximately 400 calories) protect muscle loss and decrease amino acid oxidation (protein-sparing effect of glucose). Despite expectations of the benefits, the high provision of  (above basal  requirements) through the delivery of nonprotein calories has failed to demonstrate a clear benefit at curtailing protein loss. The protein-sparing effect of glucose is not clearly observed during illness. Increasing protein delivery beyond the normal nutrition requirements (0.8 g/k/d) has been investigated as an alternative solution. Over a dozen observational studies in critically ill patients suggest that higher protein delivery is beneficial at protecting muscle mass and associated with improved outcomes (decrease in mortality). Not surprisingly, new Society of Critical Care Medicine/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition guidelines and expert recommendations suggest higher protein delivery (>1.2 g/kg/d) for critically ill patients. This article provides an introduction to the concepts that delineate the basic principles of modern medical nutrition therapy as it relates to the goal of achieving an optimal management of protein metabolism during critical care illness, highlighting successes achieved so far but also placing significant challenges limiting our success in perspective.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30693927>Adjustable optical nonlinearity in d cations containing chalcogenides via dp hybridization interaction.</a></h1><p>The introduction of d10-metal cations is of importance in the design of infrared nonlinear optical materials. The role of d10-metal cations on the band gap and the second-harmonic generation (SHG) effect as well as the structure-property relationship were investigated in the Li2MGeS4 (M = Cd, Hg) and AB2S4 (A = Cd, Hg; B = Al, Ga) systems by using the first-principles calculations. The results show that the decreased band gap is related to a higher valence band maximum (VBM) caused by the larger dp repulsion from the Hg-5d orbitals and a downshift in the conduction band minimum (CBM) due to the lower  of the Hg- orbitals. In addition, the relatively enhanced SHG response can be attributed to the decreased charge-transfer  and the enhanced hybridization between the S-3p orbitals and the Hg-5d orbitals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26687535>Lattice distortion and orbital hybridization in NdFeO3-PbTiO3 ferroelectric thin films.</a></h1><p>Single-phase xNdFeO3-(1 - x)PbTiO3 thin films with different dopant contents were fabricated on the Pt(111)/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate by a sol-gel route.

Distortion of the TiO6 octahedron was weakened, as investigated by Raman scattering and X-ray absorption spectra. An electronic structural study indicated that the hybridizations between O 2p and Pb  and Ti 3d orbitals were weakened.

While boron in bulk lanthanide hexaboride materials assumes octahedral B units, the monomer assumes a less compact structure to delocalize the charge. Two competitive molecular structures were identified for the anion and neutral species, which include a boat-like structure and a planar or near-planar teardrop structure. Ce adopts different orbital occupancies in the two isomers; the boat-like structure has a 4f superconfiguration while the teardrop favors a 4f  occupancy. The B ligand in these structures carries a charge of -4 and -3, respectively. The teardrop structure, which was calculated to be isoenergetic with the boat structure, was most consistent with the experimental spectrum. B-local orbitals crowd the  window between the Ce 4f and  (HOMO) orbitals. A low-lying transition from the B-based orbitals is observed slightly less than 1 eV above the ground state. The results suggest that edge and corner conductivity involves stabilized, highly diffuse  orbitals or bands rather than the bulk-favored 5d band. High-spin and open-shell low-spin states were calculated to be very close in  for both the anion and neutral, a characteristic that reflects how decoupled the 4f electron is from the B 2p- and Ce -based molecular orbitals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435958>Potential  surface for the reaction Sm + CO → SmO + CO: guided ion beam and theoretical studies.</a></h1><p>The potential  surface (PES) for the oxidation of samarium cations by carbon dioxide is explored both experimentally and theoretically. Using guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometry, several reactions are examined as a function of kinetic . These include the title reaction as well as its reverse along with the collision-induced dissociation of Sm(CO) and OSm(CO) with Xe. Analysis of the kinetic  dependent cross sections yields barriers for the forward and reverse oxidation reaction of 1.77 ± 0.11 and 2.04 ± 0.13 eV, respectively, and Sm-OCO and OSm-CO bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of 0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.97 ± 0.07 eV, respectively. BDEs for Sm(CO) for x = 2 and 3 are also determined as 0.40 ± 0.13 and 0.48 ± 0.12 eV, respectively. The PESs for the title reaction along the sextet and octet spin surfaces are also examined theoretically at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels using both effective core potential and all-electron basis sets. Reasonable agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for the experimentally characterized intermediates, although all-electron basis sets and spin-orbit effects are needed for quantitative agreement. The observed barrier for oxidation is shown to likely correspond to the  of the crossing between surfaces corresponding to the ground state electronic configuration of Sm (F,4f) and an excited surface having two electrons in the valence space (excluding 4f), which are needed to form the strong SmO bond.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27353150>Role of ion-pair states in the predissociation dynamics of Rydberg states of molecular iodine.</a></h1><p>Using femtosecond pump-probe ion imaging spectroscopy, we establish the key role of I(+) + I(-) ion-pair (IP) states in the predissociation dynamics of molecular iodine I2 excited to Rydberg states. Two-photon excitation of Rydberg states lying above the lowest IP state dissociation threshold (1st tier) is found to be followed by direct parallel transitions into IP states of the 1st tier asymptotically correlating to a pair of I ions in their lowest states I(+)((3)P2) + I(-)((1)S0), of the 2nd tier correlating to I(+)((3)P0) + I(-)((1)S0), and of the 3rd tier correlating to I(+)((1)D2) + I(-)((1)S0). Predissociation via the 1st tier proceeds presumably with a delay of 1.6-1.7 ps which is close to the vibrational period in the 3rd tier state (3rd tier-mediated process). The 2nd tier IP state is concluded to be the main precursor for predissociation via lower lying Rydberg states proceeding with a characteristic time of 7-8 ps and giving rise to Rydberg atoms I(5s(2)5p(4)(1)). The channel generating I((2)P3/2) + I((2)P1/2) atoms with total kinetic  corresponding to one-photon excitation is found to proceed via a pump - dump mechanism with dramatic change of angular anisotropy of this channel as compared with earlier nanosecond experiments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27681008>Using cloud models of heartbeats as the entity identifier to secure mobile devices.</a></h1><p>Mobile devices are extensively used to store more private and often sensitive information. Therefore, it is important to protect them against unauthorised access. Authentication ensures that authorised users can use mobile devices. However, traditional authentication methods, such as numerical or graphic passwords, are vulnerable to passive attacks. For example, an adversary can steal the password by snooping from a shorter distance. To avoid these problems, this study presents a biometric approach that uses cloud models of heartbeats as the entity identifier to secure mobile devices. Here, it is identified that these concepts including cloud model or cloud have nothing to do with cloud computing. The cloud model appearing in the study is the cognitive model. In the proposed method, heartbeats are collected by two ECG electrodes that are connected to one mobile device. The backward normal cloud generator is used to generate ECG standard cloud models characterising the heartbeat template. When a user tries to have access to their mobile device, cloud models regenerated by fresh heartbeats will be compared with ECG standard cloud models to determine if the current user can use this mobile device. This authentication method was evaluated from three aspects including accuracy, authentication time and  consumption. The proposed method gives 86.04% of true acceptance rate with 2.73% of false acceptance rate. One authentication can be done in , and this processing consumes about 2000 mW of power.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933492>The First Naked Bismuth-Chalcogen Metal Carbonyl Clusters: Extraordinary Nucleophilicity of the Bi Atom and Semiconducting Characteristics.</a></h1><p>Mixed bismuth-chalcogen-iron clusters [{EFe(CO)}Bi] [E = Te (1a) or Se (1b)] were produced via the reduction of BiCl with [EFe(CO)] under mild conditions. X-ray analysis showed that both clusters 1a and 1b had a square-pyramidal geometry, where the naked Bi and chalcogen both adopted a distorted trigonal-pyramidal configuration with a stereoactive lone pair. Complexes 1a and 1b can be further functionalized by methylation and metalation, which permits the nucleophilicity of the /5s and /4s lone pairs to be compared. In the metalation, the  pair of the Bi atom in 1a and 1b had an extraordinary nucleophilicity toward the unsaturated Cr(CO) fragment, even in the presence of the more chemically active 5s or 4s pair, whereas in the case of methylation, only the 4s pair of Se could be selectively alkylated. Upon oxidation of 1a and 1b with suitable oxidizing agents, NaBiO or KSeO, Bi-E bonded tetrahedral complexes [{EFe(CO)}Bi] [E = Te (4a) or Se (4b)] were formed by the elimination of one Fe(CO) vertex. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that all of the Bi atoms in these complexes had oxidation states close to +1. Due to the electropositive character of the Bi atom, pronounced induced Bi···E inter- and intramolecular interactions were evident in 1a (1b), 4a (4b), and the metalated 3a (3b), where their linear-like ···Bi···E··· or zigzag-like ···Bi-E··· (E = Te or Se) chain or the Bi···E···E···Bi (E = Te or Se) dimeric chain can further expand into the two-dimensional network via nonclassical C-H···O(carbonyl) interactions, supported by noncovalent interaction index and DFT calculations. These positively charged Bi-induced Bi···E (E = Te or Se) and carbonyl-aided weak interactions can facilitate efficient electron transport within these ternary Bi-E-Fe or quaternary Bi-E-Fe-Cr cluster-based frameworks, resulting in semiconducting behavior with surprising ultranarrow  gaps of 1.01-1.21 eV.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797788>An 18-electron system containing a superheavy element: theoretical studies of sg@au12.</a></h1><p>M@Au12 cage molecules (M = transition element from group 6) are interesting clusters with high-symmetric structure and significant stability. As the heavier homologue of W is (106)Sg, it is interesting to pinpoint whether the Sg@Au12 cluster is also stable. Geometric and electronic structures and bonding of various Sg@Au12 isomers were investigated with density functional theory (PW91, PBE, B3LYP) and wave function theory (MP2, CCSD(T)) approaches. The lowest- isomer of Sg@Au12 has icosahedral symmetry with significant Sg(6d)-Au() covalent-metallic interaction and is comparable to the lighter homologues (M = Mo, W), with similar binding , although Sg follows (as a rare case) the textbook rule "ns below (n - 1)d". The 12  valence electrons from Au12 and the six 7s6d ones from Sg can be viewed as an 18e system below and above the interacting Au 5d band, forming nine delocalized multicenter bond pairs with a high stability of ∼0.8 eV of bond  per each of the 12 Sg-Au contacts. Different prescriptions (orbital, multipole-deformation, charge-partition, and X-ray-spectroscopy based ones) assign ambiguous atomic charges to the centric and peripheral atoms; atomic core-level  shifts correspond to some negative charge shift to the gold periphery, more so for Cr@Au12 than for Sg@Au12 or Au@Au12.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087006>Cardiovascular responses to  drinks in a healthy population during eXercise: The C--X Study.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26871754>Isomorphous Substitution of Rare-Earth Elements in Lacunary Apatite Pb8Na2(PO4)6.</a></h1><p>The substitution of rare-earth elements (REEs) for Pb in the lacunary apatite Pb8Na2(PO4)6 with void structural channels was studied by means of powder X-ray diffraction (including the Rietveld refinement), scanning electron microscopy, -dispersive X-ray microanalysis, and IR spectroscopy and also measurements of the electrical conductivity. The substitution limits (xmax in Pb8-xLnxNa2(PO4)6Ox/2) at 800 °C were found to decrease with the atomic number of the REE from 1.40 for La to 0.12 for Yb with a rapid drop from light to heavy lanthanides (between Gd and Tb). The REE atoms substitute for Pb predominantly at Pb2 sites of the apatite structure according to the scheme 2Pb(2+) + □ → 2Ln(3+) + O(2-), where □ is a vacancy in the structural channel. The substitution in lacunary apatite produces quite different changes in the structural parameters compared with broadly studied alkaline-earth hydroxyapatites. In spite of the much lower ionic radii of REE than that of Pb(2+), the mean distances ⟨Pb1-O⟩ somewhat increase, whereas the distances ⟨Pb2-Pb2⟩ and ⟨Pb2-O4⟩ do not change considerably with the degree of substitution. This implies control of the substitution by not only spatial and charge accommodation of REE ions but also the availability of a stereochemically active (2) electron pair on Pb(2+). The high-temperature electrical conductivity shows dependence on the degree of substitution with a minimum at x = 0.2 indicative of a possible change of the type of conductivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25924007>Above 30% external quantum efficiency in green delayed fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes.</a></h1><p>Highly efficient green thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes with an external quantum efficiency of 31.2% were investigated by using 3-(3-(carbazole-9-yl)phenyl) pyrido[3',2':4,5]furo[2,3-b]pyridine (3CzPFP) derived from carbazole and pyrido[3',2':4,5]furo[2,3-b]pyridine.

The PE spectra all exhibit an intense electronic transition to the neutral ground state, all falling in the range of 0.7 to 1.1 eV electron binding , with polarization dependence consistent with detachment from diffuse Ce -based molecular orbitals. There is no monotonic increase in electron affinity with increasing oxidation. A qualitative picture of how electronic structure evolves with an oxidation state emerges from comparison between the spectra and the computational results. The electronic structure of the smallest metallic cluster observed in this study, Ce, is similar to the bulk structure in terms of atomic orbital occupancy (4f 5d ). Initial cerium cluster oxidation involves largely ionic bond formation via Ce 5d and O 2p orbital overlap (i.e., larger O 2p contribution), with Ce-O-Ce bridge bonding favored over Ce=O terminal bond formation. With subsequent oxidation, the Ce 5d-based molecular orbitals are depleted of electrons, with the highest occupied orbitals described as diffuse Ce  based molecular orbitals. In the y ≤ (x + 1) range of oxidation states, each Ce center has a singly occupied non-bonding 4f orbital. The PE spectrum of CeO is unique in that it exhibits a single nearly vertical transition. The highly symmetric structure predicted computationally is the same structure determined from CeO IR predissociation spectra [A. M. Burow et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 13, 19393 (2011)], indicating that this structure is stable in -1, 0, and +1 charge states. Spectra of clusters with x ≥ 3 exhibit considerable continuum signal above the ground state transition; the intensity of the continuum signal decreases with increasing oxidation. This feature is likely the result of numerous quasi-bound anion states or two-electron transitions possible in molecules with abundant nearly degenerate partially occupied orbitals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28481035>PrB : A Praseodymium-Doped Boron Cluster with a Pr Center Coordinated by a Doubly Aromatic Planar η -B Ligand.</a></h1><p>The structure and bonding of a Pr-doped boron cluster (PrB ) are investigated using photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemistry. The adiabatic electron detachment  of PrB is found to be low [1.47(8) eV]. A large  gap is observed between the first and second detachment features, indicating a highly stable neutral PrB . Global minimum searches and comparison between experiment and theory show that PrB has a half-sandwich structure with C symmetry. Chemical bonding analyses show that PrB can be viewed as a Pr [η -B ] complex with three unpaired electrons, corresponding to a Pr (4f  ) open-shell configuration. Upon detachment of the  electron, the neutral PrB cluster is a highly stable Pr [η -B ] complex with Pr in its favorite +3 oxidation state.

We sought to utilize validated patient-reported outcomes instruments to identify the patient population with the greatest burn-related disability in order to appropriately allocate plastic surgery resources to those in greatest need.The Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Burn-Specific Health Scale-Revised, Brief, and Adapted questionnaires were administered via an interpreter during a plastic surgery trip to Jharkhand, India, in January 2018. Demographics, comorbidities, and burn-specific history were recorded.Twenty-eight postburn patients were surveyed (mean age, 17.0 ± 9.2 years; male:female ratio, 1:2.5). Mean time from injury was 4.74 years. No patient had received formal, primary burn care. Mechanism of injury: flame (39%), oil (32%), scalding water (14%), and other (14%). Fifty-four percent were extremity burns; 25%, facial; and 18%, neck burns. The Burn-Specific Health Scale-Revised, Brief, and Adapted demonstrated that the most significantly impacted domains for all patients were body image and skin sensitivity, with more than 80% of patients complaining of issues with skin sensitivity. In addition, children (aged <18 years) had diminished body image domain scores. RAND SF-36 scores were lowest in the  (73.1 ± 25.0) and general health (76.5 ± 13.8) domains, and females with extremity burns demonstrated statistically significant decreases in their physical limitation domain scores (85.9 ± 17.3, P < 0.05). Females with extremity burns also had statistically significant lower scores in the  domain (64.09 ± 25.75) as compared with their male counterparts with extremity burns (100 ± 0, P = 0.045). In general, females scored lower than did males in multiple domains, and those results reached statistical significance in the  (65.9 ± 24.6 vs 93.6 ± 10.9), emotional (77.2 ± 21.5 vs 95.4 ± 11.2), and general health domains (71.1 ± 11.9 vs 90.0 ± 7.5) with P < 0.05. Children demonstrated significantly diminished scores in the emotional (75.5 ± 24.6) and general health (79.1 ± 11.8) domains.These data demonstrate the significant impact on quality of life that untreated burns have in this population. Male and female children with extremity burns and adult women with extremity burns were most significantly affected in multiple domains. Consequently, children and adult women with extremity burns appear to be the patient cohort with the greatest opportunity to impact their quality of life. These data may be utilized to improve patient triage and resource allocation for future surgical trips but could also be of significant benefit to internal health agencies and ministries for the same purpose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30427335>Excited interatomic potential  surfaces of Rb + He that correlate with Rb terms 5S through 7S.</a></h1><p>The excited state interatomic potential  surfaces for Rb + He are computed at the spin-orbit multi-reference configuration interaction level of theory using all-electron basis sets of triple and quadruple-zeta quality that have been contracted for Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) Hamiltonian and includes core-valence correlation. Davidson-Silver corrections (MRCI+Q) are employed to ameliorate size consistency error.

In the excitation spectra extracted from the 2D-EE scans, two dominant thermally stable sites were identified, consisting of a classic, three-fold split Jahn-Teller band, labeled the blue site, and an unusual asymmetric 2 + 1 split band, the violet site. A much weaker band has also been identified, whose emission is strongly overlapped by the violet site. The temperature dependence of the luminescence for these sites was monitored revealing that the blue site has a non-radiative channel competing effectively with the fluorescence even at 9.8 K. By contrast, the fluorescence decay time of the violet site was recorded to be 4.3 ns and independent of temperature up to 24 K. The nature of the dominant thermally stable trapping sites was investigated theoretically with Diatomics-in-Molecule (DIM) molecular dynamics simulations. The DIM model was parameterized with ab initio multi-reference configuration interaction calculations for the lowest  excited states of the Ba⋅Xe pair. The simulated absorption spectra are compared with the experimental results obtained from site-resolved excitation spectroscopy. The simulations allow us to assign the experimental blue feature spectrum to a tetra-vacancy trapping site in the bulk xenon fcc crystal-a site often observed when trapping other metal atoms in rare gas matrices. By contrast, the violet site is assigned to a specific 5-atom vacancy trapping site located at a grain boundary.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894723>Theory of Valence Transition in BiNiO_{3}.</a></h1><p>Motivated by the colossal negative thermal expansion recently found in BiNiO_{3}, the valence transition accompanied by the charge transfer between the Bi and Ni sites is theoretically studied. We introduce an effective model for Bi- and Ni-3d orbitals taking into account the valence skipping of Bi cations, and investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams within the mean-field approximation. We find that the valence transition is caused by commensurate locking of the electron filling in each orbital associated with charge and magnetic orderings, and the critical temperature and the nature of the transitions are strongly affected by the relative  between the Bi and Ni levels and the effective electron-electron interaction in the Bi sites. The obtained phase diagram well explains the temperature- and pressure-driven valence transitions in BiNiO_{3} and the systematic variation of valence states for a series of Bi and Pb perovskite oxides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357111>Imaging of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Ca Signals in Cultured Astrocytes.</a></h1><p>This unit provides a step-by-step protocol for constructing cell type- and mitochondria-targeted GCaMP genetically encoded Ca indicators (GECIs) for mitochondrial Ca imaging in astrocytes.

The structural characterizations were performed using X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the average particle diameter, which decreased from 4.4nm at 80kGy to 2.8nm at 120kGy. The UV-visible absorption spectrum was measured and found that platinum nanoparticles exhibit two steady absorption maxima in UV regions due to plasmonic excitation of conduction electrons, which blue shifted to lower wavelengths with a decrease in particle size. We consider the conduction electrons of platinum nanoparticles to follow Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-Weizsacker atomic model that they are not entirely free but weakly bounded to particles at lower- states {n = 5, l = 2 or 5d} and {n = 6, l = 0 or }, which upon receiving UV photon  the electrons make intra-band quantum excitations to higher- states allowed by the principles of quantum number that results the absorption maxima. We found an excellent agreement between the experimental and theoretical results, which suggest that the optical absorption of metal nanoparticles could be fundamentally described by a quantum mechanical interpretation, which could be more relevant to photo-catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A diabatization scheme has been designed to obtain the necessary potential  surfaces and couplings for complexes of Ba with an arbitrary number of helium atoms. It involves computing new He-Ba electronic wave functions and expanding them in determinants of the non-interacting complex. The 6p P ←  S photodissociation spectrum of He⋯Ba calculated with this model shows very weak coupling for a single He atom. However, several electronic relaxation mechanisms are identified, which could potentially explain the expulsion of barium ions from helium nanodroplets observed experimentally upon Ba photoexcitation. For instance, an avoided crossing in the ring-shaped HeBa structure is shown to provide an efficient pathway for fine structure relaxation. Symmetry breaking by either helium density fluctuations or vibrations can also induce efficient relaxation in these systems, e.g., bending vibrations in the linear HeBa excimer.

Two isomers of La(CH) are identified as methyl-lanthanacyclopropene [La(CHCCH)] (C) and lanthanacyclobutene [La(CHCHCH)] (C); La(CH) is determined to be H-La(η-allyl) (C), a C-H bond inserted species. All three metal-hydrocarbon radicals prefer a doublet ground state with a La -based electron configuration. Ionization of the neutral doublet state of each of these radicals produces a singlet ion state by removing the La-based  electron. The threshold ionization allows accurate measurements of the adiabatic ionization  of the neutral doublet state and metal-ligand and ligand-based vibrational frequencies of the neutral and ionic states. The formation of the three radicals is investigated by density functional theory computations. The inserted species is formed by La inserting into an allylic C-H bond and lanthanacyclopropene by concerted vinylic H elimination, whereas lanthanacyclobutene involves both allylic and vinylic dehydrogenations. The inserted species is identified as an intermediate for the formation of lanthanacyclobutene.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076464>Effects of Acute Supramaximal Cycle Exercise on Plasma FFA Concentration in Obese Adolescent Boys.</a></h1><p>The aims of the present study are 1) to evaluate the free fatty acid (FFA) profile and 2) to determine the relative anaerobic and aerobic contributions to total  consumption during repeated supramaximal cycling bouts (SCE) in adolescent boys with different body weight statuses.Normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obese (OB) adolescent boys (n =15 per group) completed a SCE sessions consisted of 6 x  maximal sprints with 2 min of passive rest between each repetition. Plasma FFA levels were determined at rest, immediately after a 10 min warm-up, and immediately at the end of SCE. The anaerobic and aerobic contributions (%) were measured via repeated SCE bouts. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) index.The FFA concentrations measured immediately after SCE were higher in the OB group than in the OW and NW (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively) groups. Moreover, the anaerobic contributions to SCE were significantly lower in obese adolescents (p<0.01) and decreased significantly during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th repetitions.

To understand the electronic properties of doped clusters, it is highly desirable to probe the excited state behavior. Here, we report the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of doped M1@Au24(SR)18 (M = Pd, Pt; R = CH2CH2Ph) clusters using femtosecond visible and near infrared transient absorption spectroscopy. Three relaxation components are identified for both mono-doped clusters: (1) sub-picosecond relaxation within the M1Au12 core states; (2) core to shell relaxation in a few picoseconds; and (3) relaxation back to the ground state in more than one nanosecond. Despite similar relaxation pathways for the two doped nanoclusters, the coupling between the metal core and surface ligands is accelerated by over 30% in the case of the Pt dopant compared with the Pd dopant. Compared to Pd doping, the case of Pt doping leads to much more drastic changes in the steady state and transient absorption of the clusters, which indicates that the 5d orbitals of the Pt atom are more strongly mixed with Au 5d and  orbitals than the 4d orbitals of the Pd dopant. These results demonstrate that a single foreign atom can lead to entirely different excited state spectral features of the whole cluster compared to the parent Au25(SR)18 cluster. The detailed excited state dynamics of atomically precise Pd/Pt doped gold clusters help further understand their properties and benefit the development of -related applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29060905>Effects of Nd:YAG laser for the controlled and localized treatment of early gastrointestinal tumors: Preliminary in vivo study.</a></h1><p>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive technique allowing for the removal of early gastrointestinal (GI) tumors, widely considered as a valid alternative to conventional surgery. However, ESD is technically demanding, and potentially severe complications, such as bleeding and perforation, may occur. -based techniques (e.g., radiofrequency ablation) might offer a potential alternative to ESD. However, their use mandates the ability to predict the damage induced and to identify a "signature" of the complete ablation, without the need for a physical specimen. Ideally, an -based procedure should be tunable in order to limit the ablation to the superficial layers, namely mucosa (M) and submucosa (SM), without injuring the muscularis propria (MP), thereby minimizing GI perforation. This experimental study aims to investigate thermal damage induced by Nd:YAG laser on the gastric wall, at different laser settings such as power (P) and time (t). Laser ablation was performed on the stomach wall of 6 Wistar rats. Two powers (2.5W and 1.0W) and 3 exposure times (12s,  and 2s) were tested, for a total of 30 ablations. Histological analysis allowed to assess thermal damage, in terms of damage depth (DD) and identification of involved layers. The ratio (R) between DD and the total depth (TD) of target layers (M+SM) was used as an index to evaluate the effectiveness of laser settings. At P=2.5W, MP was damaged (R>1) in the majority of cases (11/15). At P=1.0W, MP was preserved in all tests (R<;1), and rarely (4/15) did the damage reach the whole SM (R=1). Histopathological analysis evidenced that tissue damage was strongly related to the variable tissue thickness. These preliminary results seem to support the fact that endoscopic tunable laser ablation is feasible with a consistent damage/power correlation. Further tests are required to optimize the settings for applications on early GI tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29380861>All-electron relativistic computations on the low-lying electronic states, bond length, and vibrational frequency of CeF diatomic molecule with spin-orbit coupling effects.</a></h1><p>Ab initio all-electron computations have been carried out for Ce and CeF, including the electron correlation, scalar relativistic, and spin-orbit coupling effects in a quantitative manner. First, the n-electron valence state second-order multireference perturbation theory (NEVPT2) and spin-orbit configuration interaction (SOCI) based on the state-averaged restricted active space multiconfigurational self-consistent field (SA-RASSCF) and state-averaged complete active space multiconfigurational self-consistent field (SA-CASSCF) wavefunctions have been applied to evaluations of the low-lying  levels of Ce with [Xe]4f 5d  and [Xe]4f 5d configurations, to test the accuracy of several all-electron relativistic basis sets. It is shown that the mixing of quartet and doublet states is essential to reproduce the excitation energies. Then, SA-RASSCF(CASSCF)/NEVPT2 + SOCI computations with the Sapporo(-DKH3)-2012-QZP basis set were carried out to determine the  levels of the low-lying electronic states of CeF. The calculated excitation energies, bond length, and vibrational frequency are shown to be in good agreement with the available experimental data.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27472130>Momentum-Resolved Electronic Structure of the High-T_{c} Superconductor Parent Compound BaBiO_{3}.</a></h1><p>We investigate the band structure of BaBiO_{3}, an insulating parent compound of doped high-T_{c} superconductors, using in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on thin films. The data compare favorably overall with density functional theory calculations within the local density approximation, demonstrating that electron correlations are weak. The bands exhibit Brillouin zone folding consistent with known BiO_{6} breathing distortions. Though the distortions are often thought to coincide with Bi^{3+}/Bi^{5+} charge ordering, core level spectra show that bismuth is monovalent. We further demonstrate that the bands closest to the Fermi level are primarily oxygen derived, while the bismuth  states mostly contribute to dispersive bands at deeper binding .

The extent to which this is justifiable is explored via a thorough X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis: spanning core levels, ionization potential, work function, surface contamination, cleaning, band alignment, and valence-band density of states. The XPS analysis overcomes and addresses the shortcomings of prior XPS studies of this material. Temperature-dependent absorption spectra determine a 1.2 eV direct band gap at room temperature; the widely reported 1.4-1.5 eV band gap is attributed to weak transitions from the low density of states of the topmost valence band previously being undetected. Density functional theory HSE06 + SOC calculations determine the band structure, optical transitions, and well-fitted absorption and Raman spectra. Valence band XPS spectra and model calculations find the CBS bonding to be  similar to CIGS and CZTS, but the Bi cations (and formally occupied Bi  orbital) have fundamental impacts: giving a low ionization potential (4.98 eV), suggesting that the CdS window layer favored for CIGS and CZTS gives detrimental band alignment and should be rejected in favor of a better aligned material in order for CBS devices to progress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26669497>Bi-functional Mo-doped WO3 nanowire array electrochromism-plus electrochemical  storage.</a></h1><p>Metal-doping is considered to be an effective way for construction of advanced semiconducting metal oxides with tailored physicochemical properties.

Docking and molecular dynamics studies revealed the better binding interaction of inhibitor binding pocket of deazaflavin dependent nitroreductase (Ddn) with cofactor F420 crystal.For pharmacophore generation and atom-based 3D-QSAR analysis, a dataset of 84 compounds were selected which were carried out using PHASE. The docking studies were performed using Glide module consists of five steps protein preparation, ligand preparation, receptor grid generation, actual docking procedure and finally viewing the docking results using the poseviewer. QikProp provides ranges for comparing a particular molecule's properties with those of 95% of known drugs.

Weak hydrogen bonding observed between N1 atom in imidazole ring and Asn91. The binding of imidazole nucleus occurs at site, which has extensive hydrophobic interaction with Arg60 residues. All these pharmacokinetic parameters within the acceptable range defined for human use, thereby indicating their potential as drug- like molecule. Stability of deazaflavin dependent nitroreductase (Ddn) with molecule 63 complex was evaluated through 100 ns molecular dynamic simulations.

The electronic band structure of thallium halides (TlX, where X = Br and I) show a strong resemblance to lead halide perovskites, where both Pb and Tl exhibit a  inert pair of electrons and strong spin-orbit coupling. Although the crystal structure of TlX is not perovskite, the similarities of its electronic structure with lead halide perovskites motivated us to prepare colloidal TlX NCs. These TlX NCs exhibit a wide bandgap (>2.5 eV or <500 nm) and the potential to exhibit a reduced density of deep defect states. Optical pump terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy with excitation fluence in the range of 0.85-5.86 × 10 photons per cm on NC films shows that the TlBr NCs possess high effective carrier mobility (∼220 to 329 cm V s), long diffusion length (∼0.77 to 0.98 μm), and reasonably high photoluminescence efficiency (∼10%). This combination of properties is remarkable compared to other wide-bandgap (>2.5 eV) semiconductor NCs, which suggests a reduction in the deep-defect states in the TlX NCs.

BPyB molecules coordinately bonded with active Cu adatoms on Cu(111) in the form of complete polygonal rings at low coverages. On Ag(111), BPyB molecules aggregated into two-dimensional islands by relatively weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The coexistence of hydrogen bonds and coordination interaction was observed on the BPyB-covered Au(111) substrate. Density functional theory calculations of the metal-molecule binding  and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to help understand the forming mechanism of molecular superstructures on the surfaces. In particular, the comprehensive orbital composition analysis interprets the observed metal-organic complexes and reveals the importance of relativistic effects for the extraordinary activity of gold adatoms. The relativistic effects cause the  stability of the Au  atomic orbital and decrease the  separation between the Au  and 5d orbitals.

Rietveld structure refinement using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data demonstrated that LN-type PbZnO3 crystallized into a trigonal structure with a polar space group (R3c). The bond valence sum estimated from the interatomic distances indicated that the sample possesses a Pb(4+)Zn(2+)O3 valence state. Polarization could evolve as a result of the repulsion between constituent cations because PbZnO3 does not contain a stereochemical (2) cation or a Jahn-Teller active d(0) cation. Distortion of ZnO6 octahedra resulting from cation shift is comparable with that of d(0) TiO6 in ZnTiO3 and MnTiO3 with LN-type oxides, which leads to stabilization of the polar structure.

Ce(C2H2) formed by hydrogen elimination from ethylene was investigated by mass-analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) spectroscopy, isotopic substitutions, and relativistic quantum chemical computations. The theoretical calculations include a scalar relativistic correction, dynamic electron correlation, and spin-orbit coupling. The MATI spectrum exhibits two nearly identical band systems separated by 128 cm(-1). The separation is not affected by deuteration. The two-band systems are attributed to spin-orbit splitting and the vibrational bands to the symmetric metal-ligand stretching and in-plane carbon-hydrogen bending excitations. The spin-orbit splitting arises from interactions of a pair of nearly degenerate triplets and a pair of nearly degenerate singlets. The organolanthanide complex is a metallacyclopropene in C2v symmetry. The low- valence electron configurations of the neutral and ion species are Ce 4f(1)(1) and Ce 4f(1), respectively.

Defibrillation was performed with an  of 2 J/kg at 10 min after VF and was repeated every 1 or 2 min according to randomization. Advanced cardiac life support, including continuous chest compression with ventilation every 6 s and intravenous injection of 1 mg epinephrine every 3 min, was performed until the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or until 20 min after VF induction. Haemodynamic parameters and baseline arterial blood gas profiles were compared between groups. ROSC, 24 -h survival, and the neurologic deficit score (NDS) were evaluated at 24 h.Haemodynamic parameters during resuscitation and baseline arterial blood gas profiles did not differ between groups. ROSC was more frequently observed in the 1-min interval group (p = 0.047). Time to ROSC was not different between groups (p = 0.054). The 24 -h survival was higher (p = 0.047) and NDS at 24 h was lower (92 ± 175) in the 1-min interval group than in the 2-min interval group (272 ± 190) (p = 0.028).Defibrillation success and resuscitation outcomes were superior when using a 1-min defibrillation interval in animal models of cardiac arrest.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The calculated OH generation rate was 1373.4 μM min in ballast water, which is much higher than that in other advanced oxidative processes such as photocatalysis. As a result, non-indigenous red tide algae were inactivated to meet the ballast water discharge standards (<10 cells mL) of the International Maritime Organization. The ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (F/F) for algal chlorophyll rapidly decreased to zero within a contact time of only 6 s, indicating complete inactivation of algae. Observation under a scanning electron microscope showed no cellular materials were released by algal cells upon OH inactivation. A risk assessment of the OH treatment system was conducted, and the ratios of predicted environmental concentrations to predicted no effect concentrations of all detected disinfection byproducts were less than 1, even at a worst-case oxidant concentration of 2.41 mg L.

Post-Hartree-Fock XANES calculations, coupled with natural population analysis, performed on MP2-optimized Hg[(SR)2···(RSR)n] complexes show that the shape, position, and number of electronic transitions observed at high -resolution are directly correlated to the Hg and S (l,m)-projected empty densities of states and occupations of the hybridized Hg  and 5d valence orbitals. Linear two-coordination, the most common coordination geometry in mercury chemistry, yields a sharp 2p to  + 5d electronic transition. This transition varies in intensity for Hg bonded to thiol groups in macromolecular NOM. The intensity variation is explained by contributions from next-nearest, low-charge, thioether-type RSR ligands at 3.0-3.3 Å from Hg. Thus, Hg in NOM has two strong bonds to thiol S and k additional weak Hg···S contacts, or 2 + k coordination. The calculated stabilization  is -5 kcal/mol per RSR ligand. Detection of distant ligands beyond the first coordination shell requires precise measurement of, and comparison to, spectra of reference compounds as well as accurate calculation of spectra for representative molecular models. The combined experimental and theoretical approaches described here for Hg can be applied to other closed-shell atoms, such as Ag(I) and Au(I). To facilitate further calculation of XANES spectra, experimental data, a new crystallographic structure of a key mercury thioether complex, Cartesian coordinates of the computed models, and examples of input files are provided as Supporting Information .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25565146>Ionic bonding of lanthanides, as influenced by d- and f-atomic orbitals, by core-shells and by relativity.</a></h1><p>Lanthanide trihalide molecules LnX3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) were quantum chemically investigated, in particular detail for Ln = Lu (lutetium). We applied density functional theory (DFT) at the nonrelativistic and scalar and SO-coupled relativistic levels, and also the ab initio coupled cluster approach. The chemically active electron shells of the lanthanide atoms comprise the 5d and  (and 6p) valence atomic orbitals (AO) and also the filled inner 4f semivalence and outer 5p semicore shells. Four different frozen-core approximations for Lu were compared: the (1s(2) -4d(10) ) [Pd] medium core, the [Pd+5s(2) 5p(6) = Xe] and [Pd+4f(14) ] large cores, and the [Pd+4f(14) +5s(2) 5p(6) ] very large core. The errors of LuX bonding are more serious on freezing the 5p(6) shell than the 4f(14) shell, more serious upon core-freezing than on the effective-core-potential approximation. The LnX distances correlate linearly with the AO radii of the ionic outer shells, Ln(3+) -5p(6) and X(-) -np(6) , characteristic for dominantly ionic Ln(3+) -X(-) binding. The heavier halogen atoms also bind covalently with the Ln-5d shell. Scalar relativistic effects contract and destabilize the LuX bonds, spin orbit coupling hardly affects the geometries but the bond energies, owing to SO effects in the free atoms. The relativistic changes of bond  BE, bond length Re , bond force k, and bond stretching frequency vs do not follow the simple rules of Badger and Gordy (Re ∼BE∼k∼vs ). The so-called degeneracy-driven covalence, meaning strong mixing of accidentally near-degenerate, nearly nonoverlapping AOs without BE contribution is critically discussed.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129725>Computational investigation of catalytic effects of CXCOOH (X = F,Cl,H) on the three-component cyclocondensation reaction.</a></h1><p>The mechanism of acetic acid (AA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) catalyzed three-component cyclocondensation reaction to (4S,)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazinane-2-thione was determined via density functional calculations.

We report experiments demonstrating thermal Xe([3/2]2)-Xe(5p(6) (1)S0) atomic collision pairs to be the immediate precursor to the formation of Xe2 (∗)(a(3)Σu (+),A(1)Σu (+)) by the three body process: Xe(∗)() + 2Xe ⟶ Xe2 (∗) + Xe, where the asterisk denotes an excited electronic state. Photoassociating Xe()-Xe atomic pairs by free ⟵ free transitions of the collision complex interrupts the production of the electronically excited Xe dimer, thereby suppressing Xe2 spontaneous emission in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, λ ∼ 172 nm, A(1)Σu (+)→X(1)Σg (+)). Intercepting Xe()-Xe pairs before the complex is stabilized by the arrival of the third atom in the teratomic collision process selectively depletes the pair population in a specific Franck-Condon region determined by the probe laser wavelength (λ). Measurements of the variation of VUV emission suppression with λ provide a spectral signature of the [Xe([3/2]2) - Xe((1)S0)](∗) complex and map the probe laser wavelength onto the thermal  (ϵ″) of the incoming collision pairs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470274>Reduction and oxidation of Au adatoms on the CeO(111) surface - DFT+U versus hybrid functionals.</a></h1><p>Recently we showed that Au atoms may titrate Ce ions in near-surface layers of reduced CeO(111). This surface contained oxygen vacancies in subsurface position within the topmost O-Ce-O trilayer [Pan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2013, 111, 206101.]. The present work builds upon these findings and discusses additional results obtained using PBE+U and hybrid functionals. These approaches do not predict the same relative stabilities for the various adsorption sites of a single Au adatom at an O-defect concentration of a ¼ ML or 1.984 nm. We attribute this discrepancy to a different alignment within the O 2p-Ce 4f gap, i.e. a different order by  of partially occupied Ce 4f and Au  orbitals. The  offset of these orbitals matters, because the adsorption of Au() atop Ce(4f) or atop a subsurface oxygen atom in the first coordination shell of a Ce(4f) involves creation of Au() and Ce(4f) ions. The electron transfer to Au is coupled to stabilizing ionic relaxation in the lattice, commonly known as polaronic distortion, reinforcing the Au-Ce bond. The order of 4f and  orbitals depends on the density functional approximation and is also strongly influenced by the oxygen defect concentration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26875940>Breaking and Making of Carbon-Carbon Bonds by Lanthanides and Third-Row Transition Metals.</a></h1><p>Carbon-atom extrusion from the ipso-position of a halobenzene ring (C6 H5 X; X=F, Cl, Br, I) and its coupling with a methylene ligand to produce acetylene is not confined to [LaCH2 ](+) ; also, the third-row transition-metal complexes [MCH2 ](+) , M=Hf, Ta, W, Re, and Os, bring about this unusual transformation. However, substrates with substituents X=CN, NO2 , OCH3 , and CF3 are either not reactive at all or give rise to different products when reacted with [LaCH2 ](+) . In the thermal gas-phase processes of atomic Ln(+) with C7 H7 Cl substrates, only those lanthanides with a promotion  small enough to attain a 4f(n) 5d(1) (1) configuration are reactive and form both [LnCl](+) and [LnC5 H5 Cl](+) . Branching ratios and the reaction efficiencies of the various processes seem to correlate with molecular properties, like the bond-dissociation energies of the C-X or M(+) -X bonds or the promotion energies of lanthanides.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The observed C-O stretching wavenumber for Ba(CO) of 1911.2 cm is the most red-shifted value measured for any metal carbonyl cations, indicating strong π backdonation of electron density from Ba to CO. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that Ba(CO) has a  Π reference state, which correlates with the  D(5d ) excited state of Ba that comprises significant Ba (5d )→CO(π* LUMO) backbonding, letting the Ba(CO) complex behave like a conventional transition-metal carbonyl. A bonding analysis shows that the π backdonation in Ba(CO) is much stronger than the Ba (5d /)←CO(HOMO) σ donation. The Ba cation in the  D(5d ) excited state is a donor rather than an acceptor. Covalent bonding in the radical anion Ba(CO) takes place mainly through Ba(5d )←CO (π* SOMO) π donation and Ba(5d /)←CO (HOMO) σ donation. The most important valence functions at barium in Ba(CO) cation and Ba(CO) anion are the 5d orbitals.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Gas laser regimes with metastable Ne, Ar, and Kr atoms have been investigated, while studies of RGLs based on metastable Xe are sparse. In this work, when a strong excitation laser (2.92 mJ/pulse, 7.44 × 10 W/cm) was applied to excite Xe atoms from the ground state to the 6p[1/2] state, an interesting phenomenon emerged: An intense fluorescence of 980 nm (6p[1/2]-[3/2]) was produced. However, when the  of excitation laser was decreased to 0.50 mJ/pulse (1.27 × 10 W/cm), the fluorescence of 980 nm became very weak. Besides, lifetime and decay rate constant of the 6p[1/2] state under the condition of E = 2.92 mJ are significantly different from either those measured by other groups or those of E = 0.50 mJ. These phenomena indicate that the high  of excitation laser should trigger some new kinetic mechanisms. Further works identified that the new kinetic mechanism is the MIR ASE of 3408 nm (6p[1/2]-'[1/2]). The mechanisms are proposed as follows. Substantial 6p[1/2] atoms are produced by laser excitation. Then, the ASE of 3408 nm (6p[1/2]-'[1/2]) is quickly produced to populate substantial '[1/2] atoms. The '[1/2] atoms can readily arrive at the 6p[1/2] states through collision by virtue of the small  difference (84 cm) and high collision rate constant of the transition from the '[1/2] state to the 6p[1/2] state. As a result, the intense fluorescence of 980 nm is generated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29244499>Lanthanides as Catalysts: Guided Ion Beam and Theoretical Studies of Sm + COS.</a></h1><p>Reactions of samarium cations with carbonyl sulfide are examined using a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer and a variable temperature selected ion flow tube apparatus. Formation of SmS + CO is observed in both instruments with a kinetic  and temperature dependence demonstrating a barrierless reaction occurring with an efficiency of 26 ± 9%. Formation of SmO + CS is also observed at high kinetic energies and exhibits a threshold determined as 2.81 ± 0.32 eV, substantially higher than expected from known thermochemistry. The potential  surfaces for these reactions along sextet and octet spin surfaces are also examined theoretically at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels. The observed barrier for oxidation is shown to likely correspond to the  of the crossing between surfaces corresponding to the ground state electronic configuration of Sm (F,4f) and an excited surface having two electrons in the valence space (excluding 4f), which are needed to form the strong SmO bond. In contrast, the S-CO bond is activated much more readily because this crossing occurs at much lower energies. This result is attributed to the much weaker S-CO bond  as well as the ability of sulfur to bind effectively at different angles. Although both reactions are spin-forbidden, evidence for a more efficient spin-allowed process is also observed in the SmS + CO cross section.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443655>Imaging of mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics in astrocytes using cell-specific mitochondria-targeted GCaMP5G/: mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and cytosolic Ca2+ availability via the endoplasmic reticulum store.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial Ca(2+) plays a critical physiological role in cellular  metabolism and signaling, and its overload contributes to various pathological conditions including neuronal apoptotic death in neurological diseases. Live cell mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging is an important approach to understand mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics. Recently developed GCaMP genetically-encoded Ca(2+) indicators provide unique opportunity for high sensitivity/resolution and cell type-specific mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging. In the current study, we implemented cell-specific mitochondrial targeting of GCaMP5G/ (mito-GCaMP5G/) and used two-photon microscopy to image astrocytic and neuronal mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics in culture, revealing Ca(2+) uptake mechanism by these organelles in response to cell stimulation. Using these mitochondrial Ca(2+) indicators, our results show that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in individual mitochondria in cultured astrocytes and neurons can be seen after stimulations by ATP and glutamate, respectively. We further studied the dependence of mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics on cytosolic Ca(2+) changes following ATP stimulation in cultured astrocytes by simultaneously imaging mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca(2+) increase using mito-GCaMP5G and a synthetic organic Ca(2+) indicator, x-Rhod-1, respectively. Combined with molecular intervention in Ca(2+) signaling pathway, our results demonstrated that the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is tightly coupled with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of G protein-coupled receptors. The current study provides a novel approach to image mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics as well as Ca(2+) interplay between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, which is relevant for neuronal and astrocytic functions in health and disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Ray et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142, 064305 (2015)] and CeO (y = 1, 2) [J. O. Kafader et al., J. Chem. Phys. 145, 154306 (2016)]. Similar to the results on CeO clusters, the PE spectra of SmO, SmCeO, and SmO (y = 1, 2) all exhibit electronic transitions to the neutral ground state at approximately 1 eV eBE. The Sm centers in SmO and SmO neutrals can be described with the 4f superconfiguration, which is analogous to CeO and CeO neutrals in which the Ce centers can be described with the 4f  superconfiguration (Z = Z - 4). The Sm center in CeSmO, in contrast, has a 4f occupancy, while the Ce center maintains the 4f  superconfiguration. The less oxidized Sm centers in both SmO and SmCeO have 4f  occupancies. The 4f subshell occupancy results in relatively weak Sm-O bond strengths. If this extra 4f occupancy also occurs in bulk Sm-doped ceria, it may play a role in the enhanced O ionic conductivity in Sm-doped ceria. Based on the results of DFT calculations, the heteronuclear Ce-Sm oxides have molecular orbitals that are distinctly localized Sm 4f, Sm , Ce 4f, and Ce  orbitals. The relative intensity of two electronic bands in the PE spectrum of SmO exhibits an unusual photon -dependence, and the PE spectrum of SmO exhibits a photon -dependent continuum signal between two electronic transitions.

More than 3000 geometry optimizations were performed to reveal the structural disorder and identify structures with the lowest energies. The electronic structure calculations provide an averaged band gap of 1.674 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of about 1.6 eV. The simulations of the absorption spectrum for three representative structures with lowest  reproduced the absorption shoulders observed in the experimental spectra. These shoulders are assigned to excitations having similar orbital characters and involving transitions between hybridized (Pb)/5p(I) orbitals and 6p(Pb) orbitals. The geometries of the three structures were analyzed and the effects of the inorganic frame and the CH NH  cations on the absorption properties were estimated. It was found that both changes in the inorganic frame and the CH NH  cations orientations impact the absorption spectra, by modifying the transitions energies and intensities. This highlights the role of CH NH  cation in influencing the absorption properties of CH NH PbI and demonstrates that CH NH  cation is one of the key elements explaining the broad and nearly constant absorption spectrum in the visible range.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Results point to ionically bound, high-spin species. EuH and EuOH anions and neutrals exhibit analogous electronic structures: Transitions from (8)Σ(-) anion ground states arising from the 4f(7)σ()(2) superconfiguration to the close-lying neutral (9)Σ(-) and (7)Σ(-) states arising from the 4f(7)σ() superconfiguration are observed spaced by an  interval similar to the free Eu(+) [4f(7)] (9)S - (7)S splitting.

Despite their ecological and biotechnological importance, studies related to microorganisms from this region are limited. Metagenomics leads to exciting discoveries, mainly regarding non-cultivable microorganisms. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel β-glucosidase (glycoside hydrolase family 1) gene from a metagenome from Lake Poraquê in the Amazon region. The gene encodes a protein of 52.9 kDa, named AmBgl-LP, which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically and structurally characterized. Although AmBgl-LP hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPβG) and the natural substrate cellobiose, it showed higher specificity for pNPβG (k/K = 6 s·mM) than cellobiose (k/K = 0.6 s·mM). AmBgl-LP showed maximum activity at 40 °C and pH 6.0 when pNPβG was used as the substrate. Glucose is a competitive inhibitor of AmBgl-LP, presenting a K of 14 mM. X-ray crystallography and Small Angle X-ray Scattering were used to determine the AmBgl-LP three-dimensional structure and its oligomeric state. Interestingly, despite sharing similar active site architecture with other structurally characterized GH1 family members which are monomeric, AmBgl-LP forms stable dimers in solution. The identification of new GH1 members by metagenomics might extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and diversity of these enzymes, besides enabling us to survey their industrial applications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The discovery of novel intermetallic compounds can enhance understanding of the chemical principles that govern structural stability and chemical bonding as well as finding new applications. Valence electron-poor polar intermetallics with valence electron concentrations (VECs) between 2.0 and 3.0 e/atom show a plethora of unprecedented and fascinating structural motifs and bonding features. Therefore, establishing simple structure-bonding-property relationships is especially challenging for this compound class because commonly accepted valence electron counting rules are inappropriate. During our efforts to find quasicrystals and crystalline approximants by valence electron tuning near 2.0 e/atom, we observed that compositions close to those of quasicrystals are exceptional sources for unprecedented valence electron-poor polar intermetallics, e.g., CaAuIn containing (AuIn) wavy layers, LiMgCuGa adopting a type IV clathrate framework, and ScMgCuGa that is incommensurately modulated. In particular, exploratory syntheses of AAuT (A = Ca, Sr, Ba and T = Ge, Sn) phases led to interesting bonding features for Au, such as columns, layers, and lonsdaleite-type tetrahedral frameworks. Overall, the breadth of Au-rich polar intermetallics originates, in part, from significant relativistics effect on the valence electrons of Au, effects which result in greater /5d orbital mixing, a small effective metallic radius, and an enhanced Mulliken electronegativity, all leading to ultimate enhanced binding with nearly all metals including itself. Two other successful strategies to mine electron-poor polar intermetallics include lithiation and "cation-rich" phases. Along these lines, we have studied lithiated Zn-rich compounds in which structural complexity can be realized by small amounts of Li replacing Zn atoms in the parent binary compounds CaZn, CaZn, and CaZn; their phase formation and bonding schemes can be rationalized by Fermi surface-Brillouin zone interactions between nearly free-electron states. "Cation-rich", electron-poor polar intermetallics have emerged using rare earth metals as the electropositive ("cationic") component together metal/metalloid clusters that mimic the backbones of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, which give evidence of extensive electronic delocalization and multicenter bonding. Thus, we can identify three distinct, valence electron-poor, polar intermetallic systems that have yielded unprecedented phases adopting novel structures containing complex clusters and intriguing bonding characteristics. In this Account, we summarize our recent specific progress in the developments of novel Au-rich BaAl-type related structures, shown in the "gold-rich grid", lithiation-modulated Ca-Li-Zn phases stabilized by different bonding characteristics, and rare earth-rich polar intermetallics containing unprecedented hydrocarbon-like planar Co-Ge metal clusters and pronounced delocalized multicenter bonding.

The aim of this study was to simulate the deposition distribution of both components of this drug within the airways based on realistic airflow measurements. Breathing parameters of 25 healthy adults (11 females and 14 males) were acquired while inhaling through Turbuhaler(®). Individual specific emitted doses and particle size distributions of Symbicort(®) Turbuhaler(®) were determined. A self-developed particle deposition model was adapted and validated to simulate the deposition of budesonide (inhaled corticosteroid; ICS) and formoterol (long acting β2 agonist; LABA) in the upper airways and lungs of the healthy volunteers. Based on current simulations the emitted doses varied between 50.4% and 92.5% of the metered dose for the ICS, and between 38% and 96.1% in case of LABA component depending on the individual inhalation flow rate. This variability induced a notable inter-individual spread of the deposited lung doses (mean: 33.6%, range: 20.4%-48.8% for budesonide and mean: 29.8%, range: 16.4%-42.9% for formoterol). Significant inter-gender differences were also observed. Average lung dose of budesonide was 29.2% of the metered dose for females and 37% for males, while formoterol deposited with 26.4% efficiency for females and 32.5% for males. Present results also highlighted the importance of breath-holding after inhalation of the drug. About a half of the total lung deposition occurred during breath-hold at 9. average breath-hold time. Calculated depositions confirmed appropriate lung deposition of Symbicort(®) Turbuhaler(®) for both genders, however more effort for optimal inhalation technique is advised for persons with low vital capacity. This study demonstrated the possibility of personalized prediction of airway deposition of aerosol drugs by numerical simulations. The methodology developed in this study will be applicable also to other marketed drugs in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main topic of this paper was a focus on Ultrasound (US) to inhibit Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The variables of the treatment (power, duration, and pulse) were combined through a randomized design; the use of DoE theory (Design of Experiments) and its outputs (Pareto chart, 3D plots, desirability profiles) pointed out that the effect of the treatment relies upon the total  distributed into the system on E. coli O157:H7, as suggested by the significance of interactions of power, pulse and time, while power was the most important factor for L. monocytogenes. A final challenge test was done by using two combinations (H-80% of power, 8 min and pulse at 6 s- for E. coli and F-80%; 2 min; 6 s- for L. monocytogenes) and storing the samples at 4 °C for 2 weeks. This experiment suggests that the treatment could exert a sub-lethal injury on the pathogens, which, combined with the storage under refrigeration, could contribute to increase the shelf life.Copyright © 2018.

According to the calculations, the visible absorption is clearly attributable to a single transition from a ligand-based HOMO to a low- LUMO with a significant contribution from a relativistically stabilized Bi  orbital. Surprisingly, scalar releativistic calculations completely fail to reproduce the observed visible absorption and place it at the violet/near-UV borderline instead.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25413500>Structural, electronic, and optical properties of Eu-doped BiOX (X = F, Cl, Br, I): a DFT+U study.</a></h1><p>In order to understand the photophysical properties and explain the experimental observations of Eu-doped BiOX (X = F, Cl, Br, I), the crystal structure, electronic structure, and optical properties of pure BiOX and Eu-doped BiOX have been calculated using the DFT+U method. By Eu doping, the band gap of BiOI is slightly narrowed, while the band gaps of others (BiOF, BiOCl, and BiOBr) are slightly broadened. Importantly, there is an isolated impurity  band in the middle of the band gap, which is formed by seven spin-up  levels of Eu-4f states. Furthermore, Eu doping enhances the internal electric fields of BiOX and makes the variation of band gaps and band widths become more outstanding, especially for the band widths of X-ns, O-2s, and Bi- related bands. Taking into account the  level matching and band edge position, Eu-doped BiOCl is favorable not only for the photoluminescence application but also for the photocatalysis application. The findings in the present work could well explain the experimental observations in the literature and are helpful for the development of novel optoelectronic applications of BiOX-based materials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450571>Garcienone, a Novel Compound Involved in Allelopathic Activity of  Hook.</a></h1><p>Plants are sources of diversified allelopathic substances that can be investigated for use in eco-friendly and efficient herbicides. An aqueous methanol extract from the leaves of  exhibited strong inhibitory activity against barnyard grass ( (L.) P. Beauv.), foxtail fescue ( (L.) C.C.), alfalfa ( L.), and cress ( L.), and appears to be a promising source of allelopathic substances. Hence, bio-activity guided purification of the extract through a series of column chromatography steps yielded a novel compound assigned as garcienone (()-5-hydroxy-5-((, 9S)-6-methyl-9-(prop-13-en-10-yl) tetrahydrofuran-6-yl) pent-3-en-2-one). Garcienone significantly inhibited the growth of cress at a concentration of 10 μM. The concentrations resulting in 50% growth inhibition () of cress roots and shoots were 120.5 and 156.3 μM, respectively. This report is the first to isolate and identify garcienone and to determine its allelopathic potential.</p></html>
