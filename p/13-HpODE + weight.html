<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10974057>Normal high density lipoprotein inhibits three steps in the formation of mildly oxidized low density lipoprotein: steps 2 and 3.</a></h2><p>Treatment of human artery wall cells with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), but not apoA-II, with an apoA-I peptide mimetic, or with high density lipoprotein (HDL), or paraoxonase, rendered the cells unable to oxidize low density lipoprotein (LDL). Human aortic wall cells were found to contain 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) protein. Transfection of the cells with antisense to 12-LO (but not sense) eliminated the 12-LO protein and prevented LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity. Addition of 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid [13(S)-HPODE] and 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HPETE] dramatically enhanced the nonenzymatic oxidation of both 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) and cholesteryl linoleate. On a molar basis 13(S)-HPODE and 15(S)-HPETE were approximately two orders of magnitude greater in potency than hydrogen peroxide in causing the formation of biologically active oxidized phospholipids (m/z 594, 610, and 828) from PAPC. Purified paraoxonase inhibited the biologic activity of these oxidized phospholipids. HDL from 10 of 10 normolipidemic patients with coronary artery disease, who were neither diabetic nor receiving hypolipidemic medications, failed to inhibit LDL oxidation by artery wall cells and failed to inhibit the biologic activity of oxidized PAPC, whereas HDL from 10 of 10 age- and sex-matched control subjects did. We conclude that a) mildly oxidized LDL is formed in three steps, one of which involves 12-LO and each of which can be inhibited by normal HDL, and b) HDL from at least some coronary artery disease patients with normal blood lipid levels is defective both in its ability to prevent LDL oxidation by artery wall cells and in its ability to inhibit the biologic activity of oxidized PAPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11902945>Purification of hydroperoxide lyase from green bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fruits for the generation of C6-aldehydes in vitro.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to compare the efficiency of different extracts of hydroperoxide lyase from green bell peppers in producing aldehydes: a crude extract, a chloroplastic fraction, and a purified enzyme were investigated. From a crude extract, the HPO lyase was purified by ion-exchange chromatography with a 22.3-fold increase in purification factor. Analysis by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under denaturating conditions showed only one protein with a molecular  of 55 kDa, whereas size-exclusion chromatography indicated a molecular  of 170 kDa. A maximum of 7500 mg of aldehydes per g of protein was obtained with the purified enzyme within 20 min of bioconversion compared to 392 and 88 mg of aldehydes per g of protein within 50 and 60 min, respectively, for the chloroplast fraction and the crude extract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12558051>Purification of lipoxygenase from Chlorella: production of 9- and 13-hydroperoxide derivatives of linoleic acid.</a></h2><p>Oxygenation of linoleic acid by the enzyme lipoxygenase (LOX) that is present in the microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa is known to produce the corresponding 9- and 13-hydroperoxide derivatives of linoleic acid (9- and 13-HPOD, respectively). Previous work with this microalga indicated that partially purified LOX, present in the 30-45 and 45-80% saturated (NH4)2SO4 precipitate fractions, produced both HPOD isomers but in different ratios. It was not clear, however, if the observed activity in the two isolates represented the presence of one or more isozymes. In the present work, LOX isolated from the intracellular fraction of Chlorella by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (35-80% saturated) was purified by ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography to apparent homogeneity. Analysis of the purified protein by SDS-PAGE and subsequent native size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that LOX in Chlorella is a single monomeric protein with a molecular mass of approximately 47 kDa. The purified LOX produced both the 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD isomers from linoleic acid in equal amounts, and the isomer ratio was not altered over the pH range of 6 to 9. Optimal activity of LOX was at pH 7.5.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2371285>Reductive beta-scission of the hydroperoxides of fatty acids and xenobiotics: role of alcohol-inducible cytochrome P-450.</a></h2><p>As shown previously in this laboratory, purified rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 form 2 (P-450 IIB4) catalyzes the reductive cleavage of hydroperoxides to yield hydrocarbons and either aldehydes or ketones. We have proposed that  hydroperoxides are the physiological substrates for the cleavage reaction and have shown that with  the formation of pentane is roughly equimolar with respect to the NADPH consumed. In the present study, the other product was isolated and identified as 13-oxo-9,11-tridecadienoic acid. Of particular interest, the alcohol-inducible form of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 form 3a (P-450 IIE1) is the most active of the isozymes examined in the reductive beta-scission of the 13-hydroperoxide derived from linoleic acid and the 15-hydroperoxide derived from arachidonic acid as well as the model compounds cumyl hydroperoxide (alpha, alpha-dimethylbenzyl hydroperoxide) and t-butyl hydroperoxide. In general, the forms of P-450 with lower activity, as judged by the rate of NADPH oxidation in the reconstituted system, give less of the cleavage products (hydrocarbon and oxo compound) and catalyze direct reduction of the hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxy compounds. The occurrence of the reductive cleavage reaction in liver microsomal membranes was demonstrated, and microsomes from animals treated with ethanol or acetone (P-450 IIE1 inducers) or phenobarbital (a P-450 IIB4 inducer) were more active than those from untreated animals. We suggest that the alcohol-inducible P-450, in addition to its known deleterious effects in chemical toxicity and chemical carcinogenesis, may enhance the reductive cleavage of  hydroperoxides with a resultant loss in membrane integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16667177>An Enzymatic Conversion of Lipoxygenase Products by a Hydroperoxide Lyase in Blue-Green Algae (Oscillatoria sp.).</a></h2><p>An enzyme has been isolated from blue-green algae Oscillatoria sp. which utilizes the product, 13-hydroperoxy-9, 11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD), of lipoxygenase for its substrate. This enzyme, termed hydroperoxide lyase, converts the conjugated diene 13-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid to 13-oxotrideca-9, 11-dienoic acid. The structure of the latter has been determined by ultraviolet spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. 9-HPOD is not a substrate for this enzyme. The hydroperoxide lyase from Oscillatoria sp. has a maximum of activity at pH 6.4 and 30 degrees C. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated at 56,000. The enzyme was not inhibited by BW 755C, but was inhibited by molecules containing more than one hydroxyl group. Quercetin was found to be the best inhibitor of the enzyme activity. The purified hydroperoxide lyase from Oscillatoria sp. showed an apparent K(m) of 7.4 micromolar and a V(max) of 35 nanomoles per minute per milligram of protein for 13-HPOD. An enzymatic pathway for the biogenesis of oxodienoic acid from linoleic acid is proposed. This involves the sequential activity of lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11281273>Partial purification and characterization of 12-lipoxygenase in bullfrog erythrocytes.</a></h2><p>12-Lipoxygenase (12-LO) in bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) erythrocytes was purified partially by ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. Bullfrog 12-LO was a single chain protein with a pI of 7.1-7.8 and MW of 7.77 kDa. This enzyme did not show typical Michaelis Menten type kinetics. At low substrate concentrations, it had a lag phase and at higher substrate concentrations, the activity was inhibited. The product of linoleic acid (LA), 13-hydroperoxy-9, 11-octadecadienoic acid (), was an activator for the enzyme. When arachidonic acid (AA) was used as substrate,  also affected the Km of bullfrog 12-LO towards AA. The affinity of LA towards bullfrog 12-LO was higher than the affinity of AA. Suicide inactivation was much more rapid than that of any mammalian 12-LO reported. Hemoglobin (Hb) inhibited the activity of 12-LO partially and removing Hb eliminated this inhibition. Both Hb and Met-Hb inhibited the 12-LO activity but did not denatured completely the Hb, suggesting that the inhibition was a direct interaction between 12-LO and Hb protein chain and was not due to competition between 12-LO and Hb for oxygen. This study characterizes bullfrog 12-LO with respect to stability, optimal pH, suicide inactivation and interaction with Hb and provides important evolutionary information about this enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10563421>Rapid reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of the regiospecificity of lipoxygenase products on linoleic acid.</a></h2><p>A new reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method for the separation of regioisomeric products from lipoxygenase acting on linoleic acid was studied. The addition of salts to the mobile phase improved the retention and separation behaviour of  and 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid with respect to the results obtained with other mobile phases reported in the literature. The effect of the pH and ionic strength of the buffer on the retention times, capacity factor and separation factor of these lipoxygenase products were also studied. The pH optimum coincided with the pKa of linoleic acid (close to 7 depending on the fatty acid concentration). Phosphate concentrations close to 100 mM considerably reduced the retention times and led to better separation of the mixture of both products. Finally, this method was applied to the identification and separation of two linoleic acid hydroxides (13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid and 9-hydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid) obtained by the reduction of their corresponding hydroperoxides.</p></html>
