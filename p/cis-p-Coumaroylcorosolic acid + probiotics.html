However, the protective mechanism of Lactobacillus plantarum C88 on chronic liver injury induced by mycotoxin remains unclear.In this study, the addition of L. plantarum C88 obviously ameliorated the increased contents of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol and triglyceride, the diminish contents of total protein and albumin in serum of mice challenged with AFB. Simultaneously, L. plantarum C88 attenuated the inflammatory response via significantly reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum. Furthermore, L. plantarum C88 remarkably down-regulated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways by weakening the expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, and inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation through enhancing the expression of NF-κB inhibitor (IκB). Neutralization experiments confirmed that L. plantarum C88 decreased the levels of some pro-inflammatory factors due to the suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathways. Besides, L. plantarum C88 decreased the levels of Bax and Caspase-3, elevated the level of Bcl-2, and reduced mRNA expressions of Fatty  synthetase receptor (Fas), FAS-associated death domain (FADD), TNF receptor associated death domain (TRADD) and Caspase-8 in the liver.Probiotic L. plantarum C88 prevented AFB-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by modulating TLR2/NF-κB and TLR4/NF-κB pathways. The molecular mechanisms of L. plantarum C88 in ameliorating AFB-induced excessive apoptosis included regulating the mitochondrial pathway and cell death receptor pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599967>In vivo safety assessment of Lactobacillus fermentum strains, evaluation of their cholesterol lowering ability and intestinal microbial modulation.</a></h2><p>Despite the growing importance of  vivid health benefits, an impediment to the use of new probiotic cultures is their safety. Hence, there is a need to strictly examine the biosafety as well as health benefits of  in vivo model system.In this study, two lactic  bacterial (LAB) cultures Lactobacillus fermentum NCMR 2826 and FIX proven for their in vitro probiotic properties were investigated for their in vivo safety in Wistar rats. Acute toxicity study (14 days) with high dose of biomass (10  CFU/mL), followed by sub-chronic test for 13 weeks with oral feeding of the probiotic cultures in three different doses viz; 10, 10 and 10  CFU/mL on daily basis revealed the safety of the L. fermentum cultures. The probiotic feeding had no toxic effects on the survival, body weight, food consumption, with either of the dosage used throughout the treatment period. No statistically significant changes in relative organ weight, serum biochemical and hematological indices were found among the control and the probiotic fed animals. In addition to the safety attributes, the two L. fermentum cultures fed rats showed reduced serum cholesterol levels, macrovesicular steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning compared to control animals. Further, quantification of intestinal microbiota using real-time PCR analysis from animal feces indicated a significant increase and stability of Lactobacillus and bifidobacterial counts but a decrease of E. coli numbers.This study of safety and beneficial features highlight the use of the two native L. fermentum isolates as potential probiotic food supplements.

More than 400 bacterial isolates were found, using PCR-based identification, to belong to 12 species of the , , , and  genera. The dominant strains were screened for antagonistic activity against pathogenic and spoilage bacteria and exopolysaccharide production, acidification, and proteolytic activity. Since  was found to be the most prevalent lactic  bacteria species present in milk and in both types of cheese, the best performing strain of this species was successfully used, alone or in combination with a selected autochthonous  strain, in pilot-scale productions of Giuncata and Caciotta Leccese cheeses, respectively. The combined inoculums of selected autochthonous strains positively influenced the sensory characteristics of both Giuncata and Caciotta cheeses. Finally, the selected autochthonous cultures were enriched with a potentially probiotic  strain and successfully used in pilot-scale productions of these traditional cheeses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the use of an autochthonous  strain as a starter for the production of cheeses with added . In addition, the identification of the probiotic strain in the feces of healthy volunteers fed with the advanced traditional cheese proved its effectiveness as a carrier for the delivery of  to the human body.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523960>Impact of a Plant Sterol- and Galactooligosaccharide-Enriched Beverage on Colonic Metabolism and Gut Microbiota Composition Using an  Dynamic Model.</a></h2><p>A beverage enriched with plant sterols (1 g/100 mL) and galactooligosaccharides (1.8 g/100 mL) was subjected to a dynamic gastrointestinal and colonic fermentation process to evaluate the effect on sterol metabolism, organic  production, and microbiota composition. Production of sterol metabolites (coprostanol, methylcoprostanol, ethylcoprostenol, ethylcoprostanol, and sitostenone) was observed in the transverse colon (TC) and descending colon (DC) vessels in general, from 24 and 48 h, respectively. Microbial activity was assessed through the production of organic , mainly acetate in all colon vessels, lactate in the AC, and butyrate and propionate in the TC and DC. A higher diversity in the microbial community was found in the TC and DC, in accordance with a higher sterol metabolism and organic  production. Although the prebiotic effect of galactooligosaccharides was not detected, changes in microbiota composition (an increase in the  genus and the Synergistaceae and Lachnospiraceae families) indicated an enhancement of sterol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31193267>Distribution and antimicrobial activity of lactic  bacteria from raw camel milk.</a></h2><p>Consumer demand for natural pathogen-control agents for substitution of synthetic food preservatives and traditional antibiotics is increasing. This study aimed to reveal the distribution of lactic  bacteria (LAB) in raw camel milk and to characterize their antimicrobial traits. The genetic identification by 16S rRNA sequencing of 58 LAB isolates showed the predominance of  (24.2%),  (22.4%) and  (20.7%) genera in raw camel milk. These genera exhibited inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including multidrug-resistant . Among these LAB, two isolates-identified as  CM16 and  CM22-were selected for their strong bacteriocinogenic anti-listerial activity estimated at 1600 and 800 AU/mL, respectively. The bacteriocins produced were partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel filtration and then biochemically characterized. The proteinaceous nature of bacteriocins was confirmed by the susceptibility to enzymes. These bacteriocins showed significant technological characteristics such as heat-resistance, and stability over a wide range of pH (2.0-10.0). In conclusion, these results indicated that  CM16 and  CM22 could be useful as potential . Moreover, their partially purified bacteriocins may play an important role as food preservatives and feed additives. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the distribution of LAB population in raw camel milk and the characterization of their bacteriocins from the Arabian Peninsula of western Asia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493127> and Psychobiotics: the Role of Microbial Neurochemicals.</a></h2><p>In light of recent data, microorganisms should be construed as organisms that are capable of communication and collective behaviors. Microbial communication signals are involved both in interactions among microbial cells within microbial social systems, including the human body-inhabiting microconsortium, and the dialog between the microbiota and the host organism. The microbiota inhabits various niches of the host organism, especially the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microorganisms release diverse signal molecules and, in addition, specifically respond to host signals. This enables them to constantly interact with the nervous system including the brain and the immune system of the host organism. Evolutionarily conserved signals that are involved in the communication between microbiota and the host include neuroactive substances (neurochemicals) such as peptides, amino , biogenic amines, short-chain fatty , and gaseous substances. This ongoing dialog may either stabilize the host's physical and mental health state or, alternatively, cause serious health problems. Attempts are made to correct imbalances in the brain-gut-microbiota axis with  including their subgroup called psychobiotics that release neuroactive substances directly influencing the human brain, psyche, and behavior. A number of recent review works address the microbiota-host system and its communication signals. Some of the publications focus on the involvement of neurochemicals in the bidirectional communication within the host-microbiota system. However, this work concentrates on the impact of bacterial cell components, metabolites, and signal molecules as promising alternatives to the currently widespread  that have both advantages and disadvantages. Such biologically active agents of microbial origin are referred to as postbiotics or, alternatively, metabiotics (the term preferred in this work).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198939>Effects of a combination of xylanase, amylase and protease, and  on major nutrients including amino  and non-starch polysaccharides utilization in broilers fed different level of fibers.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effects of a combination of xylanase, amylase, and protease (XAP), with  (3 Bacillus spp.) supplementation on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients in Cobb 500 broilers from 0 to 21 d. A completely randomized 2 × 4 factorial design (2 levels of fiber; 4 types of supplements) with 8 replicate cages (6 birds/cage) was used. Each low and high-fiber diet contained 500 FTU/kg Buttiauxella sp. phytase and was supplemented with: (a) none (control), (b) XAP (2,000 U xylanase + 200 U amylase + 4,000 U protease/kg diet), (c)  (75,000 CFU/g of Bacillus spp.), or (d) XAP + . High fiber decreased (P < 0.05) nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn), AID of all amino  (AA), AID and ATTD of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), starch, and gross energy (GE). High fiber increased (P < 0.01) the flow of total non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in both ileum and total tract. The XAP +  increased (P < 0.01) AMEn as well as AID and ATTD of DM, CP, GE, starch, while alone, XAP yielded similar improvement except for DM compared with control. The supplemental XAP alone improved (P < 0.01) the digestibility of most of the AAs compared with control. Moreover, XAP +  increased (P < 0.05) AID of all AA except arginine and serine compared with control. A fiber × supplements interaction (P < 0.05) was found for AID of histidine and threonine, and their digestibility in high-fiber diet was improved to a level comparable to low-fiber diet by XAP + . The flow of NSP in XAP group was 5 to 6% lower than in control while NSP flow in XAP + probiotic group was further 4% lower than that of XAP group (P < 0.01). The results infer that the combination of XAP and  can effectively optimize the nutrient digestibility in broilers fed both low and high-fiber diets.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513295>Interventions for maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease: a network meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease of the gut. About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, , purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5-ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5-ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and 5-ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291967>Combined supplementation of Lactobacillus fermentum and Pediococcus acidilactici promoted growth performance, alleviated inflammation, and modulated intestinal microbiota in weaned pigs.</a></h2><p> are important for pigs to enhance health and intestinal development, which are potential alternative to antibiotics. Many studies have reported the functions of single bacterial strain as probiotic on the animals. In this study, we evaluated effects of combined  on growth performance, inflammation and intestinal microbiota in weaned pigs. One hundred and eight pigs, weaned at 28 day old (7.12 ± 0.08 kg), were randomly divided into the 3 dietary treatments with 6 pens and 6 pigs per pen (half male and half female). The experimental period lasted for 28 days and treatments were as follows: i.basal diet; ii. Antibiotic: the basal diet plus 75 mg· kg chlortetracycline; and iii. : basal diet plus 4% compound .Supplementation  improved average daily gain over the entire 28 days (P < 0.01) and feed efficiency in the last 14 days (P < 0.05) compared with the other two groups. Both  and antibiotic supplementation decreased concentrations of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (P < 0.05) and interferon-γ (P < 0.01).  group had greater abundance of Lactobacillus in the caecal digesta and Firmicutes in the colonic digesta, while both  and antibiotic supplementation inhibited Treponema_2 and Anaerovibrio in the caecal digesta.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined  (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554647>Changes in the gut microbiota during and after commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving in China.</a></h2><p>The influence of commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving on divers' gut microbiotas was assessed to provide dietary suggestion.Faecal samples of 47 divers working offshore were collected before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) saturation diving. Their living and excursion depths were 55-134 metres underwater with a saturation duration of 12-31 days and PaO of 38-65 kPa. The faecal samples were examined through 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing based on the Illumina sequencing platform to analyse changes in the bacteria composition in the divers' guts.Although the α and β diversity of the gut microbiota did not change significantly, we found that living in a hyperbaric environment of helium-oxygen saturation decreased the abundance of the genus , an obligate anaerobe, from 2.43%±3.83% at T1 to 0.79%±1.23% at T2 and 0.59%±0.79% at T3. Additionally, the abundance of some short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria, such as , rectale group and , showed a decreased trend in the order of before, during and after diving. On the contrary, the abundance of species, such as , , , , ,  and , showed an increasing trend, but most of them were pathogens.Occupational exposure to high pressure in a helium-oxygen saturation environment decreased the abundance of  and some SCFA-producing bacteria, and increased the risk of pathogenic bacterial infection.

In addition, it can result in physical and chemical alterations in the products and has impact on the probiotic viability and metabolic activity. This review provides an overview of the effects of HIUS on dairy products manufactured with  and prebiotics. Furthermore, it presents perspectives of HIUS application on paraprobiotics and postbiotics products. HIUS has been proven to be a potential technology and its application to fermented dairy products can result in shorter processing time, increased probiotic viability, and products with low lactose content, higher oligosaccharides concentration, less undesirable taste (lower propionic and acetic  content) and reduced ingredients (no need of prebiotic addition or β-galactosidase inclusion). In cheeses, HIUS can reduce the ripening time and accelerate proteolysis, resulting in products with better sensory, textural and nutritional (bioactive peptides) characteristics. Furthermore, it can change the prebiotic structure, facilitating the access for the . The impact of the HIUS is highly dependent on the process parameters (frequency, power, processing time, pulse mode and duration), type of probiotic culture and food composition. Therefore, HIUS process parameters must be precisely quantified and controlled. The HIUS can also be applied to the inactivation of probiotic cultures and development of paraprobiotic products or to the improvement in the production of soluble factors (postbiotics) with health effects.

Staining with PAS stain showed no suggested neurodegenerative changes. Treatment with  improved the S100b immunohistochemistry profile of the curam group partially but failed to overcome the neuroinflammatory reaction detected by hematoxylin and eosin stain. Curam was possibly blamed for the systemic effects.The neurobehavioral tests showed delayed impairment in the open field test for the curam group and impaired new object recognition for the neomycin group. These tests were applied by video recording. The neurobehavioral decline developed 14 days after the end of the 3-week antibiotic course. Unfortunately, curam abuse induced animal fatalities.Antibiotic abuse has a neurotoxic effect that works by both local and more prominent systemic mechanisms.

Modulating and harnessing microbiota-host interactions is a promising way to promote poultry health and production efficiencies without antibiotics. In poultry, the microbiome is influenced by many host and external factors including host species, age, gut compartment, diet, and environmental exposure to microbes. Because so many factors contribute to the microbiota composition, specific knowledge is needed to predict how the microbiome will respond to interventions. The effects of antibiotics on microbiomes have been well documented, with different classes of antibiotics having distinctive, specific outcomes on bacterial functions and membership. Non-antibiotic interventions, such as  and prebiotics, target specific bacterial taxa or function to enhance beneficial properties of microbes in the gut. Beneficial bacteria provide a benefit by displacing pathogens and/or producing metabolites (e.g., short chain fatty  or tryptophan metabolites) that promote poultry health by improving mucosal barrier function or immune function. Microbiota modulation has been used as a tool to reduce pathogen carriage, improve growth, and modulate the immune system.

Gliclazide is a drug characterized by large inter-individual differences in therapeutic response; however, the causes of these differences are not fully explained and may be the outcome of microbial biotransformation. Recently, great attention has been paid to studies on bile  (BA) interactions with gut microflora and the role of BAs in the modification of drug transport through biological membranes.  Considering the assumption of gliclazide-probiotic-BAs interactions, the aim of the study was to investigate the transport and biotransformation of gliclazide in probiotic bacteria, as well as the effects of deoxycholic  (DCA) on gliclazide transport into bacterial cells.   were incubated with gliclazide with or without DCA for 24 h at 37°C. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were determined at seven time points by high-performance liquid chromatography. Gliclazide biotransformation by the enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria was examined using appropriate software packages.  During the 24 h incubation with probiotic bacteria, significantly lower extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were observed at all time points compared to controls, while in the group with DCA, the decrease in concentration was noticed only at 24 h. The total concentration of gliclazide throughout the whole period was significantly lower compared to control. Proposed pathways of gliclazide biotransformation by probiotic bacteria involve reactions of hydrolysis and hydroxylation.  Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that there are interactions of gliclazide--DCA, at both the level of active and passive transport into the cells, and at the level of drug biotransformation by enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria. The effect of these interactions on the final therapeutic response of gliclazide should be further studied and confirmed in  conditions.Copyright © 2019 Ðanić, Stanimirov, Pavlović, Vukmirović, Lazić, Al-Salami and Mikov.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373710>Review article: can bugs be drugs? The potential of  and prebiotics as treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver condition. A major current research effort is ongoing to find potential strategies to treat NAFLD-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with special attention to the gut microbiota. Multiple animal studies and pilot clinical trials are assessing different gut microbiota modulating strategies such as faecal microbiota transplantation, antibiotics, , prebiotics and synbiotics.To review the role of microbiota in NAFLD-NASH and determine whether pro- and prebiotics have potential as treatment METHODS: Information was obtained from critically reviewing literature on PubMed on targeting the gut microbiota in NAFLD. Search terms included NAFLD, NASH, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis; combined with microbiome, microbiota, gut bacteria,  and prebiotics.Animal studies and the first emerging studies in humans show promising results for both the common  Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococci as for short chain fatty  (SCFA) butyrate-producing bacteria. Also, prebiotics have positive effects on different mechanisms underlying NAFLD-NASH.The most promising strategies thus far developed to alter the microbiome in NAFLD-NASH are  and prebiotics. However, pre- and probiotic treatment of NAFLD-NASH is relatively new and still under development. Actual understanding of the involved mechanisms is lacking and changes in the intestinal microbiota composition after treatment are rarely measured. Furthermore, large clinical trials with comparative endpoints are unavailable. Personalised treatment based on metagenomics gut microbiota analysis will probably be part of the future diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD-NASH.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392538>Next generation sequencing, biochemical characterization, metabolic pathway analysis of novel probiotic Pediococcus acidilactici NCDC 252 and it's evolutionary relationship with other lactic  bacteria.</a></h2><p>Pediococcus acidilactici NCDC 252 is a facultative anaerobe of dairy origin that possessed all studied in vitro probiotic attributes and several useful enzyme activities. Its whole genome was sequenced and analysed for its evolutionary relationship with other lactic  bacteria (LAB). This is a novel sequence and first report of genome sequence of P. acidilactici of dairy origin. Its genome is relatively larger than other studied genomes of P. acidilactici and is comprised of 40 scaffolds that totals to 3,243,337 bases and 44.5% GC content. A total of 3054 coding sequences (CDS) were identified by RAST and DIAMOND servers. The genome also encoded different enzyme activities required for utilization of various carbohydrates. This was also confirmed by carbohydrate utilization studies. The genome also encoded genes for  properties. The phylogenetic analysis of P. acidilactici NCDC 252 genome was done using Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood methods to study its evolution and relatedness to other LABs based upon their 16S rDNA sequences. The strain exhibited highest resemblance to Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 and is also much close to P. acidilactici based on similarity of ribosomal protein. The strain seems to have acquired some genes for its adaptation in dairy/environmental niche. This genome sequence is novel with genome more similar to L. plantarum and biochemical and phenotypic characteristics of P. acidilactici.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236715>Bacterial diversity and metabolite profiles of curd prepared by natural fermentation of raw milk and back sloping of boiled milk.</a></h2><p>Preparation of curd vary worldwide due to which its taste, texture and impact on human health also differ. In Assam, curd prepared from raw milk (RMC) is preferred over curd prepared from boiled milk (BMC), a tradition believed to have originated from the Mongoloid customs. Microbial diversity of raw milk (RM), boiled milk (BM), RMC and BMC collected from three farms were investigated by culture dependent and independent techniques. Additionally, metabolite profiles of RMC and BMC were studied by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. A total of 59 bacterial isolates were identified from the four different dairy products. In RM, lactic  bacteria such as Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc were obtained along with the environmental bacteria like Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Acetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Klebsiella and Macrococcus. Additionally, Prevotella, Oscillospira, Phascolarctobacterium and Akkermansia were also detected in BM by culture independent technique. In RMC and BMC, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus were prevalent. RM and RMC shared Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Acinetobacter as common bacterial genera. However, no bacterial genus was common in BM and BMC. The correlation analysis revealed that Lactobacillus was negatively correlated to other bacterial genera. Oligotyping analysis revealed that Lactobacillus brevis and L.fermentum were abundant in RMC and BMC, respectively. In metabolomic study, ascorbic , dodecanoic  and hexadecanoic  were found to be significantly higher in RMC.

Additionally, multifunctional in vitro bioactivity of IC and CW fractions was also assessed. The metabolite profile revealed a variety of compounds (fatty , amino , coenzyme, protein, amino sugars), with significant probable activities (Pa > 0.7) as immune-stimulant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antiproliferative, immunomodulator, and antineoplastic, among others. Moreover, in vitro assays exhibited that both IC and CW fractions presented angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (> 90%), chelating (> 79%), and antioxidant (ca. 22-57 cellular antioxidant activity units) activities.

We hypothesized that the human-derived species  would increase intestinal mucus synthesis and expulsion, without extensive degradation of mucin glycans.  data revealed that  lacked the enzymes necessary to extensively degrade mucin glycans.

Likewise, live -monoassociated colon had increased acidic mucin-filled goblet cells, as denoted by Periodic -Schiff-Alcian Blue (PAS-AB) staining and MUC2 immunostaining. , -secreted products, including acetate, were able to increase MUC2 levels in T84 cells. We also identified that -secreted products, such as γ-aminobutyric  (GABA), stimulated autophagy-mediated calcium signaling and MUC2 release. This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone. This work points to the potential of using  and similar mucin-friendly microbes as therapeutic agents for intestinal disorders with disruptions in the mucus barrier.Copyright © 2019 Engevik et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411526>Prevention of enteric bacterial infections and modulation of gut microbiota with conjugated linoleic  producing  in mice.</a></h2><p> are recognized for outcompeting pathogenic bacteria by competitive receptor-mediated colonization and secretion of functional metabolites which are antimicrobial against certain microbes as well as improving host's gut health and immunity. Recently, we have constructed a bioactive  (LC) strain, LC, by inserting  (myosin cross-reactive antigen) gene, which stimulates the conversion of conjugated linoleic . In this study, we evaluated the modulation of gut microbiome and protective roles of LC against pathogenic  serovar Typhimurium (ST) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) infections in BALB/cJ mice. We observed that LC colonized efficiently in mice gut intestine and competitively reduced the infection with ST and EHEC in various locations of small and large intestine, specifically cecum, jejunum, and ileum ( < 0.05). Positive modulation of the cecal microbiota, for example, higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria, and increased bacterial species diversity/richness, was detected in ST-challenged mice pretreated with LC based on 16S metagenomic sequencing. Cytokine gene expression analysis indicated that mice pretreated with LC associated with attenuated bacterial pathogen-induced gut inflammation. Furthermore, mice fed daily with LC for one week could protect themselves from the impairments caused by enteric infections with ST or EHEC. These impairments include weight loss, negative hematological changes, intestinal histological alterations, and potential death.

Moreover, the feasibility of modulating intestinal microbes and metabolites as novel therapeutic strategies is discussed.This study was based on data obtained from PubMed up to March 31, 2019. Articles were selected using the following search terms: "gut microbiota," "heart failure," "trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)," "short-chain fatty  (SCFA)," "bile ," "uremic toxin," "treatment," "diet," "probiotic," "prebiotic," "antibiotic," and "fecal microbiota transplantation."Accumulated evidence has revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota varies obviously in people with heart failure compared to those with healthy status. Altered gut microbial communities contribute to heart failure through bacterial translocation or affecting multiple metabolic pathways, including the trimethylamine/TMAO, SCFA, bile , and uremic toxin pathways. Meanwhile, modulation of the gut microbiota through diet, pre/, fecal transplantation, and microbial enzyme inhibitors has become a potential therapeutic approach for many metabolic disorders. Specifically, a few studies have focused on the cardioprotective effects of  on heart failure.The composition of the gut microbiota in people with heart failure is different from those with healthy status. A reduction in SCFA-producing bacteria in patients with heart failure might be a notable characteristic for patients with heart failure. Moreover, an increase in the microbial potential to produce TMAO and lipopolysaccharides is prominent.

The gut microbiota is considered as a factor involved in the regulation of numerous metabolic pathways by impacting several functions of the host. It has been suggested that  can modulate host gene expression and metabolism, and thereby positively influence host adipose tissue development and obesity related-metabolic disorders. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing  strain on host glucose and lipid metabolism and the gut microbial composition in a short-term diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice. C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group that received control standard diet, a group fed a high-fat diet (HF), and a group fed HF supplemented with  IPLA R1. Fasting serum insulin as well as triglycerides accumulation in the liver were significantly reduced in the group receiving  IPLA R1. The treatment with the EPS-producing  IPLA R1 tended to down-regulate the expression of host genes involved in the hepatic synthesis of fatty  which was concomitant with an upregulation in the expression of genes related with fatty  oxidation.  IPLA R1 not only promoted the increase of  but also the levels of .

This study aimed to investigate the role of intestinal flora and serum metabolism induced by HD against hypertension. 16 spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) were divided into HD group (5.9 g/kg) and model group (M) (normal saline), with eight Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as control group (W) (normal saline). Rats were fed by gavage once a day for 28 days. The changes of intestinal flora and serum metabolism were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS assay. HD decreased blood pressure steadily, improved the structure and composition of imbalance flora in SHRs, increased the abundance and diversity of flora, and decreased flora Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio.  sp.  increased remarkably in M group.  and  increased significantly in HD group, which were functionally related to the significant increase of ,  and  in W group, which were all  producing butyric , lactic , and regulating inflammation and other antihypertensive related factors. HD also changed the serum metabolic pattern of SHRs. 16 potential biomarkers related to inflammation, vasodilation, steroid hormones, oxidative stress, and etc. changed significantly, mainly enriched in arachidonic  metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the dominant genius and species in three groups were highly correlated with steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic  metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and vitamin B6 metabolism. Our research indicated that HD had a good antihypertensive effect, which may be driven by the protective intestinal flora and beneficial metabolites induced by it, and the metabolites were closely related to the changes of intestinal flora. It provided new insights for the antihypertensive mechanism of HD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250457>Molecular screening of beneficial and safety determinants from bacteriocinogenic lactic  bacteria isolated from Brazilian artisanal calabresa.</a></h2><p>Despite of the beneficial relevance of several lactic  bacteria (LAB) in the food industry, micro-organisms belonging to this group can determine spoilage in food products and carry a number of virulence and antibiotic resistance-related genes.

Despite presenting some beneficial aspects, the presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes jeopardize their utilization as starter or biopreservatives cultures in food products. Considering the inhibitory potential of these strains, an alternative would be the use of their bacteriocins as semi-purified or pure technological preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The food industry has a particular interest in using bacteriocinogenic lactic  bacteria (LAB) as starter,  and/or biopreservatives in different food products. Characterization of additional beneficial features is important to identify new, multifunctional potential probiotic strains. However, these strains can only be applied in food products only after being properly characterized according their potential negative aspects, such as virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. A wide characterization of beneficial and safety aspects of bacteriocinogenic LAB is determinant to guide the proper utilization of these strains, or their purified bacteriocins, by the food industry.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372184>Synbiotic-like effect of linoleic  overproducing  with berry phenolic extracts against pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic .</a></h2><p>Majority of enteric infections are foodborne and antimicrobials including antibiotics have been used for their control and treatment.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two  can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613203> strains of dairy-product origin adhere to mucin and survive digestive juices.</a></h2><p> There is an ever present need to isolate and characterize indigenous bacterial strains with potential probiotic health benefits for humans.  of dairy origin was focused because of its propensity to adhere to the intestinal glycoprotein, mucin. The lactobacillus strains were screened for mucin adhesion, resistance to low pH and bile, autoaggregation, hydrophobicity, and survival in an  digestion model.

Safety was assessed for haemolytic, mucinolytic and gelatinase activity, biogenic amine production, antibiotic resistance and phenol resistance. Expression of the 32-mmub adhesion-related gene was also measured following strain exposure to simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT) digestion. The selected mucin-adhesive strains were tolerant to  (pH 3.0) and bile (0.25 %) and demonstrated >85 % survival following simulated human digestion in the presence of milk. The digestive treatment did not affect the adhesive potential of PL20, and PL27, regardless of the food matrix.

Recently, progress has been made in understanding the immunobiology of PGLYRPs in human and mice, however, their functions in livestock animals have been less explored. In this study, we characterized the expression patterns of PGLYRPs in porcine intestinal epithelial (PIE) cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and their modulation by the interactions of host cells with PRR-ligands and non-viable immunomodulatory  referred to as paraimmunobiotics. We demonstrated that PGLYRP-1, -2, -3, and -4 are expressed in PIE cells and APCs from Peyer's patches, being PGLYPR-3 and -4 levels higher than PGLYRP-1 and -2. We also showed that PGLYRPs expression in APCs and PIE cells can be modulated by different PRR agonists. By using knockdown PIE cells for TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2, or the four PGLYRPs, we demonstrated that PGLYRPs expressions would be required for activation and functioning of TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2 in porcine epitheliocytes, but PGLYRPs activation would be independent of those PRR expressions. Importantly, we reported for the first time that PGLYRPs expression can be differentially modulated by paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria in a strain-dependent manner. These results provide evidence for the use of paraimmunobiotic bifidobacteria as an alternative for the improvement of resistance to intestinal infections or as therapeutic tools for the reduction of the severity of inflammatory damage in diseases in which a role of PGLYRPs-microbe interaction has been demonstrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623075>Gut Microbiome Modulation Based on Probiotic Application for Anti-Obesity: A Review on Efficacy and Validation.</a></h2><p>The growing prevalence of obesity has become an important problem worldwide as obesity has several health risks. Notably, factors such as excessive food consumption, a sedentary way of life, high sugar consumption, a fat-rich diet, and a certain genetic profile may lead to obesity. The present review brings together recent advances regarding the significance of interventions involving intestinal gut bacteria and host metabolic phenotypes. We assess important biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut microbiota on hosts including bile salt metabolism, short-chain fatty , and metabolic endotoxemia. Some previous studies have shown a link between microbiota and obesity, and associated disease reports have been documented. Thus, this review focuses on obesity and gut microbiota interactions and further develops the mechanism of the gut microbiome approach related to human obesity. Specifically, we highlight several alternative diet treatments including dietary changes and supplementation with . The future direction or comparative significance of fecal transplantation, synbiotics, and metabolomics as an approach to the modulation of intestinal microbes is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604151>Lactobacillus fermentum and/or ferulic  improved the immune responses, antioxidative defence and resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fingerlings.</a></h2><p>This study investigates the possible effects of using Lactobacillus fermentum (LF) and/or ferulic  (FA) in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) on some immunological parameters as well as resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila. Four diets were prepared including control diet and three diets supplemented with LF (10 CFU/g), FA (100 mg kg) or LF + FA (10 CFU/g + 100 mg kg). After 8 weeks, fish fed LF or/and FA had significantly higher final body weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate when compared to control group (P < 0.05). The feed conversion ratio of fish fed LF or/and FA were noticeably lower than control (P < 0.05). No alterations were observed in case of haematological parameters except red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (HCT) which were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in fish fed FA or those fed both LF and FA. Also, the WBCs of fish treated with LF or/and FA were noticeably higher than control (P < 0.05). Feeding on LF and FA notably increased the serum total protein and albumin levels (P < 0.05). The serum respiratory burst and lysozyme activity were also enhanced (P < 0.05) in fish fed both LF or/and FA. In addition, evaluation of the serum antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) activity showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in fish fed FA or both LF and FA as compared to the control. Fish fed LF and FA supplemented diet had highest survival rate after experimental challenge with pathogenic A. hydrophila. The obtained results revealed that LF and/or FA can be used as beneficial feed additive to improve the immune responses and disease resistance in early stages of common carp culture.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the fact that there is still no cure for Alzheimer's dementia and available treatment strategies bring only symptomatic benefits, there is a pressing demand for other effective strategies such as diet. Since the inflammation hypothesis gained considerable significance in the AD pathogenesis, elucidating the modulatory role of dietary factors on inflammation may help to prevent, delay the onset and slow the progression of AD. Current evidence clearly shows that synergistic action of combined supplementation and complex dietary patterns provides stronger benefits than any single component considered separately. Recent studies reveal the growing importance of novel factors such as dietary advanced glycation end products (d-AGE), gut microbiota, butyrate and vitamin D on inflammatory processes in AD.This paper summarizes the available evidence of pro- and anti-inflammatory activity of some dietary components including fatty , vitamins, flavonoids, polyphenols,  and d-AGE, and their potential for AD prevention and treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of 2 strains of lactic  bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum J26, against oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells, and gave an overview of the mechanisms of lactic  bacteria antioxidant activity using digital gene expression profiling. The 2 LAB strains provided significant protection against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced reduction in superoxide dismutase activity and increase in glutathione peroxidase activity in Caco-2 cells. However, inactive bacteria had little effect on alleviating oxidation stress in Caco-2 cells. Eight genes related to oxidative stress-FOSB, TNF, PPP1R15A, NUAK2, ATF3, TNFAIP3, EGR2, and FBN2-were significantly upregulated in HO-induced Caco-2 cells compared with untreated Caco-2 cells. After incubation of the HO-induced Caco-2 cells with L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum J26, 5 genes (TNF, EGR2, NUAK2, FBN2, and TNFAIP3) and 2 genes (NUAK2 and FBN2) were downregulated, respectively. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes indicated that some signaling pathways associated with inflammation, immune response, and apoptosis, such as Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak-STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κB, and tumor necrosis factor, were all negatively modulated by the 2 strains, especially L. rhamnosus GG.

The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanisms of LAPB in ameliorating food allergy-induced intestinal mucosal disorders and to investigate whether or not these disorders occur by the regulation of gut microbiota and metabolism.A TM allergy BALB/c mouse model was established, and two LAPB strains, Bifidobacterium longum (Bi) and Bacillus coagulans (Bc), were used for oral treatment in sensitized mice. The allergic mucosal disorders were assessed by histological analysis and ELISAs. Additionally, microbiota and metabolic modifications were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and GC-TOF-MS, respectively.YSPB administration suppressed TM-induced intestinal mucosal disorders, restored allergenic Th2 cell over-polarization and dysbiosis, and regulated gut arginine and proline metabolism pathways. Statistical analysis suggested the metabolites aspartate and arginine, as well as several commensal flora groups, to be the critical mediators in the process.These data demonstrated the correlation between allergic mucosal disorder, T cell subtype differentiation, gut microbiota composition and intestinal metabolism especially the arginine and proline metabolism pathways. We also revealed the significant effects of LAPB in ameliorating food allergy and maintaining the mucosal ecosystem. This study confirmed the efficiency of LAPB in relieving food allergy, provided Bi and Bc as the potential treatment approaches, and suggested amino  metabolism pathways might be the novel targets for potential clinical applications.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society of Allergology.

Diets could modulate the gut microbiota, which in turn may contribute to altered health outcomes by way of changing the relative risk of chronic diseases. Limonin, widely found in citrus fruits, has been reported to possess multiple beneficial health effects. However, the gastrointestinal fate of limonin and its effect on gut microbiota remain unknown. Herein, mice were fed a diet containing 0.05% limonin (w/w) for 9 weeks. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrum analysis showed that limonin was concentrated along the gastrointestinal tract and reached 523.14 nmol g in the colon lumen. Compared to control mice, colonic microbiota richness was significantly increased by limonin. Gut microbiota community was also clearly distinct from the control group as shown by Principle Coordinate Analysis. Additionally, the relative abundance of 22 genera (relative abundance >0.1%) was altered significantly. Among these, generally regarded  (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) were reduced, which was not due to direct inhibitory effect of limonin. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, amino  metabolism, lipid, metabolism and immune system function were predicted to be upregulated, and immune system disease and infectious disease markers were predicted to be suppressed dramatically by limonin based on gut microbiota composition. Within the infectious disease category, bacterial toxin and Staphylococcus aureus infection markers were suppressed significantly with limonin treatment. Collectively, our study provides the first line of evidence that oral intake of limonin could shift gut microbiota composition and its functions, which warrants further investigation to determine its implication in human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410766>The Application of Lactobacillus reuteri CCM 8617 and Flaxseed Positively Improved the Health of Mice Challenged with Enterotoxigenic E. coli O149:F4.</a></h2><p>The aim of our study was to monitor the effects of dietary synbiotics on experimentally infected mice. Sixty mice were divided into the following three groups: negative control group C1, positive control group C2 (mice infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O149:F4), and experimental group LF (Lactobacillus reuteri CCM 8617 + 10% flaxseed + E. coli O149:F4). Supplements were administered for 42 days. Microbiological, hematological, and biochemical analyses, electrophoretic analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes, and analysis of fatty  using gas chromatography and isotachophoresis were performed. We recorded higher numbers of jejunal and ileal lactic  bacteria, lower Enterobacteriaceae counts in the feces of the animals, and an increased production of organic  in the synbiotic-fed group.

This provided a deeper insight and understanding of the relationship and interactions between the rumen microbiome and the host animal. New high-throughput techniques have revealed that the dominance of Proteobacteria in the neonatal gut might be derived from the maternal placenta through fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid in utero, which gradually decreases in the reticulum, omasum, and abomasum with increasing age after birth. Multi "omics" technologies have also enhanced rumen fermentation and production efficiency of dairy goats using dietary interventions through greater knowledge of the links between nutrition, metabolism, and the rumen microbiome and their effect in the environment. For example, supplementation of dietary lipid, such as linseed, affects rumen fermentation by favoring the accumulation of α-linolenic  biohydrogenation with a high correlation to the relative abundance of Fibrobacteriaceae. This provides greater resolution of the interlinkages among nutritional strategies, rumen microbes, and metabolism of the host animal that can set the foundation for new advancements in ruminant nutrition using multi 'omics' technologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566009>Naturopathic Oncology Care for Pediatric Cancers: A Practice Survey.</a></h2><p> The majority of pediatric oncology patients report use of complementary and alternative medicine.

A survey was conducted with members of the Oncology Association of Naturopathic Physicians (OncANP.org) to describe recommendations across four therapeutic domains: natural health products (NHPs), nutrition, physical medicine, and mental/emotional support.  We had 99 respondents with a wide variance of clinical experience and aptitude to treat children with cancer. Of the majority (52.5%) of respondents who choose not to treat these children, the three primary reasons for this are lack of public demand (45.1%), institutional or clinic restrictions (21.6%), and personal reasons/comfort (19.6%).

Industrial applications of these "unconventional"  take an advantage of their sporulating activity which greatly enhances their compatibility with chemical formulations used in the household, cosmetic or pharmaceutical chemistry. We have analysed 14 commercially available chemical products, labelled or described to contain a probiotic or biologically active component. It was determined that in the most part they relay on consortiums of spore-forming, very closely related Bacillus species, exhibiting bimodal existence in the environment and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).

EcN produces two siderophore-microcins (Mcc) responsible for an antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteriaceae. EcN also synthesizes the genotoxin colibactin encoded by the pks island. Colibactin is a virulence factor and a putative pro-carcinogenic compound. Therefore, we aimed to decouple the antagonistic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity. We demonstrated that the pks-encoded ClbP, the peptidase that activates colibactin, is required for the antagonistic activity of EcN. The analysis of a series of ClbP mutants revealed that this activity is linked to the transmembrane helices of ClbP and not the periplasmic peptidase domain, indicating the transmembrane domain is involved in some aspect of Mcc biosynthesis or secretion. A single amino  substitution in ClbP inactivates the genotoxic activity but maintains the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this point mutant reduced the clinical signs and the fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild type strain, whereas the clbP deletion mutant could neither protect nor outcompete the pathogen. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in vitro with other E. coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. In such strains, siderophore-Mcc synthesis also required the glucosyltransferase IroB involved in salmochelin production. This interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. This co-evolution observed in EcN illustrates the fine margin between pathogenicity and probiotic activity, and the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of .

Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05).  treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile, but an increase in acetate was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino  metabolism such as urocanic , citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with  ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats.

Among isolates, the highest percentage of adhesion was detected with chloroform, while the adhesion ability of selected isolates to pig intestinal epithelium was in the correlation with the results of adhesion ability with solvents. The auto-aggregation ability of isolates was demonstrated, while co-aggregation with Escherichia coli was strain specific.The results indicated the potential probiotic properties of the isolates and give evidence for further investigation and potential application in the dairy industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350779>Effect of different strategies of Lactobacillus plantarum incorporation in chorizo sausages.</a></h2><p>Chorizo is a high-value Spanish-type dry fermented sausage, highly appreciated by consumers. In this kind of product, Lactobacillus plantarum plays an important role in the fermentation process and can also be considered as a probiotic. The impact of different strategies for incorporating probiotic L. plantarum into the physico-chemical, microbiological, and sensorial characteristics of chorizo sausages was studied. These strategies were: free cells (Cfc); alginate beads (Calg); water-in-oil emulsion (Cwo), and water-in-oil-in-water emulsion (Cwow). Proximate composition, weight loss, pH, a , color, and microbiological behavior were evaluated during the ripening (20 days) of chorizo.The strategy of incorporating L. plantarum significantly affected the proximate composition, pH, and a of sausages. However, the traditional red color of chorizo was maintained for all formulations. The incorporation of  as free cells or encapsulated in alginate beads resulted in higher counts of lactic  bacteria and L. plantarum, lower counts of Enterobacteriaceae, and in acceptable sensory scores.Overall, the quality of chorizo sausages was conditioned by the incorporation strategy, and the addition of  in alginate beads (Calg) was the most effective strategy. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315227>Gut Microbiome: Profound Implications for Diet and Disease.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome plays an important role in human health and influences the development of chronic diseases ranging from metabolic disease to gastrointestinal disorders and colorectal cancer. Of increasing prevalence in Western societies, these conditions carry a high burden of care. Dietary patterns and environmental factors have a profound effect on shaping gut microbiota in real time. Diverse populations of intestinal bacteria mediate their beneficial effects through the fermentation of dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty , endogenous signals with important roles in lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Recent progress shows that an individual's starting microbial profile is a key determinant in predicting their response to intervention with live . The gut microbiota is complex and challenging to characterize. Enterotypes have been proposed using metrics such as alpha species diversity, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla, and the relative abundance of beneficial genera (e.g., , ) versus facultative anaerobes (), pro-inflammatory , or nonbacterial microbes. Microbiota composition and relative populations of bacterial species are linked to physiologic health along different axes. We review the role of diet quality, carbohydrate intake, fermentable FODMAPs, and prebiotic fiber in maintaining healthy gut flora. The implications are discussed for various conditions including obesity, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, depression, and cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428100>Fecal Changes Following Introduction of Milk in Infants With Outgrowing Non-IgE Cow's Milk Protein Allergy Are Influenced by Previous Consumption of the Probiotic LGG.</a></h2><p>Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most common allergy in the first year of life. Non-IgE mediated CMPA is characterized by digestive symptoms and tolerance development before the age of three. Gut microbiota composition in early life has been associated with food allergy. The ingestion of different foods/nutrients may mark different shifts in the microbial colonization of the infant intestine as well as the consumption of .  To analyze changes in microbiota composition and metabolic and cytokine profiles in fecal samples from infants with non-IgE mediated CMPA after successful milk challenges, tolerance acquisition, and increasing dairy introduction in their diet.  Twelve children with CMPA, aged between 1 and 2 years old, were recruited for the study. Participants were initially consuming hypoallergenic hydrolyzed formulas (four of them supplemented with the probiotic  GG), before being exposed to a standardized oral challenge (SOC) with cow's milk. Fecal samples were collected before, 1 week, and 1 month after performing the SOC. Changes in gut microbiota were determined by high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Levels of lactobacilli were also determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microbial metabolites were analyzed by chromatographic methods and fecal cytokines related to the Th1/Th2 balance were determined by immunoassay.  Lactic  bacteria significantly increased in infants who outgrew non-IgE CMPA, after the introduction of milk. Microbial metabolites derived from the fermentation of proteins, such as branched chain fatty , and -cresol, diminished. After the SOC, some cytokines related to inflammation (TNF-α, IFN-γ) increased. Accompanying the introduction of an unrestricted diet, we found significant differences in fecal microbial composition, metabolites, and cytokines between infants who did not consume the probiotic  GG and those that did.  These findings indicate that the introduction of intact milk proteins is followed by modifications in the infant gut environment through changes in immune mediators, microbiota, and its metabolic end-products. Consumption of  during CMPA may contribute to gut homeostasis by fine-tuning these profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581386>Probiotic and antioxidant properties of noble  KCCM 12203P isolated from kimchi and evaluation of immune-stimulating activities of its heat-killed cells in RAW 264.7 cells.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the probiotic properties of  KCCM 12203P isolated from the Korean traditional food kimchi and to evaluate the antioxidative activity and immune-stimulating potential of its heat-killed cells to improve their bio-functional activities.  GG, which is a representative commercial probiotic, was used as a comparative sample. Regarding probiotic properties,  KCCM 12203P was resistant to 0.3% pepsin with a pH of 2.5 for 3 h and 0.3% oxgall solution for 24 h, having approximately a 99% survival rate. It also showed strong adhesion activity (6.84%) onto HT-29 cells and did not produce β-glucuronidase but produced high quantities of leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, β-galactosidase, and -acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. For antioxidant activity, it appeared that viable cells had higher radical scavenging activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, while in the 2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic  (ABTS) assay, heat-killed cells had higher antioxidant activity. Additionally,  KCCM 12203P showed higher lipid oxidation inhibition ability than  GG; however, there was no significant difference ( < 0.05) between heat-killed cells and control cells. Furthermore, heat-killed  KCCM 12203P activated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells without cytotoxicity at a concentration lower than 10 CFU/ml and promoted higher gene expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 than  GG.

Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of , prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric  production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364964>Bacteriocin activity of  and  ssp. .</a></h2><p>.

Thirty-three strains of lactic  bacteria of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus genera from the Lomonosov Moscow State University Collection of Microorganisms (CM MSU) have been tested for important probiotic properties which assist these bacteria to settle effectively in intestines: cell adhesion, ability to form biofilms, agglutination with lectin (concanavalin A), and antimicrobial activity. The results of experiments clearly demonstrate that all these properties can be classified as strain characteristics and differ even within the same species. Besides the cultures of Lactobacillus with good agglutination ability with concanavalin A (Lact. caucasicus CM MSU 155, Lact. brevis CM MSU 521), we also discovered strains with high adhesion properties (Lact. acidophilus CM MSU 146-89% affinity for hexadecane; Lact. paracasei CM MSU 527-85%; Lact. plantarum CM MSU 508-78%; Lact. caucasicus CM MSU 155-70%; and Lact. delbrueckii CM MSU 571-57%), biofilm formation ability with a hydrophobic carrier (Lact. plantarum CM MSU 588-OD of crystal violet extracts = 1.336; Lact. brevis CM MSU 521-OD = 1.207; and Lact. brevis CM MSU 535-OD = 1.151), and with high antimicrobial activity specially to Staphylococcus aureus.

Such strains serve as the basis for developing  with a curative potential for the central nervous system - psychobioitcs. However, the question of how to find such strains and which criteria to use for their selection remains unanswered. Some compounds produced by bacteria, such as gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, are potential mediators between bacterial cells and the host. Previously, we established that some species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are capable of producing GABA. We presumed that GABA-producing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains are great candidates to use as psychobiotics. Therefore, we selected the strains Lactobacillus plantarum 90sk and Bifidobacterium adolescentis 150 as efficient GABA producers. The goal of this work was to assess the probiotic properties of the selected strains as well as their antidepressive effects in mice. We established that the ingestion of the probiotic composition based on the selected strains by BALB/c mice for 2 weeks reduced depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test; the effect was similar to that of fluoxetine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630331>Oral Vaccination with Hepatitis E Virus Capsid Protein and Immunobiotic Bacterium-Like Particles Induce Intestinal and Systemic Immunity in Mice.</a></h2><p>The hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 (GT3) is an emergent pathogen in industrialized countries. It is transmitted zoonotically and may lead to chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised individuals. We evaluated if the major antigen of HEV, the capsid protein, can be used in combination with immunobiotic bacterium-like particles (IBLP) for oral vaccination in a mouse model. We have cloned and expressed the RGS-His-tagged HEV GT3 capsid protein (ORF2) in E. coli and purified it by NiNTA. IBLP were obtained from two immunobiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains - and heat-treated. ORF2 and the IBLP were orally administered to Balb/c mice. After three oral immunizations (14-day intervals), blood, intestinal fluid, Peyer´s patches, and spleen samples were drawn. IgA- and IgG-specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. Mononuclear cell populations from Peyer's patches and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the cytokine profiles were determined by ELISA to study cellular immunity. Orally administered recombinant ORF2 and IBLP from two L. rhamnosus strains (CRL1505 and IBL027) induced both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. IBLP027 was more effective in inducing specific secretory IgA in the gut. IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-4 were produced by Peyer's plaques lymphocytes stimulated with ORF2 ex vivo suggesting a mixed Th1/Th2-type adaptive immune response in immunized mice. Oral vaccines are not invasive, do not need to be administered by specialized personal, and elicit both systemic and local immune responses at the port of entry.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and  and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

The aim of this narrative review was to investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory nutrients, foods, and diets on inflammatory markers and fatigue in various patient populations. Next to observational and epidemiological studies, a total of 21 human trials have been evaluated in this work. Current available research is indicative, rather than evident, regarding the effectiveness of individuals' use of single nutrients with anti-inflammatory and fatigue-reducing effects. In contrast, clinical studies demonstrate that a balanced diet with whole grains high in fibers, polyphenol-rich vegetables, and omega-3 fatty -rich foods might be able to improve disease-related fatigue symptoms. Nonetheless, further research is needed to clarify conflicting results in the literature and substantiate the promising results from human trials on fatigue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270125>Translating Recent Microbiome Insights in Otitis Media into Probiotic Strategies.</a></h2><p>SUMMARYThe microbiota of the upper respiratory tract (URT) protects the host from bacterial pathogenic colonization by competing for adherence to epithelial cells and by immune response regulation that includes the activation of antimicrobial and (anti-)inflammatory components. However, environmental or host factors can modify the microbiota to an unstable community that predisposes the host to infection or inflammation.

Sixty patients treated and scheduled to undergo radical resection of colorectal cancer in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from March 2017 to December 2017 were selected and randomly divided into the glucose solution group (n=30) and combined  group (n=30). Patients in both groups took orally 12.5% glucose solution before surgery, and those in the combined  group received bifidus-triple viable preparation every day for 7 consecutive days. Changes in endotoxin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentration, white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-lactic  and urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) were detected before surgery and at 1, 3 and 7 days after surgery. The general condition was observed and changes in intestinal florae were compared between the two groups. The body temperature was measured every 4 h with an electronic thermometer, and the duration of fever was recorded (from the first day after operation to the time with normal body temperature after operation, axillary temperature <37.4°C), and the average heart rate was recorded by the ECG monitor. In addition, the time of the first anal exsufflation (the time from the beginning of the operation to the first anal exsufflation) was recorded. In the combined  group, the plasma endotoxin, IGF-I concentration, D-lactic  and urinary L/M levels were significantly lower than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Moreover, the duration of postoperative fever, average heart rate at 7 days after surgery as well as WBC and CRP clinical indexes were obviously shorter and lower in the combined  group than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Therefore, the combined application of  after surgery can effectively improve the imbalance of intestinal flora.

Nine strains were pre-screened from 485 lactic  bacteria based on their survival at a low pH and in a solution containing bile salts. All candidates were capable of surviving in an environment with low pH and with bile salts and could successfully colonize the intestine. Furthermore, their functional properties, such as anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation, were evaluated. Of the nine probiotic candidates, Lactobacillus plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 exhibited the highest anti-oxidative capacity. Moreover, only L. plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 could increase gut barrier function by upregulating the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins and inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators induced by LPS-stimulated inflammation. Interestingly, these two strains were also capable of regulating several bone metabolism-related markers playing a role in bone homeostasis and osteoblast differentiation.

This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile , SCFA and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut microbiota and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of , bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), fecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Exercise and sodium butyrate (NaB) exert metabolic benefits in both mice and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to examine the effect of exercise training and dietary supplementation of butyrate on the composition of gut microbiota and whether the altered gut microbiota can stimulate differential production of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), which promote the expression of Sesn2 and CRTC2 to improve metabolic health and protect against obesity. C57BL/6J mice were used to study the effect of exercise and high-fat diet (HFD) with or without NaB on gut microbiota. Bacterial communities were assayed in fecal samples using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Western blot was performed using relevant antibodies to detect the protein expressions in liver and HepG2 cell extracts. Exercise and butyrate administration significantly reversed metabolic dysfunctions induced by HFD (p < 0.05). The number of Firmicutes and the proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes order were predominant in all HFD groups (p = 0.001). Exercise and butyrate supplementation significantly inhibited the relative abundance of lipopolysaccharide-producing phyla (p = 0.001). Sesn2 and CRTC2 expression in the liver of mice were significantly increased after exercise (p < 0.05) and/or supplementation of butyrate (p < 0.05). Exercise enhances butyrate-producing fecal bacteria and increases butyrate production and consequently improves lipid metabolism through the butyrate -Sesn2/CRTC2 pathway.

The MJM60397 strain was susceptible to antibiotics and was found to be non-mucinolytic and non-hemolytic, and does not produce bioamines. In addition, MJM60397 tolerated simulated oro-gastrointestinal conditions and adhered to Caco-2 cells. MJM60397 also exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity and could deconjugate bile . The hypocholesterolemic effects of strain MJM60397 were studied in high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemic male ICR mice. The mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) and were divided into the following three experimental groups: HCD-control (HCD-Con), mice fed with HCD + L. fermentum MJM60397 (HCD-MJM60397), and mice fed with HCD + L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 (HCD-L.ac) as the positive control. Simultaneously, a normal control diet (NCD) group was maintained. After 7 weeks, the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in the livers of the HCD-MJM60397 mice when compared to those in the HCD-Con and HCD-L.ac mice. Fecal total bile  content was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the HCD-MJM60397 group than in the NCD, HCD-Con, and HCD-L.ac groups. Analysis of gene expression revealed higher expression of LDLR gene in the livers of the HCD-MJM60397 and HCD-L.ac mice than in the livers of the HCD-Con mice. These findings show that the hypocholesterolemic effects of the MJM60397 strain were attributable to its bile salt deconjugating activity, which resulted in decreased bile  absorption and increased excretion of bile  in the feces. These results indicate that L. fermentum MJM60397 could be developed into a potential probiotic for reducing the serum cholesterol levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632456>Management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: a review of nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions.</a></h2><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal (GI) condition involving numerous potential causative factors (e.g. alterations in gut microbiota, motility, brain-gut axis).

In addition, data indicate that alosetron improves IBS symptoms; however, it is approved only for women with severe IBS-D. Of the three approved agents, rifaximin has the most favorable safety profile. The risk-benefit ratio is an important consideration with every medication, but is especially important in the treatment of functional GI disorders such as IBS-D. Thus, the most troublesome symptoms, quality of life, symptom intensity, and individual patient preferences should be considered when formulating a management plan for patients with IBS-D.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368544>Health promoting activities of .</a></h2><p>In recent years,  have received increasing attention and become one type of popular functional food because of their many biological functions. Among these desirable biological functions, the immune regulation, antioxidative activities, and antimicrobial effects are essential properties to maintain host health.  can regulate the immune system and improve the antioxidative system by producing microbial components and metabolites. Meanwhile,  also possess antimicrobial abilities owing to their competition for nutrient requirements and mucus adherence, reducing pathogenic toxins, producing antimicrobial metabolites (short-chain fatty , bacteriocins, reuterin, linoleic , and secondary bile ) and enhancing intestinal, or systemic immunity. Therefore,  could be used to alleviate heavy metal toxicity and metabolic disorders by improving immunity, the antioxidative system, and intestinal micro-environment. This comprehensive review mainly highlights the potential health promoting activities of  based on their antioxidative, antimicrobial, and immune regulatory effects. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The antioxidative defense and the immune system are essential to maintain human health. However, many factors may result in microbial dysbiosis in the gut, which subsequently leads to pathogenic expansion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Therefore, it is important to explore beneficial foods to prevent or suppress these abnormal responses. Successful application of  in the functional foods has attracted increasing attention due to their immune regulatory, antioxidative, and antimicrobial properties. The aim of this review is to introduce immune regulatory antioxidative and antimicrobial effects of , which provides some basic theories for scientific research and development of potential functional foods.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31338788>Characteristic of Bacteriocins of Lactobacillus rhamnosus BTK 20-12 Potential Probiotic Strain.</a></h2><p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious health threat throughout the world resulting in reduced efficacy of antibacterial, antiparasitic, antiviral, and antifungal drugs. One of the most promising concepts that may represent a good alternative to antibiotics can be the use of bacteriocins obtained from lactic  bacteria. The L. rhamnosus BTK 20-12 strain was isolated from traditional Armenian naturally fermented salted cheese. The probiotic potential of the strain was approved. It was shown that strain produced at less two bacteriocins (BCN 1 and BCN 2) with different molecular weight (1427 Da and 602.6 Da, respectively). Bacteriocins inhibited the growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria of different etiologies and belong to different taxonomic groups with diverse efficiency and it depends on properties of bacteriocins, as well as from isolation sources of pathogens. Thus, bacteriocins of L. rhamnosus BTK 20-12 have protein-like nature and a broad range of activity and are excellent candidates for the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic substances to complement or replace conventional antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623188>Adjuvant Strategies for Lactic  Bacterial Mucosal Vaccines.</a></h2><p>Lactic  bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive, -tolerant bacteria that have long been used in food fermentation and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). LAB are a part of a normal microbiome and act as , improving the gastrointestinal microbiome and health when consumed. An increasing body of research has shown the importance of the microbiome on both mucosal immune heath and immune response to pathogens and oral vaccines. Currently, there are few approved mucosal vaccines, and most are attenuated viruses or bacteria, which necessitates cold chain, carries the risk of reversion to virulence, and can have limited efficacy in individuals with poor mucosal health. On account of these limitations, new types of mucosal vaccine vectors are necessary. There has been increasing interest and success in developing recombinant LAB as next generation mucosal vaccine vectors due to their natural  and bile resistance, stability at room temperature, endogenous activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and the development of molecular techniques that allow for manipulation of their genomes. To enhance the immunogenicity of these LAB vaccines, numerous adjuvant strategies have been successfully employed. Here, we review these adjuvant strategies and their mechanisms of action which include: Toll-like receptor ligands, secretion of bacterial toxins, secretion of cytokines, direct delivery to antigen presenting cells, and enterocyte targeting. The ability to increase the immune response to LAB vaccines gives them the potential to be powerful mucosal vaccine vectors against mucosal pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534458> Evaluation of Probiotic Properties of Lactic  Bacteria Isolated from Some Traditionally Fermented Ethiopian Food Products.</a></h2><p> are live microorganisms which when consumed in large number together with a food promote the health of the consumer.

The aim of this study was therefore to experimentally determine the HGT potential in the microbiota of a healthy preterm infant twin pair and to evaluate the global occurrence of the mobilized elements.Stool samples were collected. Both shotgun metagenome sequencing and bacterial culturing were done for the same samples. A range of experimental conditions were used to test DNA transfer for the cultured isolates. Searches for global distribution of transferable elements were done for the ~120,000 metagenomic samples in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database.DNA transfer experiments demonstrated frequent transmission of an ESBL encoding IncI1 plasmid, a high copy number ColEI plasmid, and bacteriophage P1. Both IncI1 and ColE1 were abundant in the stool samples. In vitro competition experiments showed that transconjugants containing IncI1 plasmids outcompeted the recipient strain in the absence of antibiotic selection.

Gallstones can be pigmentary, cholesterol (75%) or mixed. Age, female sex, obesity, rapid weight loss, consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, iron deficiency, vitamin D and low intake of fiber and vitamin C are factors associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis. On the other hand, the intake of ω-3 fatty , oleic , calcium, magnesium, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, coffee, moderate consumption of alcohol, vitamin C supplements, physical exercise and a regular diet have a protective paper. The most frequent kidney stones are calcium oxalate followed by mixed ones (oxalate and calcium phosphate), struvite, uric  and cystine. A high water intake is recommended (> 2.5 l / day), varying the type of recommended or unadvisable food depending on the type of calculus. In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading  (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (liver, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary. The nutritional intervention is an effective measure in the prevention of biliary and renal lithiasis and prevent its recurrence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201450>Survival of probiotic bacteria in the presence of food grade nanoparticles from chocolates: an in vitro and in vivo study.</a></h2><p>The use of  to treat gastrointestinal diseases such as diarrhea especially in children is becoming increasingly popular. Besides, the use of nanomaterials in food products is increasing rapidly especially in candies and chocolates. How these nanomaterials influence probiotic bacteria and their activity remains unexplored. Therefore, nanomaterials from commercial chocolate were purified and characterized by using SEM-EDS and XRD. The tested chocolate contained nano-TiO with an average size of ~ 40 nm. The influence of the extracted TiO on a commercial probiotic formulation usually used to treat diarrhea in children was studied. The probiotic formulation contained Bacillus coagulans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium as evident from 16S rRNA gene sequences and polyphasic characterization. Isolated bacteria exhibited known probiotic activities like biofilm formation,  production, growth at 6% salt, and antibiotic resistance. TiO from chocolates inhibited the growth and activity of the probiotic formulation over a concentration range of 125-500μg/ml in vitro. Based on results, it is estimated that 20 g of such chocolate contains enough TiO to disturb the gut microbial community of children aged 2-8 years with a stomach capacity of ~ 0.5-0.9 l. The in vivo study on white albino mice shows the same response but with a higher dose. The results obtained by plate counts, MTT assay, live/dead staining, and qPCR suggest that TiO from chocolates inhibits the growth and viability of probiotic bacteria in mice gut even at a concentration of 50-100 μg/day/mice. Therefore, TiO in chocolate discourages survival of probiotic bacteria in the human gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213524>Porcine Feed Efficiency-Associated Intestinal Microbiota and Physiological Traits: Finding Consistent Cross-Locational Biomarkers for Residual Feed Intake.</a></h2><p>Optimal feed efficiency (FE) in pigs is important for economic and environmental reasons. Previous research identified FE-associated bacterial taxa within the intestinal microbiota of growing pigs. This study investigated whether FE-associated bacteria and selected FE-associated physiological traits were consistent across geographic locations (Republic of Ireland [ROI] [two batches of pigs, ROI1 and ROI2], Northern Ireland [NI], and Austria [AT]), where differences in genetic, dietary, and management factors were minimized. Pigs ( = 369) were ranked, within litter, on divergence in residual feed intake (RFI), and 100 extremes were selected (50 with high RFI and 50 with low RFI) across geographic locations for intestinal microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and examination of FE-associated physiological parameters. Microbial diversity varied by geographic location and intestinal sampling site but not by RFI rank, except in ROI2, where more-feed-efficient pigs had greater ileal and cecal diversity. Although none of the 188 RFI-associated taxonomic differences found were common to all locations/batches, , , RF16, , , and two uncultured genera were more abundant within the fecal or cecal microbiota of low-RFI pigs in two geographic locations and/or in both ROI batches. These are major contributors to carbohydrate metabolism, which was reflected in functional predictions. Fecal volatile fatty  and salivary cortisol were the only physiological parameters that differed between RFI ranks. Despite controlling genetics, diet specification, dietary phases, and management practices in each rearing environment, the rearing environment, encompassing maternal influence, herd health status, as well as other factors, appears to impact intestinal microbiota more than FE. Interest in the role of intestinal microbiota in determining FE in pigs has increased in recent years. However, it is not known if the same FE-associated bacteria are found across different rearing environments. In this study, geographic location and intestinal sampling site had a greater influence on the pig gut microbiome than FE. This presents challenges when aiming to identify consistent reliable microbial biomarkers for FE. Nonetheless, seven FE-associated microbial taxa were common across two geographic locations and/or two batches within one location, and these indicated a potentially "healthier" and metabolically more capable microbiota in more-feed-efficient pigs. These taxa could potentially be employed as biomarkers for FE, although bacterial consortia, rather than individual taxa, may be more likely to predict FE. They may also merit consideration for use as  or could be targeted by dietary means as a strategy for improving FE in pigs in the future.Copyright © 2019 McCormack et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613894>Evaluation of date palm pollen (Phoenix dactylifera L.) encapsulation, impact on the nutritional and functional properties of fortified yoghurt.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate Egyptian date palm pollen (DPP) grains composition, physical and functional potentials in comparing with two forms; 80% ethanol extract, and nanoencapsulated form. Functional yoghurt fortified with DPP in three forms was prepared and their physicochemical, microstructure, texture and sensory characteristics were assessed.

In the present study, six  strains isolated from natural whey cultures were analyzed for their phenotype and genotype in exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, low pH and bile salt tolerance, bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, and antibiotic resistance profile. In addition, a comparative genomic investigation was performed between the six newly sequenced strains and the 51 publicly available genomes of  to define the pangenome structure. The results indicate that the newly sequenced strain UC1267 and the deposited strain DSM 20075 can be considered good candidates for gut-adapted strains due to their ability to survive in the presence of 0.2% glycocholic  (GCA) and 1% taurocholic and taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA). Moreover, these strains had the highest bile salt deconjugation activity among the tested  strains. Considering the safety profile, none of these strains presented antibiotic resistance phenotypically and/or at the genome level. The pangenome analysis revealed genes specific to the new isolates, such as enzymes related to folate biosynthesis in strains UC1266 and UC1267 and an integrated phage in strain UC1035.

Most cases are of unknown cause. Although the mechanisms triggering PTB remain unclear, an inappropriate increase in net inflammatory load seems to be key. To date, interventions that reduce the risk of PTB are effective only in specific groups of women, probably due to the heterogeneity of its etiopathogenesis. Use of progesterone is the most effective, but only in singleton pregnancies with history of PTB. Thus, primary prevention is greatly needed and nutritional and bioactive solutions are a promising alternative. Among these, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is the most promising to reduce the risk for early PTB. Other potential nutrient interventions include the administration of zinc (possibly limited to populations with low nutritional status or poor zinc status) and vitamin D; additional preliminary evidence exists for vitamin A, calcium, iron, folic , combined iron-folate, magnesium, multiple micronutrients, and .

Due to the volumetric microwave input, a time reduction of up to 90% is possible. When drying viscous liquids, a foamed structure that remains stable during drying exhibits further advantages as the diffusion-limited third drying step is enhanced by the porous structure. As foams not only have to be thermally resistant during microwave vacuum processing, but also withstand the vacuum, a specific process for foam drying by microwaves under low pressure conditions was developed. Foam formation and stabilization was achieved by using a synergistic mixture of proteins and carbohydrates; Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei F19 (L. paracasei) served as a model sensitive substance. Investigation of surface activity and foaming properties as a function of L. paracasei concentration revealed a significant positive contribution of the bacterial cells. It was shown that L. paracasei directly adsorbed at the air-water interface. Besides, a structuring of the liquid lamellae was assumed. Moreover, drying time was reduced to at least 50% compared to microwave vacuum drying without foaming. It was further observed that the slight loss in survival was mainly due to the relatively high moisture content and high vacuum levels at the beginning of the process. However, foaming, vacuum application, and final drying, respectively, did not affect viability of the bacterial cells. Thus, by incorporation of lactic  bacteria into foam structures, drying can be carried out in a fraction of time, and further results in high-product quality. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The application of continuous foam drying offers an efficient and energy-saving alternative to the currently applied techniques for the processing of sensitive material. The process could be applied for the preservation of starter cultures and  as well as in the pharmaceutical industry, when sensitive material such as therapeutic proteins is dried.

Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation in PD might originate in the intestine and the bidirectional communication between the central and enteric nervous system, the so-called "gut-brain axis," has received growing attention due to its contribution to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Diet targets mediators of inflammation with various mechanisms and combined with dopaminergic treatment can exert various beneficial effects in PD. Food-based therapies may favorably modulate gut microbiota composition and enhance the intestinal epithelial integrity or decrease the proinflammatory response by direct effects on immune cells. Diets rich in pre- and , polyunsaturated fatty , phenols including flavonoids, and vitamins, such as the Mediterranean diet or a plant-based diet, may attenuate chronic inflammation and positively influence PD symptoms and even progression of the disease. Dietary strategies should be encouraged in the context of a healthy lifestyle with physical activity, which also has neuroimmune-modifying properties. Thus, diet adaptation appears to be an effective additive, nonpharmacological therapeutic strategy that can attenuate the chronic inflammation implicated in PD, potentially slow down degeneration, and thereby modify the course of the disease. PD patients should be highly encouraged to adopt corresponding lifestyle modifications, in order to improve not only PD symptoms, but also general quality of life.

The safety of these isolates was evaluated by their hemolytic and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activities. Based on these results, seven isolates with the best probiotic attributes were selected and presented in this study. These LAB isolates, with 51.91-70.34% survival at low pH, proved their resistance to gastric conditions. The cell surface hydrophobicity of 50.32-77.8% and auto aggregation of 51.02-78.95% represented the adhesion properties of these isolates.

Although some nutrients, such as glutamine, show promising short term outcome in clinical studies, no evident long term effect of any supplemented nutrient was found. Main limitations were inclusion of studies no older than 10 years at time of search and studies that focused on single nutritional components only.  Even though many pre-clinical trials demonstrate promising effects of different nutritional interventions on reducing brain injury and/or improving neurodevelopmental outcome, these positive effects have so far not evidently been demonstrated in RCTs. More clinically relevant animal models and long term follow up after clinical trials are needed to move novel nutritional therapies from bench to bedside of preterm infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280746>Review: nutritional and endocrine control of colostrogenesis in swine.</a></h2><p>Colostrum plays an essential role in ensuring the survival, growth and health of piglets by providing energy, nutrients, immunoglobulins, growth factors and many other bioactive components and cells. Both colostrum yield and composition are highly variable among sows, yet mechanisms and factors that regulate colostrogenesis are not fully known. Unlike sow milk yield, sow colostrum yield is not highly determined by litter size and suckling intensity but is largely driven by sow-related factors. Colostrum synthesis is under hormonal control, with prolactin and progesterone concentrations prepartum having, respectively, positive and negative influences on colostrum yield. Less is known about the endocrine control of the end of colostrogenesis in swine, which is characterized by the closure of tight junctions in the mammary epithelium and the cessation of transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) into lacteal secretions. Recent studies indicate that exogenous hormones may influence colostrogenesis. Inducing parturition by injecting prostaglandin F2α on day 114 of gestation in combination with an oxytocin-like molecule reduced colostrum yield, and injection of prostaglandin F2α alone either reduced colostrum yield or had no effect. Injecting a supraphysiological dose of oxytocin to sows in the early postpartum period delayed the tightening of mammary tight junctions, thereby prolonging the colostral phase and increasing concentrations of IGF-I and IgG and IgA in early milk. The development of strategies to improve colostrum composition in swine through maternal feeding has been largely explored but very few attempts were made to increase colostrum yield. This is most likely because of the difficulty in measuring colostrum yield in swine. The fatty  content of colostrum greatly depends on the amount of lipids provided in the sow diet during late gestation, whereas the fatty  profile is largely influenced by the type of lipid being fed to the pregnant sow. Moreover, various ingredients that presumably have immuno-modulating effects (such as fish oil, prebiotics and ) increased concentrations of IgG, IgA and/or IgM in sow colostrum when they were provided during the last weeks of gestation. Finally, there is some evidence that sow nutrition during late gestation may influence colostrum yield but this clearly warrants more research. This review emphasizes that although progress has been made in understanding the control of colostrogenesis in swine, and that strategies exist to manipulate fat and immunoglobulin contents of colostrum, ways to increase colostrum yield are still lacking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257793>The Joint Effect of pH Gradient and Glucose Feeding on the Growth Kinetics of  CECT 539 in Glucose-Limited Fed-Batch Cultures.</a></h2><p>Two glucose-limited realkalized fed-batch cultures of  CECT 539 were carried out in a diluted whey medium (DW) using two different feeding media. The cultures were fed a mixture of a 400 g/l concentrated lactose and a concentrated mussel processing waste (CMPW, 101.72 g glucose/l) medium (fermentation I) or a CMPW medium supplemented with glucose and KHPO up to concentrations of 400 g glucose/l and 3.21 g total phosphorus/l, respectively (fermentation II). For an accurate description and a better understanding of the kinetics of both cultures, the growth and product formation by  CECT 539 were both modelled, for the first time, as a function of the amounts of glucose () added and the pH gradient () generated in every realkalization and feeding cycle, by using an empirical polynomial model. With this modeling procedure, the kinetics of biomass, viable cell counts, nisin, lactic , acetic  and butane-2,3-diol production in both cultures were successfully described (  values > 0.970) and interpreted for the first time. In addition, the optimum  and  values for each product were accurately calculated in the two realkalized fed-batch cultures. This approach appears to be useful for designing feeding strategies to enhance the productions of biomass, bacteriocin, and metabolites by the nisin-producing strain in wastes from the food industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647207>Autophagy: A Novel Mechanism Involved in the Anti-Inflammatory Abilities of .</a></h2><p>Deregulation of the complex interaction among host genetics, gut microbiota and environmental factors on one hand and aberrant immune responses on the other hand, are known to be associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease.

While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients,  remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of .© Copyright by the Author(s).

These proteins are hydrolyzed by bacterial proteases and peptidases, releasing amino , which in turn are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota (IM) for protein synthesis and production of various metabolites that can exert positive or deleterious effects, depending on their concentrations, at the colonic or systemic level. On the other hand, proanthocyanidins are polymers of flavan-3-ols which cannot be absorbed at the intestinal level, accumulating in the colon where they are fermented by the IM producing metabolites that appear beneficial for colonocytes and also at the peripheral level. This study evaluated the effect of an avocado peel polyphenol extract (AvPPE) rich in proanthocyanidins on the production of cecal bacterial metabolites and microbiota composition in rats fed a HPD. Compared with the normal-protein (NP) group, HPD did not markedly affect the body weight gain of the animals, but increased the kidney weight. Additionally, the HPD induced a higher cecal concentration of ammonia (NH4+/NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and branched-chain fatty  (BCFAs). The supplementation with AvPPE attenuated the production of H2S and increased the production of indole. On the other hand, the HPD affected the composition of the cecal microbiota, increasing the relative abundance of the genera Bacteroides and Lactobacillus, while decreasing Prevotella. The AvPPE counteracted the increase induced by the HPD on the genus Lactobacillus, and increased the relative abundance of [Prevotella].

The pathophysiological understanding of and therapeutic resources for these neuropsychiatric disorders are still limited. Humans harbor over 1000 unique bacterial species in our gut, which have been linked to both physical and mental/cognitive health. The gut microbiome is a novel and promising avenue to understand the attributes of psychiatric diseases and, potentially, to modify them. Building upon our previous work, this systematic review evaluates the most recent evidence of the gut microbiome in clinical populations with serious mental illness (SMI). Sixteen articles that met our selection criteria were reviewed, including cross-sectional cohort studies and longitudinal treatment trials. All studies reported alterations in the gut microbiome of patients with SMI compared to non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs), and beta-diversity was consistently reported to be different between schizophrenia and NCs. Ruminococcaceae and Faecalibacterium were relatively decreased in BD, and abundance of Ruminococcaceae was reported across several investigations of SMI to be associated with better clinical characteristics. Lactic  bacteria were relatively more abundant in SMI and associated with worse clinical outcomes. There was very limited evidence for the efficacy of probiotic or prebiotic interventions in SMI. As microbiome research in psychiatry is still nascent, the extant literature has several limitations. We critically evaluate the current data, including experimental approaches. There is a need for more unified methodological standards in order to arrive at robust biological understanding of microbial contributions to SMI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Strategies to prevent RRI include the use of immunomodulators as pidotimod or , but there is limited evidence of their efficacy on clinical features or on urine metabolic profile.To evaluate whether pidotimod and/or bifidobacteria can reduce RRI morbidity and influence the urine metabolic profile in preschool children.Children aged 3-6 years with RRI were enrolled in a four-arm, exploratory, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pidotimod plus bifidobacteria, pidotimod plus placebo, bifidobacteria plus placebo or double placebo for the first 10 days of each month over 4 consecutive months. Respiratory symptoms and infections were recorded with a daily diary by parents during the study. Metabolomic analyses on urine samples collected before and after treatment were performed.Compared to placebo, children receiving pidotimod, alone or with bifidobacteria, had more symptom-free days (69 versus 44, p = 0.003; and 65 versus 44, p = 0.02, respectively) and a lower percentage of days with common cold (17% versus 37%, p = 0.005; and 15% versus 37%, p = 0.004, respectively).

Thus, the current study investigates the effect of constipation symptoms on gut functionality following the modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites via dietary fiber intervention.Constipation causes a significantly reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) production and a higher level of iso-butyrate. The feces of constipated people are characterized with inhibited Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Roseburia abundance. Desulfovibrionaceae is identified to be an important endotoxin producer in constipated patients, and a butyrate-enriched SCFAs profile achieved by dietary fiber supplement accelerates gastrointestinal transit and increases the thickness of the mucosal layer, possibly through triggering the secretion of colonic hormones and enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. More importantly, an interacting regulatory mechanism among SCFAs, in particular butyrate and propionate, may be involved in signaling between the microbiome and host cells in the colon.Gut microbiota, characterized with enriched butyrate-producing and depressed Desulfovibrionaceae bacteria, attenuates constipation symptoms through promoting intestinal hormones secretion and maintaining gut barrier integrity.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Kefir consumption has been associated with many advantageous properties to general health, including as an antioxidative, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-tumor moiety. This beverage is commonly found and consumed by people in the United States of America, China, France, Brazil, and Japan. Recently, the consumption of kefir has been popularized in other countries including Malaysia. The microflora in kefir from different countries differs due to variations in culture conditions and the starter media. Thus, this study was aimed at isolating and characterizing the lactic  bacteria that are predominant in Malaysian kefir grains via macroscopic examination and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The results revealed that the Malaysian kefir grains are dominated by three different strains of Lactobacillus strains, which are Lactobacillus harbinensis, Lactobacillusparacasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The probiotic properties of these strains, such as  and bile salt tolerances, adherence ability to the intestinal mucosa, antibiotic resistance, and hemolytic test, were subsequently conducted and extensively studied. The isolated Lactobacillus spp. from kefir H maintained its survival rate within 3 h of incubation at pH 3 and pH 4 at 98.0 ± 3.3% and 96.1 ± 1.7% of bacteria growth and exhibited the highest survival at bile salt condition at 0.3% and 0.5%. The same isolate also showed high adherence ability to intestinal cells at 96.3 ± 0.01%, has antibiotic resistance towards ampicillin, penicillin, and tetracycline, and showed no hemolytic activity.

The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum DR7, L. fermentum DR9, and L. reuteri 8513d administration on the fecal microbiota profile, short-chain fatty , and water-soluble compounds were analyzed. It was found that the administration of the selected strains altered the gut microbiota diversity and composition, even at the phylum level. The fecal short-chain fatty  content was also higher in groups that were administered with the potential probiotic strains. Analysis of the fecal water-soluble metabolites revealed that administration of L. plantarum DR7 and L. reuteri 8513d led to higher fecal content of compounds related to amino  metabolism such as tryptophan, leucine, tyrosine, cysteine, methionine, valine, and lysine; while administration of L. fermentum DR9 led to higher prevalence of compounds related to carbohydrate metabolism such as erythritol, xylitol, and arabitol.

This study prepared microcapsules using an emulsification and internal gelation encapsulation method with sodium alginate, chitosan, and  as wall material, coating material, and experimental strain, respectively. Optical, scanning electron, and focal microscopes were used to observe the microcapsule surface morphology and internal viable cell distribution, and a laser particle size analyzer and zeta potentiometer were used to evaluate the chitosan-coating characteristics. In addition, microcapsule probiotic viability after storage, heat treatment, and simulated gastrointestinal fluid treatment were examined. Alginate microcapsules and chitosan-coated alginate microcapsules both had balling properties and uniform bacterial distribution. The latter kept its balling properties after freeze-drying, verified by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and had a clear external coating, observed by an optical microscope. The particle size of chitosan-coated alginate microcapsules was slightly larger than the uncoated microcapsules. The zeta potential of alginate and chitosan-coated alginate microcapsules was negative and positive, respectively. Heat,  and bile salt tolerance, and stability tests revealed that the decrease of viable cells in the chitosan-coated alginate microcapsule group was significantly lower than that in uncoated microcapsules.

Although the mechanism of ICP is still not fully understood, the reproductive hormones seem to play an important role. Recent studies show that a progesterone metabolite, epiallopregnanolone sulfate (PM5S), is supraphysiologically elevated in the serum of ICP patients, indicating it may play an etiology role in ICP. Bile  homeostasis is controlled by multiple mechanisms including farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated bile  export and synthesis. It is known that cholic  (CA), a primary bile , can activate FXR, which is inhibited by PM5S, an FXR antagonist. Here we employed a mouse model of concurrent exposure of CA and PM5S-induced liver injury and determined the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in the prevention of the bile  disorders and liver injury. Mice challenged with CA + PM5S had significantly increased levels of serum and hepatic bile  and bilirubin and liver enzyme. Pretreatment with LGG significantly reduced bile  and bilirubin levels associated with reduced liver enzyme level and mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also showed that the beneficial effects of LGG is likely mediated by hepatic FXR activation and bile salt export pump (BSEP) upregulation.

In addition, it is associated to alteration reduction in trophic factors affecting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In recent years, attention has been paid to the relationship between gut microbiota and brain. In aging, there is an alteration in microbiota, gut microbiota diversity is perturbed with an increase in pathogenic bacteria at the expense of beneficial ones. Dysbiosis may lead to chronic inflammation, and a decrease in bacteria metabolites such as short-chain fatty  which have been related to an upregulation of neurotrophic factors. Supplementation with prebiotics and  can modulate gut microbiota, returning it to a more physiological state; thus, they may be considered as a possible treatment for age-related cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Such improvements are needed to decipher the utilization of microbiome modulators for human health benefits. However, the large-scale screening and optimization of modulators to validate microbiome modulation and predict related health benefits may be practically difficult due to the need for large number of animals and/or human subjects. To this end, in vitro or ex vivo models can facilitate preliminary screening of microbiome modulators. Herein, it is optimized and demonstrated an ex vivo fecal microbiota culture system that can be used for examining the effects of various interventions of gut microbiome modulators including , prebiotics and other food ingredients, aside from nutraceuticals and drugs, on the diversity and composition of the human gut microbiota. Inulin, one of the most widely studied prebiotic compounds and microbiome modulators, is used as an example here to examine its effect on the healthy fecal microbiota composition and its metabolic activities, such as fecal pH and the fecal levels of organic  including lactate and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). The protocol may be useful for studies aimed at estimating the effects of different interventions of modulators on fecal microbiota profiles and at predicting their health impacts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555256>A State-of-Art Review on Multi-Drug Resistant Pathogens in Foods of Animal Origin: Risk Factors and Mitigation Strategies.</a></h2><p>Most of the foodborne microbial diseases are linked to foods of animal origin such as milk, meat, and poultry. Nowadays, the presence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens in foods is becoming an increasingly public health concern worldwide due to the overuse of antimicrobial drugs in animal feed. MDR pathogens can enter the food chain by posing a significant risk to both animals and consumers. MDR pathogens causing infections are untreatable due to their resistance to various antibiotics, primarily cephalosporin and carbapenems and to their extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing capability. In addition, foods of animal origin and food-related environments can be likely vehicles for spreading of multi-drug resistance genes, which accelerates the thriving of global antibiotic resistance. This paper reviews the role of foods of animal origin as a vehicle for MDR pathogens, stressing the contribution of food processes, environments, and storage conditions in dissemination and reduction of antimicrobial resistances (AMRs). Controlling the growth of MDR microorganisms and limiting the transmission/expression of AMR genes in food ecosystems could be an effective mitigation strategy, putting the focus on food processes as a part of the solution for AMR in foods. Bioprotective cultures are also a promising and environmentally friendly technology to reduce the incidence of MDR pathogens, though caution is taken as microbial starters and  can also carry AMR. Finally, applying Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and predictive microbiology, within a Risk Assessment framework, is key to get insight into those mechanisms and conditions along the food chain favoring or reducing AMR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299361>Functional genome annotation depicts probiotic properties of Bacillus velezensis FTC01.</a></h2><p>An in silico genome analysis of the probiotic Bacillus strain FTC01 was performed. The draft genome comprises 3.9 Mb, with a G + C content of 46.6% and a total of 3941 coding sequences. The species of strain FTC01 was defined as B. velezensis during GenBank genome annotation, following the current nomenclature. Eight gene clusters involved in the synthesis of non-ribosomal lipopeptides, polyketides and bacilysin were found, as well as part of the gene cluster involved in the synthesis of cyclic lipopeptide locillomycin. The production of lipopeptides surfactin and iturin by strain FTC01 was confirmed. In addition, a gene encoding a peptidylprolyl isomerase, involved in bacterial adhesion to the host tissue, beyond twelve genes responsible for  tolerance and several hydrolase genes were found. These characteristics may help in host colonization and maintenance and may account for the probiotic properties observed for strain FTC01.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Forty lactic  bacterial strains (named Sgs1-40) were isolated from the intestinal tract and eight strains (named SgmA-H) from the oesophagus-crop of snails. Several criteria were used to examine whether they may be applied as snail-specific for the screening of the presumptive probiotic bacterial strains. Principal Component Analysis using criteria such as the tolerance of these strains to the pedal mucus, gastric mucus, gastric juices and low pH, as well as the expression of the cell surface traits of hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and autoaggregation capacity revealed discrimination of twelve strains exhibiting presumptive in vitro probiotic properties. Injection of eight of these strains, which were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, in snail haemocoel increased the recruitment and phagocytic activity of amoebocytes in snail haemolymph. The Sgs14 and SgmB strains, exhibiting the highest immunostimulatory activity in haemolymph, were FITC-labelled and orally administrated to snails for ten days. The Sgs14 strain was able to adhere to intestinal mucosa of snails and stimulate the chemotactic and phagocytic activity of amoebocytes in haemolymph as well as the bactericidal activity of haemolymph serum. These responses are potentially mediated by the regulation of TLRs expression in the gut mucosa. These data indicate that the determination of properties such as snail mucus and gastric juice tolerance, cell surface traits for adhesion as well as increased chemotactic and phagocytic activity in snail haemolymph are eligible criteria to screen for snail-specific .

A new  strain (SL001) was isolated from 1000s of soil samples, which exhibited wide antimicrobial spectrum of against fish pathogens, involving , , , , , and . The challenge test against  showed that the survival rate of SL001-supplemented group was significantly higher than that of control group ( < 0.05). Moreover, SL001 could stably colonize in gut of grass carp and increased mucus-secreting goblet cells and extended intestinal villi could be observed in SL001-supplemented group ( < 0.05). Feeding with SL001 supplemented diet could significantly enhance the growth rate ( < 0.05) and markedly affect gut microbiota structure of grass carps, resulting in reduced potential pathogens and increased potential . Furthermore, feeding grass carps with SL001 caused the up-regulated expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1 and IGF-2) and down-regulated expression of myostatin (MSTN-1 and MSTN-2) ( < 0.05), which probably also account for the increased growth rate of SL001-fed group. Meanwhile, relative mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes in liver, spleen, and head kidney were analyzed in grass carps after feeding for 30 days with SL001 supplemented diets. In all three immune organs, the expression levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and complement 3 (C3) were significantly increased ( < 0.05), whereas the interleukin-8 (IL-8) was down-regulated ( < 0.05). Besides, whole genome sequencing revealed several  properties of SL001, including organic  synthesis, bacteriocin synthesis (coagulin), superoxide dismutase, and digestive enzymes. In conclusion,  SL001 which could enhance immunity and promoter growth rate of grass carps, is prospective to be used as a dietary probiotic in freshwater fish aquaculture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445119>In-vitro effect of vaginal lactobacilli against group B Streptococcus.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus agalactiae(GBS) is a leading cause of infection during pregnancy, preterm birth and neonatal infection, with a significant clinical and socio-economic impact. To prevent maternal GBS vaginal colonization, new antibiotic-free approaches, based on lactobacilli , are advisable. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-GBS activity of 14 vaginal Lactobacillus strains, belonging to different species (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis), isolated from healthy pre-menopausal women. In particular, we performed 'inhibition' experiments, evaluating the ability of both Lactobacillus cells and culture supernatants in reducing Streptococcus viability, after 60 min contact time. First, we demonstrated that the acidic milieu, produced by vaginal lactobacilli metabolism, is crucial in counteracting GBS growth in a pH-dependent manner. Experiments with organic/inorganic  solutions confirmed the strict correlation between pH levels and the anti-GBS activity. GBS was more sensitive to lactic  than to hydrochloric , indicating that the presence of H ions is necessary but not sufficient for the inhibitory activity. Moreover, experiments with Lactobacillus pH-adjusted supernatants led to exclude a direct role in the anti-GBS activity by other bioactive molecules. Second, we found that only a few Lactobacillus strains were able to reduce Streptococcus viability by means of cell pellets. The anti-GBS effect displayed by Lactobacillus cells was related to the their ability to interact and aggregate with Streptococcus cells. We found that the anti-GBS activity was retained after methanol/proteinase K treatment, but lost after lysozyme exposure of Lactobacillus cells. Therefore, we supposed that non-proteinaceous components of Lactobacillus cell wall could be responsible for the anti-GBS activity. In conclusion, we identified specific Lactobacillus strains able to interfere with GBS viability by multiple strategies and we elucidated some of the mechanisms of action. These strains could serve as probiotic formulations for the prevention of GBS vaginal colonization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the availability of RS as a prebiotic is a topic of interest and research on gut bacteria that can decompose RS is also important. The objectives in this study were 1) to isolate human gut bacterium having strong degradation activity on non-gelatinized RS, 2) to characterize its RS-degrading characteristics, and 3) to investigate its probiotic effects including a growth stimulation effect on other gut bacteria and an immunomodulatory effect.  P2P3 showing very strong RS granule utilization activity was isolated. It can attach to RS granules and form the clusters of RS granules. Also, it was able to utilize high amylose corn starch (HACS) granules up to 63.3%, and efficiently decompose other various types of commercial RS without gelatinization. In a coculture experiment,  ATCC 29148, isolated from human feces, were capable to grow using carbon sources generated from RS granules by  P2P3. In addition,  P2P3 demonstrated the ability to stimulate secretion of Th1 type cytokines from mouse macrophages  that was not shown in other .

This study thus aims to evaluate the ability to survive under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and impact of Torulaspora delbrueckii B14 and Kluyveromyces lactis B10 as single and mixed inocula for cheese production. These two yeast strains were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal tracts and tested for self-aggregation, hydrophobicity, pathogen inhibition, antibiotic resistance, and β-galactosidase production. The yeast strains were also assessed for their ability to survive in different NaCl concentrations (2.5%, 5%, and 10% w/v), multiple temperatures (4 °C and 40 °C), and used as single and mixed starter cultures for cheese production. Yeasts population levels were monitored by YPD plating and MALDI-TOF and metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS over the course of the 21 days cheese maturation process. T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 both showed >80% viability after the passage through the simulated gastrointestinal tract, had self-aggregation rates >90%, and displayed β-galactosidase activities of 0.35 U/g and 0.53 U/g, respectively. Both yeasts survived at 2.5%, 5%, and 10% NaCl for 21 days and showed growth at 4 °C. In cheese, the single inoculum of K. lactis B10 and mixed inoculum showed the highest levels of lactose consumption. HS-SPME GC-MS analysis of cheese samples allowed the identification of 38 volatile compounds. The highest concentrations of most of these compounds were observed after 21 days of maturation for the cheese produced with mixed inoculum. The most abundant  detected were hexanoic and decanoic ; the most abundant alcohols were 2,3-butanediol, 2-phenylethanol and isoamyl alcohol, and the most prevalent ester compounds were isoamyl acetate and phenethyl acetate.

Moreover, results of the safety of B. velezensis K2 showed that intraperitoneal injection of K2 in healthy grouper did not cause any pathological abnormality or death, indicating this bacteria could be considered as a candidate probiotic in aquaculture. Groupers were fed with the diets containing 1 × 10 cfu/g of B. velezensis K2 for 4 weeks. Various immune parameters were examined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of post-feeding. Results showed that diets supplemented with K2 significantly increased serum  phosphatase (ACP) activity (P < 0.05). Results of the mRNA expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney of hybrid grouper showed that the expression of lysozyme gene was significantly upregulated after 1 and 2 weeks of feeding (P < 0.05). A significant up-regulation of the expression of piscidin, IgM and MyD88 were detected at day 21, whereas the TLR3 and TLR5 showed lower expression compared to the controls during 21 days, and a significant decrease of TLR3 gene was found at day 28 (P < 0.05). After challenge with V. harveyi, the survival rate of fish administrated with the strain K2 for 28 days was signifiacantly higher than the controls without this strain (P < 0.05).

Therefore, to understand whether  could alleviate vaginosis and osteoporosis, we isolated anti-inflammatory  NK3 and  NK49 from kimchi and human fecal lactic  bacteria collection and examined their effects on  (GV)-induced vaginosis and ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in female mice. Oral gavage of NK3 and/or NK49 significantly alleviated GV-induced vaginosis; these inhibited NF-B activation and TNF- expression in the vagina and uterus, and decreased the GV population in the vagina. Furthermore, treatment with NK3 and/or NK49 alleviated ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis and obesity; these increased blood calcium, phosphorus, and osteocalcin levels and suppressed body weight. GV-induced vaginosis and ovariectomy increased colonic myeloperoxidase activity, TNF- expression, and fecal Proteobacteria population. NK3 and/or NK49 treatments reduced TNF- expression and NF-B activation in the colon. NK3 and NK49 treatment also restored GV- or ovariectomy-disrupted gut microbiota composition.

The formulation and processing techniques used to produce these probiotic formulations can influence the preservation of the microbial viability. However, it is also required that the bacteria maintain their key probiotic capacities during processing, formulation and shelf life. In this study, we investigated the impact of spray-drying on different cell wall properties of the model probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, including its adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. The dltD gene knock-out mutant, L. rhamnosus GG CMPG5540, displaying modified cell wall lipoteichoic , showed significantly increased colony-forming units after spray-drying and subsequent storage under standard conditions compared to wild-type L. rhamnosus GG. In contrast, disruption of the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides or pili expression did not impact survival. However, spray-drying did significantly affect the adherence capacity of L. rhamnosus GG.

In fact, oral administration of lipoteichoic  (LTA) from Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) prevents the development of UV-induced skin tumors in chronically exposed mice. Here we aim to evaluate whether this LTA is able to revert UV-induced immunosuppression as a mechanism involved in its anti-tumor effect and whether it has an immunotherapeutic effect against cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Using a mouse model of contact hypersensitivity, we demonstrate that LTA overcomes UV-induced skin immunosuppression. This effect was in part achieved by modulating the phenotype of lymph node resident dendritic cells (DC) and the homing of skin migratory DC. Importantly, oral LTA reduced significantly the growth of established skin tumors once UV radiation was discontinued, demonstrating that it has a therapeutic, besides the already demonstrated preventive antitumor effect. The data presented here strongly indicates that oral administration of LTA represents a promising immunotherapeutic approach for different conditions in which the skin immune system is compromised.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] is a GPCR expressed throughout both the gut and the brain and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance, metabolism, and the central modulation of food intake, motivation, reward, and mood. To date, few studies have investigated the potential of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its metabolites to modulate GPCR signaling. Here we investigate the ability of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), lactate, and different bacterial strains, including  and  genera, to modulate GHSR-1a signaling. We identify, for what is to our knowledge the first time, a potent effect of microbiota-derived metabolites on GHSR-1a signaling with potential significant consequences for host metabolism and physiology. We show that SCFAs, lactate, and bacterial supernatants are able to attenuate ghrelin-mediated signaling through the GHSR-1a. We suggest a novel route of communication between the gut microbiota and the host  modulation of GHSR-1a receptor signaling.

Biochemical factors including the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), uric  (UA), and lactoferrin, as well as β-hexosaminidase (β-HEX) activity were measured.The levels of a salivary oxidant such as MDA and NO were statistically significantly higher in periodontitis patients than to that of healthy individuals. Similarly, the results indicated elevated levels of lactoferrin and β-HEX activity in saliva of the periodontitis group, which was statistically significant when compared to the controls. While the levels of an enzymatic antioxidant such as SOD were higher in the periodontitis patients than in the control subjects, uric  levels were statistically significantly lower in the saliva of the periodontitis patients than in the healthy controls.Except for uric , as a non-enzymatic antioxidant, the levels of salivary oxidative stress generally increase in the saliva of periodontitis patients. Since altered levels of salivary biomarkers such as oxidative stress and antioxidant substances might contribute in systemic and local complications in the patients, these informative biomarkers can be used as a promising factor for the early diagnosis of the disease.Copyright©American Journal of Dentistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218652>Impairment of Cronobacter sakazakii and Listeria monocytogenes biofilms by cell-free preparations of lactobacilli of goat milk origin.</a></h2><p>Biofilm-associated bacterial infections represent one of the major threats to modern medical treatments. Bacteria encased in biofilm matrix are more resistant towards antimicrobials and thus the capability of microbes to persist and nurture in a biofilm seems to be the foremost aspect of pathogenesis and therapeutic failure. Therefore, there is a pressing demand for new drugs active against microbial biofilms. In the current study, anti-biofilm potential of Lactobacillus spp. cell-free supernatants (CFSs) against Cronobacter sakazakii and Listeria monocytogenes was characterized using crystal violet staining and MTT assay. CFSs of goat milk origin lactobacilli not only prevented biofilm formation but also disrupted preformed biofilms. Neutralized and heat-treated preparations of Lactobacillus CFSs also inhibited biofilm formation by test pathogens. The results were quantitatively confirmed by light and fluorescent microscopy observations. Biofilms developed under static conditions displayed typical compact microcolonies with uniform distribution over the surface, while upon CFS challenge, biofilms were disrupted with presence of dead cells. These findings highlight the anti-biofilm potency of Lactobacillus spp. strains of goat milk origin and their potential application in food industries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31232087>Mechanism and intervention measures of iron side effects on the intestine.</a></h2><p>Excess oral iron in the intestinal tract usually produces reactive oxygen species via Fenton and Haber-Weiss reaction, so oxidative stress is triggered. Lipid peroxidation procedurally appears, ferroptosis, apoptosis and necrosis are often induced, subsequently, mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction and even cell death occur. As a result, the intestinal epithelial cells are destroyed, leading to the incompleteness of intestinal mechanical barrier. Simultaneously, iron supplement can change the compositions and metabolic processes of intestinal microbes, and the intestinal inflammatory may be worsened. In principle, the easier dissociation of Fe from oral iron supplements is, the more serious intestinal inflammation will occur. Fortunately, some interventions have been developed to alleviate these side effects. For instance, some antioxidants e.g. VE and ferulic  have been used to prevent the formation of free radicals or to neutralize the formed free radicals. Furthermore, some new iron supplements with the ability of slow-releasing Fe, e.g. ferrous citrate liposome and EDTA iron sodium, have been successfully prepared. In order to recover the intestinal micro-ecological balance,  and prebiotics, bacterial consortium transplantation, and fecal microbiota transplantation have been developed. This study is meaningful for us to develop safer oral iron supplements and to maintain intestinal micro-ecological health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596218>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and  and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233819>Beneficial microbiota.  and pharmaceutical products in functional nutrition and medicine.</a></h2><p>The article is mainly devoted to such representatives of gut microbiota as lactic  bacteria and bifidobacteria, with minor accent on less frequently used or new probiotic microorganisms.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and  also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There are no large-scale international studies on drug use in neonatal units. Objective We aimed to describe drug use in European neonatal units and characterize its associations with geographic region and gestational age. Setting A one-day point prevalence study was performed as part of the European Study of Neonatal Exposure to Excipients from January to June 2012. Method All neonatal prescriptions and demographic data were registered in a web-based database. The impact of gestational age and region on prescription rate were analysed with logistic regression. Main outcome measure The number and variety of drugs prescribed to hospitalized neonates in different gestational age groups and geographic regions. Results In total, 21 European countries with 89 neonatal units participated. Altogether 2173 prescriptions given to 726 neonates were registered. The 10 drugs with the highest prescription rate were multivitamins, vitamin D, caffeine, gentamicin, amino  for parenteral nutrition, phytomenadione, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, fat emulsion for parenteral nutrition and . The six most commonly prescribed ATC groups (alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular system) covered 98% of prescriptions. Gestational age significantly affected the use of all commonly used drug groups. Geographic region influenced the use of alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous and respiratory system drugs. Conclusion While gestational age-dependent differences in neonatal drug use were expected, regional variations (except for systemic anti-infectives) indicate a need for cooperation in developing harmonized evidence-based guidelines and suggest priorities for collaborative work.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481604>Complex Responses to Hydrogen Peroxide and Hypochlorous  by the Probiotic Bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory diseases of the gut are associated with increased intestinal oxygen concentrations and high levels of inflammatory oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide (HO) and hypochlorous  (HOCl), which are antimicrobial compounds produced by the innate immune system.

In this study, HT-29, a human colon cancer cell line, was selected as an in vitro model to evaluate the Al-induced alteration in metabolomic profiles and explore the possible mechanisms of Al toxicity.MTT assay was performed to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Al ions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for metabolomic analysis, and its results were further confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of nine selected genes.Al inhibited the growth of the HT-29 cells, and its half-maximal dose for the inhibition of cell proliferation was found to be four mM. This dose was selected for further metabolomic analysis, which revealed that 81 metabolites, such glutathione (GSH), phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and creatine, and 17 metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic  cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and GSH metabolism, were significantly altered after Al exposure.

Moreover, females fed diet supplemented with Pantoea dispersa and Enterobacter cloacae laid more eggs but had shorter lifespan while female fed Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella oxytoca enriched diets lived longer but had lower fecundity compared to the positive control. Conversely, flies fed sugar diet (negative control) were not able to produce eggs, but lived longer than those from the positive control.These results suggest that intestinal bacteria can drive the foraging decision in a way which promotes the reproduction and survival of B. dorsalis.

This study determined the roles of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum strain JDFM LP11in gut microbiota modulation and immune response in weaned piglets. L. plantarum JDFM LP11 increased the population of lactic  bacteria in feces and enhanced the development of villi in the small intestine. Metagenome analysis showed that microbial diversity and richness (Simpson, Shannon, ACE, Chao1) and the relative abundance of the Firmicutes were higher in weaned piglets fed . Five bacterial families were different in the relative abundance, especially; Prevotellaceae occupied the largest part of microbial community showed the most difference between two groups. Transcriptome analysis identified 25 differentially expressed genes using RNA-sequencing data of the ileum.

The gut microbiota composition and metabolomics were analyzed using 16S recombinant deoxyribonucleic  pyrosequencing and ultra-performance liquid-chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.LGG administered orally induced marked increases in trabecular bone microarchitecture, cortical bone volume, and biomechanical properties in the LGG+TDF group compared with that in the TDF-only group. Moreover, LGG treatment increased intestinal barrier integrity, expanded regulatory T cells, decreased Th17 cells, and downregulated osteoclastogenesis-related cytokines in the bone marrow, spleen, and gut. Furthermore, LGG reconstructed the gut microbiota and changed the metabolite composition, especially lysophosphatidylcholine levels. However, the amount of N-acetyl-leukotriene E4 was the highest in the TDF-only group.LGG reconstructed the community structure of the gut microbiota, promoted the expression of lysophosphatidylcholines, and improved intestinal integrity to suppress the TDF-induced inflammatory response, which resulted in attenuation of TDF-induced bone loss in mice.

Modification of gut microbiota and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile  synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut microbiota, which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic  bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of  has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial barrier function, which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty  synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase B (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut microbiota, increasing short chain fatty -producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 treatment restored the structure of gut microbiota similar to the control group.

Methanogenesis, a continuous process in the rumen, carried out by archaea either with a hydrogenotrophic pathway that converts hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane or with methylotrophic pathway, which the substrate for methanogenesis is methyl groups. For accurate estimation of methane from ruminants, three methods have been successfully used in various experiments under different environmental conditions such as respiration chamber, sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique, and the automated head-chamber or GreenFeed system. Methane production and emission from ruminants are increasing day by day with an increase of ruminants which help to meet up the nutrient demands of the increasing human population throughout the world. Several mitigation strategies have been taken separately for methane abatement from ruminant productions such as animal intervention, diet selection, dietary feed additives, , defaunation, supplementation of fats, oils, organic , plant secondary metabolites, etc. However, sustainable mitigation strategies are not established yet. A cumulative approach of accurate enteric methane measurement and existing mitigation strategies with more focusing on the biological reduction of methane emission by direct-fed microbials could be the sustainable methane mitigation approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545226>Effects of berberine and metformin on intestinal inflammation and gut microbiome composition in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Berberine and metformin, both established pharmaceutical agents with herbal origins, have incidental beneficial effects on multiple diseases, including diabetes. These effects have been speculated to occur via the gut microbiome. In this study, we administered either berberine or metformin to db/db mice and investigated changes in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels. Fresh stool samples were analyzed using 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiome. Short-chain fatty  (SCFA) in the stool were quantified using gas chromatography. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and tight junction (ZO1 and occludin) proteins in the intestinal epithelium was determined using qPCR and western blotting. The intestinal barrier structure was examined using transmission electron microscopy and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using a commercial kit. Both berberine and metformin reduced food intake, body weight, and blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Both treatments effectively restored the intestinal SCFA content, reduced the level of serum LPS, relieved intestinal inflammation, and repaired intestinal barrier structure. Intervention with metformin or berberine modified the gut microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus) and reducing opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Prevotella, Proteus). An increased abundance of other  including Lactobacillus and Akkermansia was also observed. Berberine and metformin can modulate the composition of the gut microbiome and reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and intestinal inflammation in db/db mice, which demonstrates their effectiveness in the reduction of diabetic complications in this model.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we propose a promising strategy for cancer treatment using modulation of oxidative stress by suppression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a typical antioxidant enzyme. siRNA which can be applied to the development of nucleic  drugs, enabling them to eliminate unwanted side effects, increase specificity, and avoid the problem of drug resistance, was employed for GSTP-silencing at the transcriptional level. The silencing of the pi class of GST (GSTP) that displayed the most characteristic expression profile in 13 kinds of cancer cell lines has shown significant impairment in the growth of cancer cells due to oxidative stress caused by excess ROS accumulation. Comparative proteomics between normal cells and GSTP-silenced pancreatic cancer cell PANC-1 suggested that GSTP-silencing facilitated the mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings show promise for the development of strategies toward cancer therapy based on the mechanism that allows genetic silencing of GSTP to promote oxidative stress through mitochondria dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523411>The effects of supplementation of  and  spores on the intestinal microflora and growth performance in rat.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microflora has an important role in the health status. Since  can balance the intestinal microflora, they have a lot of health beneficial effects. So the appropriate selection of  can cause health-promoting effects. In this study, the combined effects of  and  on the intestinal microflora and growth performance in rats were investigated.80 male rats were divided into the treatment (receiving 5×10 spores/ml of  and 5×10 spores/ml of  for three weeks in daily water) and control (tap water without ) groups. The total aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, lactic  bacteria (LAB), coliforms and spores were weekly counted in the fecal samples. Additionally, the water and feed consumption, the weight gain and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) were calculated for each week.The  significantly increased the total aerobic, LAB and spore counts and caused significant reduction in the anaerobe and coliform counts. Following three weeks of probiotic administration, the number of anaerobic bacteria, and coliforms were reduced by up to 0.7 and 1.18 log and the number of aerobic bacteria, LAB and spores were increased by 1.29, 1.15 and 7.2 log respectively.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the immunoregulatory and antiviral activities of immunobiotics have not yet been elucidated in detail. The present study was conducted to determine whether selected lactic  bacteria (LAB) modulate toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (PolyI:C) induced viral response in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). PolyI:C increased the expression of interferon-β (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in HCT116 cells, and these up-regulations were significantly altered when cells were pre-stimulated with LAB isolated from Korean fermented foods. LAB strains were capable to up-regulate IFN-β but down-regulated IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1β mRNA levels as compared with PolyI: C. HCT-116 cell treatment with LABs beneficially modulated the mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10), 2-5A oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OSA1), myxovirus resistance protein (MxA), TLR3, and retinoic  inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and TLR negative regulators. In addition, LABs increased IFN-β, IFN-α, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β protein/mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. LABs also protected the cells by maintaining tight-junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). The beneficial effects of these LABs were mediated via modulation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. Overall, the results of this study indicate that immunobiotics have potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities that may use as antiviral substitutes for human and animal applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353583>Effect of temperature and pH on the probiotication of Punica granatum juice using Lactobacillus species.</a></h2><p>This study was focused on the effects of fermentation temperature and pH on the quality of Punica granatum juice probioticated with Lactobacillus species: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The whole fruit juice of P. granatum which is rich with phytonutrients appeared to be a good probiotic carrier. The probiotication was carried out for 24 hr at 30, 35, and 37°C and pH 2.5, 4.0, and 5.5 under microaerophilic conditions. The results found that P. granatum juice cultivated with L. casei had a better growth profile with a higher biomass density at 37°C around pH 3.5-4.0. Probiotication could maintain the scavenging activity of P. granatum juice cultivated with L. casei. The scavenging activity achieved up to 90% inhibition at the concentration of 5 mg/ml. The whole fruit-squeezed P. granatum juice was suitable for the growth of Lactobacillus species even without supplementation during cultivation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The findings of this study presented the potential of P. granatum juice (whole fruit) to be used as a good probiotic carrier, particularly for Lactobacillus species without supplementation. High nutritious P. granatum juice catered the need of probiotic bacteria during fermentation. Probiotication could maintain the antioxidant capacity of the juice in term of its radical scavenging activity. The antioxidant capacity was mainly attributed to the metabolites such as phenolic  (romarinic  and caftaric ) and flavonoids (quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, rutin and kaempferol rutinoside). With the optimized temperature (37°C) and pH (4.00), probiotic bacteria could growth well up to a cell viability of 2.46 × 10  cfu/ml. This offers P. granatum to be developed into functional food to cater to the needs of the consumers who are lactose intolerant to dairy products.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560460>The influence of the newly isolated Lactobacillus plantarum LUHS135 and Lactobacillus paracasei LUHS244 strains on blood and faeces parametersin endurance horses.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the newly isolated Lactobacillus plantarum LUHS135 and Lactobacillus paracasei LUHS244 strains grown in potato juice (with a cell count of 8.0-9.0 log10 CFU/ml) on the blood and faeces parameters of exercising horses. The horses were classified into four different groups: a control group (which received no ); the first group (which received 200 ml of L. plantarum culture in potato juice); the second group (which received 200 ml of L. paracasei culture in potato juice); and the third group (which received an L. plantarum and L. paracasei mix (with the mix consisting of 100 ml of each). Indices for the blood and faeces microflora were obtained before and after treatment of horses (on days zero and thirty). It was observed that the count for lactic  bacteria (LAB) in the faeces was significantly higher on day thirty, whereas it was lower when it came to the total enterobacteria count (TCE). Despite the ambiguous influence of any treatment on blood parameters, the L. plantarum × L. paracasei mixture increased the concentration of HGB and O2 saturation in blood samples which were taken from the horses. L. paracasei significantly decreased the lactate concentration levels in horse blood samples. As a result of the present study, it can clearly be seen that the strains being used revealed their potential application as ; however, further studies are required to prove the survival and action mechanisms of the newly isolated strains.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421399>Behavior of different Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties throughout processed cheese ("requeijão cremoso") manufacturing and storage.</a></h2><p>Even though spore-forming bacteria have been mainly linked to spoilage or foodborne pathogens vehiculated through foods, some strains of Bacillus can potentially present probiotic properties. The advantage of incorporating probiotic Bacillus strains in foods relies mainly on the fact that these microorganisms present high resistance to harsh processing conditions. "Requeijão cremoso" is a type of processed cheese highly appreciated in Brazil. During processing, this product is submitted to several harsh conditions (heating at 90 °C, for instance), leading to the inactivation of probiotic bacteria belonging to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera. That fact has precluded the development of probiotic "requeijão cremoso" products; however, probiotic Bacillus strains may comprise a promising alternative to overcome the low resistance of traditional  to food processing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of different Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties throughout processed cheese ("requeijão cremoso") manufacturing. A total of five different Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties (B. coagulans MTCC 5856, B. coagulans GBI-30 6086, B. subtilis PXN 21, B. subtilis PB6, and B. flexus HK1) were individually inoculated at different stages of manufacture - curd pasteurization, coagulation, and fusion - of "requeijão cremoso" and their survival in each of these stages was determined. The survival of B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 was further assessed throughout "requeijão cremoso" production and shelf life (45 days at 6 °C). Besides, the chemical composition, level of proteolysis, and fatty  profile of the treatments during shelf life were evaluated. The fusion stage was found as the most appropriate for the addition of B. coagulans GBI-30 6086, which allows the production of probiotic "requeijão cremoso" and facilitates the technological process while preventing the occurrence of final product recontamination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of them are under the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. The aim of the present study was to isolate and identify Bifidobacterium and to evaluate the effects of their 24 h and 120 h cell-free supernatants (CFS) from both cultures on colon cancer cell line.In the present study, 84 samples of dairy products, infant feces, and probiotic capsule were collected, and Bifidobacterium was isolated. Gram stain, biochemical tests, and molecular identification were done for the isolation and identification of Bifidobacterium. Cytotoxicity effects of CFS derived from both cultures of isolated Bifidobacterium were assessed on colon cancer cell lines.In the present study, 17 isolates of Bifidobacterium were identified. The results show that Bifidobacterium was most frequently associated with infant feces and dairy products, whereas the lowest rate was associated with local milk. After the effects of CFS on colon cancer cell line, two isolates were identified from infant feces and probiotic capsule; they had the highest ability in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. Bifidobacterium bifidum was effective in combating cancer cells and was associated with a substantial improvement in gastrointestinal cancer.The study has shown that the regular ingested  could prevent the development of colorectal cancer.

To add further clinical relevance, related studies investigating the efficacy of several HMT agents in periodontitis will be discussed.Literature searches were conducted from articles published in PubMed using keywords "periodontal disease AND periodontitis AND host modulation therapy AND anti-inflammatory AND antioxidant", and then the findings were comprehensively summarized and elaborated.Accumulating evidence indicates that periodontitis is no longer defined solely as a pathogen-induced disease; rather, it is now recognized as a consequence of uncontrolled immune response and oxidative stress leading to periodontal tissue damage. Although periodontopathic bacteria initiate the disease, inflammation and oxidative stress were reported to be the main causes for the severity of tissue destruction. Thus, since the concept of periodontitis has shifted, our approach to its management needs to be adjusted to accommodate the latest paradigm. Nowadays, the modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress is considered a target of HMT. HMT agents, such as , anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-chemokines, lipid mediators, and bio-active fatty , have been extensively investigated for their remarkable functions in modulating the immune response and providing antioxidant effects.Findings from in vitro, in vivo, and human studies frequently demonstrate positive association by the administration of HMT in periodontitis. HMT strategy targeted on anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in periodontitis might serve as an excellent therapeutic approach to reach the level of clinical benefit.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Inspired by the natural physiological process of spores, herein, an oral autonomous NPs generator is developed to overcome the spatially variable gastrointestinal tract environment and multibiological barriers. Spores modified with deoxycholic  (DA) and loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin and sorafenib, DOX/SOR) serve as an autonomous production line of NPs, which can efficaciously protect the drugs passing through the rugged environment of the stomach and furthermore can be transported to the intestinal environment and colonized rapidly. Subsequently, the DOX/SOR/Spore-DA NPs are produced by the autonomous NPs generator in the intestinal regions based on the disintegrated hydrophobic protein and the hydrophilic DA, and they can efficiently penetrate the epithelial cells via the bile  pathway, increasing basolateral drug release. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm that this biological nanogenerator can autonomously produce substantial NPs in the intestine, providing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This review presents possible mechanisms by which metabolic disorders increase blood pressure (BP) and discusses the importance of the gut as a novel modulator of BP.Obesity and high salt intake are major risk factors for hypertension. There is a hypothesis of "salt-induced obesity"; i.e., high salt intake may tie to obesity. Heightened sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, especially in the kidney and brain, increases BP in obese patients. Adipokines, including adiponectin and leptin, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to hypertension. Adiponectin induced by a high-salt diet may decrease sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 expression in the kidney, which results in reducing BP. High salt can change secretions of adipokines and RAAS-related components. Evidence has been accumulating linking the gastrointestinal tract to BP. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and ghrelin decrease BP in both rodents and humans. The sweet taste receptor in enteroendocrine cells increases SGLT1 expression and stimulates sodium/glucose absorption. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass improves glycemic and BP control due to reducing the activity of SGLT1. Na/H exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) increases BP by stimulating the intestinal absorption of sodium. Gastrin functions as an intestinal sodium taste sensor and inhibits NHE3 activity. Intestinal mineralocorticoid receptors also regulate sodium absorption and BP due to changing ENaC activity. Gastric sensing of sodium induces natriuresis, and gastric distension increases BP. Changes in the composition and function of gut microbiota contribute to hypertension. A high-salt/fat diet may disrupt the gut barrier, which results in systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased BP. Gut microbiota regulates BP by secreting vasoactive hormones and short-chain fatty . BP-lowering effects of  and antibiotics have been reported. Bariatric surgery improves metabolic disorders and hypertension due to increasing GLP-1 secretion, decreasing leptin secretion and SNS activity, and changing gut microbiome composition. Strategies targeting the gastrointestinal system may be therapeutic options for improving metabolic abnormalities and reducing BP in humans. SNS, brain, adipocytes, RAAS, the kidney, the gastrointestinal tract, and microbiota play important roles in regulating BP. Most notably, the gut could be a novel target for treatment of hypertension as a metabolic disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650040>Extract of  strain 06CC2 induces JNK/p38 MAPK pathway-mediated apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress in Caco2 colorectal cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is a multi-factorial disease involving genetic, environmental and lifestyle risk factors. In recent years, many changes in the bacterial composition of the intestinal microflora have been reported in colorectal cancer, suggesting the involvement of the intestinal microflora in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Along with these reports, research on lactic  bacteria that have a beneficial effect on the human body for the purpose of improving the intestinal environment and treating intestinal diseases has advanced. Among these studies, biogenics (defined as a component derived from lactic  bacteria that acts directly on diseases regardless of the state of intestinal microflora) is a recent concept derived from the work on .

Recent years have shown increased interest in using lactobacilli for delivery of vaccines, mainly due to their ability to skew the immune system towards pro-inflammatory responses. We have compared the potential of eight Lactobacillus species, L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. curvatus, L. rhamnosus, L. sakei, L. gasseri, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri, as immunogenic carriers of the Ag85B-ESAT-6 antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Surface-display of the antigen was achieved in L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. gasseri and L. reuteri and these strains were further analyzed in terms of their in vitro and in vivo immunogenicity. All strains activated human dendritic cells in vitro. Immunization of mice using a homologous prime-boost regimen comprising a primary subcutaneous immunization followed by three intranasal boosters, led to slightly elevated IgG levels in serum in most strains, and, importantly, to significantly increased levels of antigen-specific mucosal IgA. Cellular immunity was assessed by studying antigen-specific T cell responses in splenocytes, which did not reveal proliferation as assessed by the expression of Ki67, but which showed clear antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-17 responses for some of the groups.

Mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs include: (1) Reduction of triglyceride levels; (2) anti-arrhythmic and antithrombotic effects, and (3) resolution of inflammatory processes. The human microbiota project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have highlighted that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human gut, and that there has been a significant variability of taxa in the microbiota composition among people. Several factors (gestational age, mode of delivery, diet, sanitation and antibiotic treatment) influence the bacterial community in the human gastrointestinal tract, and among these diet habits play a crucial role. The disturbances in the gut microbiota composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, have been associated with diseases ranging from localized gastrointestinal disorders to neurologic, respiratory, metabolic, ocular, and cardiovascular illnesses. Many studies have been published about the effects of  and prebiotics on the gut microbiota/microbioma. On the contrary, PUFAs in the gut microbiota have been less well defined. However, experimental studies suggested that gut microbiota, n-3 PUFAs, and host immune cells work together to ensure the intestinal wall integrity. This review discussed current evidence concerning the links among gut microbiota, n-3 PUFAs intake, and human inflammatory disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353590>Enhanced biotransformation of soybean isoflavone from glycosides to aglycones using solid-state fermentation of soybean with effective microorganisms (EM) strains.</a></h2><p>To improve the biotransformation efficacy (BE) of glycosides to aglycones in total soybean isoflavone (SIF), Taguchi experimental design has been used to study the most significant factors on BE of glycosides to aglycones using solid-state fermentation (SSF) of soybean with effective microorganisms (EM) strains. Physicochemical properties of optimized fermented dregs have also been analyzed to evaluate their  count and mainly nutritional parameters. The results showed that identified optimal fermentation conditions are 30°C, 40% water content, 5% inoculation level, 6 d culture time, and 20 mesh number. BE of aglycones reached 85.30% with dry matter recoveries of 96.34% based on optimal fermentation conditions. Total bacterial and lactic  bacteria count reached 17.98 and 9.34 × 10 CFU/g with decreasing pH (4.21) and an increasing acidity (8.62 g/kg), respectively. This study could provide the theoretical grounds for aglycones biotransformation in large-scale production applied in food and other fields. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Isoflavones widely present in soy products possessing strong antioxidant capacity and estrogen-like activity. In human intestines, aglycone isoflavones after treatment/fermented are absorbed faster than their glucosides in untreated soybeans. The majority of glucoside isoflavones in soybean during fermentation were biologically converted to bioactive aglycone isoflavones via EM strains-fermented β-glucosidase. SSF of soybean with EM cocultures to ferment soymilk efficiently increased BE of glycosides to aglycones. Hence, EM cocultures as a new functional ingredient could improve the nutritional value of fermented soybean.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305265>The gut-bone axis: how bacterial metabolites bridge the distance.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome is a key regulator of bone health that affects postnatal skeletal development and skeletal involution. Alterations in microbiota composition and host responses to the microbiota contribute to pathological bone loss, while changes in microbiota composition that prevent, or reverse, bone loss may be achieved by nutritional supplements with prebiotics and . One mechanism whereby microbes influence organs of the body is through the production of metabolites that diffuse from the gut into the systemic circulation. Recently, short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), which are generated by fermentation of complex carbohydrates, have emerged as key regulatory metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. This Review will focus on the effects of SCFAs on the musculoskeletal system and discuss the mechanisms whereby SCFAs regulate bone cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297101>Combining Modules for Versatile and Optimal Labeling of Lactic  Bacteria: Two pMV158-Family Promiscuous Replicons, a Pneumococcal System for Constitutive or Inducible Gene Expression, and Two Fluorescent Proteins.</a></h2><p>Labeling of bacterial cells with fluorescent proteins allows tracking the bacteria in competition and interactomic  and  studies. During the last years, a few plasmid vectors have been developed aimed at the fluorescent labeling of specific members of the lactic  bacteria (LAB), a heterogeneous group that includes microorganisms used in the food industry, as , or as live vectors for mucosal vaccines. Successful and versatile labeling of a broad range of LAB not only requires a vector containing a promiscuous replicon and a widely recognized expression system for the constitutive or regulated expression of the fluorescence determinant, but also the knowledge of the main features of the entire plasmid/host/fluorescent protein ensemble. By using the LAB model species , we have compared the utility properties of a set of labeling vectors constructed by combining a promiscuous replicon (pMV158 or pSH71) of the pMV158 plasmid family with the gene encoding either the EGFP or the mCherry fluorescent protein placed under control of promoter P or P from the pneumococcal  gene cluster for maltosaccharide uptake and utilization, respectively. Some vectors carrying P also harbor the  gene, whose product represses transcription from this promoter, thus enabling maltose-inducible synthesis of the fluorescent proteins. We have determined the plasmid copy number (PCN) and segregational stability of the different constructs, as well as the effect of these features on the fitness and fluorescence intensity of the lactococcal host. Constructs based on the pSH71 replicon had a high copy number (∼115) and were segregationally stable. The copy number of vectors based on the pMV158 replicon was lower (∼8-45) and varied substantially depending on the genetic context of the plasmid and on the bacterial growth conditions; as a consequence, inheritance of these vectors was less stable. Synthesis of the fluorescent proteins encoded by these plasmids did not significantly decrease the host fitness. By employing inducible expression vectors, the fluorescent proteins were shown to be very stable in this bacterium. Importantly, conditions for accurate quantification of the emitted fluorescence were established based on the maturation times of the fluorescent proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494690>Latin American consensus on uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection-2018.</a></h2><p>An estimated 20-30% of adult women who experience an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) will have recurrent infection. In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade B recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose;  (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic  (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient. Though considered effective and receiving grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401674>Protective effect of the "food-microorganism-SCFAs" axis on colorectal cancer: from basic research to practical application.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that the short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiota play a positive role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).This study aims to elucidate the "food-microorganism-SCFAs" axis and to provide guidance for prevention and intervention in CRC.The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched from their inceptions to August 2018, and 75 articles and 25 conference abstracts were included and analysed after identification and screening.The concentrations of SCFAs in CRC patients and individuals with a high risk of CRC were higher than those in healthy individuals. The protective mechanism of SCFAs against CRC has been described in three aspects: epigenetics, immunology and molecular signalling pathways. Many food and plant extracts that were fermented by microorganisms produced SCFAs that play positive roles with preventive and therapeutic effects on CRC. The "food-microorganism-SCFAs" axis was constructed by summarizing the pertinent literature.This study provides insight into the basic research and practical application of SCFAs by assessing the protective effect of SCFAs on CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640120>Comprehensive Understanding of the Bacterial Populations and Metabolites Profile of Fermented Feed by 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The comprehensive bacterial populations and metabolites profile in fermented feed is unclear, which may have significant effects on the stability of fermented feed quality and animal gut health. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to explore the bacterial populations and metabolites profile in the fermented feed incubated with  (MF) or without  (SF). The  were a combination of ,  and . The pH and lactic  levels were higher in MF than in SF ( 0.05), while the total volatile fatty  content was lower ( 0.05).

To test this hypothesis, newborn piglets (16 piglets/group) were treated with either S. cerevisiae yeast (5 x 109 cfu/pig: Low) or (2.5 x 1010 cfu/piglet: High) or equivalent volume of sterile water (Control) by oral gavage every other day starting from day 1 of age until weaning (28±1 days of age). Piglet body weight was recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24 and 28 and average daily gain (ADG) calculated for the total period. At weaning, piglets were euthanized to collect cecum content for microbial profiling by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. ADG was higher in both Low and High yeast groups than in Control group (P<0.05). Alpha diversity analyses indicated a more diverse microbiota in the Control group compared with Low yeast group; the High yeast being intermediate (P < 0.01). Similarly, Beta diversity analyses indicated differences among treatments (P = 0.03), mainly between Low yeast and Control groups (P = 0.02). The sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) indicated that Control group was discriminated by a higher abundance of Veillonella, Dorea, Oscillospira and Clostridium; Low yeast treated pigs by higher Blautia, Collinsella and Eubacterium; and High yeast treated pigs by higher Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, Parabacteroides, Mogibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis showed that piglet ADG was positively correlated with genus Prevotella in High yeast group. Yeast supplementation significantly affected microbial diversity in cecal contents of suckling piglets associated with an improvement of short chain fatty  producing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, yeast treatment improved piglet performance and shaped the piglet cecum microbiota composition in a dose dependent way.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409765>A protective mechanism of probiotic Lactobacillus against hepatic steatosis via reducing host intestinal fatty  absorption.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome has been known to contribute up to ~30% of the energy absorption of the host. Although various beneficial mechanisms of  have been suggested for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), whether and which  impact the host's intestinal energy absorption have not yet been quantitatively studied. Here, we suggest a novel mechanism of  against NAFLD, in which Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, the most common probiotic, shares intestinal fatty  and prevents the development of diet-induced hepatic steatosis. By using quantitative methods (radioactive tracers and LC-MS) under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, we found that bacteria and hosts competed for fatty  absorption in the intestine, resulting in decreased weight gain, body fat mass, and hepatic lipid accumulation without differences in calorie intake and excretion in mice fed the probiotic bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380326> DSM 17938  May Increase CC-Chemokine Receptor 7 Expression in Infants Treated With for Colic.</a></h2><p> Studies have shown that ri  can affect cells that play a key role in the immune system. This  Italian study investigated how  DSM 17938 influenced CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in breastfed colicky infants.  Our University hospital in Turin recruited 50 healthy outpatients, at a median age of approximately 1 month, from September 2017 to August 2018. They were randomized to daily  DSM17938 (1 × 10 cfu) or a placebo for 28 days from recruitment. We collected peripheral blood and evaluated the expression of CCR7 messenger ribonucleic  using the real-time TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method at baseline and after the study period.  We found increased expression of CC-chemokine receptor 7 in infants treated with the probiotic, but not the controls ( < 0.0026). No differences were observed for interleukin 10 after the study period in either group. At baseline, daily crying time was comparable in the probiotic and control groups: 341 (25) vs. 337 (29) min., respectively ( = 0.450). After 28 days, daily mean crying time decrease statistically in the probiotic group: 78 (23) vs. 232 (31), respectively ( < 0.001).  The increase in CC-chemokine receptor 7 might have been a response to probiotic treatment. As a relatively small sample was used to conduct this study, our research needs to be replicated in different settings, and over time, to produce comparable findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363877>Rumen fermentation and microbial community composition influenced by live Enterococcus faecium supplementation.</a></h2><p>Supplementation of appropriate  can improve the health and productivity of ruminants while mitigating environmental methane production. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the effects of Enterococcus faecium SROD on in vitro rumen fermentation, methane concentration, and microbial population structure. Ruminal samples were collected from ruminally cannulated Holstein-Friesian cattle, and 40:60 rice straw to concentrate ratio was used as substrate. Fresh culture of E. faecium SROD at different inclusion rates (0, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%) were investigated using in vitro rumen fermentation system. Addition of E. faecium SROD had a significant effect on total gas production with the greatest effect observed with 0.1% supplementation; however, there was no significant influence on pH. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest propionate (P = 0.005) but the lowest methane concentration (P = 0.001). In addition, acetate, butyrate, and total VFA concentrations in treatments were comparatively higher than control. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the predominance of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota. At the genus level, Prevotella (15-17%) and Methanobrevibacter (96%) dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities of the in vitro rumen fermenta, respectively. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest quantities of total bacteria and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, whereas 1.0% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest contents of total fungi and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Overall, supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD significantly increased the propionate and total volatile fatty  concentrations but decreased the methane concentration while changing the microbial community abundance and composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615096>Potential Mechanisms of  Action in the Prevention and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and most diagnosed cancers in the world.

The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of , in particular the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. ' potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal microbiota, improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal inflammation, and the production of harmful enzymes. The prevention of colorectal cancer is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal microbiota, as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine.

It is generated from linoleic  (LA) catalyzed by linoleate hydratase in lactobacilli, which was initially named as myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA). In lactobacilli, 10-HOE is the first intermediate in the production of conjugated LA (CLA). Although MCRA from bifidobacteria can generate 10-HOE, the precise role of 10-HOE in CLA production in bifidobacteria remains unknown. In the current work, 10-HOE and LA were added to the medium as the substrate both separately and synchronously to analyze their influence on CLA production. Using 10-HOE as the substrate, bifidobacteria were able to generate CLA by first converting it to LA, followed by CLA accumulation. Recombinant MCRA catalyzed the conversion of 10-HOE to LA, indicating that bifidobacterial MCRA can account for the reversible conversion between LA and 10-HOE. This is the first report to demonstrate the precise role of 10-HOE in the process of CLA production among bifidobacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440213>Accurate and Strict Identification of Probiotic Species Based on Coverage of Whole-Metagenome Shotgun Sequencing Data.</a></h2><p>Identifying the microbes present in probiotic products is an important issue in product quality control and public health. The most common methods used to identify genera containing species that produce lactic  are matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. However, the high cost of operation, difficulty in distinguishing between similar species, and limitations of the current sequencing technologies have made it difficult to obtain accurate results using these tools. To overcome these problems, a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach has been developed along with various metagenomic classification tools. Widely used tools include the marker gene and -mer methods, but their inevitable false-positives (FPs) hampered an accurate analysis. We therefore, designed a coverage-based pipeline to reduce the FP problem and to achieve a more reliable identification of species. The coverage-based pipeline described here not only shows higher accuracy for the detection of species and proportion analysis, based on mapping depth, but can be applied regardless of the sequencing platform. We believe that the coverage-based pipeline described in this study can provide appropriate support for probiotic quality control, addressing current labeling issues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187395>Application of  in Folate Bio-Fortification of Yoghurt.</a></h2><p>Folate deficiency is a public health concern affecting all age groups worldwide.

This excessive bacterial biomass, in turn, disrupts host physiology in a myriad of ways, leading to gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms and complications. SIBO is a common cause of non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms in children, such as chronic abdominal pain, abdominal distention, diarrhoea, and flatulence, amongst others. In addition, it has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of stunting, a disease that affects millions of children worldwide. Risk factors such as -suppressive therapies, alterations in gastrointestinal motility and anatomy, as well as impoverished conditions, have been shown to predispose children to SIBO. SIBO can be diagnosed via culture-dependant or culture-independent approaches. SIBO's epidemiology is limited due to the lack of uniformity and consensus of its diagnostic criteria, as well as the paucity of literature available. Antibiotics remain the first-line treatment option for SIBO, although emerging modalities such as  and diet manipulation could also have a role.

We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut microbiota of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiota can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut microbiota is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. Microbiota diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the microbiota profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino  fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut microbiota. Although the microbiota was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of  that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611620>Isolation, characterization and identification of antigenotoxic and anticancerous indigenous  and their prophylactic potential in experimental colon carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer, the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, is a lifestyle disease where diet and gut microbiome contribute intricately in its initiation and progression.

Here, the morphology, zeta potential, hydrophobicity, average cell mass, and growth characteristics of nine different species of  and one of  are characterized. The electrospinning of polymer solutions containing ~10 log colony forming units (CFU)/mL lactic  bacteria enabled the successful incorporation of all bacterial species tested, from the smallest (0.74 µm; ) to the largest (10.82 µm;  ssp. ), into poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers with an average diameter of ~100 nm. All of these lactobacilli were viable after incorporation into nanofibers, with 0 to 3 log CFU/mg loss in viability, depending on the species. Viability correlated with the hydrophobicity and extreme length of lactic  bacteria, whereas a horizonal or vertical electrospinning set-up did not have any role. Therefore, electrospinning represents a promising method for the incorporation of lactic  bacteria into solid delivery systems, while drying the bacterial dispersion at the same time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671881>Shift of Aromatic Profile in Probiotic Hemp Drink Formulations: A Metabolomic Approach.</a></h2><p>Vegetal drinks as a substitute for milk consumption are raising striking interest in the food industry.

At the same time, the combination of CE and FAE-producing lactic  bacteria synergistically improved the fermentation quality of the silage.The addition of the FAE-producing strain of L. plantarum A1 to alfalfa silage improved its fermentation quality, and reduced the fibre content of the silage.The screened homo-fermentative and FAE-producing strain of L. plantarum A1 could be a candidate strain in improving fermentation quality and fibre digestibility of ensiled forages.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p></html>
