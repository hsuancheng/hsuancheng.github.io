Mitochondrial heat shock proteins (mtHsps), especially Hsp60 and its cofactor Hsp10, are engaged in apoptosis regulation; however, until now, the influence of poxviruses on mtHsps has never been studied. We used highly infectious Moscow strain of ectromelia virus (ECTV) to investigate the mitochondrial heat shock response and apoptotic potential in permissive L929 fibroblasts. Our results show that ECTV-infected cells exhibit mostly mitochondrial localization of Hsp60 and Hsp10, and show overexpression of both proteins during later stages of infection. ECTV infection has only moderate effect on the electron transport chain subunit expression. Moreover, increase of mtHsp amounts is accompanied by lack of apoptosis, and confirmed by reduced level of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and elevated levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Taken together, we show a positive relationship between increased levels of Hsp60 and Hsp10 and decreased apoptotic potential of L929 fibroblasts, and further hypothesize that Hsp60 and/or its cofactor play important roles in maintaining protein homeostasis in  for promotion of cell survival allowing efficient replication of ECTV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311035>Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cell Death Is Associated With NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by All-trans Retinal.</a></h2><p>Visual (retinoid) cycle anomalies induce aberrant build-up of all-trans retinal (atRAL) in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is a cause of RPE atrophy in Stargardt disease type 1 and age-related macular degeneration. NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation is implicated in the etiology of age-related macular degeneration. Here, we elucidated the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and atRAL-induced death of RPE cells.Cellular toxicities were assessed by MTS or MTT assays. Expression levels of mRNAs and proteins were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fluorescence microscopy was used to examine intracellular signals. Ultrastructural features of organelles were examined by transmission electron microscope.Abnormal accumulation of atRAL was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of human ARPE-19 cells exhibiting features of apoptosis and Caspase-3/gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis. These cells also exhibited elevated expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1/poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)/Caspase-3/GSDME, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-18, as well as NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes (IL1B and IL18). After exposure of human ARPE-19 cells to excess atRAL, reactive oxygen species (ROS) (including mitochondrial ROS) and cathepsins released from lysosomes transmitted signals leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Suppressing the production of ROS, NLRP3 inflammasome, Caspase-1, cathepsin , or cathepsin D protected ARPE-19 cells against atRAL-associated cytotoxicity. Damage to , lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum in atRAL-exposed ARPE-19 cells was partially alleviated by treatment with MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor.Aberrant build-up of atRAL promotes the death of RPE cells via NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583724>iTRAQ-based mitochondrial proteome analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying postharvest senescence of Zizania latifolia.</a></h2><p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying postharvest senescence of Zizania latifolia, the changes in the mitochondrial proteome of plants treated with or without (control) 1-methyleyelopropene and ethylene during storage at room temperature for 0, 3 and 6 days were investigated using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling combined with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1,390 proteins with two or more peptides were identified, of which 211 showed a significant (p < .05) change (at least twofold) in relative abundance. Monitoring the parallel reaction validated the reliability and accuracy of the iTRAQ results. Bioinformatics and functional analysis of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) revealed that postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia could be attributed to (a) strengthened pentose phosphate pathway, () imbalanced protein, amino acid, organic acid, and fatty acid metabolism, (c) disordered energy homeostasis, (d) exacerbated oxidative damage, (e) RNA degradation, (f) activation of the Ca , mitogen-activated protein kinase, and jasmonic acid signaling pathways, (g) programed cell death, (h) excessive biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, or (i) degradation of cell structure. Our findings provide integrated insight into the molecular mechanisms of postharvest senescence during storage as well as the DEPs that show promise as targets for controlling senescence-induced quality deterioration of Z. latifolia. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Postharvest senescence is the most important factor that causes fast quality deterioration of Zizania latifolia. The understanding of the processes leading to postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia is essential in enhancing the commercial value and extending the shelf life of the product. It is currently believed that the mitochondrial metabolism is closely related to postharvest senescence. For this, the changes of proteome in Z. latifolia  treated with or without (control) 1-MCP and ETH during storage at room temperature were investigated. Results showed that a variety of physiobiochemical responses occur during postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia. 1-MCP treatment significantly inhibited the changes of these physiobiochemical processes, finally, retarding the postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia. ETH treatment had opposite effects on proteome changes compared with 1-MCP treatment. Taken together, these results enrich the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213811>Internalization and effects on cellular ultrastructure of nickel nanoparticles in rat kidneys.</a></h2><p> Since nanoparticles (NPs) are beginning to be introduced in medicine and industry, it is mendatory to evaluate their biological side-effects, among other things. The present study aimed to investigate the pathways by which nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) enter nephrons and to evaluate their localization and effects on cellular ultrastructure.  Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 20 nm NiNPs (20 mg/Kg/.w./day) for 28 consecutive days. Transmission electron microscope technique was used to detect localization of NiNPs and their effects on cellular ultrastructure in rat kidneys. Additionally, measurements of certain biochemical parameters such as creatinine, urea, uric acid and phosphorus for investigating renal function following NiNPs treatment were taken.  The presence of NiNPs in the nephrons in treated rats was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. NiNPs entered the renal tubules cells via various pathways. The results indicated that NiNPs administration induced ultrastructural changes in the proximal cells of renal tubules and certain glomerular cells (podocytes and mesangial cells). Additionally, NiNPs were found to be localized in the , which led to a significant decrease in their density and morphology. Furthermore, cell death was induced in the glomerular cells as found with a Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and through detection of p35 using immunohistochemical staining.  Herein, NiNPs were found to induce various cellular ultrastructural changes in the kidneys of rats. NiNPs used diverse pathways to internalize into the cytoplasm of the proximal convoluted tubules (PT) cells across the basement membrane, and also through the plasma membrane of two adjacent PT cells. NiNPs internalization, accumulation and their alterations of the cellular ultrastructure affected rat renal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31226464>Pyrroloquinoline quinine ameliorates doxorubicin-induced autophagy-dependent apoptosis via lysosomal-mitochondrial axis in vascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>The cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) limits its clinical use in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors and malignant hematologic disease. However, the mechanism by which it causes cardiotoxicity is not fully understood. Apoptosis has been regarded as one of mechanisms underlying the cardiotoxic effects of DOX. In our study, we found that treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with DOX induced autophagy and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with DOX induced autophagy at earlier time (3 h), then lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) altered after treatment for 12 h which followed by the release of cathepsin D (CTSD). Lysosome-associated membrane proteins-1 and -2 (LAMP1 and LAMP2) were decreased in DOX-treated cells. Additionally, DOX induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reduction of translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane-20 (TOM-20), and release of cytochrome c. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA relieved DOX-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and TUNEL assay. CTSD inhibitor, pepstatin A, upregulated TOM-20 and suppressed the  release of cytochrome c as well as apoptosis under DOX stress. Pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ), a new  vitamin, ameliorated aforementioned phenomenon. In conclusion, our results suggested that DOX-induced apoptosis was autophagy-dependent via lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ had an ability to protect cell from autophagy-dependent apoptosis induced by DOX via lysosomal-mitochondrial axis to some extent. This study provided new mechanistic insight toward understanding the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the protection effect of PQQ.Copyright © 2019.

As a toxicant, long-term exposure to Ni can cause rhinitis, pneumonia and other respiratory inflammation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of particles extracted from Ni-refining fumes on cell viability, inflammation-related proteins and mitochondrial damage in human lung epithelial Beas-2B cells. The cells were exposed to Ni-refining fume particles for 24 h at concentrations of 0, 6.25, 12.50 and 25.00 μg/mL. The expression levels of the NACHT-LRR-PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase-1, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ), interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α protein in Beas-2B cells exposed to Ni-refining fume particles increased significantly. Downregulation of NLRP3 expression by siRNA decreased the content of IL-1β. During activation of NLRP3, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decreased, the opening rate of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) increased, and the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intervention as the positive control group, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, an effective ROS remover) acted as an inhibitor. After NAC reduced the level of ROS, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly inhibited. Ni-refining fumes caused significant cytotoxicity, inflammation and mitochondrial damage in Beas-2B cells. The present study thus provides experimental support for the hypothesis that Ni-refining fumes cause inflammation by inducing ROS production in Beas-2B cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Astrocytes respond to microglia-derived cytokines such as interleukin-1α (IL-1α) with enhanced inflammatory signaling. This provokes pro-inflammatory gene expression of, among others, the eicosanoid-generating enzyme prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2). Whereas metabolic regulation of innate immune cell inflammatory responses is intensely studied, pathways related to how metabolism modulates inflammatory signaling in astrocytes are underexplored. Here, we examined how mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation affects inflammatory responses towards IL-1α and tumor necrosis factor α in neonatal rat astrocytes. Blocking respiratory complex I and III or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase did not affect activation of inflammatory signaling by IL-1α, but did elicit differential effects on inflammatory gene mRNA expression. Remarkably, mRNA and protein expression of Ptgs2 by IL-1α was consistently up-regulated when oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited. The increase of Ptgs2 resulted from mRNA stabilization. Mitochondrial inhibitors also increased IL-1α-triggered secretion of eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E, prostaglandin F, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F, as assessed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mechanistically, attenuating oxidative phosphorylation elevated adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK silencing prevented Ptgs2 up-regulation by mitochondrial inhibitors, while AMPK activators recapitulated Ptgs2 mRNA stability regulation. Our data indicate modulation of astrocyte inflammatory responses by oxidative metabolism, with relevance towards eicosanoid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31230428>A Kidnapping Story: How Coxsackievirus B3 and Its Host Cell Interact.</a></h2><p>Infections with Coxsackievirus B3 and other members of the enterovirus genus are a common reason for myocarditis and sudden cardiac death in modern society. Despite intensive scientific efforts to cure enterovirus infections, there is still no standardized treatment option. The complexity of Coxsackievirus B3´s effects on the host cell make well defined studies on this topic very challenging. However, recent publications report newly found effects of CVB3´s structural and non-structural proteins on infected cells. For the first time, the viral capsid protein VP1 was shown to have direct influence on the viral life-cycle. By shortening the G0 and the G2 phase and simultaneously prolonging the G1 and G1-S phase, the translation of viral proteins is enhanced and the production of viable CVB3 particles is promoted. Coxsackievirus B3´s viroporin, protein 2B, was recently studied in more detail as well. Structural and physiological analyses identified two hydrophilic α-helices in the structure of 2B, enabling it to insert into cellular membranes of host cells. As main target of 2B the endoplasmatic reticulum was identified. The insertion of 2B into the ER membranes leads to an uncontrolled calcium outflow into the cytoplasm. Additional insertion of 2B into the cell membrane leads to host cell destabilization and in the end to release of viral progeny. The importance of the Coxsackievirus B3´s proteases 2A and 3C in pathogenicity is observed since years. Recently, DAP5 and eIf4G were identified as new cleavage targets for protease 2A. Cleavage of DAP-5 into DAP5-N and DAP5-C changes the gene expression of the host cell and promotes cell death. Additionally, protease 3C targets and cleaves procaspase 8 promoting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and cell death. Recent studies identified significant effects of CVB3 on  of infected cells. Mouse cardiomyocytes showed decreased activities of respiratory chain complexes I-III and changed transcription of important subunits of the complexes I-IV. A disrupted energy metabolism may be one of the main causes of cardiac insufficiency and death in CVB3 infected patients. In addition to a modified energy metabolism, CVB3 affects cardiac ion channels, KCNQ1 in particular. SGK1, which is an important mediator in KCNQ1 membrane insertions, is highly upregulated during CVB3 infections. This results in an increased insertion of KCNQ1 into the cell membrane of cardiac cells. Under stress conditions, this KCNQ1 overshoot may lead to a disturbed cardiac action potential and therefore to sudden cardiac death, as it is often observed in CVB3 infected persons.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Clinical reports have confirmed that  L. can induce significant hepatotoxicity. In this study, we showed that DB can induce -dependent apoptosis and investigated the role of autophagy in DB-induced hepatotoxicity in L-02 hepatocytes.  L-02 hepatocytes were treated with different concentrations of DB for 48 h, after which indicators of autophagy and apoptosis were measured. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and rapamycin (Rapa) were used as inhibitor and agonist of autophagy, respectively. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) was used in combination with DB to evaluate the relationship between ROS and autophagy.  L-02 cell viability was significantly decreased after treatment with DB for 48 h. Additionally, DB induced concentration-dependent apoptosis and autophagy and increased the activities of caspase-3, caspase-9, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST), and induced excessive leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA increased DB-induced apoptosis, resulting in aggravation of hepatotoxicity. Conversely, treatment with Rapa increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Moreover, we found that DB treatment increased the level of intracellular ROS, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and caused abnormal opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which were finally restored by the ROS scavenger NAC.  Accumulation of ROS can induce -dependent apoptosis and likely to play a key role in DB-induced hepatocellular injury. Activation of autophagy may inhibit apoptosis, but also reduces antioxidant capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663720>Rational design of a rigid fluorophore-molecular rotor-based probe for high signal-to-background ratio detection of sulfur dioxide in viscous system.</a></h2><p>Many viscous microenvironments exist in living systems. For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.5-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in  and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/ ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376681>Neuroprotective role of naringenin against methylmercury induced cognitive impairment and mitochondrial damage in a mouse model.</a></h2><p>Human exposure to organomercurials like methylmercury (MeHg) may occur by consumption of contaminated seafood, affecting various vital organs especially, brain contributing to neuro disorders. The citrus flavanone, naringenin (NAR) has shown strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and therefore may exert cytoprotective effect against xenobiotic agents. Herein, we investigated the neuroprotective role of NAR against MeHg induced functional changes in , neuronal cell death and cognitive impairment in a mouse model. A neurotoxic dose of MeHg (4 mg/kg..wt.) was administered orally to mice for 15 days. This resulted in the reduction of GSH and GST, an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage and memory impairment. On the contrary, NAR pre-treatment (100 mg/kg..wt.), helped in lowering the oxidative burden which in turn maintained mitochondrial function and prevented induced neuronal cell death, ultimately improving the cognitive impairment. As MeHg intoxication occurs chronically, consumption of the dietary components rich in NAR may have its positive human health impact, ultimately improving the quality of life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Recent studies suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) are able to translocate to  to modulate mitochondrial activities, but the roles of such miRNAs in diabetic cardiomyopathy remain unclear. We observed a marked reduction of mitochondrial gene cytochrome- (mt-Cytb) in the heart of db/db mice compared with controls. Downregulation of mt-Cytb by small interfering RNA (siRNA) recaptured some key features of diabetes, including elevated ROS production. Microarray revealed that none of the miRNAs were upregulated, but 14 miRNAs were downregulated in  of db/db heart. miR-92a-2-5p and let-7b-5p targeted mt-Cytb and positively modulated mt-Cytb expression. Re-expression of miR-92a-2-5p and let-7b-5p into cardiomyocytes led to reduced ROS production. Furthermore, recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated delivery of miR-92a-2-5p, but not let-7b-5p, was sufficient to rescue cardiac diastolic dysfunction in db/db heart. Let-7b-5p not only upregulated mt-Cytb in , but also downregulated insulin receptor substrate 1 in cytosol and finally lead to no efficiency for improvement of diastolic dysfunction in db/db mice. Our findings demonstrate that reduced mitochondrial miRNAs contribute to impaired mitochondrial gene expression and elevated ROS production. Re-expression of miR-92a-2-5p enhances mitochondrial translation and reduces ROS production and lipid deposition, which finally rescues diabetic cardiomyopathy.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Our goal is to identify the key factor in the process by which cells develop temozolomide (TMZ) resistance.Resistant cell lines derived from U87MG and A172 were established through long-term co-incubation of TMZ. Primary tumors obtained from patients were maintained as patient-derived xenograft for studies of tumor-initating cell (TIC) features. The cell manifestations were assessed in the gene modulated cells for relevance to drug resistance.Among the -related genes in the gene expression databases, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) was a significant factor in resistance and patient survival. SOD2 in the resistant cells functionally determined the cell fate by limiting TMZ-stimulated superoxide reaction and cleavage of caspase-3. Genetic inhibition of the protein led to retrieval of drug effect in mouse study. SOD2 was also associated with the TIC features, which enriched in the resistant cells. The CD133 specific subsets in the resistant cells exhibited superior superoxide regulation and the SOD2-related caspase-3 reaction. Experiments applying SOD2 modulation showed a positive correlation between the TIC features and the protein expression. Finally, co-treatment with TMZ and the SOD inhibitor sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate in xenograft mouse models with the TMZ-resistant primary tumor resulted in lower tumor proliferation, longer survival, and less CD133, Bmi-1, and SOD2 expression.SOD2 plays crucial roles in the tumor-initiating features that are related to TMZ resistance.

Both oxidative stress in  and NMDAR neurotransmission play essential roles in the process of neurodegenerative dementia. The aim of the study was to investigate whether pLG72 levels changed with the severity of neurodegenerative dementia. We enrolled 376 individuals as the overall cohort, consisting of five groups: healthy elderly, amnestic mild cognitive impairment [MCI], mild Alzheimer's disease [AD], moderate AD, and severe AD. pLG72 levels in plasma were measured using Western blotting. The severity of cognitive deficit was principally evaluated by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. A gender- and age- matched cohort was selected to elucidate the effects of gender and age. pLG72 levels increased in the MCI and mild AD groups when compared to the healthy group. However, pLG72 levels in the moderate and severe AD groups were lower than those in the mild AD group. D-serine level and D- to total serine ratio were significantly different among the five groups. L-serine levels were correlated with the pLG72 levels. The results in the gender- and age- matched cohort were similar to those of the overall cohort. The finding supports the hypothesis of NMDAR hypofunction in early-phase dementia and NMDAR hyperfunction in late-phase dementia.

Herein, a NF-κ signal pathway, a positive regulator of inflammation was identified as the main pathway of methylamine exposure induced adverse effects in bronchial airway cells (16HBE) for the first time. The results indicated that methylamine could stimulate the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytoplasm and  of 16HBE cells. Moreover, ROS accelerate the translocation and phosphorylation of NF-κ in nucleic and promote the expression of inflammatory, such as IL-8 and IL-6. As a result, methylamine was found to be increased ROS-mediated NF-κ activation in cells, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokine. Furthermore, the results also showed that methylamine could affect the expression of cytokines related genes, p53, STAT3, Bcl2, c-myc, Cyclin D, Hes1, Mcl-1, TGF-β2. The breakdown of those cell proliferation and apoptosis related genes were leading to a common toxic mechanism of cell death.

This contributed to the decreased resolution of TOP1-cc leading to accumulation of mtDNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, we used lung tissue obtained from areas with mild and severe emphysema from the same patients. We found a correlation between the impaired fusion and fission as indicated by low MFN1, OPA1, FIS1, and p-DRP1 levels and this disease severity.

We aimed to investigate the effects and the underlying mechanisms of 7,8-DHF on cardiac ischemia. Myocardial ischemic mouse model was induced by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery. 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally two days after ischemia for four weeks. Echocardiography, HE staining and transmission electron microscope were used to examine the function, histology and ultrastructure of the heart. H9c2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (HO), 7,8-DHF or TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. The effects of 7,8-DHF on cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial superoxide generation were examined. Furthermore, mitochondrial fission and protein expression of mitochondrial dynamics (Mfn2 [mitofusin 2], OPA1 [optic atrophy 1], Drp1 [dynamin-related protein 1] and Fis-1 [fission 1]) was detected by mitotracker green staining and western blot, respectively. 7,8-DHF attenuated cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyocyte abnormality of myocardial ischemic mice. Moreover, 7,8-DHF increased cell viability and reduced cell death accompanied by improving MMP, inhibiting mitochondrial superoxide and preventing excessive mitochondrial fission of HO-treated H9c2 cells. The cytoprotective effects of 7,8-DHF were antagonized by ANA-12. Mechanistically, 7,8-DHF repressed OMA1-dependent conversion of L-OPA1 into S-OPA1, which was abolished by Akt inhibitor. In conclusion, 7,8-DHF protects against cardiac ischemic injury by inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage of OPA1.

In order to investigate the detailed mechanisms by which salts exhibited antifungal activity, we analyzed their influence on morphological changes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and also on reactive species of oxygen (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Defects such as malformation and excessive septation were detected on salt-treated hyphae morphology observed by SEM. The internal structure of conidia treated or not with salt solutions was examined by TEM. In treated conidia, most of the conidia were affected and cellular vacuolization and cytoplasmic disorganization was observed. For ROS accumulation, a higher increase was observed in fluorescent conidia in presence of PB, SSi, and CCh by 75, 68, and 70% as compared to control, respectively. MMP was significantly decreased after salt application indicating a loss of  function. Also, luminescence showed that -conidia treated with salts contained less ATP than the untreated conidia. The results obtained herein are a step towards a comprehensive understanding of the mode of action by which salts act as antifungal agents against .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354026>Silencing of KCNA1 suppresses the cervical cancer development via  damage.</a></h2><p>Voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily A member 1 (KCNA1/Kv1.1) is an important component of type A potassium channels, which has been found to be involved in various tumors. This study aimed to identify the role of KCNA1 in cervical cancer and explore the related mechanism. The levels of KCNA1 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines were examined by Western blot and qPCR. Cell proliferation and invasion were assessed by CCK-8 and transwell assays, respectively. Protein levels of Hedgehog (Hhg), Wnt and Notch were detected by Western blot. The mitochondrial capacity was examined by immunostaining with MitoTracker Red CMXRos. KCNA1 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, and correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, depletion of KCNA1 suppressed growth, proliferation, migration and invasion of HeLa cells. Moreover, KCNA1 could regulate the Hhg, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study has demonstrated that KCNA1 is an oncogene excessively expressed in cervical cancer, and promotes tumor progression by regulating the Hhg, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways and the mitochondrial capacity. Therefore, our results provide a theoretical basis for the discovery of novel clinical treatment against cervical cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409740>SAR1B GTPase is necessary to protect intestinal cells from disorders of lipid homeostasis, oxidative stress, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Genetic defects in SAR1B GTPase inhibit chylomicron (CM) trafficking to the Golgi and result in a huge intraenterocyte lipid accumulation with a failure to release CMs and liposoluble vitamins into the blood circulation.

Eight complete fully annotated 13-22 Mb genomes from three genera, ,  and , are available from previously isolated clonal cultured strains and provide an ideal resource to explore the scope and challenges of analysing single cell amplified genomes (SAGs) isolated from a natural environment. We assembled data from 12 SAGs sampled during the Tara Oceans expedition to gain biological insights about their  ecology, which might be lost by isolation and strain culture. Although the assembled nuclear genomes were incomplete, they were large enough to infer the mating types of four  SAGs. The systematic occurrence of sequences from the  and chloroplast, representing less than 3% of the total cell's DNA, intimates that SAGs provide suitable substrates for detection of non-target sequences, such as those of virions. Analysis of the non-Mamiellophyceae assemblies, following filtering out cross-contaminations during the sequencing process, revealed two novel 1.6 and 1.8 kb circular DNA viruses, and the presence of specific Bacterial and Oomycete sequences suggests that these organisms might co-occur with the Mamiellales.

Here, we showed that exposure to AFB1 impaired mitochondrial dynamics and increased intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) in the liver of HBV-transgenic mice in vivo and the hepatitis  virus X protein (HBx)-expressing human hepatocytes both ex vivo and in vitro. HBx combined with AFB1 exposure also up-regulated receptor interaction protein 1 (RIP1), receptor interaction protein 3 (RIP3) and activated mixed lineage kinase domain like protein (MLKL), providing evidence of necrosome formation in the hepatocytes. The shift of the mitochondrial dynamics towards imbalance of fission and fusion was rescued when MLKL was inhibited in the HBx and AFB1 co-treated hepatocytes. Most importantly, based on siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 system, we found that the combination of HBx and AFB1 exposure increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to mediate up-regulation of RIP3 and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which in turn promoted location of RIP3-MLKL necrosome on , subsequently exacerbated steatosis in hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings advance the understanding of mechanism associated with HBx and AFB1-induced hepatic necrosome formation, mitochondrial dysfunction and steatosis and make COX-2 a good candidate for treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

This study is the first to describe a role for the medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) receptor G-protein-coupled receptor (Gpr) 84 in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and insulin secretion. We are able to show that Gpr84 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Mice with global deletion of  [ knockout (KO)] exhibit a mild impairment in glucose tolerance when fed a MCFA-enriched diet. Studies in mice and pancreatic islets suggest that glucose intolerance is accompanied by a defect in insulin secretion. MCFA-fed KO mice also exhibit a significant impairment in the intrinsic respiratory capacity of their skeletal muscle , but at the same time also exhibit a substantial increase in mitochondrial content. Changes in canonical pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover are unable to explain these mitochondrial differences. Our results show that Gpr84 plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and quality control.-Montgomery, M. K., Osborne, ., Brandon, A. E., O'Reilly, L., Fiveash, C. E., Brown, S. H.

The study used male young Wistar rats aged 22-30 days, divided into three experimental groups and the control group. Brain maturity in such animals corresponds to that of 1- or 2-year-old children. Hyperthermic stress was evoked by placing animals in a 45°C water bath for four consecutive days. TPM at a dose of 80 mg/kg .m. was administered with an intragastric tube before and immediately after FS. Specimens (1 mm3) collected from the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors, fixed via transcardial perfusion with a solution of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, were routinely processed for transmission-electron microscopic analysis. Advanced ultrastructural changes induced by hyperthermic stress were manifested by distinct swelling of hippocampal pre- and post-synaptic axodendritic and axospinal endings, including their vacuolization and disintegration. The axoplasm of the presynaptic boutons contained a markedly decreased number of synaptic vesicles and their abnormal accumulation in the active synaptic region. The synaptic junctions showed a dilated synaptic cleft and a decreased synaptic active zone. TPM used directly after FS was ineffective in the prevention of hyperthermia-induced injury of synaptic endings in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors. However, "prophylactic" administration of TPM, prior to FS induction, demonstrated a neuroprotective effect against synaptic damage in approximately 25% of the synaptic endings in the hippocampal sectors, more frequently located in perivascular zones. It was manifested by smaller oedema of both presynaptic and postsynaptic parts, containing well-preserved , increased number and regular distribution of synaptic vesicles within the axoplasm, and increased synaptic active zone. Our current and previous findings suggest that TPM administered "prophylactically", before FS, could exert a favourable effect on some synapses, indirectly, via the vascular factor, i.e. protecting blood-brain barrier components and through better blood supply of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors, which may have practical implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587636>A single-cell genome reveals diplonemid-like ancestry of kinetoplastid mitochondrial gene structure.</a></h2><p>Euglenozoa comprises euglenids, kinetoplastids, and diplonemids, with each group exhibiting different and highly unusual mitochondrial genome organizations. Although they are sister groups, kinetoplastids and diplonemids have very distinct mitochondrial genome architectures, requiring widespread insertion/deletion RNA editing and extensive -splicing, respectively, in order to generate functional transcripts. The evolutionary history by which these differing processes arose remains unclear. Using single-cell genomics, followed by small sub unit ribosomal DNA and multigene phylogenies, we identified an isolated marine cell that branches on phylogenetic trees as a sister to known kinetoplastids. Analysis of single-cell amplified genomic material identified multiple mitochondrial genome contigs. These revealed a gene architecture resembling that of diplonemid , with small fragments of genes encoded out of order and or on different contigs, indicating that these genes require extensive -splicing. Conversely, no requirement for kinetoplastid-like insertion/deletion RNA-editing was detected. Additionally, while we identified some proteins so far only found in kinetoplastids, we could not unequivocally identify mitochondrial RNA editing proteins. These data invite the hypothesis that extensive genome fragmentation and -splicing were the ancestral states for the kinetoplastid-diplonemid clade but were lost during the kinetoplastid radiation. This study demonstrates that single-cell approaches can successfully retrieve lineages that represent important new branches on the tree of life, and thus can illuminate major evolutionary and functional transitions in eukaryotes.

A recombinant eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3-MDA-7) containing human MDA-7 gene was constructed, which was then delivered to liver cancer cell line HepG2 and normal liver cell line L02. The positive cell clone was screened by G418. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to confirm the occurrence of MDA-7 transcription in the transfected cells. The protein expression of MDA-7 was determined by western blot analysis. The effects of MDA-7 on liver cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated through MTT assay and flow cytometry by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) double-staining. The mitochondrial protein was extracted from the normal liver cell line L02 and liver cancer cell line HepG2 at 3 day post-culture, in which the alterations of anti-apoptotic -cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), -released cytochrome  and caspase 9 were determined by western blot analysis. pcDNA3-MDA-7 mediated the expression of foreign gene MDA-7 in HepG2 and L02 cells. MDA-7 promoted liver cancer cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation; while no effect was exerted on normal liver cells, as determined by the MTT assay and flow cytometry. Relative to the L02 cells, the protein expression of Bcl-2 was downregulated in the HepG2 cells, while that of Bax, cytochrome  and caspase 9 were upregulated. In the study, the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3-MDA-7 was successfully constructed, it can mediate the expression of MDA-7 in human liver cancer cells and normal liver cells and inhibits the proliferation of human liver cancer cells through the restored expression of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic Bcl-2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372221>Hyaluronic Acid Grafted Nanoparticles of a Platinum(II)-Silicon(IV) Phthalocyanine Conjugate for Tumor and -Targeted Photodynamic Therapy in Red Light.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report novel hyaluronic acid formulated nanoparticles containing a platinum(II) conjugated silicon(IV) phthalocyanine (SiPc-Pt-HA) for tumor targeted red light photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy.

The antiproliferative potential of 1 was performed on two human tumour cell lines, A2780 and HCT116, and in normal fibroblasts, with a much higher effect in the former cell line (IC of 0.04 μM) as compared to the latter cell line and to normal fibroblasts. Compound 1 does not alter cell cycle progression but interferes with the adherence of A2780 cells triggering cell apoptosis. Apoptosis appears to occur via the extrinsic pathway (no changes in  membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-apoptotic (-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) associated protein (BAX))/anti-apoptotic (BCL-2) ratio) being this hypothesis also supported by the presence of silver mainly in the supernatants of A2780 cells. Results also indicated that cell death via autophagy was triggered. Proteomic analysis allowed us to confirm that compound 1 is able to induce a stress response in A2780 cells that is related with its antiproliferative activity and the trigger of apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The senescent cells, in medium free of glucose and bicarbonate, showed impaired activity in migration and tube formation. Flow cytometry indicated increased content of reactive oxygen species, , and calcium, while bioenergetic analysis showed increased oxygen consumption and reduced ATP content. Examination of mitochondrial network showed that senescence increased the length of the network and ultrastructure analysis exhibited elongated . Immunoblotting of the senescent EPCs demonstrated decreased expression level of fission protein1 (Fis1). In rat EPCs, the Fis1 level was decreased in the animals aged 24 months or older, compared to those of 3 months. Silencing of Fis1 in the young EPCs using Fis1-specific siRNA leads to appearance of phenotype resembling those of senescent cells, including elevated oxidative stress, disturbed mitochondrial network, reduced  membrane potential, decreasing ATP content, lower proliferation activity, and loss of therapeutic potential in ischemic hindlimbs. Fis1 over-expression in senescent EPCs reduced the oxidative stress, increased the proliferation, and restored the cobble stone-like morphology, senescence, bioenergetics, angiogenic potential, and therapeutic activity.In human EPCs, down-regulation of Fis1 is involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and contributes to the impaired activity of EPCs during the senescence process.

Hijiki was processed using 1% citric acid to decrease heavy metal content. The JH sample was separated using diethylaminoethyl-cellulose-ion exchange chromatography to obtain four active fractions (JHCF1-JHCF4) and their monosaccharide composition was detected using high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure of the crude polysaccharides and four fucoidan fractions was analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. JHCF4 showed the highest fucose and sulfate content and decreased Hep3B cell growth in 48 h with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 33.53 ± 2.50 μg/ml, which represented the strongest anticancer activity. Further, nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 and acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining demonstrated that the anticancer activity of JHCF4 was mediated by apoptosis. Moreover, JHCF4 down-regulated -cell lymphoma extra-large, while up-regulating Bcl-2-associated X protein, caspase-3, and apoptotic bodies to different degrees in Hep3B cells. JHCF4 induced apoptosis via the generation of reactive oxygen species along with the concurrent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating the potential role of the -mediated pathway. Therefore, these results indicate that JHCF4 exhibited antiproliferative effects on the investigated cancer cell lines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Attenuation of dysfunctional  by natural compounds is an emerging strategy for the recovery of abnormal energy metabolism of cancer. To develop a nano-sized curcumin (CUR) in attenuating the energy metabolism of cancer cells, herein, a coral-shaped nano-transporter DNA-FeS-DA nanoparticle was synthesized using double-stranded DNA rich in 'GAG' and 'GC' series as a template and poly-dopamine as an adhesive. CUR was successfully loaded to DNA-FeS-DA with a molar ratio of ssDNA: CUR of 1:16, forming CUR@DNA-FeS-DA. This nano-curcumin can readily enter mitochondrion in MCF-7 cancer cells. The CUR@DNA-FeS-DA nanocomposite displays desirable photothermal effect and stability, while its CUR can be released gradually in the weak acid environment. The expression of both pyruvate kinase M2 and fatty acid synthase in the MCF-7 cancer cells were noticeably inhibited by CUR@DNA-FeS-DA.

Cyclosporin A inhibits pore opening by binding to cyclophilin D, which interacts with the pore. It has been proposed that the pore is associated with the ATP synthase complex. Previously, we confirmed an earlier observation that the pore survives in cells lacking membrane subunits ATP6 and ATP8 of ATP synthase, and in other cells lacking the enzyme's c rotor ring or, separately, its peripheral stalk subunits  and oligomycin sensitive conferral protein. Here, we investigated whether the pore is associated with the remaining membrane subunits of the enzyme. Individual deletion of subunits e, f, g, and 6.8-kDa proteolipid disrupts dimerization of the complex, and deletion of DAPIT (diabetes-associated protein in insulin sensitive tissue) possibly influences oligomerization of dimers, but removal of each subunit had no effect on the pore. Also, we removed together the enzyme's membrane bound c ring and the δ-subunit from the catalytic domain. The resulting cells assemble only a subcomplex derived from the peripheral stalk and membrane-associated proteins. Despite diminished levels of respiratory complexes, these cells generate a membrane potential to support uptake of calcium into the , leading to pore opening, and retention of its characteristic properties.

Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles specialized in lipid storage that interact physically with  in several cell types. The mechanisms coupling these organelles are, however, poorly understood, and the cell-biological function of their interaction remains largely unknown. Here, we discover in adipocytes that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein MIGA2 links  to LDs. We identify an amphipathic LD-targeting motif and reveal that MIGA2 binds to the membrane proteins VAP-A or VAP- in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We find that in adipocytes MIGA2 is involved in promoting triglyceride (TAG) synthesis from non-lipid precursors. Our data indicate that MIGA2 links reactions of de novo lipogenesis in  to TAG production in the ER, thereby facilitating efficient lipid storage in LDs.

Statins are associated with mitochondrial damage, which may contribute to muscle myopathy. Here we demonstrate that simvastatin induces mitophagy in skeletal muscle cells and hypothesized that attenuating this process by silencing the mitophagy adapter p62/sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1) might mitigate myotoxicity. Surprisingly, silencing p62/SQSTM1 in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells exacerbated rather than attenuated myotoxicity. This inhibition of mitophagy in the face of statin challenge correlated with increased release of cytochrome  to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Correspondingly, targeted knockdown of Parkin, a canonical E3 ubiquitin ligase important for mitophagy, mirrored the effects of p62/SQSTM1 silencing. To corroborate these findings , we treated Parkin knockout mice with simvastatin for 2 wk. In line with our findings , these mitophagy-compromised mice displayed reduced spontaneous activity, loss of grip strength, and increased circulating levels of muscle damage marker LDH.

The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κ negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κ expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA. Together, our studies identify an important role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in maintaining hepatic homeostasis by ameliorating steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress  the NF-κ-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic scheme for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.-Zhou, L., Li, Q., Chen, A., Liu, N., Chen, N., Chen, X., Zhu, L., Xia, ., Gong, Y., Chen, X.

Lipid transfer proteins allow lipids to exit the hydrophobic environment of bilayers, and cross aqueous spaces. One lipid transfer domain fold present in almost all eukaryotes is the TUbular LIPid binding (TULIP) domain. Three TULIP families have been identified in bacteria (P47, OrfX2 and YceB), but their homology to eukaryotic proteins is too low to specify a common origin. Another recently described eukaryotic lipid transfer domain in VPS13 and ATG2 is Chorein-N, which has no known bacterial homologues. There has been no systematic search for bacterial TULIPs or Chorein-N domains.Remote homology predictions for bacterial TULIP domains using HHsearch identified four new TULIP domains in three bacterial families. DUF4403 is a full length pseudo-dimeric TULIP with a 6 strand β-meander dimer interface like eukaryotic TULIPs. A similar sheet is also present in YceB, suggesting it homo-dimerizes. TULIP domains were also found in DUF2140 and in the C-terminus DUF2993. Remote homology predictions for bacterial Chorein-N domains identified strong hits in the N-termini of AsmA and TamB in diderm bacteria, which are related to Mdm31p in eukaryotic . The N-terminus of DUF2993 has a Chorein-N domain adjacent to its TULIP domain.TULIP lipid transfer domains are widespread in bacteria. Chorein-N domains are also found in bacteria, at the N-terminus of multiple proteins in the intermembrane space of diderms (AsmA, TamB and their relatives) and in Mdm31p, a protein that is likely to have evolved from an AsmA/TamB-like protein in the endosymbiotic mitochondrial ancestor. This indicates that both TULIP and Chorein-N lipid transfer domains may have originated in bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404506>Taurine Protects Retinal Cells and Improves Synaptic Connections in Early Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>: Taurine has long been thought to be involved in retinal protection from retinal degenerative diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Retinal neurodegeneration is an early event in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) that precedes and participates in the microcirculatory abnormalities that occur in DR. Our objective was to investigate the role and mechanisms of taurine in early diabetic retinas. : Eight-week-old STZ-induced diabetic rats and control animals were randomly assigned to receive taurine or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection or by intragastric administration. The retinal function and retinal cell counts were evaluated using an electroretinography (ERG) and immunofluorescence microscopy. Plasma amino acids were measured by ion-exchange chromatography (IEC). The expression levels of retinal taurine transporter (Tau-T), -dependent apoptosis-associated genes and reactive gliosis markers were studied by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Pre- and post-synaptic markers (PSD95 and mGluR6) in outer plexiform layer (OPL), and the bipolar cell marker protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) were localized by immunofluorescence. Levels of PSD95 and mGluR6 were determined by quantitative western blot. : Taurine significantly prevented the reduction of photopic -wave amplitude and retinal cone cells and ganglion cells loss and maintained the Bcl-2/Bax ratio balance in diabetic rats. Taurine also prevented the upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and reduced retinal reactive gliosis. Taurine reduced plasma glutamate and tyrosine levels, which were elevated in diabetic rats. Moreover, mGluR6 levels reduction detected by western blot and immunofluorescence in diabetic retinas was inhibited and the displacement of mGluR6 in OPL into the inner nuclear layer (INL) detected by immunofluorescence was reduced by Taurine treatment. : Taurine may protect retinal cells from diabetic attacks by activating Tau-T, reducing retinal reactive gliosis, improving retinal synaptic connections and decreasing retinal cell apoptosis. Thus, taurine treatment may be a novel approach for early DR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665034>Autophagy and apoptosis are regulated by stress on Bcl2 by AMBRA1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and .</a></h2><p>Autophagy and apoptosis are two important physiological processes that determine cell survival or death in response to different stress signals. The regulatory mechanisms of these two processes share -cell lymphoma-2 family proteins and AMBRA1, which are present in both the endoplasmic reticulum and . -cell lymphoma-2 family proteins sense different stresses and interact with AMBRA1 to regulate autophagy and apoptosis, which are respectively mediated by Beclin1 and Caspases. Therefore, we investigated how different levels of stress on -cell lymphoma-2 family proteins that bind to AMBRA1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and  regulate the switch from autophagy to apoptosis.In this paper, we considered the responses of -cell lymphoma-2 family proteins, which bind to AMBRA1 in both the endoplasmic reticulum and , to two different levels of stress in a model originally proposed by Kapuy et al. We investigated how these two stress levels affect the transition from autophagy to apoptosis and their effects on apoptosis activation over time. Additionally, we analyzed how the feedback regulation in this model affects the bifurcation diagrams of two levels of stress and cell fate decisions between autophagy and apoptosis.Autophagy is activated for minor stress in  regardless of endoplasmic reticulum stress, while apoptosis is activated for only significant stress in . Apoptosis is only sensitive to  stress. The time duration before apoptosis activation is longer in the presence of high AMBRA1 levels with high endoplasmic reticulum and  stress. AMBRA1 can compete with -cell lymphoma-2 family proteins to bind and activate Beclin1 and thus promote the autophagy process for a long time before apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis is prone to occur with increasing activation of Caspases, inactivation of Beclin1-A and the Michaelis constant of Caspases.A novel mathematical model has been developed to understand the complex regulatory mechanisms of autophagy and apoptosis. Our model may be applied to further autophagy-apoptosis dynamic modeling experiments and simulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564190>2,4-Dihydroxy-3'-methoxy-4'-ethoxychalcone suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma  the PI3K/akt/mTOR signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>  Kom. (Fabaceae), a commonly used folk medicine, has been found to possess antitumor effects. However, the antiproliferative effect of 2,4-dihydroxy-3'-methoxy-4'-ethoxychalcone (DMEC) derived from  against multiple myeloma (MM) has never been investigated.  This study systematically evaluates the antiproliferative effect of DMEC against MM cells.  The antiproliferative effect of DMEC (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 μM) on MM cells lines, including RPMI8226, MM.1S, and U266, was examined using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay after 24 h incubation. The proapoptotic effect of DMEC (20 μM) was determined using fluorescent microscope and flow cytometer, and its possible underlying mechanisms were further studied by using western blotting analysis.  The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC) of DMEC on RPMI8226, MM.1S, and U266 cells were calculated as 25.97, 18.36, and 15.02 μM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of DMEC on MM cells was related to -mediated apoptosis  upregulation of the cleaved-caspase-3 (C-3), cleaved-caspase-9 (C-9), Bad, and cytochrome C (Cyto C), but downregulation of the Bcl-2 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, DMEC (5, 10, and 20 μM) reduced the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase  (Akt), and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), which were further evidenced by pretreatment with IGF-1, a PI3K activator.  Collectively, our results indicate that the DMEC could be treated as a new candidate for treatment of multiple myeloma in the future. Also, an  study is warranted in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433962>Apoptotic activity of xanthoquinodin JBIR-99, from Parengyodontium album MEXU 30054, in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Natural products are a valuable source of anticancer agents, with many naturally derived compounds currently used in clinical and preclinical treatments. This study aims to investigate the antiproliferative activity and potential mechanism of action of the xanthoquinodin JBIR-99, isolated from fungi Parengyodontium album MEXU 30,054 and identified by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Cytotoxicity of xanthoquinodin was evaluated in a panel of human cancer cells lines and CCD-112-CoN normal colon cells, using the sulforhodamine  assay. PC-3 prostate cancer cells were used in biochemical assays including cell cycle, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase activity. Expression levels of apoptosis-pathway-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot. The in vivo toxicity of xanthoquinodin was determined using a zebrafish model. Xanthoquinodin showed cytotoxicity in all cancer cell lines but demonstrated relative selective potency against PC-3 cells with an IC 1.7 μM. In CCD-112-CoN cells, xanthoquinodin was non-cytotoxic at 100 μM. In PC-3 cells, the compound induced loss of MTP, production of ROS, and cell cycle arrest in S phase. The expression and activity of caspase-3 was increased, which correlates with the upregulation of Cyt c, Bax, nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) (p65) and IKKβ, and downregulation of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP-1) and Bcl-2. Lastly, xanthoquinodin did not cause any visible developmental toxicity in zebrafish at 50 μM. These results demonstrate xanthoquinodin induces apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells by activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, the non-toxic effect in vivo indicates that xanthoquinodin could be a useful lead in the development of a novel, anti-cancer agent that is selective for prostate cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Here, we used in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map the interactomes of seven proteases localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). In total, we identified 802 high confidence proximity interactions with 342 unique proteins. While all seven proteases co-localized with the IMS markers OPA1 and CLPB, 230 of the interacting partners were unique to just one or two protease bait proteins, highlighting the ability of BioID to differentiate unique interactomes within the confined space of the IMS. Notably, high temperature requirement peptidase 2 (HTRA2) interacted with eight of 13 components of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, a multiprotein assembly essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial cristae structure. Knockdown of HTRA2 disrupted cristae in HEK 293 and OCI-AML2 cells, and led to increased intracellular levels of the MIB subunit IMMT. Using a cell-free assay we demonstrate that HTRA2 can degrade recombinant IMMT but not two other core MIB complex subunits, SAMM50 and CHCHD3. Our IMS protease interactome thus represents a rich dataset that can be mined to uncover novel IMS protease biology. This article is protected by copyright.

Here supramolecular assemblies of novel amphiphilic cell-penetrating peptides for targeting cancer cell  are reported. The employed strategy aims at amplifying the apoptotic stimuli by weakening the mitochondrial VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel-1)-hexokinase-II (HK-II) interaction. Peptide engineering is performed with the N-terminus of the HK-II protein, which binds to VDAC1. First, a designed positively charged segment (pKV) is anchored to the specific 15 amino acid sequence (MIASHLLAYFFTELN) to yield a cell-penetrating peptide (pHK-pKV). Second, a lipid chain (Pal) is conjugated to the N-terminus of pHK-pKV in order to enhance the intracellular delivery of the HK-II scaffold. The self-assembly properties of these two synthetic peptides are investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS) and cryogenic transmission electron (cryo-TEM) imaging, which evidence the formation of nanoassemblies of ellipsoid-like shapes. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy demonstrates the induction of partial α-helical structures in the amphiphilic peptides. Confocal microscopy reveals the specific mitochondrial location of Pal-pHK-pKV assemblies in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells. The cytotoxicity and apoptotic studies indicate the enhanced bioactivity of Pal-pHK-pKV self-assembled reservoirs, which cause massive A549 cell death with regard to pHK-pKV. Of significance, Pal-pHK-pKV treatment of non-cancerous NCM460 cells resulted in substantially lower cytotoxicity. The results demonstrate the potential of self-assembled lipo-peptide (HK-II-derived) conjugates as a promising strategy in cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552178>Cinobufagin Induces Cell Cycle Arrest at the G2/M Phase and Promotes Apoptosis in Malignant Melanoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence has shown that cinobufagin, as an active ingredient of Venenum Bufonis, inhibits tumor development. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of cinobufagin on A375 human malignant melanoma cells. MTT and colony formation assays showed that cinobufagin significantly inhibited A375 cell proliferation and cell colony formation. Additional studies demonstrated that cinobufagin markedly increased the levels of ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) and decreased the levels of cell division cycle 25C (CDC25C), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), and cyclin , subsequently inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest in A375 cells. Moreover, cinobufagin clearly inhibited the levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K), AKT, p-AKT, and -cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). By contrast, it increased the levels of Bcl-2-associated death promoter, Bcl-2-associated X, cytoplasmic cytochrome C, and apoptotic protease activating factor 1, leading to increased levels of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3, resulting in the apoptosis of A375 cells. Together, these results indicate that cinobufagin can induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis, leading to inhibition of A375/B16 cell proliferation. Thus, cinobufagin may be useful for melanoma treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345059>Endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated the xanthohumol induced murine melanoma B16-F10 cell death.</a></h2><p>Xanthohumol (XN) exerts a specific cytotoxicity in B16-F10 melanoma cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles formation.

Protein kinase /Akt plays a prominent role in mediating many of the metabolic effects of insulin. Mice and humans harboring systemic loss-of-function mutations in Akt2, the most abundant Akt isoform in metabolic tissues, are glucose intolerant and insulin resistant. Since the skeletal muscle accounts for a significant amount of postprandial glucose disposal, a popular hypothesis in the diabetes field suggests that a reduction in Akt, specifically in skeletal muscle, leads to systemic glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Despite this common belief, the specific role of skeletal muscle Akt in muscle growth and insulin sensitivity remains undefined.We generated multiple mouse models of skeletal muscle Akt deficiency to evaluate the role of muscle Akt signaling in vivo. The effects of these genetic perturbations on muscle mass, glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity were assessed using both in vivo and ex vivo assays.Surprisingly, mice lacking Akt2 alone in skeletal muscle displayed normal skeletal muscle insulin signaling, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity despite a dramatic reduction in phosphorylated Akt. In contrast, deletion of both Akt isoforms (M-AktDKO) prevented downstream signaling and resulted in muscle atrophy. Despite the absence of Akt signaling, in vivo and ex vivo insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were normal in M-AktDKO mice. Similar effects on insulin sensitivity were observed in mice with prolonged deletion (4 weeks) of both skeletal muscle Akt isoforms selectively in adulthood. Conversely, short term deletion (2 weeks) of skeletal muscle specific Akt in adult muscles impaired insulin tolerance paralleling the effect observed by acute pharmacological inhibition of Akt in vitro. Mechanistically, chronic ablation of Akt induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of AMPK, which was required for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the absence of Akt.Together, these data indicate that chronic reduction in Akt activity alone in skeletal muscle is not sufficient to induce insulin resistance or prevent glucose uptake in all conditions. Therefore, since insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle is markedly impaired in insulin-resistant states, we hypothesize that alterations in signaling molecules in addition to skeletal muscle Akt are necessary to perturb glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in vivo.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for breast cancer but is plagued by multidrug resistance (MDR). DOX-TPP-loaded micelles can enhance the specific concentration of drugs in the tumor and improve the efficacy and overcome MDR.  In this study, DOX-TPP-loaded micelles based on acetal-PEG-PCCL were prepared and their physicochemical properties were characterized. The cellular uptake and ability to induce apoptosis of the micelles was confirmed by flow cytometry in MCF-7/ADR cells. In addition, cytotoxicity of the micelles was studied in MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/ADR cells. Confocal is used to study the subcellular distribution of DOX. Free DOX-TPP or DOX-TPP-loaded acetal-PEG-PCCL micelles were administered via intravenous injection in the tail vain for the biodistribution study in vivo.  The diameter of micelles was about 102.4 nm and their drug-loading efficiency is 61.8%. The structural characterization was confirmed by 1H NMR. The micelles exhibited better antitumor efficacy compared to free doxorubicin in MCF-7/ADR cells by MTT assay. The apoptotic rate and the cellular uptake of micelles were significantly higher than free DOX and DOX-TPP. Micelles can efficiently deliver -targeting DOX-TPP to tumor cells. The result of bio-distribution showed that the micelles had stronger tumor infiltration ability than free drugs.  In this study, mitochondriotropic DOX-TPP was conjugated to the nanocarrier acetal-PEG-PCCL via ionic interaction to form a polymer, which spontaneously formed spherical micelles. The cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the micelles are superior to free DOX and exhibit mitochondrial targeting and passive tumor targeting, indicating that they have potential prospects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293190>Old problem, new solutions: biomarker discovery for acetaminophen liver toxicity.</a></h2><p>: Although the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen is a well-known problem, the search for reliable biomarker of toxicity is still a current issue as clinical tools are missing to assess patients intoxicated following chronic use, sequential ingestion, use of modified release formulations or in case of delayed arrival to hospital.

Uncovering the mechanisms underlying neuroblastoma cell differentiation is critical for therapeutic purposes. A neuroblastoma cell line (N2a) treated with either serum withdrawal (<2.5%) or melatonin (>0.1 nmol/L) for 24 hours was used as a cell differentiation research model. Interestingly, the hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) protein was induced in differentiated N2a cells. N2a-allografted nude mice received an intraperitoneal injection of melatonin (40 or 80 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks). The mean tumor volume in mice treated with 80 mg/kg melatonin was smaller than that in PBS-treated mice (1416.3 and 3041.3 mm , respectively, difference = 1625 mm , *P = 0.0003, n = 7 per group).

Immunofluorescence studies proved that XSD-7 inhibited microtubule polymerization during cell division in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells. Then, these cells were arrested at G2/M cell cycle and subsequently progressed into apoptosis. In further study, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis and Western blot analysis demonstrated that XSD-7 treatment-induced SGC-7901 cell apoptosis via both the -mediated pathway and the death receptor-mediated pathway. In contrast, XSD-7 induced apoptosis in HeLa cells mainly via the -mediated pathway. Hence, our data indicate that XSD-7 exerted antiproliferative activity by disrupting microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest, and eventually inducing cell apoptosis.

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse palmitic acid (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into . PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty acid analogue.

Beyond this mitochondrial function, several Bcl-2 family members have emerged as critical modulators of intracellular Ca homeostasis and dynamics, showing proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions. Bcl-2 family proteins specifically target several intracellular Ca-transport systems, including organellar Ca channels: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IPRs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), Ca-release channels mediating Ca flux from the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), which mediate Ca flux across the mitochondrial outer membrane into the .

Distinct interaction sites for different Bcl-2 family members were identified in the primary structure of IPRs. The unique molecular profiles of these Bcl-2 proteins may account for their distinct functional outcomes when bound to IPRs. Furthermore, Bcl-2 inhibitors used in cancer therapy may affect IPR function as part of their proapoptotic effect and/or as an adverse effect in healthy cells.Copyright © 2019 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342235>Effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial enzymes and ultrastructure in the brain cortex of rats with different tolerance to oxygen shortage.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial structure and the contents of subunits (NDUFV2, SDHA, Cyt , COX1) of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I-IV as well as of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) in the brain cortex (BC) of rats with high resistance (HR) and low resistance (LR) to hypoxia were studied for the first time depending on the severity of hypoxia.

Somatic perturbations of mtDNA are accumulating with age thus it is of great importance to uncover the main sources of mtDNA instability. Recent analyses demonstrated that somatic mtDNA deletions depend on imperfect repeats of various nature between distant mtDNA segments. However, till now there are no comprehensive databases annotating all types of imperfect repeats in numerous species with sequenced complete mitochondrial genome as well as there are no algorithms capable to call all types of imperfect repeats in circular mtDNA.We implemented naïve algorithm of pattern recognition by analogy to standard dot-plot construction procedures allowing us to find both perfect and imperfect repeats of four main types: direct, inverted, mirror and complementary. Our algorithm is adapted to specific characteristics of mtDNA such as circularity and an excess of short repeats - it calls imperfect repeats starting from the length of 10 .p. We constructed interactive web available database ImtRDB depositing perfect and imperfect repeats positions in mtDNAs of more than 3500 Vertebrate species. Additional tools, such as visualization of repeats within a genome, comparison of repeat densities among different genomes and a possibility to download all results make this database useful for many biologists. Our first analyses of the database demonstrated that mtDNA imperfect repeats (i) are usually short; (ii) associated with unfolded DNA structures; (iii) four types of repeats positively correlate with each other forming two equivalent pairs: direct and mirror versus inverted and complementary, with identical nucleotide content and similar distribution between species; (iv) abundance of repeats is negatively associated with GC content; (v) dinucleotides GC versus CG are overrepresented on light chain of mtDNA covered by repeats.ImtRDB is available at http://bioinfodbs.kantiana.ru/ImtRDB/ . It is accompanied by the software calling all types of interspersed repeats with different level of degeneracy in circular DNA. This database and software can become a very useful tool in various areas of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279710>Diagnosis of mitogenome for robust phylogeny: A case of Cypriniformes fish group.</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic tree using mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes have long been used for augmenting biological classification and understanding evolutionary processes in different lineage of life. But a basic question still exists for finding the most suitable gene for constructing robust phylogenetic tree. Much of the controversy appears due to monophyletic, paraphyletic and polyphyletic clade making deviations from original taxonomy. In the present study we report the first complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of queen loach, generated through next-generation sequencing methods. The assembled mitogenome is a 16,492 bp circular DNA, comprising of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a control region. Further in this study we also investigated the suitability of different mitochondrial region for phylogenetic analysis in Cyprinidae and loach group. For this genetic tree were constructed on COI, COII, COIII, 16S rRNA, 12S rRNA, Cyt , ATPase 6, D-loop, ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND5, and ND6 along with complete mitogenome. The complete mitogenome based phylogenetic tree got inclusive support from available classical taxonomy for these groups. On individual gene basis Cyt , 12S rRNA, ND2 and ND3 also produced perfect clade at family and subfamily level. For rest of the genes polyphyly were observed for the fishes belonging to same family or subfamily which makes their use questionable for phylogenetic tree construction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Previous preclinical models of chemoresistance in TNBC have suffered from a lack of clinical relevance. Using a single high dose chemotherapy treatment, we developed a novel MDA-MB-436 cell-based model of chemoresistance characterized by a unique and complex morphologic phenotype, which consists of polyploid giant cancer cells giving rise to neuron-like mononuclear daughter cells filled with smaller but functional  and numerous lipid droplets. This resistant phenotype is associated with metabolic reprogramming with a shift to a greater dependence on fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation. We validated both the molecular and histologic features of this model in a clinical cohort of primary chemoresistant TNBCs and identified several metabolic vulnerabilities including a dependence on PLIN4, a perilipin coating the observed lipid droplets, expressed both in the TNBC-resistant cells and clinical chemoresistant tumors treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. These findings thus reveal a novel mechanism of chemotherapy resistance that has therapeutic implications in the treatment of drug-resistant cancer. IMPLICATIONS: These findings underlie the importance of a novel morphologic-metabolic phenotype associated with chemotherapy resistance in TNBC, and bring to light novel therapeutic targets resulting from vulnerabilities in this phenotype, including the expression of PLIN4 essential for stabilizing lipid droplets in resistant cells.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433522>AT1R knockdown confers cardioprotection against sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway in rats.</a></h2><p>Myocardial dysfunction is an important manifestation of sepsis. In addition, inactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway has been reported to be beneficial in sepsis. The current study used gene expression profiling to demonstrate the overexpression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in sepsis. In this study, we used a rat model of sepsis established by cecal ligation and puncture to explore the mechanism of AT1R silencing in relation to the MAPK signaling pathway on myocardial injury. Various parameters including blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac function changes were observed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the concentration of cardiac troponin T (TnT), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and creatine kinase isoenzyme muscle/brain (CK-MB). Myocardial enzyme, tissue antioxidant capacity,  swelling, and membrane potential were also detected. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining was applied to measure cell apoptosis, and messenger RNA and protein levels of apoptosis-related proteins (Fas ligand [Fasl], -cell CLL/lymphoma [Bcl-2], p53) were also detected. Initially, sepsis rats exhibited decreased survival rate, but increased ejection fraction (EF), heart rate, and concentrations of TnT, cTnI, and CK-MB. Furthermore, decreased AT1R expression inactivated the MAPK signaling pathway (shown as decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element binding protein expression), decreased EF, heart rate, and concentrations of TnT, cTnI, and CK-MB, but increased sepsis rat survival rate. Eventually, decreased AT1R expression inhibited myocardial cell apoptosis (shown as decreased apoptosis rate and p53 and Fasl expression as well as increased Bcl-2 expression). These findings indicated that AT1R silencing plays an inhibitory role in sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269852>The role of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in the pathogenesis of uric acid nephropathy.</a></h2><p> By copying the uric acid nephropathy rat model, the oxidative stress injury of  was caused in renal tubular epithelial cells and the relationship between the injury and the induction of cell apoptosis was identified.  All rats were randomly divided into NC (normal control, NC) group, HUA (high uric acid, HUA) group and GSH (reductive glutathione, GSH) group. The values were quantitatively tested in the kidney tissues, including 24-h urinary protein quantity, serum creatinine, blood uric acid, the MDA (malondialdehyde, MDA) and SOD (superoxide dismutase, SOD) oxidative stress indicators. The expression of p53, Bax and caspase-9/-3 were detected by immunoblotting. TUNEL assays were used to detect the apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells.  In HUA and GSH groups, the 24-h urinary protein(24UTP), serum creatinine, and blood uric acid increased gradually with the increase of the replication cycle and the increase was significant compared to the NC group ( < .05). Compared to the NC group, MDA increased whereas SOD decreased. The expression of apoptotic proteins, such as p53, Bax, and caspase-9/-3 in the  was significantly different ( < .05). TUNEL assay revealed that the renal tubular epithelial cells in HUA group were largely apoptotic, whereas the GSH group improved significantly.   incurred the substantial damage due to being in a state of oxidative stress, which was the primary cause of apoptosis in the renal tubule epithelial cells.

In the present study, the potential anticancer activity of 2-[2-hydroxyl-1-(4-methoxy phenyl) ethyl]-3-(4-benzyloxy phenyl) isoindolin-1-one (CDS-1548), was evaluated in HeLa cells. CDS-1548 is an organic small-molecule compound characterized by two chiral centers, with the nuclear parent 1H-isoindolin-1-one. CDS-1548 administration significantly elevated the transcriptional activity of p53 and its downstream target genes in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, CDS-1548 treatment increased the expression levels of p53 and mouse double minute 2 homolog, as well as inducing apoptosis in HeLa cells. Furthermore, CDS-1548 treatment downregulated the expression of -cell lymphoma 2, upregulated Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer, promoted the release of cytochrome c from  to cytoplasm, and activated the production of caspase 3 and 9. Collectively, these results suggested that CDS-1548 inhibited HeLa cell proliferation by promoting G/M cell cycle phase arrest and inducting of -mediated apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310161>Physiological Biomimetic Culture System for Pig and Human Heart Slices.</a></h2><p>Preclinical testing of cardiotoxicity and efficacy of novel heart failure therapies faces a major limitation: the lack of an in situ culture system that emulates the complexity of human heart tissue and maintains viability and functionality for a prolonged time.To develop a reliable, easily reproducible, medium-throughput method to culture pig and human heart slices under physiological conditions for a prolonged period of time.Here, we describe a novel, medium-throughput biomimetic culture system that maintains viability and functionality of human and pig heart slices (300 µm thickness) for 6 days in culture. We optimized the medium and culture conditions with continuous electrical stimulation at 1.2 Hz and oxygenation of the medium. Functional viability of these slices over 6 days was confirmed by assessing their calcium homeostasis, twitch force generation, and response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Temporal transcriptome analysis using RNAseq at day 2, 6, and 10 in culture confirmed overall maintenance of normal gene expression for up to 6 days, while over 500 transcripts were differentially regulated after 10 days. Electron microscopy demonstrated intact  and Z-disc ultra-structures after 6 days in culture under our optimized conditions. This biomimetic culture system was successful in keeping human heart slices completely viable and functionally and structurally intact for 6 days in culture. We also used this system to demonstrate the effects of a novel gene therapy approach in human heart slices. Furthermore, this culture system enabled the assessment of contraction and relaxation kinetics on isolated single myofibrils from heart slices after culture.We have developed and optimized a reliable medium-throughput culture system for pig and human heart slices as a platform for testing the efficacy of novel heart failure therapeutics and reliable testing of cardiotoxicity in a 3-dimensional heart model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244524>Glioblastoma: Role of  N-acetylserotonin/Melatonin Ratio in Mediating Effects of miR-451 and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor and in Coordinating Wider Biochemical Changes.</a></h2><p>A wide array of different factors and processes have been linked to the biochemical underpinnings of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and glioblastoma stem cells (GSC), with no clear framework in which these may be integrated. Consequently, treatment of GBM/GSC is generally regarded as very poor. This article provides a framework that is based on alterations in the regulation of the melatonergic pathways within  of GBM/GSC. It is proposed that the presence of high levels of -synthesized melatonin is toxic to GBM/GSC, with a number of processes in GBM/GSC acting to limit melatonin's synthesis in . One such factor is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which increases cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1 in , leading to the 'backward' conversion of melatonin to -acetylserotonin (NAS). -acetylserotonin has some similar, but some important differential effects compared with melatonin, including its activation of the tyrosine receptor kinase  (TrkB) receptor. TrkB activation is important to GBM/GSC survival and proliferation. A plethora of significant, but previously disparate, data on GBM/GSC can then be integrated within this framework, including miR-451, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR, 14-3-3 proteins, sirtuins, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, and the kynurenine pathways.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of manoalide on oral cancer cells. MTS assay at 24 h showed that manoalide inhibited the proliferation of six types of oral cancer cell lines (SCC9, HSC3, OC2, OECM-1, Ca9-22, and CAL 27) but did not affect the proliferation of normal oral cell line (human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1)). Manoalide also inhibits the ATP production from 3D sphere formation of Ca9-22 and CAL 27 cells. Mechanically, manoalide induces subG1 accumulation in oral cancer cells. Manoalide also induces more annexin V expression in oral cancer Ca9-22 and CAL 27 cells than that of HGF-1 cells. Manoalide induces activation of caspase 3 (Cas 3), which is a hallmark of apoptosis in oral cancer cells, Ca9-22 and CAL 27. Inhibitors of Cas 8 and Cas 9 suppress manoalide-induced Cas 3 activation. Manoalide induces higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) productions in Ca9-22 and CAL 27 cells than in HGF-1 cells. This oxidative stress induction by manoalide is further supported by mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) production and mitochondrial membrane potential (MitoMP) destruction in oral cancer cells. Subsequently, manoalide-induced oxidative stress leads to DNA damages, such as γH2AX and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), in oral cancer cells. Effects, such as enhanced antiproliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, in manoalide-treated oral cancer cells were suppressed by inhibitors of oxidative stress or apoptosis, or both, such as -acetylcysteine (NAC) and Z-VAD-FMK (Z-VAD). Moreover, -targeted superoxide inhibitor MitoTEMPO suppresses manoalide-induced MitoSOX generation and γH2AX/8-oxodG DNA damages.

In addition, mitochondrial abnormalities have been frequently observed in muscle biopsy specimens of Pompe patients. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA, is so far the only available therapy. We evaluated glycolysis and basal respiration in primary human myoblasts from patients with Pompe disease and in mouse myoblasts from GAA knockout mice before and after alglucosidase alfa treatment.We tested patient-derived primary human myoblasts and immortalized GAA mouse myoblasts for GAA activity, glycolytic activity, and mitochondrial respiration before and after alglucosidase alfa treatment using enzyme activity assays and SeaHorse measurements.A significant reduction in glycolysis (30%) and in mitochondrial respiration (50%) was observed in both, human and mouse GAA-deficient myoblasts. Treatment with alglucosidase alfa resulted in partial recovery of both metabolic pathways with some variability in human myoblasts.Future assessments of treatment efficacy should include screening for the metabolic effects on both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in order to obtain a better read-out of the cellular energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449676>Biochemical pathway for the biosynthesis of the Cu center in bacterial cytochrome c oxidase.</a></h2><p>The di-copper center Cu is an essential metal cofactor in cytochrome oxidase (Cox) of  and many prokaryotes, mediating one-electron transfer from cytochrome c to the site for oxygen reduction. Cu is located in subunit II (CoxB) of Cox and protrudes into the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria or the mitochondrial intermembrane space. How the two copper ions are brought together to build CoxB·Cu is the subject of this review. It had been known that the reductase TlpA and the metallochaperones ScoI and PcuC are required for Cu formation in bacteria, but the mechanism of copper transfer has emerged only recently for the Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens system. It consists of the following steps: (a) TlpA keeps the active site cysteine pair of CoxB in its dithiol state as a prerequisite for metal insertion; () ScoI·Cu rapidly forms a transient complex with apo-CoxB; (c) PcuC, loaded with Cu and Cu , dissociates this complex to CoxB·Cu , and a second PcuC·Cu ·Cu transfers Cu to CoxB·Cu , yielding mature CoxB·Cu .

The cargo and surface proteins they carry are considered to define their biological activity, including their inflammatory properties. Monocyte to endothelial cell signaling is a prerequisite for the propagation of inflammatory responses. However, the contribution of microvesicles in this process is poorly understood.To elucidate the mechanisms by which microvesicles derived from activated monocytic cells exert inflammatory effects on endothelial cells.LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated monocytic cells release free  and microvesicles with mitochondrial content as demonstrated by flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western Blot, and transmission electron microscopy. Using RNAseq analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that both  directly isolated from and microvesicles released by LPS-activated monocytic cells, as well as circulating microvesicles isolated from volunteers receiving low-dose LPS-injections, induce type I IFN (interferon), and TNF (tumor necrosis factor) responses in endothelial cells. Depletion of free  significantly reduced the ability of these microvesicles to induce type I IFN and TNF-dependent genes. We identified -associated TNFα and RNA from stressed  as major inducers of these responses. Finally, we demonstrated that the proinflammatory potential of microvesicles and directly isolated  were drastically reduced when they were derived from monocytic cells with nonrespiring  or monocytic cells cultured in the presence of pyruvate or the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenger MitoTEMPO. and  embedded in microvesicles constitute a major subset of extracellular vesicles released by activated monocytes, and their proinflammatory activity on endothelial cells is determined by the activation status of their parental cells.

The DA oxidation can generate deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS) and highly reactive DA quinones (DAQ) to induce DA-related toxicity, which can be alleviated by DA oxidation suppressors, ROS scavengers, DAQ quenchers, and MAOB inhibitors. On the other hand, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-Keap1 and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) anti-oxidative and proliferative signaling pathways play roles in anti-oxidative cell defense and  biogenesis, which is implicated in DA neuron protections. Therefore, agents with capabilities to suppress DA-related toxicity including inhibition of DA oxidation, scavenge of ROS, detoxification of DAQ, inhibition of MAOB, and modulations of anti-oxidative signaling pathways can be protective to DA neurons. Accumulative evidence shows that tea or coffee consumptions and smoking are related to deceased PD prevalence with unknown mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the protective capabilities of tea polyphenols and other PD relevant agents to inhibit DA-related toxicity and protect against environmental or genetic factors induced DA neuron degeneration in vitro and in vivo. We find that tea polyphenols can significantly suppress DA-related toxicity to protect DA neurons. The tea polyphenols can protect DA neurons via inhibition of DA oxidation, conjugation with DAQ, scavenge of ROS, inhibition of MAOB, and modulations of Nrf2-Keap1 and PGC-1α anti-oxidative signaling pathways. The tea polyphenols with more phenolic hydroxyl groups and ring structures have stronger protective functions. The protective capabilities of tea polyphenols is further strengthened by evidence that phenolic hydroxyl groups can directly conjugate with DAQ. However, GSH and other sulfhydyl groups containing agents have weaker capabilities to abrogate DA oxidation, detoxify ROS and DAQ and inhibit MAOB; whereas nicotine (NICO) and caffeine (CAF) can only modulate Nrf2-Keap1 and PGC-1α pathways to protect DA neurons weakly. The tea polyphenols are identified to protect against overexpression of mutant A30P α-synuclein (α-syn) induced DA neuron degeneration and PD-like symptoms in transgenic Drosophila. Based on achievements from current studies, the excellent and versatile protective capabilities of tea polyphenols are highlighted, which will contribute and benefit to future anti-PD therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466050>Genipin attenuates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation via the PI3K/AKT pathway in acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>The protective effects of genipin against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) have been reported; however, the mechanism is unclear. Genipin performs its pharmacological effects via activation of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase  (AKT) signaling pathway. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in the protective effects of genipin against mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and inflammation in ALI. We constructed in vivo and in vitro models of LPS-induced ALI. PI3K/AKT signaling was inhibited using LY294002. Pretreatment with genipin increased AKT phosphorylation, indicating that PI3K/AKT signaling was upregulated. Genipin pretreatment prevented LPS-induced histopathological deterioration, increased pulmonary edema, and decreased oxygenation index, all of which were inhibited using LY294002. In addition, genipin pretreatment attenuated LPS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis, as indicated by improved mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulation of BAX (BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator), upregulation of BCL2 (BCL2 apoptosis regulator), inhibited the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and cell apoptosis. Genipin pretreatment inhibited the LPS-induced upregulation of AF4/FMR2 family member 4 (CHOP), glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) levels, indicating ERS suppression. Moreover, genipin pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced inflammation, indicating by blockade of nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling activation and reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 levels in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. LY294002 could inhibit these genipin-induced protective effects against apoptosis, ERS, and inflammation. Thus, genipin significantly activates PI3K/AKT signaling to ameliorate -dependent apoptosis, ERS, and inflammation in LPS-induced ALI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Results indicated that LFBE (YangSi No.3) inhibited proliferation of HT-29 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manners. The scanning electron micrograph illustrated that LFBE caused representative apoptotic trait and flow cytometric analysis suggested that LFBE brought about apoptosis by ceasing cell cycle at S phase. Western-blotting results indicated that LFBE promoted apoptosis was relevant to the regulation of apoptosis-related proteins, such as -cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and the release of Cytochrome-C from . PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Abundant studies have reported that extracts of fermented barley held the activities of anti-obesity, antitumor, and so on. However, little information about the comparison in the chemical profile and antiproliferation property among different barley varieties (namely, YangSi barley No.1, YangSi barley No.3, DaZhong 88-91, XiYin No.2) was observed. Results indicated that LFBE (YangSi No.3 barley) exhibited the best inhibitory property by inducing the apoptosis of HT-29 cells.

The objective of this study was to determine if quality of vitrified porcine immature oocytes was enhanced by coculturing with fresh oocytes during IVM. To distinguish fresh versus vitrified oocytes, we used two types of coculture systems: (a) transwell two-chamber coculture; () labeling and tracing fresh oocytes with CellTracker™ Green CMFDA during conventional culture. Coculture systems significantly accelerated meiotic progression of vitrified oocytes and significantly increased blastocyst formation rates following parthenogenetic activation and somatic cell nuclear transfer. Reactive oxygen species generation in vitrified oocytes was ameliorated by the coculture conditions, with no significant difference between fresh and vitrified oocytes for intracellular glutathione level. Both coculture systems significantly increased rate of normal mitochondrial distribution in vitrified oocytes, but did not affect fluorescence intensity of . The percentage of oocytes with normal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distribution and ER fluorescence intensity were significantly higher in vitrified oocytes cocultured with fresh oocytes. After 20 hr of IVM, mRNA expression of COX2, HAS2, PTX3, and TNFAIP6 remained significantly higher in cumulus cells derived from vitrified oocytes and coculture systems significantly decreased the expression of these genes. Additionally, coculture methods prevented the reduction of mRNA expression for BMP15, ZAR1, POU5F1, and DNMT3A in vitrified oocytes. In conclusion, oocyte quality and subsequent embryo development of vitrified porcine immature oocytes were significantly improved by fresh oocyte coculture during IVM.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31348723>Reaction of endogenous Coenzyme Q with nitrogen monoxide and its metabolite nitrogen dioxide.</a></h2><p> Coenzyme Q, incorporated in DOPC lyposomes or naturally present in liver bovine  or in human blood plasma, was reacted with nitrogen dioxide NO or with a NO/NO mixture.

The impairment of this process in iron/heme deficiency results in microcytic hypochromic anemia, the most prevalent anemia globally. Heme-regulated eIF2a kinase, also known as heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), is a key heme-binding protein that senses intracellular heme concentrations to balance globin protein synthesis with the amount of heme available for hemoglobin production. HRI is activated during heme deficiency to phosphorylate eIF2a (eIF2aP), which simultaneously inhibits the translation of globin mRNAs and selectively enhances the translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA to induce stress response genes. This coordinated translational regulation is a universal hallmark across the eIF2a kinase family under various stress and is termed the integrated stress response (ISR). Inhibition of general protein synthesis by HRI-eIF2aP in erythroblasts is necessary to prevent proteotoxicity and maintain protein homeostasis in both the cytoplasm and . Additionally, the HRI-eIF2aP-ATF4 pathway represses mTORC1 signaling specifically in the erythroid lineage as a feedback mechanism of erythropoietin-stimulated erythropoiesis during iron/heme deficiency. Furthermore, ATF4 target genes are most highly activated during iron deficiency to maintain mitochondrial function, redox homeostasis, and to enable erythroid differentiation. Thus, heme and translation regulate erythropoiesis through two key signaling pathways, ISR and mTORC1, coordinated by HRI to circumvent ineffective erythropoiesis. HRI-ISR is also activated to reduce the severity of   in the  murine model. Recently, HRI has been implicated in the regulation of human fetal hemoglobin production.

Therefore, to increase the knowledge of intracellular‑calcium and laser photon interaction, as well as to demonstrate differences in irradiation profiles with modern hand-pieces, we tested and compared the photobiomodulatory effect of 808 nm and 980 nm diode laser light by low- and higher-energy (60s, 100 mW/cm, 100 mW/cm, 500 mW/cm, 1000 mW/cm, 1500 mW/cm, 2000 mW/cm) irradiated with a "standard" (Gaussian fluence distribution) hand-piece or with a "flat-top" (uniform fluence) hand-piece. For this purpose, we used the eukaryote unicellular-model Dictyostelium discoideum. The 808 nm and 980 nm infrared laser light, at the energy tested directly affect the stored Ca homeostasis, independent of the mitochondrial respiratory chain activities. From an organism perspective, the effect on Ca-dependent signal transduction as the regulator of spore germination in Dictyostelium, demonstrates how a cell can respond quickly to the correct laser photonic stimulus through a different cellular pathway than the known light-chromophore() interaction. Additionally, both hand-piece designs tested were able to photobiomodulate the D. discoideum cell; however, the hand-piece with a flat-top profile, through uniform fluence levels allows more effective and reproducible effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

In PAH, histologically complex vaso-occlusive lesions in the pulmonary vasculature contribute to elevated PAP. However, the mechanisms underlying dysfunction of the microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) that comprise a significant portion of these lesions are not well understood. We recently showed that MVECs isolated from the rat Sugen/Hypoxia (SuHx) experimental model of PAH (SuHx-MVECs) exhibit increases in: migration/proliferation, mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production, intracellular calcium levels ([Ca]) and mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, quenching mtROS with the targeted antioxidant MitoQ attenuated basal [Ca], migration and proliferation; however, whether increased mtROS was associated with increased [Ca] and/or changes in mitochondrial morphology was not clear. To better understand this relationship, we measured changes in mitochondrial morphology at baseline and following inhibition of mtROS with the targeted antioxidant MitoQ and Ca entry, by inhibiting the Ca channel TRPV4. Quenching mtROS or inhibiting TRPV4 attenuated fragmentation in SuHx-MVECs. Conversely, inducing mtROS production in MVECs from normoxic rats (N-MVECs) increased fragmentation. Ca entry induced by treatment with the TRPV4 agonist, GSK1017920A, was significantly increased in SuHx-MVECs and was attenuated with MitoQ treatment. Basal and maximal respiration were depressed in SuHx-MVECs, and inhibiting mtROS but not TRPV4 improved respiration in these cells. Our data show that, in SuHx-MVECs, mtROS production promotes: a) TRPV4-mediated increases in [Ca]; ) mitochondrial fission and c) decreased mitochondrial respiration, suggesting an important role for mtROS in driving MVEC dysfunction in PAH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605012>Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation in blood cells is associated with disease severity and exercise intolerance in heart failure patients.</a></h2><p>Systemic oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of chronic heart failure (CHF). We tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) contributes to CHF progression. A total of 31 patients who had a history of hospital admission due to worsening HF were enrolled and grouped as having either mild CHF defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I-II or moderate-to-severe CHF defined as NYHA functional class III. ROS levels in PBMC  were significantly increased in CHF patients with NYHA functional class III compared to those with NYHA functional class I-II, accompanied by impaired mitochondrial respiratory capacity in PBMCs. ROS generation in PBMC  was positively correlated with urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, a systemic oxidative stress marker, in CHF patients. Importantly, mitochondrial ROS generation in PBMCs was directly correlated with plasma levels of -type natriuretic peptide, a biomarker for severity of HF, and inversely correlated with peak oxygen uptake, a parameter of exercise capacity, in CHF patients. The study showed that ROS generation in PBMC  was higher in patients with advanced CHF, and it was associated with disease severity and exercise intolerance in CHF patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251111>DIPK2A promotes STX17- and VAMP7-mediated autophagosome-lysosome fusion by binding to VAMP7B.</a></h2><p>Autophagosome and lysosome fusion is an important macroautophagy/autophagy process for cargo degradation, and SNARE proteins, including STX17, SNAP29, VAMP7 and VAMP8, are key players in this process. However, the manner in which this process is precisely regulated is poorly understood. Here, we show that VAMP7B, a SNARE domain-disrupted isoform of R-SNARE protein VAMP7, competes with SNARE domain functional isoform VAMP7A to bind to STX17 and inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Moreover, we show that DIPK2A, a late endosome- and lysosome-localized protein, binds to VAMP7B, which inhibits the interaction of VAMP7B with STX17 and enhances the binding of STX17 to VAMP7A, thus enhancing autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, DIPK2A participates in autophagic degradation of  proteins and alleviates apoptosis. Thus, we reveal a new aspect of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in which different isoforms of VAMP7 compete with STX17 and their regulation by DIPK2A. : DIPK2A: divergent protein kinase domain 2A; EEA1: early endosome antigen 1; GOLGA2: golgin A2; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; MAP1LC3B/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MFN2: mitofusin 2; MT-CO2: mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase II; PARP1: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RAB5A: RAB5A, member RAS oncogene family; RAB7A: RAB7A, member RAS oncogene family; REEP: receptor accessory protein; RTN4: reticulon 4; SNARE: SNAP receptor; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; STX17: syntaxin 17; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; VAMP7: vesicle associated membrane protein 7; VAMP8: vesicle associated membrane protein 8.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257986>Deregulated MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) is responsible for autophagy defects exacerbating kidney stone development.</a></h2><p>Kidney stone disease is a lifestyle-related disease prevalent in developed countries; however, effective medical treatment for the disease is not yet well established. As cellular damage in renal tubular cells (RTCs) is responsible for the disease, here, we focused on the role of macroautophagy/autophagy in RTCs. We found that autophagic activity was significantly decreased in mouse RTCs exposed to calcium oxalate (CaOx) monohydrate crystals and in the kidneys of ﻿GFP-conjugated MAP1LC3B (microtubule- associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) transgenic mice with CaOx nephrocalcinosis induced by glyoxylate. This caused accumulation of damaged intracellular organelles, such as  and lysosomes, the normal functioning of which is mediated by functional autophagy. An impairment of autophagy was also observed in the mucosa with plaques of CaOx kidney stone formers. We determined that the decrease in autophagy was caused by an upregulation of MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase), which consequently resulted in the suppression of the upstream autophagy regulator TFEB (transcription factor EB). Furthermore, we showed that an MTOR inhibitor could recover a decrease in autophagy and alleviate crystal-cell interactions and the formation of crystals associated with increased inflammatory responses. Taken together, we conclude that autophagy compromised by MTOR deregulation is a fundamental feature in the pathology of kidney stone formation, and propose that chemical inhibition of MTOR could be a prospective strategy for disease suppression. : ACTB: actin, beta; CaOx: calcium oxalate; CKD: chronic kidney disease; COM: calcium oxalate monohydrate; LGALS3/galectin-3: lectin, galactose binding, soluble 3; GFP: ﻿green fluorescent protein; GOX: glyoxylate; HE: hematoxylin and eosin; MAPLC3B: microtubule- associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NAC: N-acetyl-L-cysteine; ROS: ﻿reactive oxygen species; RTC: renal tubular cell; ﻿SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; tfLC3: tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3; 3-MA: 3-methyladenine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384538>Chrysophanol protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing cellular PARylation.</a></h2><p>The clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) in cancer chemotherapy is limited by its life-threatening cardiotoxic effects. Chrysophanol (CHR), an anthraquinone compound isolated from the rhizome of  L., is considered to play a broad role in a variety of biological processes. However, the effects of CHR׳s cardioprotection in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy is poorly understood. In this study, we found that the cardiac apoptosis, mitochondrial injury and cellular PARylation levels were significantly increased in H9C2 cells treated by Dox, while these effects were suppressed by CHR. Similar results were observed when PARP1 activity was suppressed by its inhibitors 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) and ABT888. Ectopic expression of PARP1 effectively blocked this CHR׳s cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury in H9C2 cells. Furthermore, pre-administration with both CHR and 3AB relieved DOX-induced cardiac apoptosis, mitochondrial impairment and heart dysfunction in Sprague-Dawley rat model.

Therefore, impact of NiO-NPs exposure (0, 5, 50, 200, 500 and 1000 mg kg soil) on the earthworm (Eisenia fetida) survival (at 28th day), reproduction (at 56th day), histopathology, ultrastructures, antioxidant enzymes and oxidative DNA damage was appraised in full life cycle study. Lower concentrations of NiO-NPs (5, 50 and 200) did not influence the survival, reproduction and growth rate of adult worms significantly. However, reproduction reduced by 40-50% with 500 and 1000 mg kg exposure, which also induced oxidative stress leading to DNA damage in earthworms. Ultrastructural observation and histology of earthworms exposed to higher NiO-NPs concentrations revealed abnormalities in epithelium layer, microvilli and  with underlying pathologies of epidermis and muscles, as well as adverse effects on the gut barrier.

The human protein denoted "family with sequence similarity 173 member " (FAM173B) was recently uncovered as a mitochondrial lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase (KMT) targeting the c-subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase (ATPSc), and was therefore renamed ATPSc-KMT. We here set out to investigate the biochemical function of its yet uncharacterized paralogue FAM173A. We demonstrate that FAM173A localizes to , mediated by a noncanonical targeting sequence that is partially retained in the mature protein. Immunoblotting analysis using methyllysine-specific antibodies revealed that FAM173A knock-out (KO) abrogates lysine methylation of a single mitochondrial protein in human cells. Mass spectrometry analysis identified this protein as adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), represented by two highly similar isoforms ANT2 and ANT3. We found that methylation occurs at Lys-52 of ANT, which was previously reported to be trimethylated. Complementation of KO cells with WT or enzyme-dead FAM173A indicated that the enzymatic activity of FAM173A is required for ANT methylation at Lys-52 to occur. Both in human cells and in rat organs, Lys-52 was exclusively trimethylated, indicating that this modification is constitutive, rather than regulatory and dynamic. Moreover, FAM173A-deficient cells displayed increased mitochondrial respiration compared with FAM173A-proficient cells. In summary, we demonstrate that FAM173A is the long-sought KMT responsible for ANT methylation at Lys-52, and point out the functional significance of Lys-52 methylation in ANT. Based on the established naming nomenclature for KMTs, we propose to rename FAM173A to ANT-KMT (gene name ).© 2019 Małecki et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266807>The mitophagy receptor Bcl-2-like protein 13 stimulates adipogenesis by regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis in mice.</a></h2><p>Metabolic programming of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) could influence the function of progenitor osteoblasts or adipocytes and hence determine skeletal phenotypes. Adipocytes predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation, whereas osteoblasts use glycolysis to meet ATP demand. Here, we compared progenitor differentiation from the marrow of two inbred mouse strains, C3H/HeJ (C3H) and C57BL6J (B6). These strains differ in both skeletal mass and bone marrow adiposity. We hypothesized that genetic regulation of metabolic programs controls skeletal stem cell fate. Our experiments identified Bcl-2-like protein 13 (Bcl2l13), a mitochondrial mitophagy receptor, as being critical for adipogenic differentiation. We also found that Bcl2l13 is differentially expressed in the two mouse strains, with C3H adipocyte progenitor differentiation being accompanied by a >2-fold increase in Bcl2l13 levels relative to B6 marrow adipocytes. Bcl2l13 expression also increased during adipogenic differentiation in mouse ear mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) and the murine preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. The higher Bcl2l13 expression correlated with increased mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis. Importantly,  knockdown significantly impaired adipocyte differentiation in both 3T3-L1 cells and eMSCs. Mechanistically,  knockdown reprogrammed cells to rely more on glycolysis to meet ATP demand in the face of impaired oxidative phosphorylation.  knockdown in eMSCs increased mitophagy. Moreover, Bcl2l13 prevented apoptosis during adipogenesis. Our findings indicate that the mitochondrial receptor Bcl2l13 promotes adipogenesis by increasing oxidative phosphorylation, suppressing apoptosis, and providing mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. We conclude that genetic programming of metabolism may be important for lineage determination and cell function within the bone marrow.© 2019 Fujiwara et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364751>TNF‑α‑mediated upregulation of SOD‑2 contributes to cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Intrinsic and acquired resistance of cancer to radio‑and chemotherapy is one of the major challenges in the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the resistance to cisplatin in ESCCs. Super dismutase [Mn], mitochondrial (SOD‑2), an important primary antioxidant enzyme located in , could regulate ROS production. Our previous study showed that tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α)‑mediated SOD‑2 through NF‑κ was involved in epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and migration in A549 cells. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify if TNF‑α mediated SOD‑2 upregulation is involved in cisplatin resistance in ESCC. It was identified that a higher expression of SOD‑2 in human ESCC samples was associated with TNF‑α expression and poor overall survival in patients with ESCC, suggesting that SOD‑2 may act as an oncogene in ESCC. To further confirm if TNF‑α could upregulate SOD‑2 to contribute to cell proliferation, the human ESCC cell line Eca‑109 was treated with TNF‑α in vitro. TNF‑α could upregulate SOD‑2 and induce cell proliferation in Eca109 cells, while blocking SOD‑2 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited TNF‑α‑induced cell proliferation. Upregulation of SOD‑2 by TNF‑α was inhibited by blocking the NF‑κ pathway, which suggested that SOD‑2 by TNF‑α/NF‑κ contributes to cell proliferation in Eca109 cells. Furthermore, it was observed that TNF‑α could induce cisplatin resistance in Eca109 cells, while transfection with SOD‑2 siRNA could significantly increase the chemosensitivity of ESCC to cisplatin. Therefore, the present results suggested that SOD‑2 may serve as an oncogene, and the upregulation of SOD‑2 by TNF‑α/NF‑κ may contribute to cisplatin resistance in ESCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536728>Neuroimmunological characterization of a mouse model of primary progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and effects of immunosuppressive or neuroprotective strategies on disease evolution.</a></h2><p>Progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) is a devastating disorder sustained by neuroimmune interactions still wait to be identified. Recently, immune-independent, neural bioenergetic derangements have been hypothesized as causative of neurodegeneration in PMS patients. To gather information on the immune and neurodegenerative components during PMS, in the present study we investigated the molecular and cellular events occurring in a Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In these mice, we also evaluated the effects of clinically-relevant immunosuppressive (dexamethasone) or bioenergetic drugs (bezafibrate and biotin) on functional, immune and neuropathological parameters. We found that immunized NOD mice progressively accumulated disability and severe neurodegeneration in the spinal cord. Unexpectedly, although CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes but not  or NK cells infiltrate the spinal cord linearly with time, their suppression by different dexamethasone treatment schedules did not affect disease progression. Also, the spreading of the autoimmune response towards additional immunogenic myelin antigen occurred neither in the periphery nor in the CNS of EAE mice. Conversely, we found that altered mitochondrial morphology, reduced contents of mtDNA and decreased transcript levels for respiratory complex subunits occurred at early disease stages and preceded axonal degeneration within spinal cord columns. However, the  boosting drugs, bezafibrate and biotin, were unable to reduce disability progression. Data suggest that EAE NOD mice recapitulate some features of PMS. Also, by showing that bezafibrate or biotin do not affect progression in NOD mice, our study suggests that this model can be harnessed to anticipate experimental information of relevance to innovative treatments of PMS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite use of multiple drugs, both chronic and acute inflammation still represent major health burdens. Inflammation produces highly reactive dicarbonyl lipid peroxidation products such as isolevuglandins which covalently modify and cross-link proteins via lysine residues. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with inflammation; however, its molecular mechanisms and pathophysiological role are still obscure. We hypothesized that inflammation-induced isolevuglandins contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and mortality. To test this hypothesis, we have (a) investigated the mitochondrial dysfunction in response to synthetic 15-E-isolevuglandin (IsoLG) and its adducts; () developed a new -targeted scavenger of isolevuglandins by conjugating 2-hydroxybenzylamine to the lipophilic cation triphenylphosphonium, (4-(4-aminomethyl)-3-hydroxyphenoxy)butyl)-triphenylphosphonium (mito2HOBA); (c) tested if mito2HOBA protects from mitochondrial dysfunction and mortality using a lipopolysaccharide model of inflammation. Acute exposure to either IsoLG or IsoLG adducts with lysine, ethanolamine or phosphatidylethanolamine inhibits mitochondrial respiration and attenuates Complex I activity. Complex II function was much more resistant to IsoLG. We confirmed that mito2HOBA markedly accumulates in isolated  and it is highly reactive with IsoLGs. To test the role of mitochondrial IsoLGs, we studied the therapeutic potential of mito2HOBA in lipopolysaccharide mouse model of sepsis. Mito2HOBA supplementation in drinking water (0.1 g/L) to lipopolysaccharide treated mice increased survival by 3-fold, improved complex I-mediated respiration, and histopathological analyses supported mito2HOBA-mediated protection of renal cortex from cell injury. These data support the role of mitochondrial IsoLG in mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. We conclude that reducing mitochondrial IsoLGs may be a promising therapeutic target in inflammation and conditions associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Adult immersion test (AIT) was performed by immersing the fully engorged female ticks for 2 min in different concentrations of amitraz (200, 250, 300, 350 ppm). Amitraz at the dose of 300 ppm, caused an adult tick mortality of 16.66 ± 6.80 per cent, inhibition of fecundity of 75.80 per cent and hatching of 50 per cent of ova laid by treated ticks. Histological changes in the ovaries of ticks collected after 24 h of treatment with amitraz (300 ppm), in comparison with controls (distilled water/methanol) were identified by microscopical examination of sections (4  μm) stained using haematoxylin and eosin. These changes included reduction in size and basophilia of stage I oocytes, presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles of various sizes around germinal vesicle of stage II oocytes, wavy basement membrane of stage III oocytes and reduction in size and number of mature stage IV and V oocytes. Electron microscopy was employed for understanding the structural changes in the ultrathin sections (60 nm) of ovaries. Ticks treated with amitraz showed major ultrastructural changes such as irregular nuclear membrane, crystolysis of  and detachment of external and internal layers of basal lamina of oocytes. The cDNA synthesized from the total RNA of whole ticks and ovaries of ticks treated with amitraz along with controls were used for relative quantification of Octopamine β receptor (OCTβ-R) expression based on the 2 method by quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as endogenous control. Down regulation of expression of OCTβ-R mRNA in the ovaries of amitraz treated ticks was observed compared to controls. Thus, the inhibition of fecundity observed in the ticks treated with amitraz can be attributed to the major structural changes and decreased expression of OCT β receptor mRNA induced by it in the ovary.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In conclusion, the ability of HBx to upregulate PA28γ levels via p53 activation, in a Ser-101-dependent pathway, is critical for the stimulation of HBV replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481398>Syntaphilin-Mediated Docking of  at the Growth Cone Is Dispensable for Axon Elongation .</a></h2><p> are abundantly detected at the growth cone, the dynamic distal tip of developing axons that directs growth and guidance. It is, however, poorly understood how mitochondrial dynamics relate to growth cone behavior , and which mechanisms are responsible for anchoring  at the growth cone during axon pathfinding. Here, we show that in retinal axons elongating along the optic tract in zebrafish,  accumulate in the central area of the growth cone and are occasionally observed in filopodia extending from the growth cone periphery. Mitochondrial behavior at the growth cone  is dynamic, with mitochondrial positioning and anterograde transport strongly correlating with growth cone behavior and axon outgrowth. Using novel zebrafish mutant lines that lack the mitochondrial anchoring proteins Syntaphilin a and , we further show that Syntaphilins contribute to mitochondrial immobilization at the growth cone. Syntaphilins are, however, not required for proper growth cone morphology and axon growth , indicating that Syntaphilin-mediated anchoring of  at the growth cone plays only a minor role in elongating axons.Copyright © 2019 Verreet et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652636>MicroRNA-29a Suppresses CD36 to Ameliorate High Fat Diet-Induced Steatohepatitis and Liver Fibrosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA-29 (miR-29) has been shown to play a critical role in reducing inflammation and fibrosis following liver injury. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and  DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Our data provide new insights that miR-29a can improve HDF-induced obesity, hepatocellular steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as highlight the role of miR-29a in regulation of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471731>Selection of suitable reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis of Begonia semperflorens under stress conditions.</a></h2><p>Begonia semperflorens (. semperflorens), belonging to the family Begoniaceae, has now been widely cultivated worldwide and is famous for its ornamental plants with colourful flowers and distinctive leaves. The selection of appropriate internal reference genes is very important to accurately determine target gene expression via quantitative real-time PCR. However, internal reference gene selection has never been conducted in . semperflorens. In this study, seven candidate reference genes of . semperflorens, including 18S ribosomal RNA (Bs18S), pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (BsPPR), actin-related protein 5 isoform X2 (BsACT), DNAJ homologue subfamily C member 17 (BsDNAJ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BsGAPDH), NAD-dependent malic enzyme 59 kDa isoform,  (BsNAD-ME), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase CYP26-2, chloroplast (BsCYP), which were obtained from our previous studies, were selected. The stabilities of these genes under stress conditions were analysed using geNorm and NormFinder. Validation of target gene expressions, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (BsPAL) and respiratory burst oxidase homologue D (BsRBOHD) under biotic and abiotic conditions, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (BsPAL), anthocyanidin synthase (BsANS), chalcone synthase (BsCHS), and flavanone-3-hydroxylase (BsF3H) under low temperature, using these seven internal reference genes for normalisation further confirmed the stabilities of the selected genes and indicated the need for reference gene selection for normalising gene expressions in . semperflorens. Of the seven candidate reference genes, the combination of BsACT, BsDNAJ, and BsNAD-ME was the ideal reference gene set for normalising gene expression in samples under biotic conditions. BsCYP combined with BsACT or BsGAPDH was the best reference gene pair under abiotic conditions. BsACT and BsPPR could be combined to normalise gene expression under low temperature. Our results will benefit future studies on gene expression in plants of Begoniaceae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613291>BODIPY-based selenides as fluorescent probes for rapid, sensitive and -specific detection of hypochlorous acid.</a></h2><p>Hypochlorous acid (HClO) is a powerful microbicidal agent in the innate immue system; however, abnormal HClO levels can cause tissue damage and many diseases. Thus, it is vitally important to develop facile, rapid and accurate analytical methods for the detection of HClO/ClO- in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we have constructed three meso-substituted BODIPY selenides with different hydrocarbyl groups (ethyl for BSe-Et, benzyl for BSe-Bz and phenyl for BSe-Ph) as fluorescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO-. All three non-fluorescent probes can sense HClO/ClO- to form fluorescent selenoxides by blocking the photo-induced electron transfer process. Their sensing properties display a clear relationship with the structure of the hydrocarbyl. The sensing reactivity is heavily dependent on the electron-donating ability of hydrocarbyls, with the order of the response time as BSe-Et (2 s) < BSe-Bz (5 s) ≪ BSe-Ph (>100 s). Both BSe-Et and BSe-Bz afford a large fluorescence response and very low detection limits (0.3 nM and 0.8 nM), and BSe-Bz displays a higher selectivity over BSe-Et. Finally, as a representative, BSe-Bz was successfully applied to the detection of exo- and endogenous HClO in living cells, and demonstrated to be a -localized fluorescent probe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262890>Amentoflavone Induces Apoptosis and Reduces Expression of Anti-apoptotic and Metastasis-associated Proteins in Bladder Cancer.</a></h2><p>Amentoflavone has been shown to be effective against a variety of cancer cells, but its role in bladder cancer remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether amentoflavone may induce toxicity effect of bladder cancer.Herein, we evaluated amentoflavone effects in a human bladder cancer cell line TSGH8301 in vitro.Amentoflavone caused significant cytotoxicity in TSGH8301 cells at a concentration as low as 200 μM. FAS/FASL-dependent extrinsic apoptosis and -dependent intrinsic apoptosis were observed in amentoflavone-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. Levels of several proapoptotic proteins, such as FAS, FAS-ligand and BAX (-cell lymphoma 2 associated X) were increased following amentoflavone treatment. Meanwhile, anti-apoptotic MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) and cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (C-FLIP) protein levels were reduced. Additionally, angiogenesis and proliferation-related proteins, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), urokinase-type plasminogen actvator (uPA) and cyclin D1 were diminished by amentoflavone.Amentoflavone induced toxicity of bladder cancer by inhibiting tumor progression and inducing apoptosis signaling transduction.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, MV in both animal and human studies has resulted in ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD). Sepsis may promote skeletal muscle atrophy in critically ill patients. Elevated high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) levels are associated with patients requiring long-term MV. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has been demonstrated to lengthen survival in patients with severe sepsis. We hypothesized that the administration of HMGB1 inhibitor EP or anti-HMGB1 antibody could attenuate sepsis-exacerbated VIDD by repressing HMGB1 signalling. Male C57BL/6 mice with or without endotoxaemia were exposed to MV (10 mL/kg) for 8 hours after administrating either 100 mg/kg of EP or 100 mg/kg of anti-HMGB1 antibody. Mice exposed to MV with endotoxaemia experienced augmented VIDD, as indicated by elevated proteolytic, apoptotic and autophagic parameters. Additionally, disarrayed myofibrils and disrupted mitochondrial ultrastructures, as well as increased HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein, oxidative stress, autophagosomes and myonuclear apoptosis were also observed. However, MV suppressed mitochondrial cytochrome C and diaphragm contractility in mice with endotoxaemia (P < 0.05). These deleterious effects were alleviated by pharmacologic inhibition with EP or anti-HMGB1 antibody (P < 0.05).

Our previous experience demonstrated that depending upon the genetic/biochemical background of cancer cells, rottlerin is able to induce both apoptotic and autophagic cell death, or dramatically disturb protein homeostasis leading to lethal cellular atrophy. In the current study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects and mechanisms of rottlerin against human amelanotic A375 melanoma cells. In this cell line, rottlerin exhibits its main and newest cytotoxic properties, that is, growth arrest, apoptosis induction, and translation shutoff. In fact, the drug, time-, and dose-dependently, markedly inhibited cell proliferation through cyclin D1 downregulation and induced apoptotic cell death as early as after 18 h treatment. Mechanistically, rottlerin triggered apoptosis by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Both pathways are likely activated by the downregulation of the antiapoptotic -cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein, which simultaneously affects mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes stability. Concomitantly to extrinsic apoptosis induction, the rottlerin-activated ER stress/eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) α axis blocked the translational apparatus. The altered proteostasis precluded the complete cells' rescue from death in the presence of apoptosis inhibitors.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351122>Effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure on neuronal differentiation and mitochondrial function in SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h2><p>Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) has dramatically increased in the last decades with expanding use of mobile phones worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of RF-EMF on neuronal differentiation and underlying signaling pathways involved in neuronal differentiation, neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial function. Differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells was performed using all-trans retinoic acid or staurosporine to obtain cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells at 935 MHz, 4 W/kg for 24 h did not alter the neuronal phenotypes quantitatively. Markers of the signaling pathways investigated, namely the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) 1 and 2 (p-Erk1/2) and protein kinase  (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β) and Wnt/β-catenin were not significantly affected by RF-EMF compared to sham. RF-EMF-impaired mitochondrial respiration in cells under glucose deprivation, but glutathione levels and mitochondrial fission and fusion markers were not altered. These findings indicate that RF-EMF might lead to an impairment of mitochondrial function that is only manifest at maximal respiration and additional stressors such as glucose deprivation. Further research is needed to investigate the effects of RF-EMF on mitochondrial function in detail because mitochondrial impairment is closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The nucleoside analogues resemble naturally occurring nucleosides and act by causing termination of the nascent DNA chain. These agents are generally safe and well tolerated as they are used by the viral, but not human polymerases in DNA replication. Actually, nucleoside analogues are a large class of agents that include drugs for cancer (cytarabine, gemcitabine, mercaptopurine), rheumatologic diseases (azathioprine, allpurinol) and even bacterial infections (trimethoprim). The nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV infection are often referred to as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, they have activity against both DNA dependent and RNA dependent DNA polymerases. They are believed to inhibit viral replication by several mechanisms, either by competitive inhibition of the viral polymerase or by DNA chain termination. Many of the antiviral nucleoside analogues are blocked at the 3’ hydroxyl group of the deoxyribonucleic acid, which results in failure of elongation of the nascent DNA molecule. Other antiviral nucleoside analogues are negative enantiomers (L-forms: lamivudine, emtricitabine, telbivudine) of the natural (D-form) nucleosides and interfere with replication, partially because of steric hindrance when they are taken up by the viral polymerase or added to the DNA molecule. Nucleoside analogues that are phosphorylated at the 5’ site are often referred to as nucleotide analogues, but this distinction is artificial as these agents (tenofovir, adefovir) are also nucleoside analogues. These features of the structure of nucleoside analogues are important because of the danger that they might be used by human polymerases and incorporated into RNA or DNA, which is the basis of the serious toxicities of the nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues can cause liver injury by several mechanisms. Most characteristic is a mitochondrial type of hepatic injury that is probably caused by the nucleoside analogue becoming incorporated into or blocking mitochondrial DNA synthesis by the mitochondrial gamma polymerase, leading to a depletion of  or decrease in their function. Mitochondrial injury can affect multiple tissues thereby causing myopathy, neuropathy, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and/or hepatic injury. The hepatic injury is characterized by accumulation of lactic acidosis, microvesicular steatosis and hepatic synthetic failure (LASH). Serum aminotransferase levels may be minimally elevated and jaundice arises late. The most dramatic example of hepatic mitochondrial injury occurred with the drug fialuridine (FIAU), a nucleoside analogue that was withdrawn after several fatalities due to hepatic failure, lactic acidosis and pancreatitis arising 2 to 3 months after initiation of therapy during phase 2 trials in humans. A similar, but rare and less dramatic and partially reversible hepatic mitochondrial injury has been linked to use of didanosine (dideoxyinosine: ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytine: ddC), stavudine (d4T) and less commonly to zidovudine (AZT).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575032>Role of Intracellular Na in the Regulation of [Ca] in the Rat Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Neurons.</a></h2><p>Transmembrane Ca influx is essential to the proper functioning of the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In the rat SCN neurons, the clearance of somatic Ca following depolarization-induced Ca transients involves Ca extrusion via Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) and mitochondrial Ca buffering. Here we show an important role of intracellular Na in the regulation of [Ca] in these neurons. The effect of Na loading on [Ca] was determined with the Na ionophore monensin and the cardiac glycoside ouabain to block Na/K-ATPase (NKA). Ratiometric Na and Ca imaging was used to measure the change in [Na] and [Ca], and cell-attached recordings to investigate the effects of monensin and ouabain on spontaneous firing. Our results show that in spite of opposite effects on spontaneous firing and basal [Ca], both monensin and ouabain induced Na loading, and increased the peak amplitude, slowed the fast decay rate, and enhanced the slow decay phase of 20 mM K-evoked Ca transients. Furthermore, both ouabain and monensin preferentially enhanced nimodipine-insensitive Ca transients. Together, our results indicate that in the SCN neurons the NKA plays an important role in regulating [Ca], in particular, associated with nimodipine-insensitive Ca channels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647776>Treatment of Neurodegeneration: Integrating Photobiomodulation and Neurofeedback in Alzheimer's Dementia and Parkinson's: A Review.</a></h2><p> A review of photobiomodulation (PBM) in Alzheimer's dementia is submitted. The addition of PBM in neurodegenerative diseases is a dual modality that is at present gaining traction as it is safe, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for treating neurodegeneration with photons that stimulate  increasing adenosine triphosphate and proteasomes increasing misfolded protein removal. Neurofeedback provides neural plasticity with an increase in brain-derived nerve factor mRNA and an increase in dendrite production and density in the hippocampus coupled with overall growth in dendrites, density, and neuronal survival.  Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. PBM and neurobiofeedback (NBF)address the multiple gene expression and upregulation of multiple pathogenic pathway inflammation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial disorders, insulin resistance, methylation defects, regulation of neuroprotective factors, and regional hypoperfusion of the brain. There is no human evidence to suggest a clinical therapeutic benefit from using consistent light sources while significantly increasing safety concerns.  A PBM test with early- to mid-Alzheimer's was reported in 2017, consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a small pilot group of early- to mid-dementia subjects under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Clinical Trial.  PBM-treated subjects showed that active treatment subjects tended to show greater improvement in the functioning of the executive: clock drawing, immediate recall, practical memory, and visual attention and task switching (Trails A&). A larger study using the CerebroLite helmet in Temple Texas again of subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled IRB-approved FDA Clinical Trial demonstrated gain in memory and cognition by increased clock drawing.  Next-generation trials with the Cognitolite for Parkinson's disease subjects will incorporate the insights regarding significant bilateral occipital hypocoherence deficits gained from the quantitative EEG analyses.

In this study, we demonstrate a strategy capable of eliminating metastatic cancer cells in a selective manner. Nucleus-targeting WO nanoparticles (WONPs) are conjugated to -selective mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) containing photosensitizer (Ce6) through a Cathepsin -cleavable peptide. In hepatocytes, upon the laser irradiation, the generated singlet oxygen species are consumed by WONPs, in turn leading to the loss of their photothermally heating capacity, thereby sparing hepatocyte from thermal damage induced by the laser illumination. By contrast, in cancer cells, the cleaved peptide linker allows WONPs and MSNs to respectively target nucleus and , where the therapeutic powers could be unleashed, both photodynamically and photothermally. This ensures the energy production of cancer cells can be abolished. We further assess the underlying molecular mechanism at both gene and protein levels to better understand the therapeutic outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330904>Application of ECIS to Assess FCCP-Induced Changes of MSC Micromotion and Wound Healing Migration.</a></h2><p>Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is an emerging technique for sensitively monitoring morphological changes of adherent cells in tissue culture. In this study, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were exposed to different concentrations of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) for 20 h and their subsequent concentration-dependent responses in micromotion and wound healing migration were measured by ECIS. FCCP disrupts ATP synthesis and results in a decrease in cell migration rates. To detect the change of cell micromotion in response to FCCP challenge, time-series resistances of cell-covered electrodes were monitored and the values of variance were calculated to verify the difference. While Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer can detect the effect of FCCP at 3 μM concentration, the variance calculation of the time-series resistances measured at 4 kHz can detect the effect of FCCP at concentrations as low as 1 μM. For wound healing migration, the recovery resistance curves were fitted by sigmoid curve and the hill slope showed a concentration-dependent decline from 0.3 μM to 3 μM, indicating a decrease in cell migration rate. Moreover, dose dependent incline of the inflection points from 0.3 μM to 3 μM FCCP implied the increase of the half time for wound recovery migration. Together, our results demonstrate that partial uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation reduces micromotion and wound healing migration of hMSCs. The ECIS method used in this study offers a simple and sensitive approach to investigate stem cell migration and its regulation by mitochondrial dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387002>Magnesium lithospermate  attenuates renal injury in 5/6 renal ablation/infarction rats by mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Apoptosis is closely interconnected with the severity of renal injury. Magnesium lithospermate  (MLB) extracted from Salviae miltiorrhizae radix showed a wide range of renoprotective effects. However, the underlying mechanisms under beneficial effects have not been elucidated. This study was conducted to investigate whether MLB could mediate renal protection and attenuate apoptosis by mitochondrial pathway. In the present study, the rat model of chronic renal failure (CRF) was established by the 5/6 renal ablation/infarction (A/I) operation. 28 days after the surgery, 30 rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, 5/6 (A/I) group and 5/6 (A/I) + MLB group. After 56 days of treatment, we detected the severity of kidney injury, the degree of mitochondrial bax oligomerization and cytochrome c release along with the expression of P53 protein. Our results showed that MLB markedly attenuated kidney injury and apoptosis in 5/6 (A/I) model rats with CRF. MLB effectively inhibited mitochondrial bax accumulation and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and down-regulated the levels of p53 phosphorylation and acetylation. These data showed that MLB could contribute to renal protection by inhibiting mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Here, we investigated the anticancer properties of UV-Tianjin on human osteosarcoma HOS cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. Apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by flow cytometry analysis. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were tested by western blotting. The results showed that UV-Tianjin concentration-dependently induced apoptosis in HOS cells. UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis was mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, which was confirmed by mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulation of -cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), -cell lymphoma-xL (Bcl-xL) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), upregulation of -cell lymphoma 2 associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist/Killer (Bak), as well as the cleavage of caspase-9 and -3. Further analysis showed that UV-Tianjin augmented the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, the extracellular-regulated kinase and p38, the major components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, as well as the generation of ROS. Moreover, UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis was remarkably attenuated by MAPK inhibitors and ROS inhibitor.

This study aimed to investigate if stem cells preconditioned with resveratrol show better therapeutic effect on the treatment of liver dysfunction in diabetic rats than stem cells without resveratrol precondition. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups including sham, DM (diabetic rats), DM + ADSC (DM rats receiving autologous transplantation of adipose-derived stem cells), and DM + pre-R-ADSC (DM rats receiving ADSC preconditioned with resveratrol). Compared with sham group, experimental results showed that DM group induced suppression of survival, suppression of Sirt1, activation of apoptotic, and activation of fibrotic pathways, leading to liver dysfunction. Autologous transplantation of ADSC (DM + ADSC) improved above pathways except for fibrotic signaling. By contrast, transplantation of resveratrol preconditioned ADSC (DM + pre-R-ADSC) significantly improved above pathways including fibrosis. Supplemental evidences suggest that resveratrol precondition increases ADSC viability under high glucose stress via Sirt1 and IGF1R expressions. Furthermore, increased secretion of IGF1 via paracrine route also confirmed in ADSC preconditioned with resveratrol. The experimental results imply that ADSC preconditioned with resveratrol shows potential in the treatment of liver dysfunction in DM patients with liver dysfunction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556366>Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter as a potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD).</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder is the leading cause of dementia in the world whose etiology is still unclear. AD was always related to aging though there have been instances where people at an early age also succumb to this disease. With medical advancements, the mortality rate has significantly reduced which also makes people more prone to AD. AD is rare, yet the prominent disease has been widely studied with several hypotheses trying to understand the workings of its onset. The most recent and popular hypothesis in AD is the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium homeostasis in the development of the disease though their exact roles are not known. With the sudden advent of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), many previously known pathological hallmarks of AD may be better understood. Several studies have shown the effect of excess calcium in  and the influence of MCU complex in mitochondrial function.

Fifty blood samples from suspected clinical cases from dogs, brought to the veterinary college clinics, were examined for presence of . gibsoni using conventional diagnosis by microscopic examination of Giemsa stained thin blood smears. In addition, species specific PCRs targeting ITS-1 region (BgITS-1 PCR) and nested PCR targeting 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Bg18SnPCR) were carried out. A 634 bp PCR fragment of . gibsoni cox3 gene was amplified in positive samples from three geographical locations of Satara, Wai and Pune in Maharashtra state of India. From analysis of the sequence of the . gibsoni cox3 gene, we found that the Indian isolate had 96-98% similarity to the isolate from Japan and China. Post sequencing, de-novo diagnostic primer pair for species specific amplification of 164 bp fragment of . gibsonicox3 was designed and the PCR was standardized. The diagnostic results of de-novo Bgcox3 PCR were compared with BgITS-1 PCR and Bg18S nPCR. Thin blood smears detected 22% (11/50) samples positive for small form of Babesia species. The BgITS-1 PCR detected 25% samples (15/50) as positive and Bg18S nPCR detected 80% (40/50) . gibsoni positive samples. The de-novo Bgcox3 PCR detected 66% (33/50) samples positive for . gibsoni (at 95% CI). The analytical sensitivity of cox3 PCR was evaluated as 0.000003% parasitaemia or 09 parasites in 100  μl of blood. The de-novo diagnostic cox3 PCR did not cross react with control positive DNA from other haemoprotozoa and rickettsia like . vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Trypanosoma evansi, Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys.

We focused on recognizing the effects of trace elements on hepatopancreas functional role. To this end, isopod specimens were exposed for 3 weeks to sediments contaminated with cadmium, copper, zinc, mercury, and nickel. Three concentrations were used in duplicate for each experimental condition. At the end of the experiment, metal body burdens were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results of the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) showed that the species A. granulatum was classified as a Cu macroconcentrator (BAF > 2) and a Zn deconcentrator (BAF < 2). Dose dependent morphological and histological changes were observed in the hepatopancreas cells using transmission electron microscopy. The predominant features were: microvillus border disruption, condensation of the cytoplasm with increasing endoplasmic reticulum, , lysosomes and granules that accumulated metals in  and S cells. The number of lipid droplets decreased especially after Cd, Zn, Hg, and Ni treatments. This study demonstrated that the terrestrial isopod A. gramulatum could be a good indicator of soil metal contamination.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275848>Curcumin Induces Apoptotic Cell Death via Inhibition of PI3-Kinase/AKT Pathway in -Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.</a></h2><p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a significant cancer of children resulting from the clonal proliferation of lymphoid precursors with arrested maturation. Although chemotherapeutic approaches have been achieving successful remission for the majority of cases of childhood ALL, development of resistance to chemotherapy has been observed. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are required to improve patient's prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the anticancer potential of curcumin in ALL. We tested a panel of -precursor ALL (-Pre-ALL) cell lines with various translocations after treatment with different doses of curcumin. Curcumin suppresses the viability in a concentration-dependent manner in 697, REH, SupB15, and RS4;11 cells (doses from 0 to 80 μM). Curcumin induces apoptosis in -Pre-ALL cell lines via activation of caspase-8 and truncation of BID. Curcumin treatment increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and resulted in a leaky mitochondrial membrane that led to the discharge of cytochrome c from the  to the cytoplasm, the activation of caspase 3 and the cleavage of PARP. Curcumin treatment of -Pre-ALL cell lines induced a dephosphorylation of the constitutive phosphorylated AKT/PKB and a down-regulation of the expression of cIAP1, and XIAP. Moreover, curcumin mediates its anticancer activity by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Finally, the suboptimal doses of curcumin potentiated the anticancer activity of cisplatin. Altogether, these results suggest an important therapeutic role of curcumin, acting as a growth suppressor of -Pre-ALL by apoptosis via inactivation of AKT/PKB and down-regulation of IAPs and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway via generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Our interesting findings raise the possibility of considering curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of -Pre-ALL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488234>Supplementation of Fermented Barley Extracts with Lactobacillus Plantarum dy-1 Inhibits Obesity via a UCP1-dependent Mechanism.</a></h2><p>We aimed to explore how fermented barley extracts with Lactobacillus plantarum dy-1 (LFBE) affected the browning in adipocytes and obese rats.In vitro, 3T3-L1 cells were induced by LFBE, raw barley extraction (RBE) and polyphenol compounds (PC) from LFBE to evaluate the adipocyte differentiation. In vivo, obese SD rats induced by high fat diet (HFD) were randomly divided into three groups treated with oral gavage: (a) normal control diet with distilled water, () HFD with distilled water, (c) HFD with 800 mg LFBE/kg body weight (bw).In vitro, LFBE and the PC in the extraction significantly inhibited adipogenesis and potentiated browning of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, rather than RBE. In vivo, we observed remarkable decreases in the body weight, serum lipid levels, white adipose tissue (WAT) weights and cell sizes of brown adipose tissues (BAT) in the LFBE group after 10 weeks. LFBE group could gain more mass of interscapular BAT (IBAT) and promote the dehydrogenase activity in the . And LFBE may potentiate process of the IBAT thermogenesis and epididymis adipose tissue (EAT) browning via activating the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent mechanism to suppress the obesity.These results demonstrated that LFBE decreased obesity partly by increasing the BAT mass and the energy expenditure by activating BAT thermogenesis and WAT browning in a UCP1-dependent mechanism.Copyright © 2019 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

When glass-bottom wells were used, cellular structures and organelles in cytoplasts could be examined directly by confocal microscopy. Nuclear envelope rupture did not occur probably due to mild centrifugation conditions used in this study. Addition of paclitaxel or doxorubicin completely blocked proliferation of residual nucleated cells; however, to our surprise, paclitaxel dramatically prolonged the survival of cytoplasts.

The decrease in the efficiency of the clearance systems in aging, as well as the presence of genetic mutations of proteins associated with cellular proteostasis in the familial forms of TDP-43 proteinopathies, suggest that a failure of these protein degradation systems is a key factor in the aetiology of TDP-43 associated disorders. Here we show that the internalization of human pre-formed TDP-43 aggregates in the murine neuroblastoma N2a cells promptly resulted in their ubiquitination and hyperphosphorylation by endogenous machineries, mimicking the post-translational modifications observed in patients. Moreover, our data identify  as the main responsible sites for the alteration of calcium homeostasis induced by TDP-43 aggregates, which, in turn, stimulates an increase in reactive oxygen species and, finally, caspase activation. The inhibition of TDP-43 proteostasis in the presence of selective inhibitors against the proteasome and macroautophagy systems revealed that these two systems are both severely involved in TDP-43 accumulation and have a strong influence on each other in neurodegenerative disorders associated with TDP-43.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392584>Increased reactive oxygen species production and maintenance of membrane potential in VDAC-less Neurospora crassa .</a></h2><p>The highly abundant voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) allows transit of metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Previous studies in Neurospora crassa showed that the LoPo strain, expressing 50% of normal VDAC levels, is indistinguishable from wild-type (WT). In contrast, the absence of VDAC (ΔPor-1), or the expression of an N-terminally truncated variant VDAC (ΔN2-12porin), is associated with deficiencies in cytochromes  and aa of complexes III and IV and concomitantly increased alternative oxidase (AOX) activity. These observations led us to investigate complex I and complex II activities in these strains, and to explore their mitochondrial bioenergetics. The current study reveals that the total NADH dehydrogenase activity is similar in  from WT, LoPo, ΔPor-1 and ΔN2-12porin strains; however, in ΔPor-1 most of this activity is the product of rotenone-insensitive alternative NADH dehydrogenases. Unexpectedly, LoPo  have increased complex II activity. In all mitochondrial types analyzed, oxygen consumption is higher in the presence of the complex II substrate succinate, than with the NADH-linked (complex I) substrates glutamate and malate. When driven by a combination of complex I and II substrates, membrane potentials (Δψ) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) under non-phosphorylating conditions are similar in all . However, as expected, the induction of state 3 (phosphorylating) conditions in ΔPor-1  is associated with smaller but significant increases in OCR and smaller decreases in Δψ than those seen in wild-type . High ROS production, particularly in the presence of rotenone, was observed under non-phosphorylating conditions in the ΔPor-1 . Thus, the absence of VDAC is associated with increased ROS production, in spite of AOX activity and wild-type OCR in ΔPor-1 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31320451>Defective bacterial phagocytosis is associated with dysfunctional  in COPD macrophages.</a></h2><p>Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study examined the effect of exogenous and endogenous oxidative stress on macrophage phagocytosis in patients with COPD.Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were generated from non-smoker, smoker and COPD subjects, differentiated in either granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (G-Mφ) or macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-Mφ). Alveolar macrophages were isolated from lung tissue or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Macrophages were incubated in ±200 µM HO for 24 h, then exposed to fluorescently labelled  or  for 4 h, after which phagocytosis, mitochondrial ROS (mROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) were measured.Phagocytosis of bacteria was significantly decreased in both G-Mφ and M-Mφ from COPD patients compared with from non-smoker controls. In non-smokers and smokers, bacterial phagocytosis did not alter mROS or ΔΨm; however, in COPD, phagocytosis increased early mROS and decreased ΔΨm in both G-Mφ and M-Mφ. Exogenous oxidative stress reduced phagocytosis in non-smoker and COPD alveolar macrophages and non-smoker MDMs, associated with reduced mROS production.COPD macrophages show defective phagocytosis, which is associated with altered mitochondrial function and an inability to regulate mROS production. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction may restore the phagocytic defect in COPD.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231548>Curcumin induced oxidative stress causes autophagy and apoptosis in bovine leucocytes transformed by .</a></h2><p>Bovine tropical theileriosis is a tick-borne disease, caused by  which is a protozoan parasite that resides within the -cells and macrophages.  is a unique parasite that can transform bovine leucocytes which leads to the cancer hallmarks in the infected cells. Previously, curcumin has been shown to possess multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. In this study, we demonstrated that curcumin inhibits the proliferation of -transformed bovine leucocytes by promoting apoptosis and autophagy. The transcriptome analysis of curcumin treated cells showed that the genes involved in cell death and autophagy are also differentially regulated. We further elucidated the mechanism of action of curcumin on  infected bovine cells. We found that curcumin induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which activated caspase 8 and destabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential leading to the release of cytochrome c from . This subsequently led to the activation of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage, finally leading to apoptosis in the infected cells. Furthermore, curcumin induced the process of autophagy which was characterized by the formation of acidic vesicular organelles, LC3B accumulation with lysosome inhibitor, E64d, and the presence of autophagosomes as visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Curcumin treatment suppressed the mTOR and increased the expression of autophagy-related proteins. We also found that N- acetylcysteine, an inhibitor of ROS, could rescue the infected cells from curcumin induced apoptosis and autophagy mediated cell death. Intriguingly, curcumin had no effect on uninfected bovine PBMCs. Altogether, these data suggest the therapeutic potential of curcumin against bovine tropical theileriosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527617>Identification and Molecular Characterization of Superoxide Dismutases Isolated From A Scuticociliate Parasite: Physiological Role in Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Philasterides dicentrarchi is a free-living microaerophilic scuticociliate that can become a facultative parasite and cause a serious parasitic disease in farmed fish. Both the free-living and parasitic forms of this scuticociliate are exposed to oxidative stress associated with environmental factors and the host immune system. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the host are neutralized by the ciliate by means of antioxidant defences. In this study we aimed to identify metalloenzymes with superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity capable of inactivating the superoxide anion (•O) generated during induction of oxidative stress. P. dicentrarchi possesses the three characteristic types of SOD isoenzymes in eukaryotes: copper/zinc-SOD, manganese-SOD and iron-SOD. The Cu/Zn-SOD isoenzymes comprise three types of homodimeric proteins (CSD1-3) of molecular weight (MW) 34-44 kDa and with very different AA sequences. All Cu/Zn-SODs are sensitive to NaCN, located in the cytosol and in the alveolar sacs, and one of them (CSD2) is extracellular. Mn- and Fe-SOD transcripts encode homodimeric proteins (MSD and FSD, respectively) in their native state: a) MSD (MW 50 kDa) is insensitive to HO and NaN and is located in the ; and ) FSD (MW 60 kDa) is sensitive to HO, NaN and the polyphenol trans-resveratrol and is located extracellularly. Expression of SOD isoenzymes increases when •O is induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and the increase is proportional to the dose of energy applied, indicating that these enzymes are actively involved in cellular protection against oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336757>Ailanthone Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Melanoma B16 and A375 Cells.</a></h2><p>Malignant melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer. Previous studies have shown that ailanthone has potent antitumor activity in a variety of cell lines. However, the anti-tumor effect of ailanthone on malignant melanoma remains unclear. To investigate the anti-tumor mechanisms of ailanthone in human melanoma B16 and mouse melanoma A375 cells, the cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, DNA content analysis, Hoechst 33258, and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were used to assess cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting was performed to evaluate the expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins and regulatory molecules. The results showed that ailanthone significantly inhibited melanoma B16 and A375 cell proliferation as well as remarkably induced cell cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase in B16 cells and the G2-M phase in A375 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation revealed that ailanthone promoted the expression of p21 and suppressed the expression of cyclin E in B16 cells or cyclin  in A375 cells through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In addition, ailanthone induced B16 and A375 cell apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mechanism. Further studies showed that ailanthone remarkably downregulated Bcl-2 and upregulated Apaf-1 and Bax, and subsequently increased mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and released cytochrome c from the  in B16 cells and A375 cells. Taken together, ailanthone induces cell cycle arrest via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway as well as cell apoptosis via the -mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.

After treatment of SNK-6 cells with different mass concentrations of bortezomib for 24 h, apoptosis was detected by AnnexinⅤ/PI flow cytometry; the expression of apoptosis-related protein Caspase-3, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and Bcl-2 and NF-κ signaling pathway key proteins P65 and P100/P52 were detected by Western blot.Bortezomib inhibited the proliferation of SNK-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( <0.05), and IC ( (2.87±0.06) ng/mL) at 24 h was lower than that at 48 h and 72 h ( <0.05). BAY11-7082 also inhibited the proliferation of SNK-6 cells with an IC = (9.73±0.36) μmol/L at 24 h. The combination treatment indicated that Z-VAD-FMK could attenuate the inhibitory effect of bortezomib on the proliferation of SNK-6 cells ( <0.05), while BAY11-7082 could enhance the inhibitory effect of bortezomib on the proliferation of SNK-6 cells ( <0.05). After treatment of SNK-6 cells with bortezomib for 24 h, apoptosis-related protein Caspase-3 cleavage, PARP activation, and Bcl-2 cleavage; NF-κ signaling pathway-related protein P65 phosphorylation level decreased, and P52 decreased.Bortezomib inhibits ENKTL cells proliferation by inhibiting NF-κ signaling pathway and induces apoptosis of ENKTL cells via -mediated caspase pathway.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496037>Sodium hydrosulphide restores tumour necrosis factor-α-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic dysregulation in HL-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α induces cardiac metabolic disorder and mitochondrial dysfunction. Hydrogen sulphide (H S) contains anti-inflammatory and biological effects in cardiomyocytes. This study investigated whether H S modulates TNF-α-dysregulated mitochondrial function and metabolism in cardiomyocytes. HL-1 cells were incubated with TNF-α (25 ng/mL) with or without sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS, 0.1 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, pro-inflammatory cytokines, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and fatty acid metabolism were evaluated through Western blotting.

However, a large disparity in frequency of European  (27%) versus Y chromosomes (1%) left unclear the magnitude of genetic exchange. We sought to quantify genomic introgression using 35 autosomal and 5 X chromosome ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) in conjunction with diagnostic Y-SNP markers to characterize the modern state of red foxes in the eastern US and to gain insight into the potential role of reproductive barriers. European admixture was highest in the ACP and apparently restricted to the central eastern US. We estimated only slightly higher (and nonsignificantly) European ancestry in autosomal than X chromosome markers. European ancestry from autosomal and X chromosome markers (36.4%) was higher than the corresponding mtDNA estimate (26.4%) in the ACP. Only 1 of 124 males (<1%) in the ACP had European Y chromosomes, which was similar to the neighboring regions, in which 2 of 99 (2%) males carried a European Y chromosome (the same haplotype). Although we could not rule out drift as the cause of low European Y chromosome frequency, results were also consistent with F1 male infertility. In the future, more extensive genomic sequencing will enable a more thorough investigation of possible barrier genes on the X chromosome as well as throughout the genome.© The American Genetic Association 2019.

However, its activity remains unknown in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. In this study, the impact of SA on insulin sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved insulin sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) and glucose tolerance test (GTT). SA restored plasma level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) by 90% and mRNA expression of  by 80% in the large intestine of HFD mice. In the mechanism, SA restored the gut microbiota profile, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucosal structure in the colon. A mitochondrial stress was observed in the enterocytes of HFD mice with ATP elevation, structural damage, and complex dysfunction. The mitochondrial response was induced in enterocytes by the dietary fat as the same responses were induced by palmitic acid in the cell culture. The mitochondrial response was inhibited in HFD mice by SA treatment.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced  release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new  vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361970>Modulation of complex II-energized respiration in muscle, heart, and brown adipose  by oxaloacetate and complex I electron flow.</a></h2><p>We recently reported that membrane potential (ΔΨ) primarily determines the relationship of complex II-supported respiration by isolated skeletal muscle  to ADP concentrations. We observed that O flux peaked at low ADP concentration ([ADP]) (high ΔΨ) before declining at higher [ADP] (low ΔΨ). The decline resulted from oxaloacetate (OAA) accumulation and inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase. This prompted us to question the effect of incremental [ADP] on respiration in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) , wherein ΔΨ is intrinsically low because of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). We found that succinate-energized IBAT , even in the absence of ADP, accumulate OAA and manifest limited respiration, similar to muscle  at high [ADP]. This could be prevented by guanosine 5'-diphosphate inhibition of UCP1. NAD cycling with NADH requires complex I electron flow and is needed to form OAA. Therefore, to assess the role of electron transit, we perturbed flow using a small molecule, 1-(3-acetamidophenyl)-2-(2-(4-methyl-2-(p-tolyl)thiazol-5-yl)ethyl)oxalamide. We observed decreased OAA, increased NADH/NAD, and increased succinate-supported mitochondrial respiration under conditions of low ΔΨ (IBAT) but not high ΔΨ (heart). In summary, complex II-energized respiration in IBAT  is tempered by complex I-derived OAA in a manner dependent on UCP1. These dynamics depend on electron transit in complex I.-Fink, .

The cells were exposed to UVB radiation following treatment with RES and/or CO-releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2). RES and/or CORM-2 upregulated HO-1 protein expression, accompanied by a gradual reduction of UVB-induced intracellular ROS levels. CORM-2 reduced intracellular ROS in the presence of tin protoporphyrin IX, an HO-1 inhibitor, indicating that the cytoprotection observed was mediated by intracellular CO and not by HO-1 itself. Moreover, CORM-2 decreased RES-stimulated mitochondrial quantity and respiration and increased the cytosolic protein expressions of radical-scavenging superoxide dismutases, SOD1 and SOD2. Taken together, our observations suggest that RES and intracellular CO act independently, at least partly, in attenuating cellular oxidative stress by promoting antioxidant enzyme expressions and inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in UVB-exposed keratinocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234346>Identification of  Mitochondrial Malate: Quinone Oxidoreductase Inhibitors from the Pathogen Box.</a></h2><p>Malaria is one of the three major global health threats.

In type A differentiated spermatogonia, the amount of GG in contact with  increased, but the extra-mitochondrial localisation of the mtrRNAs was not found either. In type  late spermatogonia, which are pre-meiotic cells, the GG/mitochondrion complexes were typically found in contact with the nucleus.

Until the onset of meiosis, which was determined by the observation of synaptonemal complexes in zygotene-pachytene spermatocytes I, the GG/mitochondrion complexes disappeared, but both types of mtrRNAs persisted in the cytoplasm of spermatids and spermatozoa.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Differentiation.

The exact mechanism of TR-inducing seizure is not clear but inhibition of the serotonin, GABA, and nitrous oxide (NOS) pathways are the commonly proposed mechanisms. Adenosinergic system has a crucial function in the modulation of seizure. Also, oxidative damage is an unavoidable effect of the seizure. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of the adenosinergic system on the seizure and oxidative stress biomarkers induced by TR using antagonist of the adenosinergic receptors in the Albino mice. For that purpose, generated clonic seizure, as seizure threshold, was evaluated by TR. Caffeine (CAF; 8 mg/kg, i.p.), a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors, was administered 1 hour before the seizure induction. The seizure threshold significantly increased by CAF-treated group when compared to TR group ( < 0.001). Oxidative stress biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species, protein carbonyl content, and lipid peroxidation significantly decreased and glutathione content significantly increased by CAF in brain  compared to the TR group, whereas oxidative biomarkers significantly increased in the TR group compared to the control group. The results of the present study suggested that the adenosinergic system is involved in seizure induced by TR and meanwhile, inhibition of adenosine receptors can decrease the TR seizure threshold and also decrease the induced oxidative damage in the brain .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431058>Coenzyme Q alleviates tacrolimus-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in kidney.</a></h2><p>The major side effect of tacrolimus (Tac) is nephrotoxicity. We studied whether supplementation of coenzyme Q, (CoQ) a potent antioxidant, can reduce Tac-induced nephrotoxicity  improving mitochondrial function. In an  study, CoQ reduced the production of Tac-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and abolished the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in proximal tubular cell line. Assessment of mitochondrial function revealed that CoQ decreased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial respiration rate increased by Tac, suggesting improvement of mitochondrial function to synthesize ATP with CoQ treatment. The effect of the CoQ  study was observed in an experimental model of chronic Tac-induced nephropathy. CoQ attenuated Tac-induced oxidative stress and was accompanied by function and histologic improvement. On electron microscopy, addition of CoQ increased not only the number but also the volume of  compared with Tac treatment only.

According to the World Health Organization, this growing trend would be partly linked to our environment, with around 20% of cancers stemming from exposure to environmental contaminants, notably chemicals like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are widespread pollutants in our environment resulting from incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic material, and thus produced by both natural and anthropic sources; notably benzo[a]pyrene ([a]P), i.e. the prototypical molecule of this family, that can be detected in cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust particles, occupational-related fumes, and grilled food. This molecule is a well-recognized carcinogen belonging to group 1 carcinogens. Indeed, it can target the different steps of the carcinogenic process and all cancer hallmarks. Interestingly, H dynamics have been described as key parameters for the occurrence of several, if not all, of these hallmarks. However, information regarding the role of such parameters during environmental carcinogenesis is still very scarce. The present review will thus mainly give an overview of the impact of [a]P on H dynamics in liver cells, and will show how such alterations might impact different aspects related to the finely-tuned balance between cell death and survival processes, thereby likely favoring environmental carcinogenesis. In total, the main objective of this review is to encourage further research in this poorly explored field of environmental molecular toxicology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Alterations of mitochondrial functionality are characteristic of these metabolic disorders. However, many questions remain to be clarified, namely how the interplay between the signaling pathways harbored in  contributes to the disease-related phenotype. Herein, we overview the role of  on the regulation of cell homeostasis through the production of ROS, mitophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Emphasis is given to the signaling pathways involving MnSOD, sirtuins and PGC-1α, which seem to contribute to FAOD phenotype, namely to multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). The association between phenotype and genotype is not straightforward, suggesting that specific molecular mechanisms may contribute to MADD pathogenesis, making MADD an interesting model to better understand this interplay.

Recently, we have found that they are highly toxic to mammalian cells. Here, we studied the effect of fusaricidin-type compounds (FTCs) on the membranes of mammalian cells. Ethanol extracts from  strains, RS10 and I/Sim, were fractionated and analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The effects of FTCs on mitochondrial functions and integrity were studied by standard methods: measurements of swelling, membrane potential (ΔΨ), respiration rate, cytochrome c release, and pore sizes. Superoxide flashes were registered by 3,7-dihydro-2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)imidazol[1,2-a]pyrazine-3-one (MCLA). Plasma membrane permeability was assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and ATP release. FTCs caused the permeabilization of the inner  membrane (IMM) to ions and low-molecular-weight (~750 Da) solutes. The permeabilization did not depend on the permeability transition pore (mPTP) but was strongly dependent on ΔΨ. Fusaricidins A plus , LI-F05a, and LI-F05b-LI-F07b permeabilized IMM with comparable efficiency. They created pores and affected mitochondrial functions and integrity similarly to mPTP opening. They permeabilized the sperm cell plasma membrane to ATP and PI. Thus, the formation of pores in polarized membranes underlays the toxicity of FTCs to mammals. Besides, FTCs appeared to be superior reference compounds for mPTP studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638601>Hyperuricemia and gout caused by missense mutation in d-lactate dehydrogenase.</a></h2><p>Gout is caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints when plasma uric acid levels are chronically elevated beyond the saturation threshold, mostly due to renal underexcretion of uric acid. Although molecular pathways of this underexcretion have been elucidated, its etiology remains mostly unknown. We demonstrate that gout can be caused by a mutation in LDHD within the putative catalytic site of the encoded d-lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in augmented blood levels of d-lactate, a stereoisomer of l-lactate, which is normally present in human blood in miniscule amounts. Consequent excessive renal secretion of d-lactate in exchange for uric acid reabsorption culminated in hyperuricemia and gout. We showed that LDHD expression is enriched in tissues with a high metabolic rate and abundant  and that d-lactate dehydrogenase resides in the  of cells overexpressing the human LDHD gene. Notably, the p.R370W mutation had no effect on protein localization. In line with the human phenotype, injection of d-lactate into naive mice resulted in hyperuricemia. Thus, hyperuricemia and gout can result from the accumulation of metabolites whose renal excretion is coupled to uric acid reabsorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404585>Matrine protects oligodendrocytes by inhibiting their apoptosis and enhancing mitochondrial autophagy.</a></h2><p>Stressed oligodendrocytes (OLGs) activate microglia to produce an inflammatory response, and the impairment of  further aggravates OLG damage, which is the earliest pathological change in multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Matrine (MAT), a tetracyclic quinolizine alkaloid derived from the herb radix sophorae flavescentis, has been shown to effectively ameliorate clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of MAT treatment need to be further studied. In the present study, we show that MAT effectively suppressed ongoing EAE, and significantly reduced the expression of caspase-3 and alpha -crystallin in OLGs, therefore lessen OLG apoptosis, microglial activation and inflammatory factors secretion. MAT treatment also reduced the content of cytochrome c and malondialdehyde, an oxidative stress marker, in the central nervous system. In contrast, the levels of autophagy-related proteins Beclin1, microtubule-associated protein l light chain 3 and glutathione peroxidase was upregulated, hence enhancing mitochondrial autophagy and alleviating the imbalance of the oxidation/antioxidation system caused by mitochondrial damage. Our research indicates that MAT is effective in treating EAE, at least in part, by protecting OLGs through inhibiting their apoptosis and enhancing mitochondrial autophagy.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, a great deal of progress has been made in developing selective and effective PI3K-targeted therapies on the basis of a vast amount of studies on the roles of specific PI3K isoforms and fine-tuned modulators of PI3Ks in a particular disease context. In particular, the pivotal roles of delta isoform of class I PI3Ks (PI3K-δ) in CD4-positive type 2 helper T cells-dominant disorders such as asthma have been consistently reported since the early investigations. Furthermore, there has been great advancement in our knowledge of the implications of PI3K-δ in various facets of allergic inflammation. This has involved the airway epithelial interface, adaptive T and  cells, potent effector cells (eosinophils and neutrophils), and, more recently, subcellular organelles (endoplasmic reticulum and ) and cytoplasmic innate immune receptors such as NLRP3 inflammasome, all of which make this PI3K isoform an important druggable target for treating asthma. Defining subpopulations of asthma patients with PI3K-δ activation, namely PI3K-δ-driven asthma endotype, may therefore provide us with a novel framework for the treatment of the disease, particularly for corticosteroid-resistant severe form, an important unresolved aspect of the current asthma management. In this review, we specifically summarize the recent advancement of our knowledge on the critical roles of PI3K-δ in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385000>Gene expression analysis of vastus medialis cells after tourniquet-induced ischemia during total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Postoperative quadriceps muscle strength was lowered after tourniquet application during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Furthermore, tourniquet application results in higher proteolytic activity within vastus medialis cells, without influence on the amount and function of . The effects of the commonly utilized intraoperative tourniquet on gene expression within the human skeletal muscle cells are barely examined. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the gene expression within the skeletal muscle cells after tourniquet-induced ischemia to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways.As part of a randomized, controlled, monocentric trial (Clinical-Trials.gov ) 20 patients, scheduled to undergo primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), were included. Written informed consent was received and the patients were randomly assigned to Group A (TKA with tourniquet) (n = 10) and Group  (TKA without tourniquet) (n = 10). A muscle biopsie of (5 × 5 × 5 mm) 125 mm were obtained from the vastus medialis exactly 60 min after performing the surgical approach. After preparation of a muscle homogenate, RNA extraction was performed (RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit Qiagen) and RNA integrity (RIN) was determined (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, RNA 6000 Pico Kit). Gene expression profiling was performed using a validated method (GeneChip™ Human Transcriptome Array 2.0; Affymetrix). Statistical analysis (SPSS-Version 24; SAS JMP10 Genomics, Version 6) included the number of significant DEGs (p < 0.05), the number of DEGs with relative difference > 25% and the number of significant pathway (p < 0.05). The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and the white blood cell (WBC) count were also perioperatively measured. The protocol was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee (File reference 2012-334N-MA).Tourniquet application resulted in a total of 3555 (13.8%) statistically significant DEGs within vastus medialis cells. 76 DEGs (29 upregulated, 47 downregulated) revealed a relative difference of more than 25%. Statistically significant changes occurred in 59 (25.8%) of 229 analyzed pathways. Furthermore, there was no clinically meaningful difference between the groups with regard to CRP and WBC count.Tourniquet induced ischemia results in significant changes of the gene expression within cells of vastus medialis including metabolism, genetic information processing and cellular processes. The identified altered expression of genes and pathways might serve as pharmacotherapeutical targets; although further research is needed to clarify the underlying biological processes.These findings add further knowledge and should raise the awareness of surgeons about the effects of tourniquet induced ischemia at the gene expression level. Additional high-quality research may be warranted to examine the short and long term clinical significance of the present data.Level I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659149>Tunneling nanotube-mediated intercellular vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.</a></h2><p>Intercellular communication within the bone marrow niche significantly promotes leukemogenesis and provides protection of leukemic cells from therapy. Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of  and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the biological role of the TNT-mediated vesicle exchange between stromal and leukemic cells, implicating the direct vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided protection of leukemic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671612>Successful Targeting of the Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer by Glucose-Conjugated 1,4-Naphthoquinones.</a></h2><p>Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains challenging due to the development of drug resistance. The Warburg effect describes the ability of cancer cells to consume larger amounts of glucose compared to normal tissues. We identified derivatives of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones to be active in CRPC and further synthetically modified them via glucose conjugation to increase selectivity by Warburg effect targeting. Mechanisms of action were examined by quantitative proteomics followed by bioinformatical analysis and target validation. Four synthesized molecules revealed the highest selectivity towards human CRPC cells, which correlated with higher GLUT-1 activity and expression. The compounds were able to induce pro-apoptotic signs and to inhibit the pro-survival processes and mechanisms of drug resistance (i.e., AR-signaling and autophagy). Proteome analysis suggested a disruption of the /oxidative phosphorylation, which was validated by further functional analysis: thus,  depolarization, elevated levels of cytotoxic ROS, an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as release of mitochondrial AIF and cytochrome C to cytoplasm were observed. In conclusion, glucose-conjugated 1,4-naphthoquinones show potent activity and selectivity in human CRPC exerted via mitochondrial targeting. The compounds can overcome drug resistance against current standard therapies and suppress pro-survival mechanisms. This unique combination of properties makes them new promising candidates for the treatment of CRPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446166>FAM134B improves preadipocytes differentiation by enhancing mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Family with Sequence Similarity 134, Member  (FAM134B) is a protein that known to be necessary for the long-term survival of nociceptive and autonomic ganglion neurons. Recent work has exhibited that FAM134B plays a pivotal role in autophagy-mediated turnover of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, tumor inhibition and lipid homeostasis. In this study, we provide mechanistic links between FAM134B and adipocyte differentiation. Here, we found that adipocyte-specific FAM134B overexpression mice are obese and have increased white adipose tissue (WAT) mass. Serum tests showed that they developed high glucose level and severe insulin resistance. In addition, they also exhibited enhanced autophagy and reduced  amount, suggesting the function of FAM134B to promote autophagy in adipocytes. Overexpression of FAM134B in 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes promoted autophagy and differentiation, while the effect could be inhibited after treatment with autophagyinhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Overexpressioncells also showed an early reduction of  number, while its autophagy flux level increased fast from differentiation day 2.

The distal tendons of PLT and SOL muscles were isolated in situ and individually attached to the force transducers to record the developed tension in response to stimuli (80 Hz tetanus train, 1.5 minutes) to the ipsilateral sciatic nerve. The fatigue resistance test (five sets separated by 2-minute rests) was evaluated in terms of tension attenuation (fatigue) from the initial to the last tension (A) during each set, attenuation of the initial () or last tension (C) in each set, as compared to the first set in the presence or absence of ischemia or h-LEH (10 mL/kg). While ischemia significantly enhanced fatigue only in PLT, h-LEH showed no effect regardless of the perfusion pattern (normal/ischemia) or muscle-type (PLT/SOL) during each set (A). In parameter (), set-by-set fatigue development was observed in PLT, whereas h-LEH-SOL showed a trend of advanced fatigue resistance. Such trends became clear in the parameter C (last tension), because h-LEH-SOL exerted, rather than decreased, the tension enhancement regardless of the presence or absence of ischemia, whereas there were no h-LEH effects in PLT. In addition, faster recovery of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide content in the muscle after 10 minutes of all fatigue tests was observed in h-LEH-SOL, while saline-SOL still showed a significantly higher value than that of control. These results suggested that additional O supply by h-LEH may accelerate the tricarboxylic acid cycle/electron transport chain in slow-type aerobic SOL muscle containing abundant  and contribute to the faster removal of muscle fatigue substances such as lactate.© 2019 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323957>Integrated Approach Reveals Role of Mitochondrial Germ-Line Mutation F18L in Respiratory Chain, Oxidative Alterations, Drug Sensitivity, and Patient Prognosis in Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant primary brain tumour in adults, with a dismal prognosis. This is partly due to considerable inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity. Changes in the cellular energy-producing mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRC) activities are a hallmark of glioblastoma relative to the normal brain, and associate with differential survival outcomes. Targeting MRC complexes with drugs can also facilitate anti-glioblastoma activity. Whether mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encode several components of the MRC contribute to these phenomena remains underexplored. We identified a germ-line mtDNA mutation (m. 14798T > C), enriched in glioblastoma relative to healthy controls, that causes an amino acid substitution F18L within the core mtDNA-encoded cytochrome  subunit of MRC complex III. F18L is predicted to alter corresponding complex III activity, and sensitivity to complex III-targeting drugs. This could in turn alter reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell behaviour and, consequently, patient outcomes. Here we show that, despite a heterogeneous mitochondrial background in adult glioblastoma patient biopsy-derived cell cultures, the F18L substitution associates with alterations in individual MRC complex activities, in particular a 75% increase in MRC complex II_III activity, and a 34% reduction in CoQ10, the natural substrate for MRC complex III, levels. Downstream characterisation of an F18L-carrier revealed an 87% increase in intra-cellular ROS, an altered cellular distribution of mitochondrial-specific ROS, and a 64% increased sensitivity to clomipramine, a repurposed MRC complex III-targeting drug. In patients, F18L-carriers that received the current standard of care treatment had a poorer prognosis than non-carriers (373 days vs. 415 days, respectively). Single germ-line mitochondrial mutations could predispose individuals to differential prognoses, and sensitivity to mitochondrial targeted drugs. Thus, F18L, which is present in blood could serve as a useful non-invasive biomarker for the stratification of patients into prognostically relevant groups, one of which requires a lower dose of clomipramine to achieve clinical effect, thus minimising side-effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628462>Mitochondrial miR-181a-5p promotes glucose metabolism reprogramming in liver cancer by regulating the electron transport chain.</a></h2><p>Liver cancer and other malignant tumor cells rely on the glycolytic pathway to obtain energy (i.e., the Warburg effect); however, the underlying mechanism is unclear.  are sites of oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The 13 constituent respiratory chain proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome (namely, mtDNA) play essential roles. We found that in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, 11 of the 13 mtDNA-encoded genes exhibited decreased mRNA levels and 5 genes displayed decreased protein levels, including the cytochrome  (mt-CYB) and cytochrome C oxidase II (mt-CO2) genes. Mitochondrial gene sequencing revealed abnormalities in the levels of a large number of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs). MicroRNA-181a-5p (mir-181a-5p), which potentially targets genes encoding mt-CYB and mt-CO2 protein, was screened out from 549 downregulated mitomiRs via bioinformatic analysis. After overexpression of mitomiR-181a-5p, mt-CYB and mt-CO2 levels were reduced in HCC cells, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) maintained by the electron transport chain (ETC) was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) was upregulated, accompanied by elevated glucose, lactic acid release, and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In vivo experiments confirmed that constitutive mitomiR-181a-5p expression caused reprogramming of glucose metabolism and promoted tumor growth and early lung metastasis in liver cancer. In summary, the present study reveals the important role of mitomiRs in glucose metabolism reprogramming in liver cancer, which is of considerable value in exploring new therapeutic targets for HCC.© The Author(s) 2019.

The SRB assay showed that the maximum growth inhibition rate of AVEAF on MCF-7 cell was 27.12 at 100 µg/ml.

AVEAF elevated intracellular ROS level in the MCF-7 cells which were reversed with -acetycysteine (2 mM) pretreatment indicating that AVEAF induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis via augmentation of intracellular ROS. Western blotting exhibited that AVEAF increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax while decreasing anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression which promoted the cleavage of caspase-9, PARP1, RIPK 1, and RIPK 3. Additionally, AVEAF exerted anticancer effect on tumor-bearing rats and the tumor inhibition rate is 50%.

Our method aggregates visual correspondences-motifs that are visually similar across different acquisitions-to infer changes on the parameters of pretrained models, and enable them to operate on new data. In particular, we examine the annotations of an existing acquisition to determine pivot locations that characterize the reference segmentation, and use a patch matching algorithm to find their candidate visual correspondences in a new volume. We aggregate all the candidate correspondences by a voting scheme and we use them to construct a consensus heatmap: a map of how frequently locations on the new volume are matched to relevant locations from the original acquisition. This information allows us to perform model adaptations in two different ways: either by a) optimizing model parameters under a Multiple Instance Learning formulation, so that predictions between reference locations and their sets of correspondences agree, or by ) using high-scoring regions of the heatmap as soft labels to be incorporated in other domain adaptation pipelines, including deep learning ones. We show that these unsupervised techniques allow us to obtain high-quality segmentations on unannotated volumes, qualitatively consistent with results obtained under full supervision, for both  and synapses, with no need for new annotation effort. 1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328124>Effect of Pectin on the Expression of Proteins Associated with Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Cell Senescence in HT29-Human Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p> dynamic is regulated by different proteins, maintaining a balance between fission and fusion. An imbalance towards mitochondrial fission has been associated with tumor cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to analyze whether pectin modifies the viability of human colon cancer cells and the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission. The human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 cells was growth in 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence and presence of pectin. Pectin reduced HT29 cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching a plateau at 150~300 μmol/L pectin. The presence of 200 μmol/L pectin reduced the expression of dynamin-related protein-1 and increased expression of the mitochondrial fusion-associated proteins mitofusin-1 and 2. Expression of cyclin B1, a protein involved in G2/M transition, was found decreased in pectin-incubated HT29 cells. Moreover, expression of p53 protein, the amount of p53 in the nucleous and β-galactosidase activity, which are all biomarkers for cellular senescence, were significantly higher in pectin-incubated HT29 cells than in HT29 cells incubated without pectin. Expression of the protein -cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) homologous antagonist/killer was increased in response to incubation with pectin. However, incubation with pectin did not affect expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein or Bcl-2, or the caspase-3 activity. Overall, we concluded that pectin reduces the viability of human HT29 colon cancer cells, which is accompanied with a shift in the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial dynamics towards mitochondrial fusion.

Encouragingly, and supporting the potential further application of Compound R6 as a tool for basic and medicinal research, a pharmacokinetics (PK) profiling study showed that Compound R6 is metabolically stable and can pass the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, Compound R6 accumulates in the brain of test animals via intravenous and intraperitoneal administration. Finally, we found that Compound R6 confers significant neuroprotective effects on a rat cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model, demonstrating its potential as a promising drug candidate for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412578>Mitochondrial DNA Variants in Patients with Liver Injury Due to Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs.</a></h2><p>Hepatotoxicity is the most severe adverse effect of anti-tuberculosis therapy. Isoniazid's metabolite hydrazine is a mitochondrial complex II inhibitor. We hypothesized that mitochondrial DNA variants are risk factors for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to isoniazid, rifampicin or pyrazinamide.We obtained peripheral blood from tuberculosis (TB) patients before anti-TB therapy. A total of 38 patients developed DILI due to anti-TB drugs. We selected 38 patients with TB but without DILI as controls. Next-generation sequencing detected point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA genome. DILI was defined as ALT ≥5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT ≥3 times the ULN with total bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN.In 38 patients with DILI, the causative drug was isoniazid in eight, rifampicin in 14 and pyrazinamide in 16. Patients with isoniazid-induced liver injury had more variants in complex I's NADH subunit 5 and 1 genes, more nonsynonymous mutations in NADH subunit 5, and a higher ratio of nonsynonymous to total substitutions. Patients with rifampicin- or pyrazinamide-induced liver injury had no association with mitochondrial DNA variants.Variants in complex I's subunit 1 and 5 genes might affect respiratory chain function and predispose isoniazid-induced liver injury when exposed to hydrazine, a metabolite of isoniazid and a complex II inhibitor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270171>mSphere of Influence: Finding a Direction-How Do  Know Where To Go?</a></h2><p>Lena Pernas works in the field of metabolism of infection.

Previously, we reported on endoplasmic reticulum stress and NAD depletion in AF, suggesting a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in AF progression. Here, we examined mitochondrial function in experimental model systems for AF (tachypaced HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes and ) and validated findings in clinical AF. Tachypacing of HL-1 cardiomyocytes progressively induces mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by impairment of mitochondrial Ca-handling, upregulation of mitochondrial stress chaperones and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration and ATP production. Atrial biopsies from AF patients display mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by aberrant ATP levels, upregulation of a mitochondrial stress chaperone and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. The pathophysiological role of mitochondrial dysfunction is substantiated by the attenuation of AF remodeling by preventing an increased mitochondrial Ca-influx through partial blocking or downregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and by SS31, a compound that improves bioenergetics in . Together, these results show that conservation of the mitochondrial function protects against tachypacing-induced cardiomyocyte remodeling and identify this organelle as a potential novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336911>Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Attenuates Autophagy to Ameliorate Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension through Drp1/NOX- and Atg-5/Atg-7/Beclin-1/LC3β Pathways.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, and the abnormal proliferation, apoptosis and migration of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, liraglutide, has been shown to prevent pulmonary hypertension in monocrotaline-exposed rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of liraglutide on autophagy, mitochondrial stress and apoptosis induced by platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB). PASMCs were exposed to PDGF-BB, and changes in mitochondrial morphology, fusion-associated protein markers, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were examined. Autophagy was assessed according to the expressions of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II, LC3 puncta and Beclin-1. Western blot analysis was used to assess apoptosis, mitochondrial stress and autophagy markers. Liraglutide significantly inhibited PDGF-BB proliferation, migration and motility in PASMCs. PDGF-BB-induced ROS production was mitigated by liraglutide. Liraglutide increased the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and decreased the expression of p-Yes-associated protein (p-YAP), inhibited autophagy-related protein (Atg)-5, Atg-7, Beclin-1 and the formation of LC3-β and mitochondrial fusion protein dynamin-related (Drp)1. Therefore, liraglutide can mitigate the proliferation of PASMCs via inhibiting cellular Drp1/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX) pathways and Atg-5/Atg-7/Beclin-1/LC3β-dependent pathways of autophagy in PAH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597406>A Diet Induced Maladaptive Increase in Hepatic Mitochondrial DNA Precedes OXPHOS Defects and May Contribute to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), an increasingly prevalent and underdiagnosed disease, is postulated to be caused by hepatic fat mediated pathological mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction is proposed to be involved, but it is not known whether this is a pathological driver or a consequence of NAFLD. We postulate that changes to liver mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are an early event that precedes mitochondrial dysfunction and irreversible liver damage. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the impact of diet on liver steatosis, hepatic mtDNA content, and levels of key mitochondrial proteins. Liver tissues from C57BL/6 mice fed with high fat (HF) diet (HFD) and Western diet (WD, high fat and high sugar) for 16 weeks were used. Steatosis/fibrosis were assessed using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) Oil Red and Masson's trichome staining and collagen content. Total DNA was isolated, and mtDNA content was determined by quantifying absolute mtDNA copy number/cell using quantitative PCR. Selected mitochondrial proteins were analysed from a proteomics screen. As expected, both HFD and WD resulted in steatosis. Mouse liver contained a high mtDNA content (3617 ± 233 copies per cell), which significantly increased in HFD diet, but this increase was not functional, as indicated by changes in mitochondrial proteins. In the WD fed mice, liver dysfunction was accelerated alongside downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mtDNA replication machinery as well as upregulation of mtDNA-induced inflammatory pathways. These results demonstrate that diet induced changes in liver mtDNA can occur in a relatively short time; whether these contribute directly or indirectly to subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction and the development of NAFLD remains to be determined. If this hypothesis can be substantiated, then strategies to prevent mtDNA damage in the liver may be needed to prevent development and progression of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251961>Mitochondrial signaling in inflammation-induced depressive behavior in female and male rats: The role of glucocorticoid receptor.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction can result from the interplay between elevated inflammatory markers and alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and can contribute to pathogenesis of major depression. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) could be associated with alterations in mitochondrial apoptotic signaling in the prefrontal cortex of male and female Wistar rats with depressive-like behavior. To that end, we measured LPS-induced alterations in the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in  and cytosol of PFC of female and male rats, as well as the levels of cleaved cytosolic PARP-1. We also measured the mitochondrial levels of GR and its phosphoisoforms pGR232 and pGR246, as well as the mRNA levels of two GR-regulated mitochondrial genes, COX-1 and COX-3. We discovered that although seven-day LPS treatment evoked depressive-like behavior and induced apoptosis in the PFC of both sexes, it affected apoptotic cascades in both sexes differently. In females the treatment initiated both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascade, while in males only intrinsic cascade was engaged. Alterations in intrinsic apoptotic pathway were more associated with GR alterations in males, where LPS treatment decreased levels of mitochondrial GR and increased pGR232/pGR246 ratio. Alterations in mitochondrial GR could be associated with changes in expression of genes involved in oxidative metabolism in the PFC of this sex, and could, in combination with elevated levels of BCL-2 and decreased levels of BAX detected in this cell fraction, mitigate the detrimental effect of LPS on  in male PFC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have shown that selenium deficiency and low protein(Pr) intake are the primary risk factors for Keshan disease.The relationship between the cardiac malfunction induced by these two risk factors and the -mediated apoptotic pathway is poorly understood.This study aimed to determine the effect of selenium deficiency and low protein intake on the -mediated apoptotic pathway.In the present study, 120 weaning Wistar rats were randomly fed one of six different diets. The myocardial tissue sections were deparaffinized in water and subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining. Mitochondrial changes in the myocardial tissue were observed and photographed using an H-7650 Hitachi transmission electron microscope. Levels of whole blood Se were measured using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Whole blood glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was measured using a glutathione peroxidase cellular activity assay kit. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total-anti-oxidizing-capability(T-AOC)and reactive oxygen species(ROS)levels in serum and myocardial tissue were measured using MDA, T-AOC and ROS kits. Apoptosis was detected by immunohistochemistry.Experimental results showed that the selenium-deficient diet decreased serum selenium levels and GSH-PX activity, which caused severe cardiac dysfunction. Importantly, the levels of MDA and ROS in serum and myocardial tissue defects were significantly increased, where as total-anti-oxidizing-capability(T-AOC) levels were dramatically decreased as a result of the combination of selenium deficiency and low protein intake (P<0.05).The levels of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 were enhanced, but the expression of -cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) was reduced (P<0.05).Our results suggest that selenium deficiency and low protein intake can cause oxidative stress in the myocardium and induce cell apoptosis via the -mediated pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Presently, scientists are developing other metal drugs as an alternative of cisplatin. In this paper, three new iridium(III) complexes [Ir(ppy)(adppz)](PF) (adppz = 7-aminodipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine; ppy = 2-phenylpyridine 1), [Ir(bzq)(adppz)](PF) (bzq = benzo[h]quinolone 2) and [Ir(piq)(adppz)](PF) (piq = 1-phenylisoquinoline 3) were synthesized and characterized. The complexes can effectively inhibit the cell colonies. The cytotoxicity in vitro of the complexes against A549, HepG2, SGC-7901, BEL-7402 and normal NIH3T3 cells was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole)-2,5-diphenyltetraazolium bromide (MTT) methods. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and Ca concentrations were assayed. The mitochondrial membrane potential, a release of cytochrome c and the expression of -cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family protein have been investigated. The data reveal that the complexes 1-3 can effectively inhibit the cell proliferation in A549 cells with low IC value of 3.2 ± 0.4 μM, 4.8 ± 0.5 μM and 1.2 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. The antitumor in vivo shows that complex 3 can inhibit tumor growth with an inhibitory rate of 76.34%. The studies on the mechanism indicate that these complexes cause apoptosis in A549 cell via a ROS-mediated lysosomal-mitochondrial dysfunction pathway. In addition, the interaction of the complexes with BSA was explored.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, HXKII blocks -dependent apoptosis by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c. HXKII overexpression is frequently observed in several types of cancer and confers chemoresistance to cancer cells. In the present study, we found that compared with cell lines generated from diffuse large--cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, cell lines with features of Burkitt lymphoma have higher levels of HXKII because of the activation of both c-MYC and HIF-1. Under normoxia, HXKII levels were correlated with the growth ability of each -cell lymphoma cell line. HXKII levels were further enhanced when the -cell lymphoma cells were cultured under hypoxia. The high levels of HXKII induced by hypoxia conferred cisplatin resistance in all tested -cell lymphoma cell lines. The HDAC inhibitor panobinostat significantly suppressed HXKII expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Importantly, panobinostat reversed the anti-lymphoma action of cisplatin, and this effect was diminished by hypoxia. These data suggest that HXKII plays different roles, including in the regulation of glycolysis and inhibition of apoptosis, depending on its expression levels. Furthermore, inhibition of HXKII expression by panobinostat may represent a new and attractive strategy to overcome cisplatin resistance.Copyright © 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

This ablates the bactericidal capacities of phagocytes through massive and unregulated conversion of cytosolic ATP into the key signaling molecule cAMP. We show that exposure of primary human monocytes to as low a concentration as 22.5 pM CyaA, or a low (2:1) multiplicity of infection by CyaA-producing  bacteria, blocks macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-driven differentiation of monocytes. CyaA-induced cAMP signaling mediated through the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) efficiently blocked expression of macrophage markers, and the monocytes exposed to 22.5 pM CyaA failed to acquire the characteristic intracellular complexity of mature macrophage cells. Neither M-CSF-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion nor accumulation of Golgi bodies, , or lysosomes was observed in toxin-exposed monocytes, which remained small and poorly phagocytic and lacked pseudopodia. Exposure to 22.5 pM CyaA toxin provoked loss of macrophage marker expression on  differentiated macrophages, as well as on primary human alveolar macrophages, which appeared to dedifferentiate into monocyte-like cells with upregulated CD14 levels.

We reveal a novel mechanism of potential subversion of host immunity, where CyaA at very low (22 pM) concentrations could inhibit maturation of human monocyte precursors into the more phagocytic macrophage cells. Furthermore, exposure to low CyaA amounts has been shown to trigger dedifferentiation of mature primary human alveolar macrophages back into monocyte-like cells. This unprecedented capacity is likely to promote survival of the pathogen in the airways, both by preventing maturation of monocytes attracted to the site of infection into phagocytic macrophages and by dedifferentiation of the already airway-resident sentinel cells.Copyright © 2019 Ahmad et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412237>Compromised Mitochondrial Protein Import Acts as a Signal for UPR.</a></h2><p>The induction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR) results in increased transcription of the gene encoding the mitochondrial chaperone HSP70. We systematically screened the C. elegans genome and identified 171 genes that, when knocked down, induce the expression of an hsp-6 HSP70 reporter and encode mitochondrial proteins. These genes represent many, but not all, mitochondrial processes (e.g., mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and mitophagy are not represented). Knockdown of these genes leads to reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and, hence, decreased protein import into . In addition, it induces UPR in a manner that is dependent on ATFS-1 but that is not antagonized by the kinase GCN-2. We propose that compromised mitochondrial protein import signals the induction of UPR and that the mitochondrial targeting sequence of ATFS-1 functions as a sensor for this signal.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney  was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF  due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin.

In the present paper, we make a review about the development of acupuncture intervention induced improvement of CIRI (such as reducing the infarction area, improving learning-memory ability and motor function) by regulating autophagy in animal studies. Outcomes showed that acupuncture intervention can function in 1) inhibiting CIRI-induced increase of the number of lysosomes and autophagic lysosomes, and relieving structural injury of , and reducing the number of autophagosome in the central region of the ischemic cerebral cortex tissue; 2) down-regulating the expression of microtubule-associated protein Ⅱ light chain 3 (LC3Ⅱ) and the ratio of LC3-Ⅱ/LC3-Ⅰ in the ischemic cerebral region, and 3) regulating the expression of Beclin 1 (autophagy-related gene), promoting the expression of P62 (autophagy-related adaptor protein). In addition, acupuncture can also regulate phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)- protein kinase  (AKT)- mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTOR) signaling at different time-points (down-regulation at the early stage and up-regulation at the later stage), and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mTOR- UNC51-like kinase-1 signaling to relieve cerebral ischemic injury.

However, the beneficial role of statins in mitochondrial protection in heart failure remains unclear.Rats were treated with angiotensin II (1.5 mg·kg ·day ) or co-administered simvastatin (oral, 10 mg·kg ) for 14 days; and then administration was stopped for the following 14 days. Cardiac structure/function was examined by wheat germ agglutinin staining and echocardiography. Mitochondrial morphology and the numbers of lipid droplets, lysosomes, autophagosomes, and mitophagosomes were determined by transmission electron microscopy. Human cardiomyocytes were stimulated, and intracellular ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ ) changes were measured by flow cytometry and JC-1 staining, respectively. Autophagy and mitophagy-related and -regulated apoptotic proteins were identified by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.Simvastatin significantly reduced ROS production and attenuated the disruption of ΔΨ . Simvastatin induced the accumulation of lipid droplets to provide energy for maintaining mitochondrial function, promoted autophagy and mitophagy, and inhibited -mediated apoptosis. These findings suggest that mitochondrial protection mediated by simvastatin plays a therapeutic role in heart failure prevention by modulating antioxidant status and promoting energy supplies for autophagy and mitophagy to inhibit mitochondrial damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. play a key role in mediating heart failure progression.

This changes can be exacerbated in the cancer patient. We also find modifications of the NMJ: dysfunctional , modifications in the innervation of muscle fibers and motor units, uncoupling of the excitation-contraction of muscle fibers, inflammation. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) compete with acetylcholine and prevent it from fixing itself on its receptor. Many publications reported guidelines for using NMBAs in the elderly, based on studies comparing old people with young people. No one screened frailty before, and thus, no studies are comparing frail elderly and non-frail elderly undergoing cancer surgery.Despite many studies about curarisation in the specific populations, and many arguments for a potential interest for investigation, but no studies investigated specifically the response to NMBAs in regard of the frailty-induced and age-related sarcopenia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451640>Chemoptogenetic damage to  causes rapid telomere dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in aging, inflammation, and cancer.  are an important source of ROS; however, the spatiotemporal ROS events underlying oxidative cellular damage from dysfunctional  remain unresolved. To this end, we have developed and validated a chemoptogenetic approach that uses a mitochondrially targeted fluorogen-activating peptide (Mito-FAP) to deliver a photosensitizer MG-2I dye exclusively to this organelle. Light-mediated activation (660 nm) of the Mito-FAP-MG-2I complex led to a rapid loss of mitochondrial respiration, decreased electron transport chain complex activity, and mitochondrial fragmentation. Importantly, one round of singlet oxygen produced a persistent secondary wave of mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide lasting for over 48 h after the initial insult. By following ROS intermediates, we were able to detect hydrogen peroxide in the nucleus through ratiometric analysis of the oxidation of nuclear cysteine residues. Despite mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and nuclear oxidative stress induced by dysfunctional , there was a lack of gross nuclear DNA strand breaks and apoptosis. Targeted telomere analysis revealed fragile telomeres and telomere loss as well as 53BP1-positive telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs), indicating that DNA double-strand breaks occurred exclusively in telomeres as a direct consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction. These telomere defects activated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated DNA damage repair signaling. Furthermore, ATM inhibition exacerbated the Mito-FAP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and sensitized cells to apoptotic cell death. This profound sensitivity of telomeres through hydrogen peroxide induced by dysregulated  reveals a crucial mechanism of telomere- communication underlying the pathophysiological role of mitochondrial ROS in human diseases.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of liver  in hepatoprotection of betulin using a rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis induced by ethanol administration (4 g/kg, intragastric) for 8 weeks. The treatment with betulin (50 and 100 mg/kg .w., intragastric) during this period attenuated the histological signs of steatohepatitis and lowered the serum and liver triglyceride contents, as well as the serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Betulin (100 mg/kg) decreased the liver/body weight ratio and inhibited the increase in the serum levels of TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ, and hyaluronic acid, demonstrating hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic potential. Betulin also inhibited the formation of superoxide anions in  and the end-products of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue, the amount of which was significantly increased in ethanol-treated rats. The disturbances in mitochondrial respiration, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and decreasing of mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activities in rats with steatohepatitis, were reverted by betulin administration. The increased susceptibility of  to Ca-induced permeability transition pore formation in the hepatitis group was improved in rats treated with betulin. In conclusion, betulin, having antioxidant properties, exerts a beneficial effect in the rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis via prevention of liver  dysfunction, which may be attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629811>Characterization of PHB in the gonadal development of the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus.</a></h2><p>Prohibitin (PHB) is an evolutionarily conserved multifunctional protein with ubiquitous expression.

PHB was localized with  and ubiquitin in the testis and ovaries. The PtPHB gene was found to contain an open reading frame of 825 bp, encoding a predicted peptide with 275 amino acids, sharing between 65.9% and 96.7% similarity with that of other species. The qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that the phb gene and PHB protein both expressed less in the testis and ovary than in other tissues, and the phb gene presented the lowest expression in the Z1 stage. Furthermore, the phb gene and PHB protein expression were different in the testis and ovaries at different developmental stages. PHB was mainly found to be co-localized with  and ubiquitin in cytoplasm and acrosome complex during spermatogenesis and in follicular cells during oogenesis. Interestingly, PHB- signals and ubiquitin signal were also found in oocytes. These results indicated that PHB might play important roles during spermatogenesis and oogenesis by regulating mitochondrial activities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Though novel combination chemotherapy of autophagy inducers with chemotherapeutic agents is extensively investigated, nanomedicine-based combination therapy for ACD remains in infancy. In attempt to actively trigger ACD for synergistic chemotherapy, here we incorporated autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAP) into 7pep-modified PEG-DSPE polymer micelles (7pep-M-RAP) to specifically target and efficiently priming ACD of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with high expression of transferrin receptor (TfR). Cytotoxic paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded micelle (7pep-M-PTX) was regarded as chemotherapeutic drug model. We discovered that with superior intracellular uptake  and more tumor accumulation of micelles , 7pep-M-RAP exhibited excellent autophagy induction and synergistic antitumor efficacy with 7pep-M-PTX. Mechanism study further revealed that 7pep-M-RAP and 7pep-M-PTX used in combination provided enhanced efficacy through induction of both apoptosis- and -associated autophagic cell death. Together, our findings suggested that the targeted excess autophagy may provide a rational strategy to improve therapeutic outcome of breast cancer, and simultaneous induction of ACD and apoptosis may be a promising anticancer modality.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

GB activates the proapoptotic  cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family member BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID) to switch on the intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway, leading to Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer- (Bak-) dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GB can also induce mitochondrial damage in the absence of BID, Bax, and Bak, critical for MOMP, indicating that GB targets the  in other ways. Interestingly, granzyme A (GA), GB, and caspase 3 can all directly target the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I for ROS-dependent cell death. Studies of ROS biogenesis have revealed that GB must enter the  for ROS production, making the mitochondrial entry of cytotoxic proteases (MECP) an unexpected critical step in the granzyme death pathway. MECP requires an intact ΔΨm and is mediated though Sam50 and Tim22 channels in a mtHSP70-dependent manner. Preventing MECP severely compromises GB cytotoxicity. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the canonical mitochondrial death pathway in order to put into perspective this new insight into the GB action on the  to trigger ROS-dependent cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311943>Different Antioxidant Efficacy of Two Mn-Containing Superoxide Anion Scavengers on Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-Exposed Cardiac Muscle Cells.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress due to excess superoxide anion ([Formula: see text]) produced by dysfunctional  is a key pathogenic event of aging and ischemia-reperfusion diseases. Here, a new [Formula: see text]-scavenging Mn complex with a new polyamino-polycarboxylate macrocycle (4,10-dimethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,7-diacetate) containing 2 quinoline units (MnQ2), designed to improve complex stability and cell permeability, was compared to parental Mn complex with methyls replacing quinolines (MnM2). MnQ2 was more stable than MnM2 (log K = 19.56(8) vs. 14.73(2) for the equilibrium Mn + L, where L = Q2 and M2) due to the involvement of quinoline in metal binding and to the hydrophobic features of the ligand which improve metal desolvation upon complexation. As oxidative stress model, H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation. MnQ2 and MnM2 (10 μmol L) were added at reoxygenation for 1 or 2 h. The more lipophilic MnQ2 showed more rapid cell and mitochondrial penetration than MnM2. Both MnQ2 and MnM2 abated endogenous ROS and mitochondrial [Formula: see text], decreased cell lipid peroxidation, reduced mitochondrial dysfunction, in terms of efficiency of the respiratory chain and preservation of membrane potential (Δψ) and permeability, decreased the activation of pro-apoptotic caspases 9 and 3, and increased cell viability. Of note, MnQ2 was more effective than MnM2 to exert cytoprotective anti-oxidant effects in the short term. Compounds with redox-inert Zn replacing the functional Mn were ineffective. This study provides clues which further our understanding of the structure-activity relationships of Mn-chelates and suggests that Mn-polyamino-polycarboxylate macrocycles could be developed as new anti-oxidant drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669372>Molecular characterization of a novel sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase from the razor clam Sinonovacula constricta and its expression response to sulfide stress.</a></h2><p>The razor clam Sinonovacula constricta is a commercial benthic bivalve, and burrows the deeper cave than the other buried benthic bivalves. Due to the little exchange of seawater and to anoxic conditions, S. constricta is exposed to considerable amounts of sulfide during low tide, but exhibits strong sulfide tolerance. Mitochondrial sulfide oxidation is a particular defense strategy against sulfide toxicity of sulfide-tolerant organisms, for which sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is the first key enzyme. In order to investigate the mechanism of sulfide tolerance in S. constricta, its SQR (designated as ScSQR), was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of ScSQR was 3698 bp and encoded 443 amino acids. The deduced ScSQR protein contained conserved FAD-binding domains, two cysteine residues, two histidines, and one glutamic acid, which are the essential elements for the catalytic mechanism of SQR. Subcellular localization analysis by the TargetP 1.1 prediction and the Western blot confirmed that ScSQR was only located in the . The response of ScSQR in the gill and liver of S. constricta were investigated during sulfide exposure (50, 150, and 300 μM sulfide) for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the time-course expressions of ScSQR protein in the S. constricta gill were detected when exposed to 150 μM sulfide by Western blot. The expression level of ScSQR increased significantly and showed a time-dependent pattern. In addition, under sulfide stress, the expression level of the gill was higher than that of liver. Together, our results suggest that ScSQR may perform important roles in protecting cells from sulfide stress by participating in mitochondrial sulfide detoxification and providing high sulfide tolerance to S. constricta.Copyright © 2019.

Although several mechanisms have been identified as responsible for selective degradation of , such as the PINK1-PRKN/PARKIN- and receptor-dependent pathways, aspects of the mechanisms and particularly the principles underlying the selection process of  remain obscure. Here, we addressed a new selection strategy in which the selective elimination of  is dependent on organellar topology. We found that populations of  undergo different topological transformations under serum starvation, either swelling or forming donut shapes. Swollen  are associated with mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and PRKN recruitment, which promote their selective elimination, while the donut topology maintains mitochondrial membrane potential and helps  resist autophagy. Mechanistic studies show that donuts resist autophagy even after depolarization through preventing recruitment of autophagosome receptors CALCOCO2/NDP52 and OPTN even after PRKN recruitment. Our results demonstrate topology-dependent, bifurcated mitochondrial recycling under starvation, that is swollen  undergo removal by autophagy, while donut  undergo fission and fusion cycles for reintegration.

Using C-labeled choline and C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and western blotting, we show increased  choline phospholipid (ChoPL) production and activation of PCYT1A (phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1, choline, alpha), the rate-limiting enzyme of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis, during autophagy. We also discovered that the loss of PCYT1A activity results in compromised autophagosome formation and maintenance in autophagic cells. Direct tracing of ChoPLs with fluorescence and immunogold labeling imaging revealed the incorporation of newly synthesized ChoPLs into autophagosomal membranes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  during anticancer drug-induced autophagy. Significant increase in the colocalization of fluorescence signals from the newly synthesized ChoPLs and mCherry-MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) was also found on autophagosomes accumulating in cells treated with autophagy-modulating compounds. Interestingly, cells undergoing active autophagy had an altered ChoPL profile, with longer and more unsaturated fatty acid/alcohol chains detected. Our data suggest that  synthesis may be required to increase autophagosomal ChoPL content and alter its composition, together with replacing phospholipids consumed from other organelles during autophagosome formation and turnover. This addiction to  ChoPL synthesis and the critical role of PCYT1A may lead to development of agents targeting autophagy-induced drug resistance.

Pulmonary hypertension was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of monocrotaline (60 mg/kg). MgSO (100 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered daily for 3 weeks, from the seventh day after monocrotaline injection. Adult male rats were randomized into monocrotaline (MCT) or monocrotaline plus MgSO (MM) groups ( = 15 per group); control groups were maintained simultaneously.

Levels of pulmonary artery wall thickening, α-smooth muscle actin upregulation, right ventricular systolic pressure increase, and right ventricular hypertrophy were lower in the MM group than in the MCT group (all  < 0.05). Levels of lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial injury, inflammasomes and cytokine upregulation, and apoptosis in the lungs and right ventricle were lower in the MM group than in the MCT group (all  < 0.05). Notably, the mitigation effects of MgSO on pulmonary artery wall thickening and right ventricular hypertrophy were counteracted by exogenous calcium chloride.

The aims of this study were to explore the cellular pharmacokinetics of GDL in whole cells and subcellular fractions, and detect cellular pharmacodynamics on the human SH-SY5Y cells induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R). Firstly, a simple, sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for assessing the amount of ginkgolide A (GA),  (GB) and K (GK) in cellular/subcellular samples. Then, phosphatidylserine and  membrane potential were assayed to evaluate the extent of apoptosis effect. The study showed that the cellular/subcellular accumulation of GA and GB were increased in a concentration-dependent manner; the levels of GA and GB in cytosol were the highest among these subcellular organelles. Meanwhile, GDL also attenuated the OGD/R-induced increases in the percentage of apoptotic and  membrane potential. In addition, verapamil increased the rate and amount of GA and GB entering cellular/subcellular compartments through inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity, and promoted the protective effect of GDL. The present study reports the cellular pharmacokinetics profiles of GA and GB in normal and OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cells in vitro for the first time, which provided valuable information for clinical safety application.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406682> host-specific (HSTs) toxins: An overview of chemical characterization, target sites, regulation and their toxic effects.</a></h2><p> causes pathogenic disease on various economically important crops having saprophytic to endophytic lifecycle.

To gain insight into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis in grasses, we examined leaf gas exchange, anatomy and ultrastructure, and tissue localization of glycine decarboxylase subunit P (GLDP) in nine Neurachninae species. We identified previously unrecognized variation in leaf structure and physiology within Neurachne that represents varying degrees of C3-C4 intermediacy in the Neurachninae. These include inverse correlations between the apparent photosynthetic CO2 compensation point in the absence of day respiration (C*) and a) chloroplast and mitochondrial investment in the mestome sheath (MS), where CO2 is concentrated in C2 and C4 Neurachne species; ) width of the MS cells; c) frequency of plasmodesmata in the MS cell walls adjoining the parenchymatous bundle sheath; and d) the proportion of leaf GLDP invested in the MS tissue. Less than 12% of the leaf GLDP was allocated to the MS of completely C3 Neurachninae species with C* values of 56-61 µmol mol-1, whereas two-thirds of leaf GLDP was in the MS of Neurachne lanigera, which exhibits a newly-identified, partial C2 phenotype with C* of 44 µmol mol-1. Increased investment of GLDP in MS tissue of the C2 species was attributed to more MS  and less GLDP in mesophyll . These results are consistent with a model where C4 evolution in Neurachninae initially occurred via an increase in organelle and GLDP content in MS cells, which generated a sink for photorespired CO2 in MS tissues.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In addition to its specific acetylcholine toxicity to insects, TMX was also found to be toxic to mammals. Moreover, oocytes are vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS production can override antioxidant defenses and produce oxidative stress and DNA damage that trigger apoptosis and necrosis in organisms. In this study, we exposed bovine oocytes to TMX during maturation. Microscopic examination showed that 1.6 mM TMX significantly inhibited maturation at the germinal vesicle (GV) and metaphase I (MI) stages. Immunofluorescence staining and enzyme activity analysis revealed that TMX induced a reduction in CDC25 and CDC2 activity. Furthermore, time-lapse tracking and immunofluorescence staining indicated the maintenance of cyclin  in the cytoplasm, persistence of Bub3 at kinetochores, and absence of actin caps after TMX-exposed oocytes reached the MI stage. In addition, metaphase II (MII) oocytes exposed to TMX showed disordered chromosomes and spindles. These oocytes accumulated excess ROS and showed significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptotic signals. Parthenogenetic embryos from these oocytes showed decreased percentages of morulae and blastocysts. These results indicate that TMX delays bovine oocyte progression to MI stage, blocks them at the MI stage, triggers disordered chromosomes and spindles at MII stage, and ultimately results in MII oocytes with poor cleavage ability and inhibited development to morulae and blastocysts.Copyright © 2019.

However, studies on NF-κ activity in mitochondrial function are much more limited and scattered throughout the literature. For example, in 2001 it was first published that NF-κ subunits were found  the , including not only IkBα and NF-κ p65 subunits, but also NF-κ pathway proteins such as IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, but not much follow-up work has been done to date. Upon further thought the lack of studies on NF-κ activity in mitochondrial function is surprising given the importance and the evolutionary history of both NF-κ and the mitochondrion. Both are ancient in their appearance in our biological record where both contribute substantially to cell survival, cell death, and the regulation of function and/or disease. Studies also show NF-κ can influence mitochondrial function from outside the . Therefore, it is essential to understand the complexity of these roles both inside and out of this organelle. In this review, an attempt is made to understand how NF-κ activity contributes to overall mitochondrial function - both inside and out. The discussion at times is speculative and perhaps even provocative to some, since NF-κ does not yet have defined mitochondrial targeting sequences for some nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and mechanisms of mitochondrial import for NF-κ are not yet entirely understood. Also, the data associated with the mitochondrial localization of proteins must be yet further proved with additional experiments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537648>Structural basis for the interaction of the chaperone Cbp3 with newly synthesized cytochrome  during mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly.</a></h2><p>Assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain requires the coordinated synthesis of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded subunits, redox co-factor acquisition, and correct joining of the subunits to form functional complexes. The conserved Cbp3-Cbp6 chaperone complex binds newly synthesized cytochrome  and supports the ordered acquisition of the heme co-factors. Moreover, it functions as a translational activator by interacting with the mitoribosome. Cbp3 consists of two distinct domains, an N-terminal domain present in mitochondrial Cbp3 homologs, and a highly conserved C-terminal domain comprising a ubiquinol-cytochrome  chaperone region. Here, we solved the crystal structure of this C-terminal domain from a bacterial homolog at 1.4 Å resolution, revealing a unique all-helical fold. This structure allowed mapping of the interaction sites of yeast Cbp3 with Cbp6 and cytochrome  via site-specific photo-crosslinking. We propose that mitochondrial Cbp3 homologs carry an N-terminal extension that positions the conserved C-terminal domain at the ribosomal tunnel exit for an efficient interaction with its substrate, the newly synthesized cytochrome  protein.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600935>Nanoparticulated Honokiol Mitigates Cisplatin-Induced Chronic Kidney Injury by Maintaining  Antioxidant Capacity and Reducing Caspase 3-Associated Cellular Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Cisplatin is a potent anti-cancer drug, however, its accompanied organ-toxicity hampers its clinical applications. Cisplatin-associated kidney injury is known to result from its accumulation in the renal tubule with excessive generation of reactive oxygen species. In this study, we encapsulated honokiol, a natural lipophilic polyphenol constituent extracted from  into nano-sized liposomes (nanosome honokiol) and examined the in vivo countering effects on cisplatin-induced renal injury. We observed that 5 mg/kg body weight. nanosome honokiol was the lowest effective dosage to efficiently restore renal functions of cisplatin-treated animals. The improvement is likely due the maintenance of cellular localization of cytochrome c and thus preserves  integrity and their redox activity, which as a consequence, reduced cellular oxidative stress and caspase 3-associated apoptosis. These improvements at the cellular level are later reflected on the observed reduction of kidney inflammation and fibrosis. In agreement with our earlier in vitro study showing protective effects of honokiol on kidney cell lines, we demonstrated further in the current study, that nanosuspension-formulated honokiol provides protective effects against cisplatin-induced chronic kidney damages in vivo.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated , prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336123>Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Cyclophilins Block Opening of the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore and Protect Mice From Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.</a></h2><p>Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury is a complication of liver surgery that involves mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Cyclophilin D (PPIF or CypD) is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that regulates mPTP opening in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We investigated whether and how recently created small-molecule inhibitors of CypD prevent opening of the mPTP in hepatocytes and the resulting effects in cell models and livers of mice undergoing ischemia/reperfusion injury.We measured the activity of 9 small-molecule inhibitors of cyclophilins in an assay of CypD activity. The effects of the small-molecule CypD inhibitors or vehicle on mPTP opening were assessed by measuring mitochondrial swelling and calcium retention in isolated liver  from C57BL/6J (wild-type) and Ppif (CypD knockout) mice and in primary mouse and human hepatocytes by fluorescence microscopy. We induced ischemia/reperfusion injury in livers of mice given a small-molecule CypD inhibitor or vehicle before and during reperfusion and collected samples of blood and liver for histologic analysis.The compounds inhibited peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration values, 0.2-16.2 μmol/L) and, as a result, calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling, by preventing mPTP opening (half maximal inhibitory concentration values, 1.4-132 μmol/L) in a concentration-dependent manner. The most potent inhibitor (C31) bound CypD with high affinity and inhibited swelling in  from livers of wild-type and Ppif mice (indicating an additional, CypD-independent effect on mPTP opening) and in primary human and mouse hepatocytes. Administration of C31 in mice with ischemia/reperfusion injury before and during reperfusion restored hepatic calcium retention capacity and oxidative phosphorylation parameters and reduced liver damage compared with vehicle.Recently created small-molecule inhibitors of CypD reduced calcium-induced swelling in  from mouse and human liver tissues. Administration of these compounds to mice during ischemia/reperfusion restored hepatic calcium retention capacity and oxidative phosphorylation parameters and reduced liver damage. These compounds might be developed to protect patients from ischemia/reperfusion injury after liver surgery or for other hepatic or nonhepatic disorders related to abnormal mPTP opening.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

This study was further extended to identify the toxicity of AgNPs using an animal model. Interestingly, we observed that A549 cells treated with AgNPs resulted in G/M arrest and ultimately leads to induction of apoptosis cell death. Moreover, gene analysis demonstrated that diminished expression of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic (Bax) mitochondrial genes. The alterations in the gene pattern may interrupt of mitochondrial membrane potential which facilitates the releasing of cytochrome c (cyt c) into cytosol. The cyt c act as a key molecule for activation of caspases (9 and 3) to initiate intrinsic apoptotic signaling cell death process. The histological analysis proven the application of AgNPs in nanomedicine is quietly harmless and would not cause any discernible stress like swelling and inflammation to the organs of mice.

This is the first publication about optical characterization, concentration detection and photodegradation of 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG, either in biological or in vitro applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299273>Genetically targeted fluorescent probes reveal dynamic calcium responses to adrenergic signaling in multiple cardiomyocyte compartments.</a></h2><p>Calcium (Ca), an important second messenger, regulates many cellular activities and varies spatiotemporally within the cell. Conventional methods to monitor Ca changes, such as synthetic Ca indicators, are not targetable, while genetically encoded Ca indicators (GECI) can be precisely directed to cellular compartments. GECIs are chimeric proteins composed of calmodulin (or other proteins that change conformation on Ca binding) coupled with two fluorescent proteins that come closer together after an increase in [Ca], and enhance Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that allows for ratiometric [Ca] assessment. Here, adult rat ventricular myocytes were transfected with specifically targeted calmodulin-based GECIs and Ca responses to a physiological stimulus, norepinephrine (NE, 10 μM), were observed in a) sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), ) , c) the space between the  and SR, termed the  Associated Membrane space (MAM) and d) cytosol for 10 min after stimulation. In SR and , NE increased the [Ca] ratio by 17% and by 8%, respectively. In the MAM the [Ca] ratio decreased by 16%, while in cytosol [Ca] remained unchanged. In conclusion, adrenergic stimulation causes distinct responses in the cardiomyocyte SR,  and MAM. Additionally, our work provides a toolkit-update for targeted [Ca] measurements in multiple cellular compartments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been in the spotlight since FDA regulatory approval was granted to several photosensitizers worldwide. Nevertheless, there are still strong limitations in the targeting specificity that is vital to prevent systemic toxicity. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel bimodal oxime conjugate composed of a photosensitizing drug, red-emitting pheophorbide a, and nandrolone (NT), a steroid specifically binding the androgen receptor (AR) commonly overexpressed in various tumors. We characterized the physico-chemical properties of the NT-pheophorbide a conjugate (NT-Pba) and singlet oxygen generation. Because light-triggered therapies have the potential to provide important advances in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancer, the biological potential of this novel specifically-targeted photosensitizer was assessed in prostatic cancer cell lines in vitro using an AR-positive (LNCaP) and an AR-negative/positive cell line (PC-3). U-2 OS cells, both with and without stable AR expression, were used as a second cell line model. Interestingly, we found that the NT-Pba conjugate was not only photodynamically active and AR-specific, but also that its phototoxic effect was more pronounced compared to pristine pheophorbide a. We also examined the intracellular localization of NT-Pba. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy provided clear evidence that the NT-Pba conjugate localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and . Moreover, we performed a competitive localization study with the excess of nonfluorescent NT, which was able to displace fluorescent NT-Pba from the cell interior, thereby further confirming the binding specificity. The oxime ether bond degradation was assayed in living cells by both real-time microscopy and a steroid receptor reporter assay using AR U-2 OS cells. Thus, NT-Pba is a promising candidate for both the selective targeting and eradication of AR-positive malignant cells by photodynamic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344428>Perturbed ovarian and uterine glucocorticoid receptor signaling accompanies the balanced regulation of mitochondrial function and NFκ-mediated inflammation under conditions of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine whether glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, mitochondrial function, and local inflammation in the ovary and uterus are intrinsically different in rats with hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance compared to controls.Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to daily injections of human chorionic gonadotropin and/or insulin.In both the ovary and the uterus, decreased expression of the two GR isoforms was concurrent with increased expression of Fkbp51 but not Fkbp52 mRNA in hCG + insulin-treated rats. However, these rats exhibited contrasting regulation of Hsd11b1 and Hsd11b2 mRNAs in the two tissues. Further, the expression of several oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins decreased in the ovary and uterus following hCG and insulin stimulation, in contrast to increased expression of many genes involved in mitochondrial function and homeostasis. Additionally, hCG + insulin-treated rats showed increased expression of ovarian and uterine NFκ signaling proteins and Tnfaip3 mRNA. The mRNA expression of Il1b, Il6, and Mmp2 was decreased in both tissues, while the mRNA expression of Tnfa, Ccl2, Ccl5, and Mmp3 was increased in the uterus. Ovaries and uteri from animals co-treated with hCG and insulin showed increased collagen deposition compared to controls.Our observations suggest that hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance disrupt ovarian and uterine GR activation and trigger compensatory or adaptive effects for mitochondrial homeostasis, allowing tissue-level maintenance of mitochondrial function in order to limit ovarian and uterine dysfunction. Our study also suggests that hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance activate NFκ signaling resulting in aberrant regulation of inflammation-related gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Contacts of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  are now recognized to be essential for diverse biological processes such as calcium homeostasis, phospholipid biosynthesis, apoptosis, and autophagy. In addition to these universal roles, ER- communication serves also cell type-specific functions. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on ER- contacts in cells of the innate immune system, especially in macrophages.

Below toxic levels, hydrogen sulfide promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and function, thereby conferring protection against cellular stress. For these reasons, increases in hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen sulfide-producing enzymes have been implicated in several human disease states. This review will first summarize our current understanding of hydrogen sulfide production and metabolism, as well as its signaling mechanisms; second, this work will detail the known mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide in the  and the implications of its mitochondrial-specific impacts in several pathologic conditions.-Murphy, ., Bhattacharya, R., Mukherjee, P.

Here we use a new probe, roGFP2-Tpx1.C169S, to monitor pre-toxic fluctuations of peroxides in fission yeast, where the concentrations linked to signaling or to toxicity have been established. This probe is able to detect nanomolar fluctuations of intracellular HO caused by extracellular peroxides; expression of human aquaporin 8 channels HO entry into fission yeast decreasing membrane gradients. The probe also detects HO bursts from  after addition of electron transport chain inhibitors, the extent of probe oxidation being proportional to the mitochondrial activity. The oxidation of this probe is an indicator of steady-state levels of HO in different genetic backgrounds. Metabolic reprogramming during growth in low-glucose media causes probe reduction due to the activation of antioxidant cascades. We demonstrate how peroxiredoxin-based probes can be used to monitor physiological HO fluctuations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216623>Potential of Transcript Editing Across Mitogenomes of Early Land Plants Shows Novel and Familiar Trends.</a></h2><p>RNA editing alters the identity of nucleotides in an RNA sequence so that the mature transcript differs from the template defined in the genome. This process has been observed in chloroplasts and  of both seed and early land plants. However, the frequency of RNA editing in plant  ranges from zero to thousands of editing sites. To date, analyses of RNA editing in  of early land plants have been conducted on a small number of genes or mitochondrial genomes of a single species. This study provides an overview of the mitogenomic RNA editing potential of the main lineages of these two groups of early land plants by predicting the RNA editing sites of 33 mitochondrial genes of 37 species of liverworts and mosses. For the purpose of the research, we newly assembled seven mitochondrial genomes of liverworts. The total number of liverwort genera with known complete mitogenome sequences has doubled and, as a result, the available complete mitogenome sequences now span almost all orders of liverworts. The RNA editing site predictions revealed that C-to-U RNA editing in liverworts and mosses is group-specific. This is especially evident in the case of liverwort lineages. The average level of C-to-U RNA editing appears to be over three times higher in liverworts than in mosses, while the C-to-U editing frequency of the majority of genes seems to be consistent for each gene across bryophytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310736>Breast cancer: Occluded role of  N-acetylserotonin/melatonin ratio in co-ordinating pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>A plethora of factors contribute to the biochemical underpinnings of breast cancer, in the absence of any clear, integrative framework. This article proposes that melatonergic pathway regulation within  provides an integrative framework for the wide array of data driving breast cancer pathophysiology. As melatonin is toxic to breast cancer cells, its production within  poses a significant challenge to breast cancer cell survival. Consequently, the diverse plasticity in breast cancer cells may arise from a requirement to decrease  melatonin synthesis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor role in breast cancer pathophysiology may be mediated by an increase in cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1 in , leading to the backward conversion of melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS has distinct effects to melatonin, including its activation of the tyrosine receptor kinase  (TrkB) receptor. TrkB activation significantly contributes to breast cancer cell survival and migration. However, the most important aspect of NAS induction by CYP1b1 in breast cancer cells is the prevention of melatonin effects in . Many of the changes occurring in breast cancer cells arise from the need to regulate this pathway in , allowing this to provide a framework that integrates a host of previously disparate data, including: microRNAs, estrogen, 14-3-3 proteins, sirtuins, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the kynurenine pathways. It is also proposed that this framework provides a pathoetiological model incorporating the early developmental regulation of the gut microbiome that integrates breast cancer risk factors, including obesity. This has significant treatment, prevention and research implications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
