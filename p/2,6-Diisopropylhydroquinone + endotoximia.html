Stored RBC units contain high concentrations of RBC- EVs, thereby increasing the concentration of EVs in the circulation after transfusion. The mechanisms underlying the clearance of donor RBC-EVs after transfusion are unknown. This study investigates whether membrane markers that are associated with clearance of RBCs are also implicated in clearance of RBC-EVs in human endotoxemic recipients of a transfusion.Six volunteers were injected with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and after two hours transfused with an autologous RBC unit donated 35 days earlier. Samples were collected from the RBC unit and the volunteers before and after transfusion. RBC-EVs were labeled with (anti) glycophorin A, combined with (anti) CD44, CD47, CD55, CD59, CD147, or lactadherin to detect phosphatidylserine (PS) and analyzed on a A50 Micro flow cytometer.In the RBC unit, RBC-EVs solely exposed PS (7.8%). Before transfusion, circulating RBC-EVs mainly exposed PS (22%) and CD59 (9.1%), the expression of the other membrane markers was much lower. After transfusion, the concentration of RBC- EVs increased .4-fold in two hours. Thereafter, the EV concentration decreased towards baseline levels. The fraction of EVs positive for all tested membrane markers decreased after transfusion.Besides a minor fraction of PS-exposing EVs, RBC-EVs produced during storage do not expose detectable levels of RBC membrane markers that are associated with clearance, which is in contrast to the EVs produced by the circulating RBCs.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we characterized a novel porcine β-defensin (pBD129) and explored its role in alleviating bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammation and intestinal epithelium atrophy. The  gene was cloned and expressed in . A recombinant pBD129 protein was also purified. To explore its role in alleviating the endotoxin-induced inflammation, mice, with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were treated by pBD129 at different doses. The recombinant pBD129 showed significant antimicrobial activities against the  and  with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 32 μg/mL. Hemolytic assays showed that the pBD129 had no detrimental impact on cell viabilities. Interestingly, we found that pBD129 attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by decreasing serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α ( < 0.05). Moreover, pBD129 elevated the intestinal villus height ( < 0.05) and enhanced the expression and localization of the major tight junction-associated protein ZO-1 in LPS-challenged mice. Additionally, pDB129 at a high dose significantly decreased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) concentration ( < 0.05) and reduced intestinal epithelium cell apoptosis ( < 0.05) in LPS-challenged mice. Importantly, pBD129 elevated the expression level of Bcl--associated death promoter (Bcl-), but down-regulated the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes such as the B-cell lymphoma--associated X protein (Bax), BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3), and caspase-9 in the intestinal mucosa ( < 0.05). These results suggested a novel function of the mammalian defensins, and the anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of pBD129 may allow it a potential substitute for conventionally used antibiotics or drugs.Copyright © 2019 Xie, Xie, Su, Chen, Yu, Mao, Huang, Yu, Luo, Zheng, Luo and He.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30498207>Altered gut microbiota after traumatic splenectomy is associated with .</a></h2><p>Splenectomy carries a long-term risk of postoperative infection, and the chronic, low-grade inflammation associated with  may be related to the gut microbiota. In this study, to increase our understanding of the potential cause of the high rate of infection in postsplenectomy patients, we evaluated the differences in the gut microbiota and plasma lipopolysaccharide level of patients after splenectomy relative to those of healthy controls. Thirty-two patients having undergone splenectomy and 42 healthy individuals were enrolled into the splenectomy (SP) and healthy control (HC) groups, respectively. The SP group was subdivided into three subgroups according to the length of their postoperative time. Fecal samples were used for gut microbiota analysis via 16s rRNA gene sequencing, blood examinations and plasma lipopolysaccharide measurements were also taken. Significant differences were observed in gut microbiota composition with regard to the relative bacterial abundances of  phyla, 7 families, and 15 genera. The lipopolysaccharide level was significantly higher in the SP group than in the HC group and were negatively associated with five bacterial families with low abundance in the SP group. The degree of the microbiota alteration increased with the length of the postoperative time. The PICRUSt analysis showed that the relative abundances of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways were higher in the SP group and were positively associated with the plasma lipopolysaccharide level. Significant alterations were observed in the gut microbiota of the splenectomized patients and were associated with plasma lipopolysaccharide level. Further studies are needed to verify whether such alterations after splenectomy are related to an increased risk of complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664762>Basophil-derived tumor necrosis factor can enhance survival in a sepsis model in mice.</a></h2><p>Basophils are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, despite their small numbers and short life span, suggesting that they have beneficial roles in maintaining health. However, these roles are not fully defined. Here we demonstrate that basophil-deficient mice exhibit reduced bacterial clearance and increased morbidity and mortality in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. Among the several proinflammatory mediators that we measured, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was the only cytokine that was significantly reduced in basophil-deficient mice after CLP. In accordance with that observation, we found that mice with genetic ablation of Tnf in basophils exhibited reduced systemic concentrations of TNF during . Moreover, after CLP, mice whose basophils could not produce TNF, exhibited reduced neutrophil and macrophage TNF production and effector functions, reduced bacterial clearance, and increased mortality. Taken together, our results show that basophils can enhance the innate immune response to bacterial infection and help prevent sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981294>Inhibition of peptidylarginine deiminase alleviates LPS-induced pulmonary dysfunction and improves survival in a mouse model of lethal .</a></h2><p>Immune cell death caused by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), referred to as NETosis, can contribute to the pathogenesis of  and organ damage. Although the mechanisms by which infection induces NETosis and how that leads to organ dysfunction remain largely unknown, NET formation is often found following citrullination of histone H3 (CitH3) by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD). We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of PAD and subsequent CitH3-mediated NET formation increases endothelial permeability and pulmonary dysfunction and, therefore, that inhibition of PAD can mitigate damage and improve survival in lethal . Here, we showed that treatment with YW3-56, a PAD2/PAD4 inhibitor, significantly diminished PAD activation, blocked LPS-induced pulmonary vascular leakage, alleviated acute lung injury, and improved survival in a mouse model of lethal LPS-induced . We found CitH3 in the bloodstream 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of LPS (35 mg/kg) into mice. Additionally, CitH3 production was induced in cultured neutrophils exposed to LPS, and NETs derived from these LPS-treated neutrophils increased the permeability of endothelial cells. However, YW3-56 reduced CitH3 production and NET formation by neutrophils following LPS exposure. Moreover, treatment with YW3-56 decreased the levels of circulating CitH3 and abolished neutrophil activation and NET formation in the lungs of mice with .

We hypothesized that the PPAR-β/δ-agonist GW0742 improves long-term outcome after sepsis caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Fifty-one CD-1 female mice underwent CLP and received either vehicle (control), GW0742 (0.03 mg/kg/injection; five post-CLP i.v. injections), GSK0660 (PPAR-β/δ-antagonist) or both and were monitored for 28 d. Another 20 CLP mice treated with GW0742 and vehicle were sacrificed 24 h post-CLP to assess coagulopathy. Compared to vehicle, survival of CLP-mice treated with GW0742 was higher by 35% at d 7 and by 50% at d 28. CLP mice treated with GW0742 had 60% higher IFN-γ but circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and chemokine ligand were lower at 48 h post-CLP. Compared to vehicle, CLP mice treated with GW0742 exhibited a 50% reduction in the circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 associated with an increase in platelet number at 24 h post-CLP (but no changes occurred in anti-thrombin-III, plasminogen, fibrinogen and clotting-times). CLP mice treated with GW0742 exhibited a similar increase in most of the biochemical markers of organ injury/dysfunction (lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and triglycerides) measured. Treatment with GW0742 consistently improved long-term survival in septic CD-1 mice by partially modulating the post-CLP systemic cytokine response and coagulation systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29787388>Dying as a Pathway to Death in Sepsis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29912589>Lactobacillus plantarum prevents and mitigates alcohol-induced disruption of colonic epithelial tight junctions, , and liver damage by an EGF receptor-dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>Pathogenesis of alcohol-related diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis involves gut barrier dysfunction, , and toxin-mediated cellular injury.

This study aimed to define altered MS-metabolomic responses during high-fat (HF)-induced NASH that are restored by GTE utilizing livers from an earlier study in which GTE decreased endotoxin-TLR4-NFκB liver injury.Mice are fed a low-fat (LF) or HF diet for 12 weeks and then randomized to LF or HF diets containing 0% or % GTE for an additional 8 weeks. Global MS-based metabolomics and targeted metabolite profiling of catechins/catechin metabolites are evaluated. GTE in HF mice restores hepatic metabolites implicated in dyslipidemia insulin resistance, and inflammation. These include 122 metabolites: amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, bile acids, flavonoids, xenobiotics, and carbohydrates. Hepatic amino acids, B-vitamins, and bile acids are inversely correlated with biomarkers of insulin resistance, liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation. Further, phosphatidylcholine metabolites are positively correlated with biomarkers of liver injury and NFκB inflammation. Thirteen catechin metabolites are identified in livers of GTE-treated mice, mostly as phase II conjugates of parental catechins or microbial-derived valerolactones.The defined anti-inflammatory/metabolic interactions advance an understanding of the mechanism by which GTE catechins protect against NFκB-mediated liver injury in NASH.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The i.v. administration of nicotine (50 μg/kg) abolished the lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg i.v.)-evoked: (i) falls in blood pressure and spectral measure of cardiac sympathovagal balance (ratio of the low-frequency to high-frequency power, LF/HF), (ii) elevations in immunohistochemical protein expressions of NFκB and α4β-nAChR in medullary neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and (iii) decreases in medullary α7-nAChR protein expression.

Activators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been reported to activate MEF2, but a comprehensive analysis of GPCR activators that regulate MEF2 has to our knowledge not been performed. Here, we tested several GPCR agonists regarding their ability to activate a MEF2 reporter in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E (PGE) strongly activated MEF2. Using pharmacological and protein-based inhibitors, we demonstrated that PGE regulates MEF2 via the EP receptor, the βγ subunit of G protein and two concomitantly activated downstream pathways. The first consists of Tiam1, Rac1, and its effector p21-activated kinase , the second of protein kinase D. Both pathways converge on and inactivate histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and thereby de-repress MEF2. ,  in MEF2-reporter mice induced upregulation of PGE and MEF2 activation.

Administration of E.Coli endotoxin (LPS) produces systemic inflammatory effects of sepsis including disruption of endothelial barrier, and if severe enough death. Whole body periodic acceleration (pGz) is the headward-footward motion of the body. pGz has been shown to induce pulsatile shear stress to the endothelium, thereby releasing vascular and cardio protective mediators. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not pGz performed as a pre-treatment or post-treatment strategy improves survival in a lethal murine endotoxin model.This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled study in mice. pGz was performed in mice as pre-treatment (pGz-LPS, 3 days prior to LPS), post-treatment (LPS- pGz, 30 min after LPS) strategies or Control (LPS-CONT), in a lethal murine model of .  was induced with intraperitoneal injection of E.Coli LPS (40mg/kg). In a separate group of mice, a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) was provided in their drinking water and pGz-LPS and LPS-pGz performed to determine the effect of nitric oxide (NO) inhibition on survival. In another subset of mice, micro vascular leakage was determined. Behavioral scoring around the clock was performed in all mice at 30 min intervals after LPS administration, until 48 hrs. survival or death. LPS induced 100% mortality in LPS-CONT animals by 30 hrs. In contrast, survival to 48 hrs. occurred in 60% of pGz-LPS and 80% of LPS-pGz. L-NAME abolished the survival effects of pGz. Microvascular leakage was markedly reduced in both pre and post pGz treated animals and was associated with increased tyrosine kinase endothelial-enriched tunica interna endothelial cell kinase  (TIE2) receptor and its phosphorylation (p-TIE2). In a murine model of lethal , pGz performed as a pre or post treatment strategy significantly improved survival, and markedly reduced microvascular leakage. The effect was modulated, in part, by NO since a non-selective inhibitor of NO abolished the pGz survival effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500176>Targeting ROS and cPLA2/COX2 Expressions Ameliorated Renal Damage in Obese Mice with .</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with metabolic , reactive oxygen species (ROS), chronic inflammation, and obese kidney fibrosis.

GPR84 activation is involved in the inflammatory response, but the mechanisms by which it modulates inflammation have been incompletely described. In this study, we investigated GPR84 expression, activation, and function in macrophages to establish the role of the receptor during the inflammatory response. We observed that GPR84 expression in murine tissues is increased by , hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  studies revealed that GPR84 mRNA expression is increased by LPS and other pro-inflammatory molecules in different murine and human macrophage populations. Likewise, high glucose concentrations and the presence of oxidized LDL increased GPR84 expression in macrophages. Activation of the GPR84 receptor with a selective agonist, 6-(octylamino) pyrimidine-,4(1H,3H)-dione (6--octylaminouracil, 6-OAU), enhanced the expression of phosphorylated Akt, p-ERK, and p65 nuclear translocation under inflammatory conditions and elevated the expression levels of the inflammatory mediators TNFα, IL-6, IL-12B, CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL1. In addition, GPR84 activation triggered increased bacterial adhesion and phagocytosis in macrophages. The enhanced inflammatory response mediated by 6-OAU was not observed in GPR84 cells nor in macrophages treated with a selective GPR84 antagonist. Collectively, our results reveal that GPR84 functions as an enhancer of inflammatory signaling in macrophages once inflammation is established.

Despite intensive research in the last two decades, there is currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for treating ALD. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of the gut-liver axis and gut microbiome on the pathogenesis of ALD. Alcohol may induce intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, which in turn result in increased levels of pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and translocation of microbial products from the gut to the liver (bacterial translocation). LPS is an inflammatory signal that activates toll-like receptor 4 on Kupffer cells, contributing to the inflammation observed in ALD. Recently, probiotics have been shown to be effective in reducing or preventing the progression of ALD. A potential mechanism is that the probiotics transforms the composition of intestinal microbiota, which leads to reductions in alcohol-induced dysbiosis, intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, , and consequently, the development of ALD. While transformation of intestinal microbiota by probiotics appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of intestinal barrier dysfunction, there is a scarcity of research that studies probiotics in the context of ALD.

Our results showed that HA suppressed LPS-triggered MMP-9-mediated gelatinolysis and expression of protein and mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner without effects on TIMP-1 activity. Also, HA significantly attenuated the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β from LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Moreover, HA significantly inhibited LPS-mediated STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and ERK1/ activation in THP-1 cells. In an LPS-induced  mouse model, studies indicated that HA pretreatment improved -induced acute sickness behavior, including acute motor deﬁcits and anxiety-like behavior.

Recent studies have reported that gut dysbiosis and leakage of bacterial components, may contribute to the metabolic disturbances and systemic inflammation observed in subjects with MetS. Chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to induce features of MetS in experimental studies. LPS interacts with the innate immune system, facilitated through LPS-binding protein (LBP) and the co-receptor CD14, both regarded as markers of gut leakage.We investigated whether circulating levels of LBP and sCD14 are associated with the presence of MetS and its components, and further any association with systemic inflammation.We examined 482 men, aged between 65 and 75 years, all at high CVD risk. MetS criteria's according to the US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III were met in 182 subjects (38%).Levels of LBP and sCD14 did not differ between individuals with and without MetS. However, a trend towards increased risk of MetS through quartiles of LBP was observed (p = 0.05). Individuals in the highest quartile (Q4), had an increased risk of MetS (OR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.04-3.00), compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) (p = 0.04). With regard to the separate constituents of MetS, patients who met the waist circumference criterion had significant higher concentration of LBP compared to those who did not (p = 0.04). We also found a weak, but significant correlation between LBP and waist circumference (r = 0.10, p = 0.03). Moderate, yet significant correlations were observed between both LBP and sCD14 and several markers of systemic inflammation (r = 0.1-0.23; p < 0.001-0.04).The trend for increased prevalence of MetS observed with increasing quartiles of LBP seems to be mainly driven by central obesity in our male cohort.

Therefore, the development of drugs to control the pathogen-induced inflammatory responses associated with sepsis is essential. To address this, our study examined the transcriptomes of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced dendritic cells (DCs), identifying TANK-binding kinase1 (Tbk1) as a key factor involved in the inflammatory response. These data suggested drug repositioning of the Tbk1 inhibitor CYT387, currently used for the treatment of myelofibrosis and some cancers, as a candidate for regulating the LPS-induced inflammatory response. CYT387 also inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine and surface molecule expression by mature DCs after LPS exposure. These effects correlated with both Akt phosphorylation and IκBα degradation. Finally, CYT387 demonstrated therapeutic effects in LPS-induced  and Escherichia coli K1-induced mouse models of sepsis and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, our study suggests that drug repositioning of CYT387 may serve as a potential therapeutic for sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

EA-230 has shown promising immunomodulatory and tissue-protective effects in animals and an excellent safety profile in human phase I studies that we performed. The present phase IIa study follows-up on these results by investigating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of EA-230 under systemic inflammatory conditions induced by experimental human .In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa study, systemic inflammation was induced by intravenous administration of Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At t = 0 hours, 36 healthy male volunteers received  ng/kg LPS, followed by a -hour continuous infusion of EA-230 (15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/h, n = 8 per group) or placebo (n = 12).EA-230 was well tolerated and showed a favourable safety profile. Treatment with the highest dose of EA-230 resulted in a significant attenuation of the LPS-induced increase in plasma levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory proteins-1α and -1β, and vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (% reduction of 48, 28, 33, 28, 14, 16 and 19 respectively, p < .01), and reduced fever (peak decrease from 1.8 ± 0.1°C to 1.3 ± 0.°C, P < .05) and symptom scores (peak decrease from 7.4 ± 1.0 to 4.0 ± 1. points, P < .05). EA-230 exhibited a very short elimination half-life and a large volume of distribution in the highest dosage group (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval: 0.17 [0.12-0.24] hours and . [1.3-3.8] L/kg, respectively).Administration of EA-230 is safe and results in attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response in humans.© 2019 The Authors.

Cardiovascular complications greatly increase sepsis-associated mortality. Although murine models are routinely used for preclinical studies, the benefit of using genetically engineered mice in sepsis is countered by discrepancies between human and mouse sepsis pathophysiology. Therefore, recent guidelines have called for standardization of preclinical methods to document organ dysfunction. We investigated the course of cardiac dysfunction and myocardial load in different mouse models of sepsis to identify the optimal measurements for early systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Methods and Results We performed speckle-tracking echocardiography and assessed blood pressure, plasma inflammatory cytokines, lactate, B-type natriuretic peptide, and survival in mouse models of  or polymicrobial infection (cecal ligation and puncture, [ CLP ]) of moderate and high severity. We observed that myocardial strain and cardiac output were consistently impaired early in both sepsis models. Suppression of cardiac output was associated with systolic dysfunction in  or combined systolic dysfunction and reduced preload in the CLP model. We found that cardiac output at  hours post- CLP is a negative prognostic indicator with high sensitivity and specificity that predicts mortality at 48 hours. Using a known antibiotic (ertapenem) treatment, we confirmed that this approach can document recovery. Conclusions We propose a non-invasive approach for assessment of cardiac function in sepsis and myocardial strain and strain rate as preferable measures for monitoring cardiovascular function in sepsis mouse models. We further show that the magnitude of cardiac output suppression  hours post- CLP can be used to predict mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29762676>Interleukin 38 Protects Against Lethal Sepsis.</a></h2><p>Interleukin 38 (IL-38) is the most recently characterized cytokine of the interleukin 1 family. However, its role in sepsis remains unknown.Circulating IL-38 levels were measured in  cohorts of adult and pediatric patients with sepsis. Using  murine models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, the effects of IL-38 on survival, inflammation, tissue injury, and bacterial clearance were assessed.Serum IL-38 concentrations were significantly elevated in adult and pediatric patients with sepsis relative to corresponding healthy adult and pediatric controls, respectively. An increased IL-38 level negatively correlated with the number of blood leukocytes and with the level of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in clinical sepsis. Anti-IL-38 antibody impaired survival and while recombinant IL-38 improved survival in the  murine models of LPS-induced  and CLP-induced sepsis. IL-38 administration decreased the inflammatory response, as reflected by lower levels of cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, TNF-α, interleukin 10, interleukin 17, interleukin 27, CXCL1, and CCL2), and less damage to tissues (including lung, liver, and kidney) in CLP-induced sepsis. Furthermore, IL-38 augmented bacterial clearance in CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis.These findings suggest that IL-38 attenuates sepsis by decreasing inflammation and increasing bacterial clearance, thus providing a novel tool for antisepsis therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29844096>Saturated Fat Is More Metabolically Harmful for the Human Liver Than Unsaturated Fat or Simple Sugars.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (i.e., increased intrahepatic triglyceride [IHTG] content), predisposes to type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are the main pathways contributing to IHTG. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition influences the pathways, mediators, and magnitude of weight gain-induced changes in IHTG.We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 ±  years, BMI 31 ± 1 kg/m, liver fat 4.7 ± 0.9%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([H]glycerol) and DNL (HO) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, , plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks.Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55%) than UNSAT (+15%,  < 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33%) by stimulating DNL (+98%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and  and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression.Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630520>Phytochemical and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous leaf extract of Indian borage (oregano) on rats induced with inflammation.</a></h2><p>The Indian borage (Plectranthus amboinicus) also called Oregano contains many effective antioxidants, which includes caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and flavonoids. It has been employed in traditional medicine for its several health benefits including the prevention and cure of many debilitating diseases. Anti-inflammatory properties of Plectranthus amboinicus grown within this environment have not been adequately explored.The protective and therapeutic effects of Oregano against  and inflammation were evaluated using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat models.A total of 30 Wistar rats were randomly selected for this study and divided into six groups, with each group having 5 rats. Inflammation was induced on appropriate animal groups using LPS injection at a concentration of 4 mg/kg. Aqueous leaf extract of Indian borage was administered orally in four doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg post-LPS exposure and 150 mg/kg pre-LPS exposure) to respective treatment rat groups. Haematological profile, toxicity profile of liver and kidney and levels of biomarkers of inflammation were assayed using standard methods.Rats injected with LPS showed severe anaemia and marked leucopoenia with significant decrease in monocytes compared to the control group (p< 0.05). There was increased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p< 0.05) in the peripheral circulation of rats exposed to LPS. Treatment with Indian borage significantly (p< 0.05) reduced the toxic effects in the LPS-treated animals and attenuated the increase in the expression of circulating proinflammatory cytokines; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TN-Fα) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) caused by LPS. Indian borage pretreatment also significantly (p< 0.05) counteracted the associated haematological dyscrasias caused by exposure to LPS. The extract elicited a significant protective effect on the kidney and liver as evidenced by the decreased renal markers and hepatic enzyme activities when compared with the control. The extract demonstrated protective and suppressive role against the overexpression of inflammatory mediators by ameliorating the induced inflammation and endotoxaemic conditions in the affected rat groups thereby validating its folkloric use.Our study thus reveals that the extract might be an active, natural and non-toxic drug lead against -induced inflammation and toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682583>Dietary LPS traces influences disease expression of the diet-induced obese mouse.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram negative bacteria are generally present in laboratory animal chow diets in unknown amounts, which has been correlated to significant immunological differences between animals receiving diets with either low or high "naturally" occurring LPS content. LPS in the blood stream has been linked to glucose intolerance through Toll-like receptor mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, metabolic , adipose tissue inflammation. LPS uptake increases when co-administered with fat, therefore uncontrolled LPS levels in a high-fat diet may increase variation in development of disease when high-fat diets are used to induce obesity and type  diabetes. Three experiments were conducted, in which C57BL/6NTac mice received high-fat (60%) or low fat (10%) diets with or without LPS for 8 or 20 weeks investigating the short and long term effects. Three different doses of LPS were used to investigate dosage effect, and ampicillin to isolate the effect of dietary LPS. Dietary LPS increased LPS levels in the blood stream, and affected the level of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), a key parameter in this model, in a dose dependant manner (p < 0.05). There was a strong tendency toward slower glucose uptake in the LPS supplemented groups once obesity was established, but the differences disappeared after 20 weeks. A high-fat diet slightly increased serum LPS and altered ileal expression of il10 and tnfa (p < 0.05). In conclusion, LPS seems to affect the glucose metabolism in a time-dose dependant manner, and uncontrolled variation in LPS levels of a diet may therefore increase inter-study variation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although many studies have developed drugs for sepsis treatment, none have decreased the mortality rate. The aim of this study was to identify a novel treatment option for sepsis using the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) L1000 perturbation dataset based on an in vitro and in vivo sepsis model. Sepsis-related microarray studies of early-stage inflammatory processes in patients and innate immune cells were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository and used for candidate drug selection based on the LINCS L1000 perturbation dataset. The anti-inflammatory effects of the selected candidate drugs were analyzed using activated macrophage cell lines. CGP-60474, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, was the most potent drug. It alleviated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in activated macrophages by downregulating the NF-κB activity, and it reduced the mortality rate in LPS induced  mice. This study shows that CGP-60474 could be a potential therapeutic candidate to attenuate the endotoxemic process. Additionally, the virtual screening strategy using the LINCS L1000 perturbation dataset could be a cost and time effective tool in the early stages of drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176010>The role of serpin protein on the natural immune defense against pathogen infection in Lampetra japonica.</a></h2><p>Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are a large protein family that is involved in various physiological processes and is known to regulate innate immunity pathways. However, research for the functional study of serpins in lamprey is limited. In the present study, a serpin gene was cloned and characterized from Lampetra japonica at molecular, protein and cellular levels, named L-serpin which belongs to family F serine protease inhibitors (serpin family). The L-serpin includes a serpin domain in the N-terminus. The mRNA transcript of L-serpin was extensively expressed in kidney, supraneural body, intestine, liver, heart, gill and the highest expression in leukocytes. The mRNA expression level of L-serpin increased significantly after Vibrio anguillarum, Staphylocccus aureus and Poly I:C stimulation and dramatically peak at 8 h. It is demonstrated that the L-serpin protected cells from lethal Gram-negative  through associating with inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered cell death and inflammatory factors expression. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and the microbe binding assay were used to determine that L-serpin interacts directly with LPS (KD = 6.14 × 10 M). Furthermore, we confirmed L-serpin is a major inhibitor of complement activation by inactivating lamprey-C1q protein (KD = .06 × 10 M). Taken together, these findings suggest that L-serpin is a endogenous anti-inflammatory factor to defend against Gram-negative bacterial challenge and involved in lamprey innate immunity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The inflammasome serves as a key component of immune homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to various inflammatory disorders. However, little is known about the effects of acetate on inflammasome activation and the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that acetate attenuates inflammasome activation via GPR43 in a Ca-dependent manner. Through binding to GPR43, acetate activates the G subunit and subsequent phospholipase C-IP signaling to decrease Ca mobilization. In addition, acetate activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), promotes NLRP3 inflammasome ubiquitination by PKA, and ultimately induces NLRP3 degradation through autophagy. In vivo, acetate protects mice from NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis and LPS-induced . Collectively, our research demonstrates that acetate regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome via GPR43 and Ca-dependent mechanisms, which reveals the mechanism of metabolite-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome attenuation and highlights acetate as a possible therapeutic strategy for NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789941>A non-linear mixed effect model for innate immune response: In vivo kinetics of endotoxin and its induction of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6.</a></h2><p>Endotoxin, a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has been extensively studied as a stimulator of the innate immune response. However, the temporal aspects and exposure-response relationship of endotoxin and resulting cytokine induction and tolerance development is less well defined. The aim of this work was to establish an in silico model that simultaneously captures and connects the in vivo time-courses of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and associated tolerance development. Data from six studies of porcine  in anesthetized piglets (n = 116) were combined and used in the analysis, with purified endotoxin (Escherichia coli O111:B4) being infused intravenously for 1-30 h in rates of 0.063-16.0 μg/kg/h across studies. All data were modelled simultaneously by means of importance sampling in the non-linear mixed effects modelling software NONMEM. The infused endotoxin followed one-compartment disposition and non-linear elimination, and stimulated the production of TNF-α to describe the rapid increase in plasma concentration. Tolerance development, observed as declining TNF-α concentration with continued infusion of endotoxin, was also driven by endotoxin as a concentration-dependent increase in the potency parameter related to TNF-α production (EC50). Production of IL-6 was stimulated by both endotoxin and TNF-α, and four consecutive transit compartments described delayed increase in plasma IL-6. A model which simultaneously account for the time-courses of endotoxin and two immune response markers, the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, as well as the development of endotoxin tolerance, was successfully established. This model-based approach is unique in its description of the time-courses and their interrelation and may be applied within research on immune response to bacterial endotoxin, or in pre-clinical pharmaceutical research when dealing with study design or translational aspects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135706>Nicotine Improves Survivability, Hypotension, and Impaired Adenosinergic Renal Vasodilations in Endotoxic Rats: Role of α7-Nachrs/HO-1 Pathway.</a></h2><p>The nicotinic/cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway protects against acute kidney injury and other end-organ damages induced by . In this study, we tested the hypothesis that functional α7-nAChRs/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is imperative for the nicotine counteraction of hemodynamic and renovascular dysfunction caused by acute  in rats. Renal vasodilations were induced by cumulative bolus injections of acetylcholine (ACh, 0.01 nmol-7.29 nmol) or ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, adenosine receptor agonist, 1.6 nmol-100 nmol) in isolated phenylephrine-preconstricted perfused kidneys. The data showed that 6-h treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg i.p.) decreased systolic blood pressure and renal vasodilations caused by NECA but not Ach. The endotoxic insult also increased the mortality rate and elevated serum urea and creatinine. These LPS effects were sex-unrelated, except hypotension, and enhanced mortality which were more evident in male rodents, and abrogated after co-administration of nicotine (0.5, 1 mg/kg and  mg/kg) in a dose-dependent fashion. The advantageous effects of nicotine on NECA vasodilations, survivability, and kidney biomarkers in endotoxic male rats disappeared upon concurrent exposure to methyllycaconitine citrate (α7-nAChR blocker) or zinc protoporphyrin (HO-1 inhibitor) and were reproduced after treatment with bilirubin, but not hemin (HO-1 inducer) or tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (carbon monoxide-releasing molecule). Together, current biochemical and pharmacological evidence suggests key roles for α7-nAChRs and the bilirubin byproduct of the HO-1 signaling in the nicotine counteraction of renal dysfunction and reduced adenosinergic renal vasodilator capacity in endotoxic rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405531>Pharmaceutical Impact of  and Metformin Combination on High-Fat-Diet-Induced Metabolic Disorders: Link to Intestinal Microbiota and Metabolic .</a></h2><p> Metformin and  are representative anti-diabetic therapeutic agents in western and oriental medicinal fields, respectively. The present study examined the therapeutic effects of  extract (HCE) and metformin in combination in a dysmetabolic mouse model.  Metabolic disorders were induced in C57BL/6J mice by high fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks.  Combination of metformin and HCE significantly lowered body weight, abdominal fat, perirenal fat, liver and kidney weights, but did not change epididymal fat in HFD-fed animals. Metformin + HCE treatment markedly attenuated the elevated serum levels of TG, TC, AST, ALT, and endotoxin and restored the depleted HDL level.

Moreover, treatment with HCE + metformin dramatically suppressed inflammation in HFD-fed animals via inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1 and IL-6) and LPS receptor (TLR4). Histopathological findings showed that exposure of HFD-treated animals to metformin + HCE ameliorated fatty liver, shrinkage of intestinal villi and adipocytes enlargement.

The migration of neutrophils is significantly impaired during severe sepsis. We sought to determine the role of trimetazidine (TMZ) in regulation of neutrophil migration to the heart in a mouse model of sepsis and , and to identify the mechanism whereby TMZ confers a survival advantage.  C57/BL6 mice were (1) injected with LPS followed by 24-h TMZ administration, or () treated with TMZ (20 mg/kg/day) for 1 week post cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. Echocardiography and Millar system detection showed that TMZ alleviated cardiac dysfunction and histological staining showed the failure of neutrophils migration to heart in both LPS- and CLP-induced mice. Bone marrow transplantation revealed that TMZ-pretreated bone marrow cells improved LPS- and CLP-induced myocardial dysfunction and enhanced neutrophil recruitment in heart. In CXCL2-mediated chemotaxis assays, TMZ increased neutrophils migration via AMPK/Nrf2-dependent up-regulation of CXCR2 and inhibition of GRK2. Furthermore, using luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that TMZ promoted the binding of the Nrf2 and CXCR2 promoter regions directly. Application of CXCR2 inhibitor completely reversed the protective effects of TMZ . Co-culture of neutrophils and cardiomyocytes further validated that TMZ decreased LPS-induced cardiomyocyte pyroptosis by targeting neutrophils.  Our findings suggested TMZ as a potential therapeutic agent for septic or  associated cardiac dysfunction in mice.   What is the current knowledge on the topic? Migration of neutrophils is significantly impaired during severe sepsis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. What question did this study address?

Intestinal injury and intestinal  (IETM) contribute greatly in the development of AH. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) have been reported to affect intestinal injury. The present study aims to investigate the role of miR‑141 in intestinal injury and IETM of AH. An AH model was successfully established in mice and they were the injected with a series of miR‑141 mimic, miR‑141 inhibitor or toll like receptor 4 monoclonal antibody (TLR4mAb; an inhibitor of the Toll‑like receptor TLR pathway). After that, the intestinal tissues and intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from differently treated AH mice. The expression of miR‑141 and TLR pathway‑associated genes and the levels of inflammatory factors were determined. Furthermore, a target prediction program and a luciferase reporter assay were employed to examine whether miR‑141 targets TLR4. Finally, MTT and transwell assays were carried out to detect cell viability and cell permeability. Intestinal tissues from AH mice treated with miR‑141 mimic or TLR4mAb exhibited lower levels of inflammatory factors and reduced expression of the TLR pathway‑associated genes, suggesting a decreased inflammatory response as well as inactivation of the TLR pathway by miR‑141. The luciferase reporter assay suggested that miR‑141 negatively regulated TLR4. Intestinal epithelial cells treated with miR‑141 mimic or TLR4mAb demonstrated enhanced viability and reduced permeability. Opposite results were observed in AH mice treated with a miR‑141 inhibitor.

Presence of pro-inflammatory mediators in the tissues results in the remodelling of matrices which could modify the functions of extravasated leukocytes. Previous reports have shown changes in the expression of ECM proteins during local inflammatory responses. In this study, we have investigated the time- and tissue-specific expression profile of key ECM proteins in systemic inflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse models. The results show that compared to naïve tissues, within 12 h following CLP surgery, a 20-30-fold increase was observed in the expression of collagen-IV (Col-IV) transcripts in the mesentery tissues with a .4-fold increase in the protein by 24 h. However, Western blot band intensities indicated that vimentin and fibrinogen were remarkably expressed in more quantity compared to Col-IV. Secondly, in CLP group of mice, fibrinogen showed 6-40-fold increase in mRNA level in various tissues with about -fold increase in the protein level compared to respective naïve tissues. Similar studies in the LPS-injected mice showed up to -3 fold increase in the expression of Col-IV, fibrinogen and vimentin at protein level in the lungs. In such animals, although similar pattern was observed for fibrinogen in kidney and liver tissues, the mesentery showed prominent changes in Col-IV and vimentin mRNA compared to CLP. Further, bioinformatics analysis showed multiple pathways which could be associated with vimentin, Col-IV and fibrinogen under inflammatory conditions both in human and mouse.

Obesity and a high calorie diet are associated with altered endocrine and metabolic functions of adipose tissue, contributing to systemic inflammation as a result of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/adipokines into the circulation and metabolic . Furthermore, the accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages within the visceral adipose tissue may also be a major cause of chronic inflammation of adipocytes. Thus, it is important to understand the factors that regulate the function of both adipocytes and macrophages to find attractive strategies against the burden of obesity-induced health problems.

This review focuses on the molecular biology mechanism of obesity-induced inflammation and the reciprocal interactions between the major molecular mechanisms and a range of dietary bioactive compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30014232>The Pannexin-1 Channel Inhibitor Probenecid Attenuates Skeletal Muscle Cellular Energy Crisis and Histopathological Injury in a Rabbit  Model.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the effect of probenecid (Pro) as an inhibitor of the pannexin-1 (Panx-1) channel-mediated release of intracellular ATP to the extracellular compartment on inflammation, cellular energy crisis, and organ injury in a rabbit sepsis model induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A total of 24 anesthetized and ventilated rabbits were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: infusion of LPS without Pro (LPS group), infusion of LPS with Pro (LPS + Pro group), sham operation without Pro (normal group), and sham operation with Pro (normal + Pro group). The LPS group had significantly higher serum ATP levels, serum inflammatory factor levels (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), and lower ATP concentrations and ATP/ADP ratios in the skeletal muscle tissue than the normal group. Compared to that at baseline, the expression of Panx-1 in peripheral blood cells increased significantly after the infusion of LPS (fluorescence intensity of Panx-1: T0 (baseline) vs. T1 (post-LPS) = 10 ± 1. vs. 84 ± 48, P < 0.0001; paired differences 73 ± 46, P = 0.024). Moreover, the LPS group exhibited higher expression of Panx-1 in the skeletal muscle tissue than the normal group. The serum ATP level was significantly positively correlated with IL-1β (R = 0.602, P = 0.001), IL-6 (R = 0.381, P = 0.033), and TNF-α (R = 0.514, P = 0.005) in 24 paired measurements. Compared to the LPS group, the LPS + Pro group had significantly lower levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and serum ATP. In the skeletal muscle tissue, the LPS + Pro group also had a higher ATP concentration (1.1 ± 0.15 vs. 1.33 ± 0.17, P = 0.041) and ATP/ADP ratio (0.37 ± 0.03 vs. 0.51 ± 0.06, P = 0.002) and a lower histopathological damage score (4.67 ± 0.52 vs. 3 ± 0.63, P = 0.004). An overexpression of Panx-1 channel might be responsible for the strong inflammatory response, high serum ATP level, and skeletal muscle cellular energy crisis and histopathological damages in sepsis. Inhibiting Panx-1 channel-mediated release of intracellular ATP could decrease the above-mentioned injuries, and Panx-1 might be a potential therapeutic target in sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30185517>Targeting Peroxiredoxin 1 by a Curcumin Analogue, AI-44, Inhibits NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Sepsis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the onset and progression of various inflammatory diseases, making it a highly desirable drug target. In this study, we screened a series of small compounds with anti-inflammatory activities and identified a novel NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, AI-44, a curcumin analogue that selectively inhibited signal  but not signal 1 of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We demonstrated that AI-44 bound to peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and promoted the interaction of PRDX1 with pro-Caspase-1 (CASP1), which led to the suppression of association of pro-CASP1 and ASC. Consequently, the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome was interrupted, and the activation of CASP1 was inhibited. Knockdown of PRDX1 significantly abrogated the inhibitory effect of AI-44 on the NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, AI-44 alleviated LPS-induced  in mice via suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Taken together, our work highlighted PRDX1 as a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and suggested AI-44 as a promising candidate compound for the treatment of sepsis or other NLRP3 inflammasome-driven diseases.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062264>Does the Administration of Sevelamer or Nicotinamide Modify Uremic Toxins or  in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients?</a></h2><p>Hyperphosphatemia control is a major issue in hemodialysis patients. Both sevelamer and nicotinamide are prescribed for this purpose. In addition, they exert pleiotropic effects such as an improvement of inflammatory status and potentially enhanced clearance of uremic toxins. In the present secondary analysis of the NICOREN trial, we investigated the impact of sevelamer and nicotinamide on uremic toxins, toxin precursors, and  in chronic hemodialysis patients.Circulating uremic toxins (including phenylacetylglutamine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenine, hippuric acid, indole-3-acetic acid, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl--furanpropionic acid, kynurenic acid, and p-cresyl glucuronide) and precursors were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and urea, uric acid, phosphate, C-reactive protein, and intact parathyroid hormone by routine biochemistry methods. Serum endotoxin (evaluated by lipopolysaccharide levels) and C-terminal fibroblast growth factor-23 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.One hundred hemodialysis patients were randomized to receive either nicotinamide or sevelamer treatment. Among them, 63% were male, mean (± standard deviation) age was 65 ± 14 years, 47% had diabetes mellitus, and 51% had a history of cardiovascular disease. In the sevelamer group, but not the nicotinamide group, serum levels of urea, uric acid, and fibroblast growth factor-23 were significantly reduced after 6 months of treatment. The other circulating uremic toxins and toxin precursors remained unchanged in response to either phosphate-lowering agent. Sevelamer treatment led to a marked decrease in serum lipopolysaccharide (p < 0.001) whereas nicotinamide treatment induced an only modest decrease of borderline significance (p = 0.057). There was no change in C-reactive protein levels.In contrast to sevelamer, nicotinamide did not reduce circulating levels of low-molecular-weight uremic toxins other than phosphate, and neither agent reduced circulating uremic toxins of high-molecular-weight or protein-bound toxins. Sevelamer, but not nicotinamide, reduced serum endotoxin levels. Despite no change in serum C-reactive protein, the endotoxin-lowering effect of sevelamer may help to attenuate the inflammatory status of patients with chronic kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386827>Telluric acid ameliorates hepatic ischemia reperfusion-induced injury in rats: Involvement of TLR4, Nrf2, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>In past tellurium-based compounds had limited use, however, their therapeutic potential have been target of interest recently due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capabilities in experimental . Nevertheless, their potential hepatoprotective effect against ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is still obscure. This study examined the possible hepatoprotective effect of telluric acid (TELL), one of tellurium-based compound, against the deteriorating effect hepatic IR injury in rats through directing toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) cascade, phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt axis, and nuclear erythroid-related factor- (Nrf-) pathway as possible mechanisms contributed to TELL's effect. Indeed, male Wistar rats were randomized into 3 groups: sham-operated, control IR and TELL (50 µg/kg). TELL was administrated once daily for seven consecutive days prior to the IR induction. Pretreatment with TELL attenuated hepatic IR injury as manifested by hampered plasma aminotransaminases and lactate dehydrogenase activities. Also, TELL opposed IR induced elevation in tissue expression/activity of high-mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB1), TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88), phospho-nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (p-NF-κB p65), phospho-mitogen activated protein kinasep38 (p-MAPKp38) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Moreover, TELL reduced the elevated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances along with increased both Nrf- and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression, beside replenishment of hepatic reduced glutathione. In addition, TELL induced obvious upregulation of p-PI3K and p-Akt protein expressions together with restoration of histopathological changes in IR injury. In conclusion, TELL purveyed conceivable novel hepatoprotective mechanisms and attenuated events associated with acute hepatic injury via inhibition of TLR4 downstream axis and activation of Nrf- and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Thus, TELL may provide a novel therapeutic potential for complications of hepatic IR injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated (i) the nicotine modulation of hemodynamic and renal vasodilatory responses to  in rats, and (ii) roles of α7 or α4β-nAChRs and related HSP70/TNFα/iNOS signaling in the interaction. was induced by ip lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg/day, for  days) and changes in systolic blood pressure and vasodilator responsiveness of isolated perfused kidney to acetylcholine or 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, adenosine receptor agonist) were evaluated.Lipopolysaccharide had no effect on serum creatinine, reduced blood pressure, and increased renal vasodilations induced by acetylcholine or NECA in male and female preparations. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide reduced renal HSP70 expression, but increased α7-nAChRs, α4β-nAChRs and iNOS expressions. The co-administration of aminoguanidine (iNOS inhibitor), pentoxifylline (TNFα inhibitor), or nicotine attenuated lipopolysaccharide mediation of renal vasodilations and elevations in α7/α4β-nAChR and iNOS expressions. Nicotine also reversed the downregulating effect of lipopolysaccharide on HSP70 expression. α7-nAChRs (methyllycaconitine citrate, MLA) or α4β-nAChRs (dihydro-β-erythroidine, DHβE) blockade potentiated the lipopolysaccharide enhancement of renal vasodilations, and abolished the depressant effect of nicotine on lipopolysaccharide responses. A similar abolition of nicotine effects was seen after HSP70 inhibition by quercetin. Alternatively, lipopolysaccharide hypotension was eliminated in rats treated with DHβE/nicotine or quercetin/nicotine regimen in contrast to no effect for nicotine alone or combined with MLA.These findings establish that nicotine offsets lipopolysaccharide facilitation of renal vasodilations possibly through a crosstalk between HSP70 and nAChRs of the α7 and α4β types.Copyright © 2019 Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Sepsis and  impair HPV. We previously showed that nitric oxide synthase  (NOS2) is required, but not sufficient, for the effect of endotoxin on HPV. The aim of the current study was to identify additional factors that might contribute to the impairment of HPV during .Gene expression profiling was determined using pulmonary tissues from NOS2-deficient (NOS2) and wild-type mice subjected to endotoxin or saline challenge (control). HPV was accessed as the percentage increase in left pulmonary vascular resistance (LPVR) in response to left main bronchus occlusion (LMBO) in wild-type mice.Among the 22,690 genes analyzed, endotoxin induced a greater than three-fold increase in 59 and 154 genes in the lungs of wild-type and NOS2 mice, respectively. Of all the genes induced by endotoxin in wild-type mice, arginase 1 (Arg1) showed the greatest increase (16.3-fold compared to saline treated wild-type mice). In contrast, endotoxin did not increase expression of Arg1 in NOS2 mice. There was no difference in the endotoxin-induced expression of Arg2 between wild-type and NOS2-deficient mice. We investigated the role of arginase in HPV by treating the mice with normal saline or the arginase inhibitor N-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (norNOHA). In control mice (in the absence of endotoxin) treated with normal saline, HPV was intact as determined by profound LMBO-induced increase in LPVR (121 ± 22% from baseline). During  and treatment with normal saline, HPV was impaired compared to normal saline treated control mice (33 ± 9% vs. 121 ± 22%, P < 0.05). HPV was restored in endotoxin-exposed mice after treatment with the arginase inhibitor norNOHA as shown by the comparison to endotoxemic mice treated with normal saline (113 ± 29% vs, 33 ± 9%, P < 0.05) and to control mice treated with normal saline (113 ± 29% vs, 121 ± 22%, P = 0.97).The results of this study suggest that  induces Arg1 and that arginase contributes to the endotoxin-induced impairment of HPV in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30453774>Ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction in critical illness.</a></h2><p>Mechanical ventilation (MV) is life-saving for patients with acute respiratory failure but also causes difficult liberation of patients from ventilator due to rapid decrease of diaphragm muscle endurance and strength, which is termed ventilator-induced diaphragmatic damage (VIDD).

(Asteraceae) has been used for a long time for medicinal purposes due to its various pharmacological effects and richness in active compounds such as phenolics, sesquiterpenes, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and polysaccharides. Despite the high content of compounds that have important roles in medicinal plants, there are still limited literature data regarding this valuable species. The plant was fractioned using chloroform (EC) and distilled water (EA) and HPLC analysis revealed the presence of eupatorin, eupatilin, and quercetin in EC and caefic acid and rutin in EA. The antiproliferative potential on BT-20, HepG2, Caco-, and Jurkat cancer cell lines was assessed by MTS test. Jurkat cells were more sensitive to both extracts (IC50 of 7.35 ± 0.35 for EC and 13.77 ± .16 µg/mL for EA), while the other lines were susceptible only to EC (IC50 88.27 ± 1.34 on Caco- cells and over 100 µg/mL on BT20 and HepG2 cells) after 24 h of exposure.

Accumulating evidence suggests that enhanced glycolytic metabolism promotes inflammatory and myocardial diseases. In this study, we performed deep mRNA sequencing analysis on the hearts of control and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and identified that the glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructo--kinase (PFK-)/fructose-,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) might play an indispensable role in ETM-induced cardiac damage. Quantitative real-time PCR validated the transcriptional upregulation of PFKFB3 in the myocardium of LPS-challenged mice and immunoblotting and immunostaining assays confirmed that LPS stimulation markedly increased the expression of PFKFB3 at the protein level both in vivo and in vitro. The potent antagonist 3-(3pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)--propen-1-one (3PO) was used to block PFKFB3 activity in vivo (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and in vitro (10 μM). Echocardiographic analysis and TUNEL staining showed that 3PO significantly alleviated LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction and apoptotic injury in vivo. 3PO also suppressed the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and lactate in the serum, in addition to lactate in the myocardium. PFKFB3 inhibition also diminished the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in both adult cardiomyocytes and HL-1 cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting analysis showed that 3PO inhibited LPS-induced apoptotic induction in cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PFKFB3 participates in LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction via mediating inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the role of burn-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility (BIGD) in promoting bacterial translocation following burn injury, and the protective effect of ghrelin in this process.We assessed gastric emptying (GE%) and intestinal transit (IT by geometric center "GC") in a 60% total body surface area scald burn rat model and measured bacterial counts in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and distal small intestine by colony-forming unit per gram of tissue (CFU/g). A group of animals was treated with ghrelin or saline after burn.Scald burn was associated with a significant delay in GE (62% ± 4% vs 74% ± 4%; P = .02) and a trend of delay in intestinal transit (GC: 5.5 ± 0.1 vs 5.8 ± 0.; P = .09). Concurrently, there was a marginal increase in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (6 × 10 vs  × 10  CFU/g; P = .05) and significant translocation to MLN ( × 10 vs 4 × 10 ; P = .03). We observed a negative correlation between GE and intestinal bacterial overgrowth (r  = -0.61; P = .002) and between IT and translocation (r  = -0.63; P = .004). Ghrelin administration significantly accelerated GE following burn injury (91% ± 3% vs 62% ± 4; P = .03), reduced small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and completely inhibited translocation to MLN (0.0 vs 5 × 10 ; P = .01).Burn-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility is correlated with the systemic translocation of gram-negative gut bacteria that are implicated in multiple organ failure in burn patients.

However, it is unclear how changes in the intestinal microbiota (IM) relate to ethanol (EtOH)-induced disruption of gut-liver homeostasis. We investigated this issue using selectively bred Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats, a validated animal model of excessive EtOH consumption.Independent groups of male adult sP rats were exposed to the standard, home-cage -bottle "EtOH (10% v/v) versus water" choice regimen with unlimited access for 24 h/d (Group Et) for 3 (T1), 6 (T2), and 12 (T3) consecutive months. Control groups (Group Ct) were composed of matched-age EtOH-naïve sP rats. We obtained samples from each rat at the end of each experimental time, and we used blood and colon tissues for intestinal barrier integrity and/or liver pathology assessments and used stool samples for IM analysis with 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.Rats in Group Et developed hepatic steatosis and elevated serum transaminases and endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels but no other liver pathological changes (i.e., necrosis/inflammation) or systemic inflammation. While we did not find any apparent alteration of the intestinal colonic mucosa, we found that rats in Group Et exhibited significant changes in IM composition compared to the rats in Group Ct. These changes were sustained throughout T1, T2, and T3. In particular, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, and Streptococcus were the differentially abundant microbial genera at T3. The KEGG Ortholog profile revealed that IM functional modules, such as biosynthesis, transport, and export of LPS, were also enriched in Group Et rats at T3.We showed that chronic, voluntary EtOH consumption induced liver injury and  together with dysbiotic changes in sP rats.

However, the role and regulation of neutrophils related to nonresolving inflammation and atherosclerosis are poorly understood. We report herein that chronic subclinical , a risk factor for atherosclerosis, skewed neutrophils into a nonresolving inflammatory state with elevated levels of inflammatory mediators (Dectin-1, MMP9, and LTB4) and reduced levels of homeostatic mediators (LRRC32, TGFβ, and FPN). The polarization of neutrophils was due to ROS-mediated activation of oxCAMKII, caused by altered peroxisome homeostasis and reduced lysosome fusion. Application of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) enhanced peroxisome homeostasis of neutrophils, reduced oxCAMKII, and rebalanced the expression profiles of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Adoptive transfer of neutrophils programmed by subclinical  rendered exacerbated atherosclerosis. In contrast, transfer of ex vivo programmed neutrophils by 4-PBA reduced the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Similarly, previous reports have demonstrated that FcGRIIb deficient mice (FcGRIIb-/-; a lupus mouse model) are susceptible to LPS tolerance-induced decreased cytokine responses that inadequate for the organismal control. Thus, understanding the relationship between FcGRIIb and LPS tolerance could improve the therapeutic strategy for lupus. LPS tolerance can be induced through sequential LPS stimulations in either cells or a model organism. In RAW264.7 (a mouse macrophage cell-line), sequential LPS stimulation induced the secretion of Lipocalin- (Lcn-) despite reduced cytokine secretion and severe energy depletion, as measured by the extracellular flux analysis, typical of LPS tolerance. In contrast, treatment with recombinant Lcn- (rLcn-) attenuated LPS tolerance, as shown by an increase in secreted cytokines and altered macrophage polarization toward M1 (increased  and ) in RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest a role of Lcn- in LPS tolerance attenuation. In bone marrow derived macrophages, Lcn- level was similar in LPS tolerant FcGRIIb-/- and wild-type (WT) cells despite the increased LPS tolerance of FcGRIIb-/- cells, suggesting relatively low basal levels of Lcn- produced in FcGRIIb-/- cells. In addition, attenuation of LPS tolerance effectuated by granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reduced Lcn- in both cell types, implying an inverse correlation between Lcn- and the severity of LPS tolerance. Consequently, rLcn- improved LPS tolerance only in FcGRIIb-/- macrophages and attenuated disease severity of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis pre-conditioning with sequential LPS injection (LPS-CLP model) only in FcGRIIb-/- mice, but not in WT mice. To summarize, inadequate Lcn- production in FcGRIIb-/- macrophage might, at least in part, be responsible for the inordinate LPS tolerance compared with WT cells. Additionally, supplementation of rLcn- attenuates LPS tolerance in FcGRIIb-/- macrophages in vitro, and in FcGRIIb-/- mice with LPS-CLP sepsis in vivo. In conclusion, Lcn- secreted by macrophages is possibly an autocrine signal to counter the reduced cytokine secretion in LPS tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257316>Erythropoietin attenuates LPS-induced microvascular damage in a murine model of septic acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis, with a high mortality. Hallmarks of septic-AKI include inflammation, endothelial injury, and tissue hypoxia. Therefore, it would be of interest to develop therapeutic approaches for improving the microvascular damage in septic-AKI. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a well-known cytoprotective multifunctional hormone. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of EPO on microvascular injury in a murine model of endotoxemic AKI. Male Balb/c mice were divided into four groups: control, LPS (8 mg/kg, ip.), EPO (3000 IU / kg, sc.) and LPS + EPO. A time course study (0-48 h) was designed. Experiments include, among others, immunohistochemistry and Western blottings of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1α), erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R), vascular endothelial growth factor system (VEGF/VEGFR-), platelet and endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (PeCAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB). Data showed that EPO attenuates renal microvascular damage during septic-AKI progression through a) the decrease of HIF-1 alpha, iNOS, and NF-κB and b) the enhancement of EPO-R, PeCAM-1, VEGF, and VEGFR- expression. In summary, EPO renoprotection involves the attenuation of septic-induced renal hypoxia and inflammation as well as ameliorates the endotoxemic microvascular injury.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In HFD-fed obese rats on a 10-week calcitriol (0.3 μg/kg/TIW) or vehicle treatment (NASH-vit. D and NASH-V rats) reigme, various in vivo and in vitro experiments were undertaken. Through anti-TNFα-TNFR1-NFκB signaling effects, chronic calcitriol treatment significantly restored plasma calcitriol levels and significantly improved vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in monocytes and the small intestine of NASH-vit.

Significantly, plasma and portal endotoxin/TNFα levels, bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes, plasma DX-4000-FITC, fecal albumin-assessed intestinal hyper-permeability, over-expression of TNFα-related immune profiles in monocytes, inflammation of intestinal/mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT)/liver and hepatic steatosis were improved by chronic calcitriol treatment of NASH rats. Additionally, in vitro experiments with acute calcitriol co-incubation reversed NASH-V rat monocyte supernatant/TNFα-induced monolayer barrier dysfunction in caco- cells, cytokine release from MAT-derived adipocytes, and triglyceride synthesis by lean-V rat hepatocytes. Using in vivo and in vitro experiments, our study reported calcitriol signaling in the gut as well as in adipose tissue.

This study investigated the effects and the potential mechanisms of sevoflurane preconditioning on septic myocardial dysfunction which was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from Escherichia coli O55:B5; 18 mg/kg) in mice. Results indicated that one hour after the administration, LPS induced a significant increase in cell-surface Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cytoplasmic IKKα protein expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) protein (P<0.05), which was attenuated by preconditioning with sevoflurane. Two hours after the administration, inhalation of sevoflurane significantly reduced the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 (P < 0.05). Twelve hours after administration, LPS caused pathological damage to the heart and elevated the serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB; P < 0.05). Echocardiography indicated that sevoflurane preconditioning significantly improved systolic and diastolic function. The inhalation of sevoflurane inhibited increases in myeloperoxidase (MPO), macrophage inflammatory protein- (MIP-), TNF-α and IL-1β levels (P < 0.05) induced by , whereas IL-6 release was facilitated. Sevoflurane attenuated the myocardial levels of nitric oxide (NO; P < 0.05) without an apparent influence on malondialdehyde (MDA), or superoxide dismutase (SOD; P > 0.05).

Two in vivo models of  caused by lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli (LPS) injection were carried out in male outbred Balb/C mice -3 months old, as follow: (1) LPS (50 μg/kg) was intravenously injected 1 h prior to intravenous injection of GLN (0.75 mg/kg) and samples were collected  h later to investigate the role of GLN on the acute lung inflammation; () LPS (1 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 1 h prior to intravenous injection of GLN (0.75 mg/kg) and samples were collected 18 h later to measure the effects of GLN on local and later phases of inflammation in the peritoneum. Results showed that GLN administration reduced the number of neutrophils in the inflamed lungs, partially recovery of the reduced number of leukocytes in the blood; reduced adhesion molecules on lung endothelium and on circulating neutrophils. Moreover, GLN treatment diminished the number of neutrophils, levels of chemotactic cytokine CXCL2 in the inflamed peritoneum, and neutrophils collected from the peritoneum of GLN-treated mice presented lower levels of Rho, Rac, and JNK.

Intestinal microbiota is also changed, but its impact on spaceflight-related metabolic disorder is not clear. We investigated the relationship between glucose metabolic changes and gut dysbiosis in a hind limb-unloading (HU) mouse model, a well-accepted ground-based spaceflight analog. Impaired body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and peripheral insulin resistance were found in -4-wk HU mice. Reduced abundance of gut  spp. and  was observed within 3 d of HU. The ground-based control (Ctrl) mice that were cohoused with HU mice showed similar patterns of dysbiosis and metabolic changes. Compared with the Ctrls, higher levels of plasma LPS-binding protein and altered transcription of  and glucose metabolism-related genes in the liver were observed in HU mice. The supplementation of  spp. suppressed  and liver inflammation and improved glucose tolerance in HU mice. The results indicate a close relationship between dysbiosis and altered glucose metabolism in the HU model and also emphasize the importance of evaluating intestinal microbiota in astronauts and its effect on glucose metabolism.-Wang, Y., Zhao, W., Shi, J., Wang, J., Hao, J., Pang, X., Huang, X., Chen, X., Li, Y., Jin, R., Ge, Q.

A sleeve style ice boot where ice is in direct contact with the skin, and water drains from the boot is being used clinically for distal limb cryotherapy. The degree of cooling achieved by this boot is unknown.Evaluate skin and lamellar cooling after application of the ice sleeve in healthy horses, and the same horses during an  model.Prospective study, crossover design.In eight healthy horses thermocouples were inserted into dorsal lamellae of both front feet, and under skin on both metacarpi. One forelimb received cryotherapy using sleeve style ice boot, with contralateral limb as control. Temperature was recorded on data logging devices at 5 min intervals during each cryotherapy session. Day 1: temperature data was collected for healthy horses. Day : data was collected for the same horses during i.v. administration of endotoxin.In healthy and endotoxaemic horses, the sleeve style ice boot significantly decreased mean skin (7.°C and 5.8°C respectively) and lamellar (10.8°C and 9.6°C respectively) temperatures compared with control limbs (P<0.001). Skin and lamellar temperatures in endotoxaemic horses undergoing cryotherapy were significantly colder than in healthy horses (P = 0.01).Order of treatment not randomised.The boot caused significant decreases in lamellar temperatures compared with untreated control limbs in all horses. Endotoxaemic horses had significantly colder lamellae and skin than healthy horses.

Angiopoietin- (ANGPT2) is a context-dependent regulator of vascular leakage that signals via both endothelial TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE2) and integrins. Here, we show that antibodies against β1-integrin decrease LPS-induced vascular leakage in murine , as either a preventative or an intervention therapy. β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies bound to the vascular endothelium in vivo improved the integrity of endothelial cell-cell junctions and protected mice from -associated cardiac failure, without affecting endothelial inflammation, serum proinflammatory cytokine levels, or TIE receptor signaling. Moreover, conditional deletion of a single allele of endothelial β1-integrin protected mice from LPS-induced vascular leakage. In endothelial monolayers, the inflammatory agents thrombin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IL-1β decreased junctional vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and induced actin stress fibers via β1- and α5-integrins and ANGPT2. Additionally, β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies prevented inflammation-induced endothelial cell contractility and monolayer permeability. Mechanistically, the inflammatory agents stimulated ANGPT2-dependent translocation of α5β1-integrin into tensin-1-positive fibrillar adhesions, which destabilized the endothelial monolayer. Thus, β1-integrin promotes endothelial barrier disruption during inflammation, and targeting β1-integrin signaling could serve as a novel means of blocking pathological vascular leak.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

The anti-inflammatory effects of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator metformin in sepsis has been revealed. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. In the present study, the potential roles of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and kruppel-like factor  (KLF2) in the effects of metformin on endothelial pro-inflammatory responses were investigated. The results showed that metformin pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of HDAC5 at serine 498, leading to the upregulation of KLF2, and eliminated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor ⍺ (TNF⍺)-induced upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). Furthermore, the adhesion of HL60 leukocytes to endothelial monolayer was effectively inhibited by metformin. In addition, the in vivo data confirmed that AMPK activation attenuated local and systemic inflammation in endotoxic mice induced by LPS via mediating phosphorylating HDAC5 and restoring KLF2 expression. Our findings revealed that AMPK activation-mediated HDAC5 phosphorylation and KLF2 restoration is, at least partially, responsible to the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin in -induced endothelial cells, which has important implications for the future development of interfering therapies of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) ameliorates the histological features of NASH; satisfactory antifibrotic effects have not yet been reported. Here, we investigated the combined effects of OCA + a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fifty Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino-acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 12 weeks. The in vitro and in vivo effects of OCA + sitagliptin were assessed along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade and intestinal barrier function. Direct inhibitory effects of OCA + sitagliptin on activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSCs) were assessed in vitro.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin potentially inhibited hepatic fibrogenesis along with Ac-HSC proliferation and hepatic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, α1(I)-procollagen, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) mRNA expression and hydroxyproline levels. Obeticholic acid inhibited hepatic TLR4 expression and increased hepatic matrix metalloproteinase- expression. Obeticholic acid decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating CDAA diet-induced zonula occludens-1 disruption, whereas sitagliptin directly inhibited Ac-HSC proliferation. The in vitro suppressive effects of OCA + sitagliptin on TGF-β1 and α1(I)-procollagen mRNA expression and p38 phosphorylation in Ac-HSCs were almost consistent. Sitagliptin directly inhibited the regulation of Ac-HSC.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin synergistically affected hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting  induced by intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing Ac-HSC proliferation.

Experimental  offers an established model to induce transient systemic inflammation in healthy humans, and has been proposed as an experimental paradigm of depression. Indeed, different symptoms of depression can be observed during experimental , including negative mood or dysthymia as key symptoms of depression. Hopelessness and low self-esteem constitute common cognitive symptoms in depression, but have not been specifically assessed during . Thus, we pooled data from healthy volunteers who received low-dose endotoxin (i.e., 0.4 or 0.8 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide, LPS) or placebo in three randomized, controlled studies to investigate the effects of LPS on cognitive schemata related to depression. Validated questionnaires were used to assess self-esteem, hopelessness and the vulnerability factor intolerance of uncertainty after intravenous injection of LPS or placebo. Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 were repeatedly assessed, along with self-reported mood. Because not all questionnaires were available from primary studies, data were analyzed in two separate data sets: In data set 1, self-esteem and intolerance of uncertainty were assessed in  = 87 healthy volunteers, who randomly received either 0.4 or 0.8 ng/kg LPS or placebo. In data set , hopelessness was measured in  = 59 volunteers who randomly received either LPS (0.8 ng/kg) or placebo. In both data sets, LPS-application led to significant increases in TNF-α and IL-6, reflecting systemic inflammation. Positive mood was significantly decreased in response to LPS, in line with inflammation-induced mood impairment. General self-esteem, intolerance of uncertainty and hopelessness did not differ between LPS- and placebo groups, suggesting that these negative cognitive schemata are not responsive to acute LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Interestingly, LPS-treated volunteers reported significantly lower body-related self-esteem, which was associated with increased TNF-α concentration. Thus, certain aspects of self-esteem related to physical attractiveness and sportiness were reduced. It is conceivable that this effect is primarily related to physical sickness symptoms and reduced physical ability during experimental . With respect to cognitive symptoms of depression, it is conceivable that LPS affects cognitive , but not negative cognitive schemata, which are rather based on learning and repeated experiences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593353>In vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy of the combined Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor and genistein isoflavone, two biological compounds from soybean.</a></h2><p>Soybean Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor (BBI) and genistein, two biological compounds from soybean, are well-known for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities.

EA-230, a linear tetrapeptide (A-Q-G-V), is derived from the beta chain of the human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy hormone. It has shown immunomodulatory and renoprotective effects in several animal models of systemic inflammation. In phase 1 and phase 2a studies, these immunomodulatory effects were confirmed during human experimental , and EA-230 was found to have an excellent safety profile.The objective of this first in-patient study is to test the safety and tolerability as well as the immunomodulatory and renoprotective effects of EA-230 in a proof-of-principle design in patients with systemic inflammation following on-pump cardiac surgery.We describe a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 180 elective patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, with or without concomitant valve surgery, are enrolled. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and will receive either EA-230 (90 mg/kg/hour) or a placebo. These will be infused at the start of the surgical procedure until the end of the use of the cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary focus of this first-in-patient study will be on safety and tolerability of EA-230. The primary efficacy end point is the modulation of the inflammatory response by EA-230 quantified as the change in interleukin-6 plasma concentrations after surgery. The key secondary end point is the effect of EA-230 on renal function. The study will be conducted in  parts to enable an interim safety analysis by an independent data monitoring committee at a sample size of 60. An adaptive design is used to reassess statistical power halfway through the study.This study has been approved by the independent competent authority and ethics committee and will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, guidelines of Good Clinical Practice, and European Directive 2001/20/CE regarding the conduct of clinical trials. Results of this study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Enrollment of this study commenced in July 2016, and results are expected at the end of 2018.This adaptive phase  clinical study is designed to test the safety and tolerability of EA-230 in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

The conductance catheter-derived pressure-volume loop area reflects left ventricular stroke work (LV SW). Dividing LV SW by time, a measure of LV SW min is obtained sharing the same unit as CPO (W). We aimed to validate CPO as a marker of LV SW min under various inotropic states.We retrospectively analysed data obtained from experimental studies of the hemodynamic impact of mild hypothermia and hyperthermia on acute heart failure. Fifty-nine anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated closed-chest Landrace pigs (68 ± 1 kg) were instrumented with Swan-Ganz and LV pressure-volume catheters. Data were obtained at body temperatures of 33.0 °C, 38.0 °C and 40.5 °C; before and after: resuscitation, myocardial infarction, , sevoflurane-induced myocardial depression and beta-adrenergic stimulation. We plotted LVSW min against CPO by linear regression analysis, as well as against the following classical indices of LV function and work: LV ejection fraction (LV EF), rate-pressure product (RPP), triple product (TP), LV maximum pressure (LVP) and maximal rate of rise of LVP (LV dP/dt).CPO showed the best correlation with LV SW min (r = 0.89; p < 0.05) while LV EF did not correlate at all (r = 0.01; p = 0.259). Further parameters correlated moderately with LV SW min (LVP r = 0.47, RPP r = 0.67; and TP r = 0.54). LV dP/dt correlated worst with LV SW min (r = 0.28).CPO reflects external cardiac work over a wide range of inotropic states. These data further support the use of CPO to monitor inotropic interventions in the ICU.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299021>Use of the microbiome in the management of children with type  diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this review is to present recent data that defines our current understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in the development of T2DM.Recent studies focus on the physiology and molecular pathways of the gut microbiome-host interaction. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of plant-based nonsoluble fiber bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43 to induce enteroendocrine molecules that control appetite, and to upregulate intestinal gluconeogenesis gene expression that controls glucose regulation. "Metabolic endotexemia" reflects a state of low-grade systemic inflammation that results from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release from the gut into the systemic circulation in response to a high-fat diet. Inflammatory pathways induced by LPS, activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), and other inflammatory signaling pathways are mediators of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus.Recent scientific data support that derangements in the composition of the microbiota, termed "microbiome dysbiosis" is a factor in the development of "metabolic " and T2DM.

To address this issue, we evaluated Nox2 activation, oxidative stress, gut permeability, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serum levels in 67 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and 73 controls. Compared with controls, NAFLD patients had higher Nox2 activity, isoprostane, zonulin, and LPS levels. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), homeostatic model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), LPS, and isoprostanes were independently associated with Nox2-derivative peptide (sNox2-dp) levels. Within the NAFLD group, patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) had significant higher levels of sNox2-dp, isoprostanes, LPS, triglycerides, HOMA-IR, fasting glucose and insulin, and lower HDL than those without NASH. Furthermore, sNox2-dp levels were linearly associated with the histological grading of steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, fibrosis, and NAFLD activity score. This study provides evidence that children with NAFLD have Nox2 overactivation compared with controls and significant association with the degree of liver damage. The close relationship between Nox2 and LPS serum levels leads to hypothesize a potential role for gut-derived LPS in eliciting systemic Nox2 activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228617>De novo expression of functional connexins 43 and 45 hemichannels increases sarcolemmal permeability of skeletal myofibers during .</a></h2><p> caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) leads to severe skeletal muscular deterioration, starting with higher membrane permeability and decline in resting membrane potential (RMP). However, the molecular mechanism of such changes remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the possible involvement of connexin43- and connexin45-based hemichannels (Cx43 and Cx45 HCs, respectively) as putative mediators of sarcolemmal dysfunctions induced by LPS in control (Cx43Cx45) and Cx43/Cx45 expression-deficient (Cx43Cx45:Myo-Cre) skeletal mice myofibers. At 5 h of , control myofibers presented Cx43 and Cx45 proteins forming functional HCs. Additionally, myofibers from endotoxic control mice showed dye uptake in vivo, which was inhibited by carbenoxolone, a Cx HC blocker. A similar increase in membrane permeability was observed in myofibers freshly isolated from skeletal muscle of mice treated for 5 h with LPS, which was blocked by the Cx HC blocker and was absent in myofibers from mice simultaneously treated with LPS and boldine, which is a Cx HC blocker. The increase in sarcolemmal permeability was mimicked by isolated myofibers treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and occurred at 5 h after treatment.  also induced a significant increase in basal intracellular Ca signal and a drop in RMP in control myofibers. These two changes were not elicited by myofibers deficient in Cx43/Cx45 expression. Therefore, sarcolemmal dysfunction characterizing  is largely explained by the expression of functional Cx43 and Cx45 HCs. Hence, current therapy options for individuals suffering from endotoxic shock could be greatly improved with selective Cx HC inhibitors avoiding the underlying skeletal muscle dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that a decrease in GFR and/or changes in transporters or channels for Mg could be responsible for the observed Mg abnormalities. Therefore, we studied the metabolism of Mg in a murine model of . LPS-induced hypermagnesemia was paralleled by a decrease in creatinine clearance and an increase in the fractional excretion of Mg. In agreement with an altered renal Mg handling,  decreased the renal expression of claudin (Cldn) 10b, Cldn16, Cldn19, parvalbumin, and of the solute carrier family (Slc) 41a3. Further, LPS increased the renal expression of Cldn14 and Slc41a1. The renal expression of the transient receptor potential melastin (Trpm) 6, Trpm7, and of cyclin M (Cnnm)  was unaltered in response to LPS. In vitro studies support a direct effect on the expression of Cldn10b, Cldn14, Cldn16, and Cldn19. Further,  increased the fractional excretion of sodium, which was paralleled by a decrease of important renal sodium transporters. In the large intestine, the expression of Trpm7 was increased in response to LPS, whereas the expression of Trpm6 was decreased. Cnnm4 mRNA levels were unchanged in the large intestine. Further, Cldn12 and Na-H exchanger 3 (Slc9a3) expressions were decreased in the small intestine in response to LPS. Our findings indicate that  is associated with hypermagnesemia and a disturbed Mg handling.

The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, neutrophils adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in LPS-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mice. We found that PEL inhibited LPS-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. PEL also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore, PEL suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or Interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/ by LPS. Moreover, treatment with PEL resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal .

A total of 40 articles out of 942 in the first screening met the inclusion criteria.

Since only heterogeneous cross-sectional studies are available, it remains unclear to what extent  could be associated or not with cognitive disorders and dementia.

We here aimed to study the role of Nbeal2 deficiency in both leukocytes and platelets during gram-negative pneumonia and sepsis. Approach and Results- We studied the role of Nbeal2 in platelets and leukocytes during murine pneumonia and sepsis by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Apart from platelet α-granule deficiency and reduced neutrophil granularity, also monocyte granularity was reduced in Nbeal2 mice, whereas plasma levels of MPO (myeloperoxidase), elastase, NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), and leukocyte CD11b expression were increased. Nbeal2 leukocytes showed unaltered in vitro antibacterial response and phagocytosis capacity against Klebsiella, and unchanged reactive nitrogen species and cytokine production. Also during Klebsiella pneumonia and sepsis, Nbeal2 mice had similar bacterial growth in lung and distant body sites, with enhanced leukocyte migration to the bronchoalveolar space. Despite similar infection-induced inflammation, organ damage was increased in Nbeal2 mice, which was also seen during . Platelet-specific Nbeal2 deficiency did not influence leukocyte functions, indicating that Nbeal2 directly modifies leukocytes. Transfusion of Nbeal2 but not of Nbeal2 platelets into thrombocytopenic mice was associated with bleeding in the lung but similar host defense, pointing at a role for platelet α-granules in maintaining vascular integrity but not host defense during Klebsiella pneumosepsis. Conclusions- These data show that Nbeal2 deficiency-resulting in gray platelet syndrome-affects platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes, with intact host defense but increased organ damage during gram-negative pneumosepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312993>Acute Colchicine Poisoning Causes  via the Destruction of Intestinal Barrier Function: The Curative Effect of Endotoxin Prevention in a Murine Model.</a></h2><p>Colchicine binds to intracellular tubulin and prevents mitosis. Colchicine is also used as an anti-inflammatory drug. Meanwhile, excess administration of medication or accidental ingestion of colchicine-containing plants can cause acute colchicine poisoning, which initially results in gastrointestinal effects that may be followed by multiorgan dysfunction. However, the mechanism of colchicine poisoning remains unclear, and there are no standard therapeutic strategies.We focused on intestinal barrier function and attempted to reveal the underlying mechanism of colchicine poisoning using an animal model.Colchicine was orally administered to C57Bl/6 mice. Then, we performed histopathological analysis, serum endotoxin assays, and intestinal permeability testing. Additionally, the LPS-TLR4 signaling inhibitor TAK-242 was intraperitoneally injected after colchicine administration to analyze the therapeutic effect.We observed villus height reduction and increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the gastrointestinal epithelium of colchicine-treated mice. Both intestinal permeability and serum endotoxin levels were higher in colchicine-treated mice than in control mice. Although colchicine-poisoned mice died within 25 h, those that also received TAK-242 treatment survived for more than 48 h.Colchicine disrupted intestinal barrier function and caused endotoxin shock. Therapeutic inhibition of LPS-TLR4 signaling might be beneficial for treating acute colchicine poisoning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822415>Ultralow doses of dextromethorphan protect mice from endotoxin-induced sepsis-like hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Dextromethorphan, a wildly used over-the-counter antitussive drug, is reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that dextromethorphan at micromolar doses displays potent hepatoprotective effects and enhances mice survival in a sepsis model. Moreover, we also observed potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of subpicomolar concentrations of dextromethorphan in rodent primary neuron-glial cultures. The purpose of this study was to provide a proof of principle that ultralow dose dextromethorphan displays anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in animal studies. Here, we report that subpico- and micromolar doses of dextromethorphan showed comparable efficacy in protecting mice from lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine (LPS/GalN)-induced hepatotoxicity and mortality. Mice were given injections of dextromethorphan from 30 min before and , 4 h after an injection of LPS/GalN (20 μg/600 mg/kg). Our results showed that dextromethorphan at subpicomolar doses promoted survival rate in LPS/GalN-injected mice. Ultralow dose dextromethorphan also significantly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase activity, TNF-α level and liver cell damage of  mice. Mechanistic studies using primary liver Kupffer cell cultures revealed that subpicomolar concentrations of dextromethorphan reduced the NADPH oxidase-generated superoxide free radicals from Kupffer cells, which in turn reduced the elevation of its downstream reactive oxygen species (iROS) to relieve the oxidative stress and decreased TNF-α production in Kupffer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel therapeutic concept of using ultralow doses of dextromethorphan for the intervention of sepsis or septic shock.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658116>Sevoflurane Promotes Bactericidal Properties of Macrophages through Enhanced Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Expression in Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Sevoflurane has antiinflammatory properties, but less is known about effects on infectious inflammationSevoflurane effects on macrophage function in inflammation are not well understood WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In a lipopolysaccharide model of inflammation, sevoflurane increased mouse macrophage nitric oxide synthase activity and bacteria phagocytosis in vitro and in vivoThese effects were abolished by pharmacologically inhibiting nitric oxide synthase expressionIn  in mice, sevoflurane had bactericidal effects BACKGROUND:: Sevoflurane with its antiinflammatory properties has shown to decrease mortality in animal models of sepsis. However, the underlying mechanism of its beneficial effect in this inflammatory scenario remains poorly understood. Macrophages play an important role in the early stage of sepsis as they are tasked with eliminating invading microbes and also attracting other immune cells by the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Thus, the authors hypothesized that sevoflurane mitigates the proinflammatory response of macrophages, while maintaining their bactericidal properties.Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide in the presence and absence of % sevoflurane. Expression of cytokines and inducible NO synthase as well as uptake of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli (E. coli) were measured. The in vivo  model consisted of an intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection after anesthesia with either ketamine and xylazine or 4% sevoflurane. Male mice (n = 6 per group) were observed for a total of 20 h. During the last 30 min fluorescently labeled E. coli were intraperitoneally injected. Peritoneal cells were extracted by peritoneal lavage and inducible NO synthase expression as well as E. coli uptake by peritoneal macrophages was determined using flow cytometry.In vitro, sevoflurane enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced inducible NO synthase expression after 8 ;h by 466% and increased macrophage uptake of fluorescently labeled E. coli by 70% compared with vehicle-treated controls. Inhibiting inducible NO synthase expression pharmacologically abolished this increase in bacteria uptake. In vivo, inducible NO synthase expression was increased by 669% and phagocytosis of E. coli by 49% compared with the control group.Sevoflurane enhances phagocytosis of bacteria by lipopolysaccharide-challenged macrophages in vitro and in vivo via an inducible NO synthase-dependent mechanism.

We hypothesized that poor nutrition status, established with a suboptimal composition of parenteral nutrition (PN), predisposes to -induced edema, oxidative stress, and dysregulated immune responses.Using a  ×  factorial design, 3-day-old piglets (n = 40) were given either optimal or suboptimal composition of PN for 7 days and then infused with either saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 9 hours to induce an acute-phase reaction. Abdominal tissue edema and blood markers of immunity, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed.Piglets receiving suboptimal nutrition showed signs of malnutrition with restricted growth, signs of inflammation (elevated C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6, and serum amyloid A levels), oxidative stress (lower erythrocyte glutathione/hemoglobin and α-tocopherol/cholesterol ratios), and liver dysfunction (increased liver weight and blood bilirubin levels). Perirenal edema was more excessive in malnourished LPS-infused animals, relative to healthy LPS-infused control animals (P < .01). Malnutrition reduced the inflammatory response to LPS (lower CRP, tumor necrosis factor-α, haptoglobin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio) but did not influence LPS-induced oxidative stress markers.We conclude that  and malnutrition in combination lead to acute-phase hyporesponsiveness and perirenal edema in piglets. This finding may have implications for pediatric patients that suffer from malnutrition, as their response to bacterial infections may differ substantially from patients of normal nutrition status.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640128>The relationship between vitamin C status, the gut-liver axis, and metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of cardiometabolic risk factors, which together predict increased risk of more serious chronic diseases. We propose that one consequence of dietary overnutrition is increased abundance of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut that cause increased inflammation, impaired gut function, and  that further dysregulate the already compromised antioxidant vitamin status in MetS. This discussion is timely because "healthy" individuals are no longer the societal norm and specialized dietary requirements are needed for the growing prevalence of MetS. Further, these lines of evidence provide the foundational basis for investigation that poor vitamin C status promotes , leading to metabolic dysfunction that impairs vitamin E trafficking through a mechanism involving the gut-liver axis.

We propose that a pro-inflammatory intestinal milieu, due to intestinal hyper-permeability and/or microbial dysbiosis, initiates or exacerbates PD pathogenesis. One factor that can cause intestinal hyper-permeability and dysbiosis is chronic stress which has been shown to accelerate neuronal degeneration and motor deficits in Parkinsonism rodent models. We hypothesized that stress-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis lead to a pro-inflammatory milieu that exacerbates the PD phenotype in the low-dose oral rotenone PD mice model. To test this hypothesis, mice received unpredictable restraint stress (RS) for 12 weeks, and during the last six weeks mice also received a daily administration of low-dose rotenone (10 mg/kg/day) orally. The initial six weeks of RS caused significantly higher urinary cortisol, intestinal hyperpermeability, and decreased abundance of putative "anti-inflammatory" bacteria (Lactobacillus) compared to non-stressed mice. Rotenone alone (i.e., without RS) disrupted the colonic expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1, increased oxidative stress (N-tyrosine), increased myenteric plexus enteric glial cell GFAP expression and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) protein levels in the colon compared to controls. Restraint stress exacerbated these rotenone-induced changes. Specifically, RS potentiated rotenone-induced effects in the colon including: 1) intestinal hyper-permeability, ) disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin1), 3) oxidative stress (N-tyrosine), 4) inflammation in glial cells (GFAP + enteric glia cells), 5) α-syn, 6) increased relative abundance of fecal Akkermansia (mucin-degrading Gram-negative bacteria), and 7) . In addition, RS promoted a number of rotenone-induced effects in the brain including: 1) reduced number of resting microglia and a higher number of dystrophic/phagocytic microglia as well as (FJ-C+) dying cells in the substantia nigra (SN), ) increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reactivity in the SN, and 3) reduced dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites (DOPAC, HVA) in the striatum compared to control mice. Our findings support a model in which chronic stress-induced, gut-derived, pro-inflammatory milieu exacerbates the PD phenotype via a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated whether the facilitation of central γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission blunts these favorable influences of CSA. The LPS-CSA interaction was determined in the absence and presence of drugs that activate GABA or GABA receptors or elevate synaptic GABA levels in the central nervous system. The consequent i.v. administration of CSA (10 mg/kg) blunted the LPS-evoked hypotension, tachycardia, and reductions in time- and frequency-domain indices of heart rate variability (measures of cardiac autonomic control) evoked by LPS (10 mg/kg i.v.). The ability of CSA to reverse the LPS effects disappeared in rats treated intracisternally (i.c.) with baclofen (selective GABA agonist,  μg/rat) but not muscimol (selective GABA agonist, 1 μg/rat), indicating a preferential compromising action for central GABA receptors on the advantageous effects of CSA. Moreover, the improvement by CSA of LPS-evoked cardiovascular derangements was also eliminated after concurrent i.c. administration of vigabatrin (GABA transaminase inhibitor, 200 μg/rat) or tiagabine (GABA reuptake inhibitor, 100 μg/rat).

The current paradigm suggests that neonatal susceptibility to infection is explained by an innate immune response that is functionally immature. Recent studies in adults have questioned a therapeutic role for IFNβ in sepsis; however, the role of IFNβ in mediating neonatal sensitivity to sepsis is unknown. We evaluated the transcriptional regulation and expression of IFNβ in early neonatal (P0) and adult murine models of  (IP LPS, 5 mg/kg). We found that hepatic, pulmonary, and serum IFNβ expression was significantly attenuated in endotoxemic neonates when compared to similarly exposed adults. Furthermore,  induced hepatic p65/NFκB and IRF3 activation exclusively in adults. In contrast,  induced immunotolerant p50/NFκB signaling in neonatal mice without evidence of IRF3 activation. Consistent with impaired IFNβ expression and attenuated circulating serum levels, neonatal pulmonary STAT1 signaling and target gene expression was significantly lower than adult levels. Using multiple  approaches, the source of hepatic IFNβ expression in endotoxemic adult mice was determined to be the hepatic macrophage, and experiments in RAW 264.7 cells confirmed that LPS-induced IFNβ expression was NFκB dependent. Finally, treating neonatal mice with IFNβ  h after  stimulated pulmonary STAT1 signaling and STAT1 dependent gene expression. Furthermore, IFNβ treatment of endotoxemic neonatal animals resulted in significantly improved survival following exposure to lethal . In conclusion,  induced IFNβ expression is attenuated in the early neonatal period, secondary to impaired NFκB-p65/IRF3 signaling. Pre-treatment with IFNβ decreases neonatal sensitivity to .

Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 × 10 , 1 × 10 , or 4 × 10 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously ( ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier ). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at  hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the "ex vivo" responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 × 10 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human .

Human models that mirror sepsis immunology are instrumental to this aim. The response to endotoxin in humans during the first 24 h captures many hallmarks of the inflammatory response observed in sepsis. However, the long-term immunologic effects of human experimental  have been sparsely studied and could be determinant for the use of this model in sepsis therapy research. In the present work, we studied the immune-composition of healthy subjects challenged with endotoxin (1 ng/kg) 4 h,  days, and 20 days post administration by flow cytometry to study the effects on innate and adaptive immune system, and compared it with the immune-composition in patients during the first 9 days after onset of septic shock. We found several differences and similarities between these groups. Experimental  resulted in an increase in absolute numbers of intermediate monocytes, which also displayed lower human leucocyte antigen expression 20 days post endotoxin. These changes differed with those observed in septic shock patients. Another long-term effect of experimental  was elevated numbers of effector CD8 cells and an increased percentage of proliferating and cytokine expressing CD8 cells, and these phenomena were also present in sepsis patients.

A recent study indicated that alarmins such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) have drawn attention as therapeutic targets of sepsis. Post-translational modification (i.e., acetylation of lysine residues) of HMGB1 leads to the release of HMGB1 into the cellular space, operating as a warning signal that induces inflammation. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been shown to negatively regulate HMGB1 hyperacetylation and its extracellular release in sepsis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the S-nitrosylation (SNO) of SIRT1 may disrupt the ability of SIRT1 to negatively regulate the hyperacetylation of HMGB1. As long as the S-nitrosylation of SIRT1 occurs during septic conditions, it may worsen the situation. We found that the activity of SIRT1 decreased as the SNO-SIRT1 levels increased, resulting in HMGB1 release by LPS in RAW264.7 cells. Both the iNOS inhibitor (1400 W) and silencing iNOS significantly inhibited SNO-SIRT1, allowing increases in SIRT1 activity that decreased the HMGB1 release by LPS. SNAP, a NO donor, significantly increased both SNO-SIRT1 levels and the HMGB1 release that was accompanied by decreased sirt1 activity. However, sirtinol, a Sirt1 inhibitor, by itself decreased Sirt1 activity compared to that of the control, so that it did not affect already increased SNO-SIRT levels by SNAP. Most importantly, in lung tissues of LPS-endotoxic mice, significantly increased levels of SNO-SIRT were found, which was inhibited by 1400 W treatment. Plasma nitrite and HMGB1 levels were significantly higher than those in the sham controls, and the elevated levels were significantly lowered in the presence of 1400 W. We concluded that the S-nitrosylation of Sirt1 under endotoxic conditions may uninhibit the acetylation of HMGB1 and its extracellular release.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and aminoglycosides share the mechanisms for renal excretion, the predictive power of NGAL was examined towards the changes in amikacin pharmacokinetics during early  in anesthetized Wistar rats.Endogenous biomarkers of inflammation and acute kidney injury were assessed including NGAL in saline-injected controls and two groups of rats challenged with an intravenous injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg)-a fluid-resuscitated group (LPS) and a fluid-resuscitated group infused intravenously with 8 μg/kg/h terlipressin (LPS-T). Sinistrin and amikacin were infused to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and amikacin clearance (CL). The investigations included blood gas analysis, chemistry and hematology tests and assessment of urine output, creatinine clearance (CL) and sinistrin clearance (CL).Within 3 h of injection, systemic and renal inflammatory responses were induced by lipopolysaccharide. Gene and protein expression of NGAL was increased in the kidneys and the concentrations of NGAL in the plasma (pNGAL) and urine rose 4- to 38-fold (P < 0.01).

DCs recognize and respond to bacteria through multiple PRRs, including TLRs. Heat shock protein gp96/grp94 is a master essential chaperone for TLRs in the endoplasmic reticulum. We generated DC-specific gp96-knockout (KO) mice and showed that gp96 KO DCs were unable to respond to multiple TLR ligands. TLR-mediated hyperinflammatory response can lead to sepsis. However, the roles of neither DCs nor the DC-intrinsic gp96 in the process are completely understood. In a LPS-induced sepsis model, we hereby found that deletion of gp96 in DCs significantly reduced serum TNF-α levels and improved survival. Furthermore, using the well-defined polymicrobial sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture, we found that DC-specific ablation of gp96 improved survival with significantly attenuated liver and renal injuries, decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines, altered DC maturation and activation, and increased serum Ig. Collectively, we demonstrate that deletion of gp96 in DCs is beneficial in protecting mice against sepsis induced by both  and polymicrobial infections.

However, current therapies for sepsis treatment are unsatisfactory, and the mortality rate is still high. The main pathological characteristics observed during sepsis syndrome and  include hypotension, tachycardia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), tissue damage, and cytokine and oxidative bursts. These conditions severely decrease the survival rates of endotoxemic patients. As a consequence of , large amounts of endotoxin circulate in the bloodstream throughout the vascular system and interact directly with endothelial cells that cover the inner wall of blood vessels. Endothelial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharides exhibit conversion to activated fibroblasts. By means of endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis, endothelial cells downregulate the expression of endothelial proteins and express fibrotic and ECM markers throughout endothelial protein expression reprogramming.

In the present study, we modeled SAE by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally to mice at a concentration of 3.0 mg/kg. We investigated regional preferences for cytokine-mediated brain reactions to  and at what time point brain inflammation begins, as well as what cytokines are involved in acute brain reactions. Brains were divided into seven parts: cortex (CTX), olfactory system (Olf), hippocampus (Hip), striatum (Str), diencephalon (Die), brain stem (BS), and cerebellum (CBL). In each brain region, we determined the tissue concentrations of 11 cytokines: CCL2, CCL3, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, in mice injected with LPS or saline, at 1, 4, and 24 h after injection using multiplex cytokine assays. Every brain region responded with the production of multiple cytokines to LPS-induced systemic inflammation during the acute phase (4-24 h) after LPS injection. IL-6, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, and TNF-α were "early cytokines" that increased only at 4 h but not at 24 h after LPS injection in most brain regions. CCL11, CXCL10, and G-CSF were "late cytokines" that were elevated up to 24 h after LPS injection in selected brain regions. The regions Olf, Hip, and Die were the most responsive to ; these regions produced ten cytokines and continued to produce three "late cytokines" up to 24 h after LPS injection. Str was the least responsive to . The widespread nature of brain cytokine production explains the characteristics of SAE. Further studies on the roles of CCL11, CXCL10, and G-CSF may be especially important in terms of potential prevention of SAE between 4 and 24 h after the onset of sepsis.Copyright © 2019.

Proanthocyanidins are natural bioactive compounds that could modulate intestinal dysfunction. This study analyzes the protective effects of proanthocyanidins in a rat model of intestinal dysfunction.To investigate the preventive effects of both high dietary (75 mg kg body weight) and pharmacological (375 mg kg body weight) oral doses of proanthocyanidins (GSPE), rat intestinal dysfunction is induced with LPS (i.p.). In vivo intestinal permeability (ovalbumin [OVA] assay) and systemic inflammation and  (TNF-α and LPS plasma levels) are assessed. Intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress are determined using myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase- (COX-) activities, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, respectively. Ileal gene expression of permeability/inflammatory genes is analyzed. LPS administration induces intestinal permeability, inflammation, and oxidative stress. GSPE normalizes in vivo OVA levels. In the small intestine, the GSPE treatment decreases MPO and COX- activities; modulates the ileum inflammatory and permeability proteins gene expression; and in the large intestine, prevents increase of ROS levels.Proanthocyanidins, at nutritional and pharmacological doses, prevents endotoxin-induced-intestinal inflammation, permeability, and oxidative stress in rats differentially in each intestinal section. Proanthocyanidins are nutritional-therapeutic novel candidates for preventing intestinal dysfunction.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In lung ECs, activation of Rho-associated kinase-1 (ROCK1) phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC)-associated phosphatase at its inhibitory site, which favors phosphorylation of MLC, stress fiber formation, and hyperpermeability during acute lung injury. The role of microRNA-144 (miR-144) has been well investigated in many human diseases, including cardiac ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury, lung cancer, and lung viral infection; however, its role in pulmonary EC barrier regulation remains obscure. Here, we investigated the miR-144-mediated mechanism in the protection of endothelial barrier function in an LPS-induced lung injury model. By using transendothelial electrical resistance and transwell permeability assay to examine  permeability and immunofluorescence microscopy to determine barrier integrity, we showed that ectopic expression of miR-144 effectively blocked lung EC barrier disruption and hyperpermeability in response to proinflammatory agents. Furthermore, using a gain-and-loss-of-function strategy, overexpression of miR-144 significantly decreased ROCK1 expression. Concomitantly, miR-144 inhibits ROCK1-mediated phosphorylation of MLC phosphatase and thus phosphorylation of MLC to counteract stress fiber formation in LPS-activated EC. Finally, in LPS-challenged mice, intranasal delivery of miR-144 mimic via liposomes attenuated -induced increases in lung wet/dry ratio, vascular permeability, and inflammation. In conclusion, these data suggest that miR-144-attenuated activation of inflammatory ROCK1/MLC pathway in vascular ECs is a promising therapeutic strategy to counter inflammatory lung injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29807532>LpA-II:B:C:D:E: a new immunochemically-defined acute phase lipoprotein in humans.</a></h2><p>Previous studies of lipoproteins in patients with sepsis have been performed on density fractions isolated by conventional ultracentrifugation that are heterogeneous and provide no information about the cargo of apoproteins present in the immunochemically distinct subclasses that populate the density classes.

In contrast, the third TGRLP, LpA-II:B:C:D:E ("complex particle"), after reaching a nadir at 4 h rose 49% above baseline, p = .006 at 8 h and became the dominant particle in the TGRLP pool. This increment exceeds the threshold of > 25% change required for designation as an acute phase protein. Simultaneous decreases in LpA-I:A-II and LpB:C:E + LpB:E suggest that these subclasses undergo post-translational modification and contribute to the formation of new LpA-II:B:C:D:E particles.We have identified a new acute phase lipoprotein whose apoprotein constituents have metabolic and immunoregulatory properties applicable to host defense that make it well constituted to engage in the APR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623115>Intravascular heavy chain-modification of hyaluronan during endotoxic shock.</a></h2><p>During inflammation, the covalent linking of the ubiquitous extracellular polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) with the heavy chains (HC) of the serum protein inter alpha inhibitor (IαI) is exclusively mediated by the enzyme tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated-gene-6 (TSG-6). While significant advances have been made regarding how HC-modified HA (HC-HA) is an important regulator of inflammation, it remains unclear why HC-HA plays a critical role in promoting survival in intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  while exerting only a modest role in the outcomes following intratracheal exposure to LPS. To address this gap, the two models of intraperitoneal LPS-induced endotoxic shock and intratracheal LPS-induced acute lung injury were directly compared in  knockout mice and littermate controls. HC-HA formation, endogenous TSG-6 activity, and inflammatory markers were assessed in plasma and lung tissue.  knockout mice exhibited accelerated mortality during endotoxic shock. While both intraperitoneal and intratracheal LPS induced HC-HA formation in lung parenchyma, only systemically-induced  increased plasma TSG-6 levels and intravascular HC-HA formation. Cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells secreted TSG-6 in response to both TNFα and IL1β stimulation, indicating that, in addition to inflammatory cells, the endothelium may secrete TSG-6 into circulation during systemic inflammation. These data show for the first time that LPS-induced systemic inflammation is uniquely characterized by significant vascular induction of TSG-6 and HC-HA, which may contribute to improved outcomes of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29978131>Effects of Polymyxin B on Clinical Signs, Serum TNF-α, Haptoglobin and Plasma Lactate Concentrations in Experimental  in Sheep.</a></h2><p>The experiment evaluated the effects of intravenous administration of polymyxin B on experimental  in sheep.Twenty clinically healthy fat-tailed sheep were randomly divided into: a group treated with 6,000 U/kg of polymyxin B, a group at 12,000 U/kg, and positive and negative controls.  was induced by intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from .  serotype O55:B5 at 0.5 μg/kg. polymyxin was infused intravenously along with .5 L of isotonic intravenous fluids at 20 mL/kg/h.

Clinical signs were evaluated before and at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 24, and 48 h after LPS administration. Blood was also sampled at the denoted hours and serum haptoglobin, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and plasma lactate concentrations were assayed.The serum concentration of TNF-α in the positive control group increased significantly up to 48 h after LPS administration. The concentration of TNF-α was significantly different from those of the polymyxin B and positive control groups from 3 to 48 h; also, the concentrations of haptoglobin at different times in the polymyxin groups were lower than those of the positive control group and were significant at hours 3 to 48 (P < 0.05). Following the LPS administration, haptoglobin and TNF-α concentrations changed without significant difference between the two polymyxin B groups.Polymyxin B (6,000 U/kg) restrained blood lactate concentrations.

Circulating lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gut microbiota (metabolic ), proposed as a triggering factor for the low-grade inflammation in obesity, might also be responsible for AT dysfunction. Nevertheless, this hypothesis has not been explored in human obesity. To analyze the relationship between metabolic  and AT markers for lipogenesis, lipid handling, and inflammation in human obesity, 33 patients with obesity scheduled for surgery were recruited and classified according to their LPS levels. Visceral and subcutaneous AT gene and protein expression were analyzed and adipocyte and AT in vitro assays performed. Subjects with obesity with a high degree of metabolic  had lower expression of key genes for AT function and lipogenesis ( SREBP1, FABP4, FASN, and LEP) but higher expression of inflammatory genes in visceral and subcutaneous AT than subjects with low LPS levels. In vitro experiments corroborated that LPS are responsible for adipocyte and AT inflammation and downregulation of PPARG, SCD, FABP4, and LEP expression and LEP secretion. Thus, metabolic  influences AT physiology in human obesity by decreasing the expression of factors involved in AT lipid handling and function as well as by increasing inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30184534>Combined Enteral and Parenteral Glutamine Supplementation in Endotoxemic Swine: Effects on Portal and Systemic Circulation Levels.</a></h2><p>To measure plasma glutamine (GLN) levels in systemic and portal circulation after combined enteral and parenteral administration in early endotoxemic swine.

Another 16 swine served as controls. After infusion with LPS or placebo, GLN was administered intravenously, enterally or in combination (0.5 g/kg i.v. plus 0.5 g/kg enterally) over 30 min. At 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 min, blood was drawn from the systemic and portal circulation for colorimetric assessment of GLN.In healthy, placebo-alone swine, GLN levels remained stable throughout the study. Intravenous and combined infusion increased systemic levels (p = 0.001), but after enteral administration alone, a smaller effect was observed (p = 0.026). Portal levels were increased after combined, enteral and intravenous administration (p = 0.001). In , systemic and portal levels decreased significantly. Intravenous and, to a greater extent, combined administration increased systemic levels (p = 0.001), while enteral administration only had a small effect (p = 0.001).

Our review shows that PMX appeared to be effective in improving hemodynamics and respiratory function in septic shock requiring emergency abdominal surgery. Recent large-scale ranomized controlled trialscould not demonstrate whether prognosis is improved by PMX.

At weeks 0 and 9, participants ingested 226 g of yogurt or 216 g of soy pudding before a meal providing 56-60 g fat, 82 g carbohydrate, and 28-30 g protein. Plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), LPS activity, interleukin-6 (IL-6), glucose, triglyceride, and insulin were measured hourly for 4 h to assess differences in postprandial responses between groups by -factor ANOVA.Premeal yogurt consumption prevented the postprandial decrease in sCD14 net incremental area under the curve (net iAUC) by 72% in obese individuals at week 0 (P = 0.0323). YN and YO had ≥40% lower net iAUC of LBP-to-sCD14 ratio and plasma IL-6 concentration than CN and CO, respectively (P < 0.05).

However, there is a little information about genotoxic stress in ovarian follicular cells as well as about the changes in oocyte developmental potential under . So the aim of our study was to investigate in vitro oocyte maturation, the DNA damage and expression of some developmental competence-related genes in follicular cells of mice treated with LPS.LPS (3mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into the mice for 24h, and in vitro maturation of mouse oocyte was determined. The expression levels of genes in cumulus cells were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. DNA damage in granulosa cells was assessed by the alkaline comet assay.LPS injection caused an impairment of oocyte maturation in vitro: the percentage of oocytes reaching metaphase I and metaphase II decreased markedly compared to vehicle control mice. At the same time we observed strong DNA damage in granulosa cells of LPS-treated animals. The  resulted in significantly reduced mRNA expression levels for hyaluronan synthase  (HAS2), cyclooxygenase  (COX2) and Gremlin-1 (GREM1) genes compared with control.Our results obtained in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced female reproductive dysfunction suggest that LPS may affect oocyte quality through the induction of DNA damage and decreasing the cumulus expression of genes associated with cumulus expansion and oocyte maturation, such as HAS2, COX2 and GREM1.Copyright © 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Host iron acquisition by pathogens and systemic inflammatory response are key events in the pathogenesis of sepsis. In sepsis, hepcidin induces iron sequestration to limit iron availability to pathogens. Hepcidin is also known to limit inflammation. Since its role in pathophysiology of sepsis-associated AKI is unknown, we investigated the effect of exogenous hepcidin in endotoxin- and peritonitis-induced pathology and AKI.  C57BL/6 mice were treated with saline or 50-100 µg of hepcidin, pre- and post-LPS injection, or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP, model of peritonitis). Splenectomized mice were challenged with LPS, with and without hepcidin. Mice were euthanized at 24 h after LPS injection and at different time points after CLP. Systemic inflammation and renal injury markers were assessed. Direct effect of hepcidin on renal tubular and endothelial cells was evaluated using endotoxin-induced cytotoxic serum. Role of heavy chain ferritin (H-ferritin) in mediating hepcidin-induced anti-inflammatory effect on LPS stimulated macrophages was evaluated with siRNA studies.  Twenty-four hours pretreatment with hepcidin significantly reduced LPS-induced AKI. Hepcidin ameliorated LPS-induced increase in serum TNFα and renal Cox-, and prevented loss in PGC1α and cytochrome c oxidase activity. This was associated with reduced glomerular injury and preserved mitochondrial structure. Hepcidin did not exert direct protection on the renal parenchymal cells but reduced endotoxin-induced serum cytotoxicity to mitigate renal injury. Splenectomy reduced LPS-induced early inflammation and AKI, independent of hepcidin, indicating the importance of systemic inflammation. Higher splenic H-ferritin in hepcidin-treated animals was associated with reduced splenocytes apoptosis and inflammation. Hepcidin reduced LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in macrophages in H-ferritin dependent manner. Hepcidin significantly reduced CLP-induced AKI, and mortality (20% hepcidin treated vs 80% PBS treated). Importantly hepcidin reduced bacteremia and AKI even when administered after onset of sepsis.  We demonstrate a protective role of hepcidin in endotoxin- and peritonitis-induced pathologies and AKI, exerted primarily through its anti-inflammatory effects, and antibacterial property. Macrophage H-ferritin plays an important role in hepcidin-mediated protection against endotoxin-induced inflammation. We uncover a novel prophylactic and therapeutic role of hepcidin in sepsis-associated bacteremia, AKI, and mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29787304>Deterioration of Regional Lung Strain and Inflammation during Early Lung Injury.</a></h2><p>The contribution of aeration heterogeneity to lung injury during early mechanical ventilation of uninjured lungs is unknown.To test the hypotheses that a strategy consistent with clinical practice does not protect from worsening in lung strains during the first 24 hours of ventilation of initially normal lungs exposed to mild systemic  in supine versus prone position, and that local neutrophilic inflammation is associated with local strain and blood volume at global strains below a proposed injurious threshold.Voxel-level aeration and tidal strain were assessed by computed tomography in sheep ventilated with low Vt and positive end-expiratory pressure while receiving intravenous endotoxin. Regional inflammation and blood volume were estimated from -deoxy--[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography.Spatial heterogeneity of aeration and strain increased only in supine lungs (P < 0.001), with higher strains and atelectasis than prone at 24 hours. Absolute strains were lower than those considered globally injurious. Strains redistributed to higher aeration areas as lung injury progressed in supine lungs. At 24 hours, tissue-normalized F-FDG uptake increased more in atelectatic and moderately high-aeration regions (>70%) than in normally aerated regions (P < 0.01), with differential mechanistically relevant regional gene expression. F-FDG phosphorylation rate was associated with strain and blood volume. Imaging findings were confirmed in ventilated patients with sepsis.Mechanical ventilation consistent with clinical practice did not generate excessive regional strain in heterogeneously aerated supine lungs. However, it allowed worsening of spatial strain distribution in these lungs, associated with increased inflammation.

Although intravenous cefotaxime and tobramycin were administered, her fever persisted and her C-reactive protein level increased to 307 mg/L. On day 3 of admission, she demonstrated abnormal neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as delirium, ataxia, and word salad.

Yet, it is mostly assessed with histograms or large regions-of-interest. Spatial heterogeneity could also influence regional gene expression. We used positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to assess the contribution of different length-scales to mechanical heterogeneity and to direct lung injury biological pathway identification.Sheep exposed to mild (n = 5, supine and n = 3, prone) and moderate (n = 6, supine) systemic  were protectively ventilated. At baseline, 6 hours and 20 hours length-scale analysis was applied to aeration in CT (mild groups) and PET transmission (moderate group) scans; and voxel-level strain derived from image registration of end-inspiratory and end-expiratory CTs (mild). -deoxy--[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (F-FDG)-PET kinetics parameters in ventral and dorsal regions were correlated with tissue microarray gene expression (moderate).While aeration and strain heterogeneity were highest at 5-10 mm length-scales, larger length-scales contained a higher fraction of strain than aeration heterogeneity. Contributions of length-scales >5-10 mm to aeration and strain heterogeneity increased as lung injury progressed (p < 0.001) and were higher in supine than prone animals. Genes expressed with regional correlation to F-FDG-PET kinetics (|r| = 0.81 [0.78-0.85]) yielded pathways associated with immune system activation and fluid clearance.Normal spatial heterogeneity of aeration and strain suggest larger anatomical and functional determinants of lung strain than aeration heterogeneity. Lung injury and supine position increase the contribution of larger length-scales.

Secondary lymphoid organs are highly innervated by sympathetic neurons that secrete norepinephrine (NE) as the primary neurotransmitter. Immune cells express adrenergic receptors, enabling the sympathetic nervous system to directly control immune function. NE is a potent immunosuppressive factor and markedly inhibits TNF-α secretion from innate cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we demonstrate that NE blocks the secretion of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines by rapidly inducing IL-10 secretion from innate cells in response to multiple Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals. NE mediated these effects exclusively through the β-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). Consequently, Adrb2 animals were more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection and to intestinal inflammation in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis. Further, Adrb2 animals rapidly succumbed to  in response to a sub-lethal LPS challenge and exhibited elevated serum levels of TNF-α and reduced IL-10. LPS-mediated lethality in WT animals was rescued by administering a β -specific agonist and in Adrb2 animals by exogenous IL-10. These findings reveal a critical role for ADRB2 signaling in controlling inflammation through the rapid induction of IL-10. Our findings provide a fundamental insight into how the sympathetic nervous system controls a critical facet of immune function through ADRB2 signaling.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Lipopolysaccharide decreased glomerular filtration rate and slowed intraproximal tubular flow rate, as measured by in vivo imaging. Fluid resuscitation restored glomerular filtration rate but not tubular flow rate. Adding atrial natriuretic peptide to fluid resuscitation improved both glomerular filtration rate and tubular flow rate. Mice lacking guanylyl cyclase A in either proximal tubules or endothelium demonstrated less improvement of tubular flow rate when treated with atrial natriuretic peptide, compared with control mice. Deletion of endothelial, but not proximal tubular, guanylyl cyclase A augmented the reduction of glomerular filtration rate by lipopolysaccharide.Both endogenous and exogenous natriuretic peptides prevent lipopolysaccharide-induced oliguria by activating guanylyl cyclase A in proximal tubules and endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29980651>Mechanisms Underlying Increased TIMP2 and IGFBP7 Urinary Excretion in Experimental AKI.</a></h2><p>Recent clinical data support the utility/superiority of a new AKI biomarker ("NephroCheck"), the arithmetic product of urinary TIMP × IGFBP7 concentrations. However, the pathophysiologic basis for its utility remains ill defined.To clarify this issue, CD-1 mice were subjected to either nephrotoxic (glycerol, maleate) or ischemic AKI. Urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 concentrations were determined at 4 and 18 hours postinjury and compared with urinary albumin levels. Gene transcription was assessed by measuring renal cortical and/or medullary TIMP2/IGFBP7 mRNAs (4 and 18 hours after AKI induction). For comparison, the mRNAs of three renal "stress" biomarkers (NGAL, heme oxygenase 1, and p21) were assessed. Renal cortical TIMP2/IGFBP7 protein was gauged by ELISA. Proximal tubule-specific TIMP2/IGFBP7 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Each AKI model induced prompt (4 hours) and marked urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 increases without an increase in renal cortical concentrations. Furthermore, TIMP2/IGFBP7 mRNAs remained at normal levels.  also failed to increase TIMP2/IGFBP7 mRNAs. In contrast, each AKI model provoked massive NGAL, HO-1, and p21 mRNA increases, confirming that a renal "stress response" had occurred. Urinary albumin rose up to 100-fold and strongly correlated (=0.87-0.91) with urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 concentrations. Immunohistochemistry showed progressive TIMP2/IGFBP7 losses from injured proximal tubule cells. Competitive inhibition of endocytic protein reabsorption in normal mice tripled urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 levels, confirming this pathway's role in determining urinary excretion.AKI-induced urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 elevations are not due to stress-induced gene transcription. Rather, increased filtration, decreased tubule reabsorption, and proximal tubule cell TIMP2/IGFBP7 urinary leakage seem to be the most likely mechanisms.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30009813>Additive counteraction by α7 and α4β-nAChRs of the hypotension and cardiac sympathovagal imbalance evoked by  in male rats.</a></h2><p>The cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway favorably influences end organ damage induced by inflammatory conditions. Here, we hypothesized that α7 and/or α4β-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) protect against cardiovascular and autonomic imbalances induced by  in rats. We assessed dose-effect relationships of i.v. nicotine (25, 50, or 100 μg/kg), PHA-543613 (α7-nAChR agonist; 0. or .0 mg/kg), or 5-iodo-A-85380 (5IA, α4β-nAChRs agonist; 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg) on cardiovascular and inflammatory responses elicited by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg i.v.). The two lower doses of nicotine caused dose-dependent attenuation of hypotensive and tachycardic responses of LPS. Nicotine also reversed LPS-evoked reductions in time-domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV) and spectral measure of cardiac sympathovagal balance. Alternatively, hypotensive and tachycardic effects of LPS were (i) partly and dose-dependently reversed after selective activation of α7 (PHA) or α4β-nAChRs (5IA), and (ii) completely eliminated after co-treatment with the smaller doses of the two agonists. Further, PHA or 5IA abolished the reducing effect of LPS on time and spectral measures of HRV. Elevations in serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) observed in LPS-treated rats were compromised upon co-administration of nicotine, PHA, or 5IA.

Thus, the objectives were to characterize effects of chronic  on production parameters and follicular development in estrous-synchronized lactating cows. Eleven Holstein cows (169 ± 20 d in milk; 681 ± 16 kg of body weight) were acclimated to their environmental surroundings for 3 d and then enrolled in  experimental periods (P). During P1 (3 d) cows consumed feed ad libitum and baseline samples were obtained. During P2 (7 d), cows were assigned to continuous infusion of either (1) saline-infused and pair-fed (CON-PF; 40 mL/h of saline i.v.; n = 5) or () LPS infused and ad libitum fed (LPS-AL; Escherichia coli O55:B5; 0.017, 0.020, 0.026, 0.036, 0.055, 0.088, and 0.148 μg/kg of body weight/h i.v. on d 1 to 7, respectively; n = 6). Controls were pair-fed to the LPS-AL group to eliminate confounding effects of dissimilar nutrient intake. Infusing LPS temporally caused mild hyperthermia on d 1 to 3 (+0.49°C) relative to baseline. Dry matter intake of LPS-AL cows decreased (28%) on d 1 of P2, then progressively returned to baseline. Relative to baseline, milk yield from LPS-AL cows was decreased on d 1 of P2 (12%). No treatment differences were observed in milk yield during P2. Follicular growth, dominant follicle size, serum progesterone (P4), and follicular P4 and 17β-estradiol concentrations were similar between treatments. Serum 17β-estradiol tended to increase (115%) and serum amyloid A and LPS-binding protein were increased (118 and 40%, respectively) in LPS-AL relative to CON-PF cows. Compared with CON-PF, neutrophils in LPS-AL cows were initially increased (45%), then gradually decreased. In contrast, monocytes were initially decreased (40%) and progressively increased with time in the LPS-AL cows. Hepatic mRNA abundance of cytochrome P450 family  subfamily C (CYP2C) or CYP3A was not affected by LPS, nor was there a treatment effect on toll-like receptor 4 or LBP; however, acyloxyacyl hydrolase and RELA subunit of nuclear factor kappa B tended to be increased in LPS-AL cows. These data suggest lactating dairy cows become tolerant to chronic and exponentially increasing LPS infusion in terms of production and reproductive parameters.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Prolonged MV induces diaphragmatic dysfunction in non-septic animals, but few reports describe the effects of prolonged MV in sepsis. We hypothesized that prolonged MV is not protective but worsens the diaphragmatic dysfunction induced by a mild sepsis, because MV and sepsis share key signaling mechanisms, such as cytokine upregulation.We studied the impact of prolonged MV (12 h) in four groups (n = 8) of male Wistar rats: 1)  induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, ) MV without , 3) combination of  and MV and 4) sham control. Diaphragm mechanical performance, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6) in plasma were measured.Prolonged MV and sepsis independtly reduced maximum diaphragm force (-27%, P = 0.003; -37%, P<0.001; respectively). MV and sepsis acted additively to further decrease diaphragm force (-62%, P<0.001). Similar results were observed for diaphragm kinetics (maximum lengthening velocity -47%, P<0.001). Sepsis and MV reduced diaphragm cross sectional area of type I and IIx fibers, which was further increased by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Sepsis and MV were individually associated with the presence of a robust perimysial inflammatory infiltrate, which was more marked when sepsis and MV were both present (all P<0.05). Sepsis and, to a lesser extent, MV increased proinflammatory cytokine production in plasma and diaphragm (all P<0.05); proinflammatory cytokine expression in plasma was increased further by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Maximum diaphragm force correlated negatively with plasma and diaphragmatic cytokine production (all p<0.05).Prolonged (12 h) MV exacerbated sepsis-induced decrease in diaphragm performance. Systemic and diaphragmatic overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to diaphragm weakness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29743160>Microbiome and Cardiovascular Disease in CKD.</a></h2><p>Patients with CKD exhibit a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular mortality, which likely stems from the presence of unique, nontraditional risk factors that accompany deteriorating kidney function. Mounting evidence suggests that alterations to the intestinal microbiome in CKD may serve as one such risk factor. The human intestinal tract is home to >100 trillion micro-organisms made up of a collection of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic species. These species along with their local environment constitute the intestinal microbiome. Patients with CKD show intestinal dysbiosis, an alteration of the gut micro-organism composition and function. Recent evidence links byproducts of intestinal dysbiosis to vascular calcification, atherosclerosis formation, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CKD. CKD-associated intestinal dysbiosis may also be accompanied by defects in intestinal barrier function, which could further enhance the negative effects of pathogenic intestinal bacteria in the human host. Thus, intestinal dysbiosis, defective intestinal barrier function, and a reduced capacity for clearance by the kidney of absorbed bacterial byproducts may all potentiate the development of cardiovascular disease in CKD. This narrative review focuses on microbiome-mediated mechanisms associated with CKD that may promote atherosclerosis formation and cardiovascular disease. It includes () new data supporting the hypothesis that intestinal barrier dysfunction leads to bacterial translocation and  that potentiate systemic inflammation, () information on the accumulation of dietary-derived bacterial byproducts that stimulate pathways promoting atheromatous changes in arteries and cardiovascular disease, and () potential interventions. Despite great scientific interest in and a rapidly growing body of literature on the relationship between the microbiome and cardiovascular disease in CKD, many important questions remain unanswered.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487562>Importance of gut microbiota in obesity.</a></h2><p>Recently, a number of studies have related the development of highly prevalent disorders such as type  diabetes and obesity to gut microbiota. Obesity itself have been associated with modifications in gut microbiota composition, and a tendency towards an overgrowth of microorganisms that obtain more efficient energy from diet. It's capacity to decompose the polysaccharides that can not be digested by the host, increase monosaccharide and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. However, the increase in fat mass is not only due to a more efficient harvest of energy, but also the microbiota participates in changes in , bowel permeability, insulin resistance, hormonal environment, expression of genes regulating lipogenesis, interaction with bile acids, as well as changes in the proportion of brown adipose tissue, and effects associated with the use of drugs such as metformin. Currently, use of prebiotics and probiotics and other innovative techniques like antibiotic therapy or gut microbiota transplant, has been proposed as suitable tools to control the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity or insulin resistance through the diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29882682>Unintended Consequences: Fluid Resuscitation Worsens Shock in an Ovine Model of .</a></h2><p>Fluid resuscitation is widely considered a life-saving intervention in septic shock; however, recent evidence has brought both its safety and efficacy in sepsis into question.In this study, we sought to compare fluid resuscitation with vasopressors with the use of vasopressors alone in a hyperdynamic model of ovine .Endotoxemic shock was induced in 16 sheep, after which they received fluid resuscitation with 40 ml/kg of 0.9% saline or commenced hemodynamic support with protocolized noradrenaline and vasopressin. Microdialysis catheters were inserted into the arterial circulation, heart, brain, kidney, and liver to monitor local metabolism. Blood samples were recovered to measure serum inflammatory cytokines, creatinine, troponin, atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and hyaluronan. All animals were monitored and supported for 12 hours after fluid resuscitation.After resuscitation, animals that received fluid resuscitation required significantly more noradrenaline to maintain the same mean arterial pressure in the subsequent 12 hours (68.9 mg vs. 39.6 mg; P = 0.04). Serum cytokines were similar between groups. Atrial natriuretic peptide increased significantly after fluid resuscitation compared with that observed in animals managed without fluid resuscitation (335 ng/ml [256-382] vs. 233 ng/ml [144-292]; P = 0.04). Cross-sectional time-series analysis showed that the rate of increase of the glycocalyx glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan was greater in the fluid-resuscitated group over the course of the study (P = 0.02).Fluid resuscitation resulted in a paradoxical increase in vasopressor requirement. Additionally, it did not result in improvements in any of the measured microcirculatory- or organ-specific markers measured. The increase in vasopressor requirement may have been due to endothelial/glycocalyx damage secondary to atrial natriuretic peptide-mediated glycocalyx shedding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571343>Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei Reduce Gut Microbial Lipopolysaccharide Production and Inhibit Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>It is increasingly recognized that gut microbiota play a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Previously, we have reported that the abundance of genus Bacteroides is lower in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than in patients without CAD with coronary risk factors or in healthy volunteers. However, it remains unclear which and how specific gut bacteria contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis.We recruited patients with CAD patients and controls without CAD with coronary risk factors. We then compared gut microbial composition using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in fecal samples to detect species with differential abundance between  groups. Subsequently, we used atherosclerosis-prone mice to study the mechanisms underlying the relationship between such species and atherosclerosis.Human fecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed a significantly lower abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei in patients with CAD. This significant differential abundance was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gavage with live B. vulgatus and B. dorei attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone mice, markedly ameliorating  followed by decreasing gut microbial lipopolysaccharide production, effectively suppressing proinflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, fecal lipopolysaccharide levels in patients with CAD were significantly higher and negatively correlated with the abundance of B. vulgatus and B. dorei.Our translational research findings identify a previously unknown link between specific gut bacteria and atherosclerosis.

It is known that bone marrow derived macrophages are important in resolving the inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Here, we hypothesize that treatment in combination of DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-Aza -deoxycytidine (Aza) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Trichostatin A (TSA) mitigates the inflammation induced pyroptosis and apoptosis during  induced ALI. To test this hypothesis, the mice challenged with a sublethal dose of LPS followed by one-hour post-treatment with a single dose of Aza and TSA intraperitoneally showed a substantial attenuation of apoptosis and inflammation. Importantly, we observed significant changes in the mitochondrial membrane structure, and lower levels of DNA fragmentation, reduced expression of apoptotic and pyroptotic genes both transcriptionally and translationally in LPS induced BMDMs treated by a combination of Aza and TSA than in LPS-induced BMDMs treated with either drug alone. The protection was mediated by an inhibition of JNK-ERK and STAT3-JMJD3 activated pathways. Thus, targeting these important signaling pathways with the combination of Aza and TSA would be a good treatment modality for ALI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously observed that supplementation with anthocyanins (AC) (particularly glycosides of cyanidin and delphinidin) mitigated high fat diet (HFD)-induced development of obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and steatosis in C57BL/6J mice. This paper investigated whether these beneficial effects could be related to AC capacity to sustain intestinal monolayer integrity, prevent , and HFD-associated dysbiosis. The involvement of redox-related mechanisms were further investigated in Caco- cell monolayers. Consumption of a HFD for 14 weeks caused intestinal permeabilization and , which were associated with a decreased ileum expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1), increased expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX1 and NOX4) and NOS2 and oxidative stress, and activation of redox sensitive signals (NF-κB and ERK1/) that regulate TJ dynamics. AC supplementation mitigated all these events and increased GLP- levels, the intestinal hormone that upregulates TJ protein expression. AC also prevented, in vitro, tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization, NOX1/4 upregulation, oxidative stress, and NF-κB and ERK activation. HFD-induced obesity in mice caused dysbiosis and affected the levels and secretion of MUC2, a mucin that participates in intestinal cell barrier protection and immune response. AC supplementation restored microbiota composition and MUC2 levels and distribution in HFD-fed mice. Thus, AC, particularly delphinidin and cyanidin, can preserve GI physiology in HFD-induced obesity in part through redox-regulated mechanisms. This can in part explain AC capacity to mitigate pathologies, i.e. insulin resistance and steatosis, associated with HFD-associated obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Increased intestinal permeability is an important event leading to . This study aims to elucidate the possible association between endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) and zonulin (a biomarker of intestinal permeability) levels and the risk of coronary heart disease, and thus healthy aging. Serum levels of zonulin, lipopolysaccharide and soluble CD14 (a protein that binds lipopolysaccharide) were measured in disease-free centenarians, young healthy controls and patients with precocious acute myocardial infarction. Disease-free centenarians had significantly lower levels of serum zonulin (<0.01) and lipopolysaccharide (<0.001) than young patients with acute myocardial infarction, and had significantly lower concentrations of serum lipopolysaccharide than young healthy controls (<0.05). No significant differences were found for soluble CD14 between groups.

During sepsis, endothelial permeability is severely augmented, contributing to renal dysfunction and patient mortality. Ca influx and the subsequent increase in intracellular [Ca] in endothelial cells (ECs) are key steps in the establishment of endothelial hyperpermeability. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) ion channels are permeable to Ca and are expressed in a broad range of cell types and tissues, including ECs and kidneys. However, the role of TRPM7 on endothelial hyperpermeability during sepsis has remained elusive. Therefore, we investigated the participation of TRPM7 in renal vascular hyperpermeability, renal dysfunction, and enhanced mortality induced by . Our results showed that endotoxin increases endothelial hyperpermeability and Ca overload through the TLR4/NOX-/ROS/NF-κB pathway. Moreover, endotoxin exposure was shown to downregulate the expression of VE-cadherin, compromising monolayer integrity and enhancing vascular hyperpermeability. Notably, endotoxin-induced endothelial hyperpermeability was substantially inhibited by pharmacological inhibition and specific suppression of TRPM7 expression. The endotoxin was shown to upregulate the expression of TRPM7 via the TLR4/NOX-/ROS/NF-κB pathway and induce a TRPM7-dependent EC Ca overload. Remarkably, in vivo experiments performed in endotoxemic animals showed that pharmacological inhibition and specific suppression of TRPM7 expression inhibits renal vascular hyperpermeability, prevents kidney dysfunction, and improves survival in endotoxemic animals. Therefore, our results showed that TRPM7 mediates -induced endothelial hyperpermeability, renal dysfunction, and enhanced mortality, revealing a novel molecular target for treating renal vascular hyperpermeability and kidney dysfunction during , sepsis, and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885503>Circulating plasma microRNAs dysregulation and metabolic  induced by a high-fat high-saturated diet.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet increase two to three times the plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and induce subclinical inflammation. Diet can modify gene expression due to epigenetic processes related to MicroRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in the post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in regulation of expression of genes related to the inflammatory response. Also, diet can indirectly induce post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs, which may affect the risk for the development of chronic diseases.This study investigated the effect of high-fat high-saturated meal ingestion on plasma miRNA expression and LPS levels during the postprandial period in healthy women.An interventional study was carried out in which a high-fat breakfast (1067.45 kcal), composed mainly of saturated fatty acids (56 g), and 500 mL of water, was offered. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 1, 3 and 5 h after meal intake. The studied population consisted of healthy women (n = 11), aged between 20 and 40 years, and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25 kg/m. Plasma levels of lipid profile, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and LPS were measured at the 3 time points. A profile of 752 human plasma miRNA expression was analyzed by real-time PCR assay. These analyzes were performed for all blood collection time-points.Expression profile analysis revealed 33 differentially expressed plasma circulating miRNAs compared to that of the control group. MiR-145-5p and miR-200 were differentially modulated in all time-points post meal consumption. In addition, there was a significant increase in plasma LPS, triglycerides, myristic and palmitic saturated fatty acids levels at the 3 time-points in comparison with the control basal levels. We also observed increased levels of the plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) cytokine and the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) levels after 5 h post meal ingestion.Ingestion of high-fat high-saturated meal was able to induce metabolic  and increase the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNF-alpha and VCAM-1, as well as modulating circulating miRNAs possibly controlling inflammatory and lipid metabolism proteins at the postprandial period.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We speculated that blocking HMGA1-mediated pathways might improve outcomes from sepsis. To investigate HMGA1 further, we developed genetically modified mice expressing a dominant negative (dn) form of HMGA1 targeted to the vasculature. In dnHMGA1 transgenic (Tg) mice, endogenous HMGA1 is present, but its function is decreased due to the mutant transgene. These mice allowed us to specifically study the importance of HMGA1 not only during a purely pro-inflammatory insult of , but also during microbial sepsis induced by implantation of a bacterial-laden fibrin clot into the peritoneum. We found that the dnHMGA1 transgene was only present in Tg and not wild-type (WT) littermate mice, and the mutant transgene was able to interact with transcription factors (such as NF-κB), but was not able to bind DNA. Tg mice exhibited a blunted hypotensive response to , and less mortality in microbial sepsis. Moreover, Tg mice had a reduced inflammatory response during sepsis, with decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into tissues, which was associated with reduced expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-.

Citrulline (Cit), which has been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in other situations, may be of interest in this setting. Our aim was to assess the effect of Cit in three catabolic models relevant to critical illness:  (LPS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and TBI with infectious complications (TBI-Ec), which are characterized by different alterations in protein homeostasis. Fifty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g) were randomized to receive a standard diet ad libitum (CON, n = 9) or to undergo catabolic injuries on day 0 (D0, n = 49), and EN (Sondalis HP energy® 290 kcal/kg/d) from day 1 (D1) combined with Cit ( g/kg/d) or isonitrogenous non-essential AAs (NEAAs) until day 3 (D3).  was induced by IP injection of LPS from E. coli (3 mg/kg), TBI by hydraulic percussion, and infectious complications (TBI-Ec) by administration of luminescent E. coli on D1. Nitrogen balance (ΔN) and 3-methylhistidine (3-MHis) were measured daily. Muscle protein synthesis (MPS, measured by the SUnSET method) and mTORC1 activation (S6K-1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation) were measured on D3  h after the arrest of enteral nutrition in soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius and tibialis muscles. ΔN was lower (p < 0.001) in all three models of injury compared with basal and CON from D1 to D3, and more negative in the LPS-CIT (p < 0.05) than in the LPS group. The 3-MHis/creatinine ratio was significantly increased on D1 in all groups compared with CON, and on D2 only in the LPS and TBI groups (p < 0.0001, LPS and TBI vs. CON). MPS was similar in all groups in soleus and tibialis but significantly higher in EDL in LPS-CIT [LPS-CIT: 4.5 ± 1.7 (mean ± SD) vs. CON: .3 ± 1.; and vs. LPS-NEAA: 3.1 ± .3] and in gastrocnemius (LPS-CIT vs. CON; p = 0.05). S6K-1 phosphorylation in the EDL was also higher in LPS-CIT vs. CON (LPS-CIT: 0.94 ± 0.51 CON: 0.42 ± 0.28), but not in gastrocnemius. IL-6 plasma level was significantly higher in all the catabolic groups vs. CON (p < 0.005) with no difference between treatments (Cit or NEAAs). In conclusion, the TBI model showed only a rise in muscle proteolysis, whereas the LPS model displayed a rise in both protein synthesis and proteolysis. Secondly, our results show that the Cit effect varies according to the type of injury and to the muscle under study. The stimulation of MPS rate and the mTOR pathway in LPS-treated rats contrasts with degraded ΔN, suggesting that the Cit effect on protein metabolism in critically ill rats is limited at the whole-body level.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Mice were treated with uridine (30 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection [i.p.]) or saline solution of LPS (.5 mg/kg, i. p.). Endotoxin increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-, and IL-6 by .1-, 1.9-, 1.7-, 1.6-, and .3-fold, respectively. Prior treatment with uridine prevented LPS-induced increases in all studied cytokines. In splenic lymphocytes, LPS treatment increased the expression of HSP 72 by .4-fold, whereas preliminary treatment with uridine completely prevented this effect. LPS also activated NF-κB signaling in splenic lymphocytes, and uridine decreased NF-κB pathway activity. Inhibitory analysis showed that the mechanism of uridine action was associated with the formation of the UDP-metabolic activator of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel (mitoK) and the UTP-activator of glycogen synthesis in the tissues. A specific inhibitor of mitoK, 5-hydroxydecanoate (5 mg/kg), and an inhibitor of glycogen synthesis, galactosamine (110 mg/kg), prevented the effects of uridine. Thus, uridine itself or uridine phosphates, which increased after uridine treatment, appeared to inhibit pro-inflammatory responses induced by LPS application. Overall, these findings demonstrated that the mechanisms mediating the effects of uridine were regulated by activation of glycogen synthesis and opening of the mitoK, which in turn increased the energy potential of the cell and reduced oxidative stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that hypoglycemia activates the innate immune system, which is known to increase cardiovascular risk.To determine whether hypoglycemia modifies subsequent innate immune system responses.Single-blinded, prospective study of three independent parallel groups.Twenty-four healthy participants underwent either a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic (.5 mmol/L), euglycemic (6.0 mmol/L), or sham-saline clamp (n = 8 for each group). After 48 hours, all participants received low-dose (0.3 ng/kg) intravenous endotoxin.We studied in-vivo monocyte mobilization and monocyte-platelet interactions.Hypoglycemia increased total leukocytes (9.98 ± 1.14 × 109/L vs euglycemia 4.38 ± 0.53 × 109/L, P < 0.001; vs sham-saline 4.76 ± 0.36 × 109/L, P < 0.001) (mean ± SEM), mobilized proinflammatory intermediate monocytes (42.20 ± 7.52/μL vs euglycemia 20.66 ± 3.43/μL, P < 0.01; vs sham-saline 26.20 ± 3.86/μL, P < 0.05), and nonclassic monocytes (36.16 ± 4.66/μL vs euglycemia 12.72 ± .42/μL, P < 0.001; vs sham-saline 19.05 ± 3.81/μL, P < 0.001). Following hypoglycemia vs euglycemia, platelet aggregation to agonist (area under the curve) increased (73.87 ± 7.30 vs 52.50 ± 4.04, P < 0.05) and formation of monocyte-platelet aggregates increased (96.05 ± 14.51/μL vs 49.32 ± 6.41/μL, P < 0.05). Within monocyte subsets, hypoglycemia increased aggregation of intermediate monocytes (10.51 ± 1.42/μL vs euglycemia 4.19 ± 1.08/μL, P < 0.05; vs sham-saline 3.81± 1.42/μL, P < 0.05) and nonclassic monocytes (9.53 ± 1.08/μL vs euglycemia .86 ± 0.72/μL, P < 0.01; vs sham-saline 3.08 ± 1.01/μL, P < 0.05), with platelets compared with controls. Hypoglycemia led to greater leukocyte mobilization in response to subsequent low-dose endotoxin challenge (10.96 ± 0.97 vs euglycemia 8.21 ± 0.85 × 109/L, P < 0.05).Hypoglycemia mobilizes monocytes, increases platelet reactivity, promotes interaction between platelets and proinflammatory monocytes, and potentiates the subsequent immune response to endotoxin. These changes may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk observed in people with diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29942089>Genetic deficiency of indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase promotes gut microbiota-mediated metabolic health.</a></h2><p>The association between altered gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, inflammation and cardiometabolic diseases is becoming increasingly clear but remains poorly understood. Indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase is an enzyme induced in many types of immune cells, including macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli, and catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. Indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase activity is better known for its suppression of effector T cell immunity and its activation of regulatory T cells. However, high indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase activity predicts worse cardiovascular outcome and may promote atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation, suggesting a more complex role in chronic inflammatory settings. Indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase activity is also increased in obesity, yet its role in metabolic disease is still unexplored. Here, we show that obesity is associated with an increase of intestinal indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase activity, which shifts tryptophan metabolism from indole derivative and interleukin-22 production toward kynurenine production. Indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase deletion or inhibition improves insulin sensitivity, preserves the gut mucosal barrier, decreases  and chronic inflammation, and regulates lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. These beneficial effects are due to rewiring of tryptophan metabolism toward a microbiota-dependent production of interleukin-22 and are abrogated after treatment with a neutralizing anti-interleukin-22 antibody. In summary, we identify an unexpected function of indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase in the fine tuning of intestinal tryptophan metabolism with major consequences on microbiota-dependent control of metabolic disease, which suggests indoleamine ,3-dioxygenase as a potential therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29755842>Lipopolysaccharide  induces amyloid-β and p-tau formation in the rat brain.</a></h2><p>Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques are not specific to Alzheimer's disease and occur with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Soluble brain Aβ may be neuroprotective and increases in response to neuroinflammation. Sepsis is associated with neurocognitive compromise. The objective was to determine, in a rat  model of sepsis, whether neuroinflammation and soluble Aβ production are associated with Aβ plaque and hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the brain. Male Sprague Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS). Brain and blood levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα and cortical microglial density were measured in LPS-injected and control animals. Soluble brain Aβ and p-tau were compared and Aβ plaques were quantified and characterized. Brain uptake of [F]flutemetamol was measured by phosphor imaging. LPS  resulted in elevations of cytokines in blood and brain. Microglial density was increased in LPS-treated rats relative to controls. LPS resulted in increased soluble Aβ and in p-tau levels in whole brain. Progressive increases in morphologically-diffuse Aβ plaques occurred throughout the interval of observation (to 7-9 days post LPS). LPS  resulted in increased [F]flutemetamol in the cortex and increased cortex: white matter ratios of activity. In conclusion, LPS  causes neuroinflammation, increased soluble Aβ and Aβ diffuse plaques in the brain. Aβ PET tracers may inform this neuropathology. Increased p-tau in the brain of LPS treated animals suggests that downstream consequences of Aβ plaque formation may occur. Further mechanistic and neurocognitive studies to understand the causes and consequences of LPS-induced neuropathology are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660669>PCSK9 decreases during Experimental .</a></h2><p>We read Rannikko et al.'s article about proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels in patients with bacteremia [1] with great interest. In these patients PCSK9 levels were increased compared to healthy controls, which is in line with other published data and probably caused by the associated inflammatory response []. Interestingly, within the patient cohort, patients with lower PCSK9 levels were more likely to die at day 7, 28 and 90, which was surprising, because in contrast to this Boyd et al. reported that high PCSK9 levels were associated with organ failure in septic patients in the emergency department [].

Intestinal absorption of bacterial components activates the toll-like receptors inducing inflammation, and this in turn IR. We evaluated the role of  in promoting inflammation-induced insulin resistance (IR) in the development of T2DM, and its usefulness as predictive biomarker.We included in this study 462 patients from the CORDIOPREV study without T2DM at baseline. Of these, 107 patients developed T2DM according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnosis criteria after a median follow-up of 60 months (Incident-DIAB group), whereas 355 patients did not developed it during this period of time (Non-DIAB group).We observed a postprandial increase in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) levels in the Incident-DIAB at baseline (P < 0.001), whereas LPS levels were not modified in the Non-DIAB. Disease-free survival curves based on the LPS postprandial fold change improved T2DM Risk Assessment as compared with the previously described FINDRISC score (hazard ratio of .076, 95% CI 1.149-3.750 vs. 1.384, 95% CI 0.740-.589). Moreover, disease-free survival curves combining the LPS postprandial fold change and FINDRISC score together showed a hazard ratio of 3.835 (95% CI 1.323-11.114), linked to high values of both parameters.Our results suggest that a high postprandial  precedes the development of T2DM. Our results also showed the potential use of LPS plasma levels as a biomarker predictor of T2DM development.

No difference was found in 28-day all-cause mortality. However, the trial showed that in some patients with septic shock the burden of endotoxin activity was extreme (EAA ≥ 0.9). In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated the impact of PMX use in patients with septic shock and endotoxin activity measured between 0.6-0.89.Post-hoc analysis of the EUPHRATES trial for the 194 patients with EAA ≥ 0.6-0.89 who completed two treatments (PMX or sham). The primary end point was mortality at 28 days adjusted for APACHE II score and baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP). Additional end points included changes in MAP, cumulative vasopressor index (CVI), median EAA reduction, ventilator-free days (VFD), dialysis-free days (DFD) and hospital length of stay. Subpopulations analyzed were site and type of infection and those with norepinephrine dose > 0.1 mcg/kg/min at baseline.At 28 days, 23 patients of 88 (26.1%) in the PMX group died versus 39 of 106 (36.8%) in the sham group [risk difference 10.7%, OR 0.52, 95% CI (0.27, 0.99), P = 0.047]. When unadjusted for baseline variables, P = 0.11. The 28-day survival time in the PMX group was longer than for the sham group [HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.33, 0.95) P = 0.03]. PMX treatment compared with sham showed greater change in MAP [median (IQR) 8 mmHg (- 0.5, 19.5) vs. 4 mmHg (- 4.0, 11) P = 0.04] and VFD [median (IQR) 20 days (0.5, 23.5) vs. 6 days (0, 20), P = 0.004]. There were no significant differences in other end points. There was a significant difference in mortality in PMX-treated patients with no bacterial growth on culture [PMX, 6/30 (20%) vs. sham, 13/31 (41.9%), P = 0.005]. The median EAA change in the population was - 12.9% (range: increase 49.%-reduction 86.3%). The mortality in the above median EAA change group was PMX: 6/38 (15.7%) vs. sham 15/49 (30.6%), P = 0.08.These hypothesis-generating results, based on an exploratory post hoc analysis of the EUPHRATES trial, suggest measurable responses in patients with septic shock and an EAA ≥ 0.6 to 0.89 on changes in mean arterial pressure, ventilator-free days and mortality.Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: .

Animals were fed a 17-week cafeteria diet (CAF diet), supplemented with daily GSPE doses (100 or 500 mg kg body weight) during the final two weeks. CAF diet enhanced the intestinal permeation of an orally administered marker (ovalbumin, OVA) and increased the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in -3-fold. Ex vivo Ussing chamber assays showed a 55-70% reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased the TNF-α secretions in both small and large intestinal sections with a 25-fold increment in the ileum. Ileal tissues also presented a 4-fold increase of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Both GSPE-treatments were able to restitute TEER values in the ileum and colon and to reduce plasma LPS to basal levels without a dose-dependent effect.

We hypothesized that tissue-specific mRNA and long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) induction differs between individuals with divergent evoked inflammatory responses.In the GENE Study (Genetics of Evoked Response to Niacin and ), we performed an inpatient endotoxin challenge (1 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) in healthy humans. We selected individuals in the top (high responders) and bottom (low responders) extremes of inflammatory responses and applied RNA sequencing to CD14 monocytes (N=15) and adipose tissue (N=25) before and after LPS administration.Although only a small number of genes were differentially expressed at baseline, there were clear differences in the magnitude of the transcriptional response post-LPS between high and low responders, with a far greater number of genes differentially expressed by  in high responders. Furthermore, tissue responses differed during inflammation, and we found a number of tissue-specific differentially expressed lincRNAs post-LPS, which we validated. Relative to nondifferentially expressed lincRNAs, differentially expressed lincRNAs were equally likely to be nonconserved as conserved between human and mouse, indicating that conservation is not a predictor of lincRNAs associated with human inflammatory pathophysiology. Differentially expressed genes also were enriched for signals with inflammatory and cardiometabolic disease in published genome-wide association studies. CTB-41I6. ( AC002091.1), a nonconserved human-specific lincRNA, is one of the top lincRNAs regulated by  in monocytes, but not in adipose tissue. Knockdown experiments in THP-1 monocytes suggest that this lincRNA enhances LPS-induced interleukin 6 ( IL6) expression in monocytes, and we now refer to this as monocyte LPS-induced lincRNA regulator of IL6 ( MOLRIL6).We highlight mRNAs and lincRNAs that represent novel candidates for modulation of innate immune and metabolic responses in humans.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

In humans, supplementation with EC-rich foods, extracts, and pure EC improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in normal weight, overweight, obese and T2D individuals. These effects of EC are also observed in rodent models of diet-induced obesity and T2D. The events involved in the development of insulin resistance and T2D are multiple and interrelated. EC has been shown to inhibit inflammation, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and to regulate events in the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas that impact glucose homeostasis. A downregulation of oxidant production, particularly through direct inhibition or suppression of NADPH oxidase expression, and of redox sensitive signals (NF-κB, JNK1/) that inhibit the insulin pathway, appear to be central to the beneficial actions of EC on insulin sensitivity. Overall, EC seems to have a positive role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, however definitive answers on its importance for the management of T2D will depend on further clinical and mechanistic studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Therapeutic VNS activates both efferent and afferent fibers; however, the effects attributable to vagal afferent stimulation are unclear. Here, we tested if selective activation of afferent fibers in the abdominal vagus suppresses systemic inflammation. In urethane-anesthetized rats challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 60 µg/kg, i.v.), abdominal afferent VNS ( Hz for 20 min) reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) levels 90 min later by 88% compared with unmanipulated animals. Pre-cutting the cervical vagi blocked this anti-inflammatory action. Interestingly, the surgical procedure to expose and prepare the abdominal vagus for afferent stimulation ('vagal manipulation') also had an anti-inflammatory action. Levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were inversely related to those of TNF. Prior bilateral section of the splanchnic sympathetic nerves reversed the anti-inflammatory actions of afferent VNS and vagal manipulation. Sympathetic efferent activity in the splanchnic nerve was shown to respond reflexly to abdominal vagal afferent stimulation. These data demonstrate that experimentally activating abdominal vagal afferent fibers suppresses systemic inflammation, and that the efferent neural pathway for this action is in the splanchnic sympathetic nerves.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The cycling task comprised of alternating 3 min intervals at a moderate-vigorous intensity (50% and 70% of maximum power output; P) for 30 min, followed by 30 min at moderate intensity (40-50% P). Neuromuscular function was assessed at pre-, post-exercise and 60 min post-exercise. Circulating levels of endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines and markers of gut permeability and damage were also collected at these time points. Heart rate, core temperature, skin temperature, perceived exertion, thermal sensation and comfort were also measured.Post-exercise voluntary activation of HOT (87.9% [85., 90.8]) was statistically lower (mean difference - .5% [- 4.5, - 0.5], d = .50) than that of CON (90.5% [87.8, 93.]). The HOT trial resulted in statistically elevated (+ 69%) markers of gastrointestinal damage compared to CON (mean difference 0.424 ng mL [0.163, 0.684, d = - 3.26]), although this was not observed for endotoxin, other inflammatory markers, or gastrointestinal permeability.This research provides evidence that short-duration cycling in the heat results in sub-optimal neuromuscular activation and increased expression of gastrointestinal damage markers, without a simultaneous elevation in circulating endotoxins or pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946956>Mitochondrial ALDH2 protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction by suppression of ER stress and autophagy.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an essential component of outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria, plays a pivotal role in myocardial anomalies in sepsis. Recent evidence depicted an essential role for mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in cardiac homeostasis. This study examined the effect of ALDH2 on -induced cardiac anomalies. Echocardiographic, cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca properties were examined. Our results indicated that LPS impaired cardiac contractile function (reduced fractional shortening, LV end systolic diameter, peak shortening, maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening, prolonged relengthening duration, oxidation of SERCA, and intracellular Ca mishandling), associated with ER stress, inflammation, O production, increased autophagy, CAMKKβ, phosphorylated AMPK and suppressed phosphorylation of mTOR, the effects of which were significantly attenuated or negated by ALDH2. LPS promoted early endosomal formation (as evidenced by RAB4 and RAB5a), apoptosis and necrosis (MTT and LDH) while decreasing late endosomal formation (RAB7 and RAB 9), the effects were reversed by ALDH2. In vitro study revealed that LPS-induced SERCA oxidation, autophagy and cardiac dysfunction were abrogated by ALDH2 activator Alda-1, the ER chaperone TUDCA, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, or the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. The beneficial effect of Alda-1 against LPS was nullified by AMPK activator AICAR or rapamycin. CAMKKβ inhibition failed to rescue LPS-induced ER stress. Tunicamycin-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction was ameliorated by Alda-1 and autophagy inhibition, the effect of which was abolished by rapamycin. These data suggested that ALDH2 protected against LPS-induced cardiac anomalies via suppression of ER stress, autophagy in a CAMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesised that RIPC may be beneficial by attenuating the systemic inflammatory response. We investigated whether RIPC affects the response in humans to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) by measuring plasma cytokines and renal cell-cycle arrest mediators, which reflect renal tubular stress.Healthy male volunteers were randomised to receive either daily RIPC for 6 consecutive days (RIPC, n=10) plus RIPC during the 40 min preceding i.v. LPS ( ng kg), RIPC only during the 40 min before LPS (RIPC, n=10), or no RIPC preceding LPS (control, n=10). As a surrogate marker of renal tubular stress, the product of urinary concentrations of two cell-cycle arrest markers was calculated (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- [TIMP2]*insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 [IGFBP7]). Data are presented as median (inter-quartile range).In both RIPC groups, RIPC alone increased [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]. LPS administration resulted in fever, flu-like symptoms, and haemodynamic alterations. Plasma cytokine concentrations increased profoundly during  (control group: tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] from 14 [9-16] pg ml at baseline to 480 [284-709] pg ml at 1.5 h after LPS; interleukin-6 [IL-6] from 4 [4-4] pg ml at baseline to 659 [505-1018] pg ml at  h after LPS). LPS administration also increased urinary [TIMP2[*[IGFBP7]. RIPC had no effect on LPS-induced cytokine release or [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7].RIPC neither modulated systemic cytokine release nor attenuated inflammation-induced tubular stress after LPS.

Microvesicles in the RBC product may support coagulation because they have procoagulant effects in vitro. We investigated whether transfusion of RBCs containing extracellular vesicles promotes coagulation in human recipients. As transfusion is mostly administered to ill patients, we used a model of .Eighteen healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either saline or fresh ( days stored) or stored autologous (35 days stored) RBC transfusion (Dutch Trial Register: NTR4455). Two hours after infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from Escherichia coli,  ng/kg body weight), subjects received either saline or fresh or stored RBCs. Blood was sampled every  hours up to 8 hours after LPS infusion. Vesicles were measured with a flow cytometer (A50-Micro, Apogee Flow Systems).LPS resulted in increased thrombin generation compared to baseline. During storage, the total number of extracellular vesicles increased from 1.4 × 10 /mL (interquartile range [IQR], 8.3 × 10 -1.9 × 10 /mL) in the fresh product to 1.7 × 10 /mL (IQR, 7.9 × 10 -.3 × 10 /mL; p < 0.01) in the stored product (p < 0.001). Vesicles appeared to be mostly RBC derived.After transfusion, extracellular vesicles from stored RBC products, but not from fresh products, could be detected in the circulation of healthy volunteers. However, infusion of stored RBC extracellular vesicles did not augment thrombin generation compared to endotoxemic controls. Also, levels of d-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex were unaffected.

This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise-induced hypohydration on gastrointestinal integrity, function, symptoms, and systemic endotoxin and inflammatory profiles. In a randomized crossover design, male endurance runners ( = 11) performed  h of running at 70% of maximum oxygen uptake in 25°C ambient temperature with water provision [euhydration (EuH)] and total water restriction [hypohydration (HypoH)] during running, which accounted for 0.6 ± 0.6% and 3.1 ± 0.7% body mass loss, respectively. Blood and fecal samples were collected before and after exercise. Breath samples (H determination) were collected and gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) recorded before, during, and after exercise. HypoH resulted in a higher, yet insignificant, ∆ preexercise to postexercise plasma cortisol concentration (+286 nmol/l vs. +176 nmol/l;  = 0.098) but significantly higher intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) (+539 pg/ml vs. +371 pg/ml;  = 0.047) concentration compared with EuH. A greater breath H response ( = 0.026) was observed on HypoH (1,188 ppm/3 h, peak +12 ppm) vs. EuH (579 ppm/3 h, peak +6 ppm). Despite greater GIS incidence on HypoH (82%) vs. EuH (64%), GIS severity scores were not significant between trials. Exercise-induced leukocytosis (overall pre- to postexercise: 5.9 × 10/l to 12.1 × 10/l) was similar on both trials. Depressed in vitro neutrophil function was observed during recovery on HypoH (-36%) but not on EUH (+6%). A pre- to postexercise increase ( < 0.05) was observed for circulating cytokine concentrations but not endotoxin values. Hypohydration during  h of running modestly perturbs gastrointestinal integrity and function and increases GIS incidence but does not affect systemic  and cytokinemia.  Despite anecdotal beliefs that exercise-induced hypohydration exacerbates perturbations to gastrointestinal status, the present study reports only modest perturbations in gastrointestinal integrity, function, and symptoms compared with euhydration maintenance. Exercise-induced hypohydration does not exacerbate systemic  and cytokinemia compared with euhydration maintenance. Programmed water intake to maintain euhydration results in gastrointestinal symptom severity similar to exercise-induced hypohydration. Maintaining euhydration during exertional stress prevents the exercise-associated depression in bacterially stimulated neutrophil function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897706>Kinetics of Physiological and Behavioural Responses in Endotoxemic Pigs with or without Dexamethasone Treatment.</a></h2><p>Although dexamethasone (DEX) is a widely used immunoregulatory agent, knowledge about its pharmacological properties in farm animals, especially pigs, is insufficient. Previous studies suggest that compared to other species, pigs are less sensitive to the immunosuppression conferred by DEX and more sensitive to the threat of bacterial endotoxins. However, there is a paucity of studies examining DEX immunomodulation in  in this species. In this study, a porcine  model was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the effect of DEX-pretreatment on the magnitude and kinetics of neuroendocrine, metabolic, hematologic, inflammatory, and behavioural responses were examined. DEX decreased cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and lymphocyte whereas glucose concentration was increased under both normal and endotoxemic conditions. By contrast, DEX decreased triglyceride, lactate, and IL-6 concentrations and increased platelet count only under an endotoxemic condition. DEX also reduced the frequency of sickness behaviour following LPS challenge. PCA showed that glucose and triglyceride metabolism together with red blood cell count mainly contributed to the separation of clusters during DEX treatment. Our study demonstrates that DEX protects pigs from inflammation and morbidity in , in spite of their less sensitivity to DEX. Moreover, its considerable role in the regulation of the metabolic and hematologic responses in endotoxemic pigs is revealed for the first time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30135596>LPS-induced maternal inflammation promotes fetal leukocyte recruitment and prenatal organ infiltration in mice.</a></h2><p>A pro-inflammatory intrauterine milieu accounts for increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. We asked how maternal inflammation as seen in  affects fetal leukocyte recruitment in vivo during late gestation.Inflammation was induced in pregnant LysEGFP-mice by intraperitoneal LPS injection between gestational day 14 and 18 (E14-E18). After 20 h, intravital fluorescence microscopy was performed on fetal yolk sac venules to examine leukocyte rolling (number of rolling cells/min) and adhesion (>30 s). Infiltration of neutrophils into chorion/amnion, lung, and kidney were quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy.At high doses ( × 1 mg/kg), LPS triggered preterm birth (PTB) and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), with early gestations at high risk of IUFD and late gestations prone to PTB. Lower LPS dosing ( × 0.25 mg/kg) did not induce labor, but promoted maternal and fetal cytokine production, as well as neutrophilic infiltration of fetal membranes, as seen in chorioamnionitis (CAM). Baseline fetal leukocyte recruitment increased throughout gestation, and maternal inflammation further augmented adhesion at E16-E18. Enhanced leukocyte recruitment ultimately translated into prominent infiltration of fetal lung and kidney.LPS-induced maternal  promotes IUFD, PTB, and fetal leukocyte recruitment depending on gestational age.

NGAL and caspase 3 mRNA expression were measured after delivering NGAL siRNA in HK- cells and apoptosis was measured with TUNEL and flow cytometry.SCr and uNGAL were significantly increased after LPS treatment and renal morphology data indicated AKI and renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. Caspase 3 and NGAL were predominantly expressed in the tubular epithelial cells and there was a correlation between caspase 3 and NGAL protein (r = 0.663, p = 0.01). In vitro, there was a strong correlation between caspase 3 and NGAL mRNA in LPS-injured HK- cells within 24 h (r = 0.448, p < 0.05).

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the new product gallic acid-L-leucine (GAL) conjugate could ameliorate the LPS-induced dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism and NO production. We first investigated the effects of GAL conjugate on the expression of proinflammatory enzymes and the production of proinflammatory NO and lipid mediators in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, primary peritoneal macrophages, and mouse model. Western blot analyses revealed that GAL attenuated LPS-induced expression of iNOS, COX-, and 5-LOX in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, probing NO-mediated fluorescence revealed that GAL antagonized the stimulatory effect of LPS on iNOS activity. By profiling of lipid mediators with ESI-MS-based lipidomics, we found that GAL suppressed LPS-induced overproduction of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, leukotriene B4, and thromboxane B2. We further discovered that GAL might exhibit anti-inflammatory activities by the following mechanisms: (1) suppressing LPS-induced activation of MAP kinases (i.e., ERK1/, JNK, and p38); () reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (3) preventing LPS-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factors NF-B and AP-1. Consequently, GAL significantly decreased the levels of COX- and iNOS expression and the plasma levels of proinflammatory lipid mediators in LPS-treated mice. GAL pretreatment enhanced the survival of mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Taken together, our results suggest that GAL may be a potential anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of  and sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239174>Acute phase protein, α - 1- acid glycoprotein (AGP-1), has differential effects on TLR- and TLR-4 mediated responses.</a></h2><p>Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP-1) is a major positive acute phase glycoprotein with unknown functions that likely play a role in inflammation. We tested its involvement in a variety of inflammatory responses using human AGP-1 purified to apparent homogeneity and confirmed its identity by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. AGP-1 alone upregulated MAPK signaling in murine peritoneal macrophages. However, when given in combination with TLR ligands, AGP-1 selectively augmented MAPK activation induced by ligands of TLR- (Braun lipoprotein) but not TLR-4 (lipopolysaccharide). In vivo treatment of AGP-1 in a murine model of sepsis with or without TLR- or TLR-4 ligands, selectively potentiated TLR--mediated mortality, but was without significant effect on TLR-4-mediated mortality. Furthermore, in vitro, AGP-1 selectively potentiated TLR- mediated adhesion of human primary immune cell, neutrophils. Hence, our studies highlight a new role for the acute phase protein AGP-1 in sepsis via its interaction with TLR- signaling mechanisms to selectively promote responsiveness to one of the two major gram-negative endotoxins, contributing to the complicated pathobiology of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Inhibition of purinergic P2X receptors markedly reduces damage inflicted by cytolytic bacterial toxin and after complement activation in both erythrocytes and monocytes. P2X expression generally shows variation throughout the population. Here, we investigate correlation between P2X receptor abundance in blood cell plasma membranes and haematocrit during sepsis, in patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU).Patients admitted to the ED and successively transferred to ICU with the diagnosis sepsis (<  systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and suspected infection), were grouped as either blood pathogen-positive (14 patients) or blood pathogen-negative (20 patients). Blood samples drawn at ICU admission were analysed for P2X and P2X receptor abundance using indirect flow cytometry.Here, we find inverse correlation between P2X receptor expression and change in haematocrit (r - 0.80) and haemoglobin (r - 0.78) levels from admission to ED to arrival at ICU in patients with pathogen-positive sepsis. This correlation was not found in patients without confirmed bacteraemia.

This supports previous in vitro findings of P2X activation as a significant component in cell damage caused by pore-forming bacterial toxins and complement-dependent major attack complex.

Hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, mean blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output were continuously recorded. Central venous oxygen saturation was also measured in order to obtain a complete evaluation of cardiovascular response to sepsis. Heart rate was decreased, whilst mean arterial pressure decrease was alleviated after DEX administration in septic animals. In addition, central venous pressure was stable in animals with sepsis after DEX infusion. Sepsis dramatically elevated pulmonary function indicators but DEX succeeded in ameliorating this effect. The important decrease measured in central venous oxygen saturation in both sepsis groups reflected the decreased perfusion of tissues that takes place at the end of early sepsis. Our findings support the hypothesis that DEX has beneficial effects on heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure, whilst reduction in systemic blood pressure occurs at acceptable levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031625>Connecting Metainflammation and Neuroinflammation Through the PTN-MK-RPTPβ/ζ Axis: Relevance in Therapeutic Development.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a common factor of pathologies such as obesity, type  diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. Chronic inflammation is considered part of the pathogenic mechanisms of different disorders associated with aging. Interestingly, peripheral inflammation and the associated metabolic alterations not only facilitate insulin resistance and diabetes but also neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the identification of novel pathways, common to the development of these diseases, which modulate the immune response and signaling is key. It will provide highly relevant information to advance our knowledge of the multifactorial process of aging, and to establish new biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets to counteract the underlying chronic inflammatory processes. One novel pathway that regulates peripheral and central immune responses is triggered by the cytokines pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK), which bind its receptor, Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ, and inactivate its phosphatase activity. In this review, we compile a growing body of knowledge suggesting that PTN and MK modulate the immune response and/or inflammation in different pathologies characterized by peripheral inflammation associated with insulin resistance, such as aging, and in central disorders characterized by overt neuroinflammation, such as neurodegenerative diseases and . Evidence strongly suggests that regulation of the PTN and MK signaling pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities particularly in those neurological disorders characterized by increased PTN and/or MK cerebral levels and neuroinflammation.

We hypothesized that an increase of renal EP or EP receptors and/or a downregulation of renal EP and EP receptors enhances PGE-induced renal vasodilatation. Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 3 mg/kg i.p.) increased microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 and prostacyclin synthase expression, whereas mPGES- expression was unaltered. Further, LPS increased the mRNA abundance for the prostaglandin EP receptor, whereas the expressions of the EP and EP receptors were decreased. In isolated-perfused kidneys from control mice, PGE exerted a dual effect on renal vascular tone, inducing vasodilatation at lower concentrations and vasoconstriction at higher concentrations. In kidneys from endotoxemic mice, the vasodilatory component was more pronounced, whereas the vasoconstriction at higher PGE concentrations was absent. Similarly, prostacyclin (PGI)-induced vasodilatation was more pronounced in endotoxemic kidneys. The enhanced vasodilatory effect was paralleled by an increase in renal vascular EP and prostacyclin IP receptor mRNA expression. Further, stimulation of renin secretion rate by PGE and PGI was enhanced in endotoxemic kidneys. Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX)- inhibitor SC-236 (10 mg/kg) did not alter the basal GFR, but augmented the LPS-induced decline in GFR, and attenuated the LPS-induced increase in plasma renin concentration in vivo. Our data suggest that an activation of the COX-/mPGES-1 synthetic pathway is responsible for the increased renal formation of PGE in response to LPS and that the vasodilatory effect of PGE and PGI is enhanced during .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30774009>The hepatic innate immune response is lobe-specific in a murine model .</a></h2><p>The liver plays a central role in the innate immune response to . While previous studies have demonstrated lobe-specific transcriptional responses to various insults, whether this is true in response to  is unknown. We sought to assess whether there were significant intra- and inter-lobe differences in the murine hepatic innate immune transcriptional response to . Adult male ICR mice were exposed to i.p. LPS (5 mg/kg, 30 min, 60 min, 5 h) and primary ( Tnf, Cxcl1, Nfkbia, Tnfiap3) and secondary ( Il6, Nos2) innate immune response gene expression was assessed in the left medial, right medial, left lateral, and right lateral lobes, and the papillary and caudate processes. The expression of all innate immune response genes increased following i.p. LPS challenge. When tested at the early time points (30 and 60 min), the left medial lobe and caudate process consistently demonstrated the highest induction of gene expression. Most inter-lobe differences were attenuated at later time points (5 h). To improve reproducibility of the study of  induced by i.p.

The impact of sepsis on electrophysiological and molecular determinants of learning is underexplored. We observed that mice that survived sepsis or  experienced loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated (BDNF-mediated) process responsible for spatial memory formation. Memory impairment occurred despite preserved hippocampal BDNF content and could be reversed by stimulation of BDNF signaling, suggesting the presence of a local BDNF inhibitor. Sepsis is associated with degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, releasing heparan sulfate fragments (of sufficient size and sulfation to bind BDNF) into the circulation. Heparan sulfate fragments penetrated the hippocampal blood-brain barrier during sepsis and inhibited BDNF-mediated LTP. Glycoarray approaches demonstrated that the avidity of heparan sulfate for BDNF increased with sulfation at the -O position of iduronic acid and the N position of glucosamine. Circulating heparan sulfate in endotoxemic mice and septic humans was enriched in -O- and N-sulfated disaccharides; furthermore, the presence of these sulfation patterns in the plasma of septic patients at intensive care unit (ICU) admission predicted persistent cognitive impairment 14 days after ICU discharge or at hospital discharge. Our findings indicate that circulating -O- and N-sulfated heparan sulfate fragments contribute to septic cognitive impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502657>EGF receptor plays a role in the mechanism of glutamine-mediated prevention of alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and liver injury.</a></h2><p>Recent study indicated that glutamine prevents alcoholic tissue injury in mouse gut and liver. Here we investigated the potential role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in glutamine-mediated prevention of ethanol-induced colonic barrier dysfunction,  and liver damage. Wild-type and EGFR*Tg transgenic (expressing dominant negative EGFR) mice were fed 1-6% ethanol in Lieber-DeCarli diet. Gut permeability was measured by vascular-to-luminal flux of FITC-inulin, and junctional integrity assessed by confocal microscopy. Liver injury was evaluated by plasma transaminases, histopathology and triglyceride analyses. Glutamine effect on acetaldehyde-induced tight junction disruption was investigated in Caco- cell monolayers. Doxycycline-induced expression of EGFR* blocked glutamine-mediated prevention of ethanol-induced disruption of colonic epithelial tight junction, mucosal permeability and . Ethanol activated cofilin and disrupted actin cytoskeleton, which was blocked by glutamine in an EGFR-dependent mechanism. Ethanol down-regulated antioxidant gene expression and up-regulated cytokine and chemokine gene expression, which were blocked by glutamine in wild-type mice in the presence or absence of doxycycline, but not in EGFR*Tg mice in the presence of doxycycline. Histopathology, plasma transaminases, triglyceride and expression of chemokine and antioxidant genes indicated ethanol-induced liver damage, which were blocked by glutamine in an EGFR-dependent mechanism. Src kinase activity and extracellular ligand binding domain of EGFR are required for glutamine-mediated protection of barrier function in Caco- cell monolayers. Glutamine released metalloproteinases into the medium, and metalloproteinase inhibitors blocked glutamine-mediated protection of barrier function. Results demonstrate that EGFR plays an important role in glutamine-mediated prevention of alcoholic gut permeability,  and liver damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, exaggerated reactions to LPS can lead to potentially deadly sepsis while chronic, low-grade inflammation is linked with the development of several metabolic diseases, like type  diabetes. These processes are initiated by the binding of LPS to CD14 protein and the TLR4/MD2 receptor complex located in the plasma membrane of immune cells and also by the activation of a cytoplasmic multi-protein complex called the inflammasome. Recent studies have shown that lipids of the plasma membrane and endomembranes are important regulators of LPS-triggered signaling pathways. In this review we summarize those data emphasizing the role of phosphatidylinositols and modification of proteins by palmitoylation. Dysregulation of the lipid-dependent steps of the LPS-induced signaling can lead to excessive production of cytokines during sepsis and metabolic diseases linked with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944710>Worldwide trends in scientific publications on association of gut microbiota with obesity.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence has shown underlying roles of gut dysbiosis and metabolic  in obesity and its complications. Despite the large number of experimental and clinical researches performed on gut microbiota and obesity, no bibliometrics' study has been conducted so far. We aimed to assess the trend of global scientific publications in the field of gut microbiota and obesity.The bibliometrics' data from January 2000 to April 2017 were retrieved based on Scopus database.

However, the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of insulin is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of the class A1 scavenger receptor (SR-A1), a prototypic member of the pattern recognition receptor family, in the insulin-mediated suppression of inflammatory responses in macrophages. Our murine in vivo studies show that insulin can attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  in a SR-A1-dependent manner, and this was consistent with our in vitro results which demonstrate that the SR-A1 is necessary for insulin to antagonize the LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages. The effect of SR-A1 on the anti-inflammatory action of insulin might be associated with the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling pathway in macrophages. Insulin could inhibit macrophage polarization to a pro-inflammatory phenotype via the SR-A1/ERK cascade. Collectively, our results suggest that SR-A1 may be a pivotal element for the anti-inflammation effect of insulin in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249650>Multiorgan Development of Oxidative and Nitrosative Stress in LPS-Induced  in C57Bl/6 Mice: DHE-Based  Approach.</a></h2><p>Detection of free radicals in tissues is challenging. Most approaches rely on incubating excised sections or homogenates with reagents, typically at supraphysiologic oxygen tensions, to finally detect surrogate, nonspecific end products. In the present work, we explored the potential of using intravenously (i.v.) injected dihydroethidine (DHE) to detect superoxide radical (O ) abundance  by quantification of the superoxide-specific DHE oxidation product, -hydroxyethidium (-OH-E), as well as ethidium (E) and DHE in multiple tissues in a murine model of  induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.), while DHE was delivered via the tail vein one hour before sacrifice. Tissues (kidney, lung, liver, and brain) were harvested and subjected to HPLC/fluorescent analysis of DHE and its monomeric oxidation products. In parallel, electron spin resonance (EPR) spin trapping was used to measure nitric oxide (NO) production in the aorta, lung, and liver isolated from the same mice. Endotoxemic inflammation was validated by analysis of plasma biomarkers. The concentration of -OH-E varied in the liver, lung, and kidney; however, the ratios of -OH-E/E and -OH-E/DHE were increased in the liver and kidney but not in the lung or the brain. An LPS-induced robust level of NO burst was observed in the liver, whereas the lung demonstrated a moderate yet progressive increase in the rate of NO production. Interestingly, endothelial dysfunction was observed in the aorta, as evidenced by decreased NO production 6 hours post-LPS injection that coincided with the inflammatory burden of  (e.g. elevated serum amyloid A and prostaglandin E). Combined, these data demonstrate that systemic delivery of DHE affords the capacity to specifically detect O  production . Furthermore, the ratio of -OH-E/E oxidation products in tissues provides a tool for comparative insight into the oxidative environments in various organs. Based on our findings, we demonstrate that the endotoxemic liver is susceptible to both O -mediated and nonspecific oxidant stress as well as nitrosative stress. Oxidant stress in the lung was detected to a lesser extent, thus underscoring a differential response of liver and lung to endotoxemic injury induced by intraperitoneal LPS injection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536546>Clinical factors associated with bacterial translocation in Japanese patients with type  diabetes: A retrospective study.</a></h2><p>To explore clinical factors associated with bacterial translocation in Japanese patients with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM).The data of 118 patients with T2DM were obtained from two previous clinical studies, and were retrospectively analyzed regarding the clinical parameters associated with bacterial translocation defined as detection of bacteremia and levels of plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), the latter of which is thought to reflect inflammation caused by .LBP level was not significantly different between patients with and without bacteremia. No clinical factors were significantly correlated with the detection of bacteremia. On the other hand, plasma LBP level was significantly correlated with HbA1c (r = 0.312), fasting blood glucose (r = 0.279), fasting C-peptide (r = 0.265), body mass index (r = 0.371), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.241), and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, r = 0.543; and interleukin-6, r = 0.456). Multiple regression analysis identified body mass index, HbA1c, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 as independent determinants of plasma LBP level.The plasma LBP level was similar in patients with and without bacteremia. While both bacteremia and LBP are theoretically associated with bacterial translocation, the detection of bacteremia was not associated with LBP level in T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29868038>Pro-Inflammatory Th1 and Th17 Cells Are Suppressed During Human Experimental  Whereas Anti-Inflammatory IL-10 Producing T-Cells Are Unaffected.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is one of the leading causes of the deaths in hospitals. During sepsis, patients are exposed to , which may contribute to the dysregulation of the immune system frequently observed in sepsis. This dysregulation leads to impaired pro-inflammatory responses and may increase the risk for secondary infections in sepsis. The experimental human  model is widely used as a model system to study the acute effects of . Under physiological circumstances, the immune system is tightly regulated. Effector T-cells exert pro-inflammatory function and are restrained by regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which modulate pro-inflammatory effector responses.  may induce inadequate Treg activity or render effector T-cells dysfunctional. It was the aim of the study to investigate effector T-cell and Treg responses in an experimental human  model.In a cross-over designed placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy male volunteers received an intravenous injection of either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.8 ng/kg body weight) or a placebo (saline 0.9%). CD3 T-cells, CD4 T-cells, CD8 T-cells, and intracellular cytokine profiles were measured with flow cytometry at baseline and at repeated points after LPS/placebo injection. Complete blood cell counts were obtained with an automated hematology analyzer and cytokines were quantified by ELISA.Circulating neutrophils were significantly increased  h after LPS injection ( < 0.001) while absolute number of CD3 T-cells, CD4 T-cells, and CD8 T-cells decreased ( < 0.001). Effector T-helper-cells (THs) showed a significant-but transient-decrease of pro-inflammatory IFNγ, interleukin (IL)-, TNFα, and IL-17A production after LPS injection ( < 0.001). In contrast, the frequency of Treg and the capacity to produce IL-10 were unchanged ( = 0.21).Effector THs fail to produce pro-inflammatory Th1-/Th17-associated cytokines after LPS challenge. In contrast, IL-10 production by Treg is not affected. Thus, -induced suppression of pro-inflammatory THs might be considered as a contributing factor to immunoparalysis in sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29974363>Esmolol indirectly stimulates vagal nerve activity in endotoxemic pigs.</a></h2><p>There is an increasing interest in beta-blockade as a therapeutic approach to sepsis following consistent experimental findings of attenuation of inflammation and improved survival with beta1 selective antagonist. However, the mechanism of these beneficial effects remains very uncertain. Thus, this study is aimed at investigating the effects of a beta-1 selective blockade on sympathetic/parasympathetic activity in endotoxin-challenged pigs using heart rate variability. The hypothesis is that an adrenergic blockade could promote parasympathetic activity. Indeed, the increase of parasympathetic activity is a mechanism recently described as beneficial in septic states.Fifty-one endotoxin-challenged pigs were studied. After 30 min of endotoxin infusion and 30 min of evolution without intervention, the pigs were randomly assigned the placebo or esmolol treatment and were observed for 200 min. Overall heart rate variability was assessed continuously, in the temporal domain by standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN, ms),and in the frequency domain by spectral powers of low frequency (LF, ms × 10/Hz) and high frequency (HF, ms × 10/Hz) bands.Variations of power in these frequency bands were interpreted as putative markers of sympathetic (LF) and parasympathetic (HF) activity. In LPS treated animals, Esmolol did not increase SDNN, but instead decreased LF and increased HF power.These spectral modifications associated to a beta-blocker treatment after an endotoxemic challenge are interpreted as a significant decrease of sympathetic activity and an indirect increase of vagal autonomic tone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30357579>Protective Effects of Sodium Pyruvate during Systemic Inflammation Limited to the Correction of Metabolic Acidosis.</a></h2><p>Protective effects by exogenous sodium pyruvate already have been described in various experimental models of injury, among others during intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, hemorrhagic shock, and shock secondary to systemic inflammation (endotoxemic shock). Low doses of sodium pyruvate reduced signs of inflammation, enhanced systemic blood pressure, and ameliorated metabolic acidosis when administered in a prophylactic manner during endotoxemic shock. In the present study, we investigated whether low-dosed infusions of sodium pyruvate exhibited beneficial effects when applied therapeutically after the induction of systemic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide was infused at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg × h over a period of 360 min to induce systemic inflammation in male Wistar rats. Sodium pyruvate (single dose 50 mg/kg × 15 min) was administered intravenously 180 and 270 min after starting of the lipopolysaccharide infusion. Systemic/vital parameters (e.g., systemic blood pressure and breathing rate) and blood/plasma parameters (e.g., acid-base parameters; electrolytes; glucose and lactate concentration; hemolysis; aminotransferase activities; and parameters of coagulation) were determined in regular intervals. Lipopolysaccharide infusion led to metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte as well as hemostatic disturbances, and hemolysis. Except for the acid-base status (amelioration of metabolic acidosis) and the plasma chloride concentration (reduction of hyperchloremia), the additional infusion of sodium pyruvate failed in significantly improving lipopolysaccharide-dependent alterations (e.g. vital, blood and plasma parameters). Protective effects of a delayed administration of the metabolizable anion pyruvate during systemic inflammation, hence, are limited to its function as alkalizer to counteract metabolic acidosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480421>Plasma Disappearance Rate of Indocyanine Green for Determination of Liver Function in Three Different Models of Shock.</a></h2><p>The measurement of the liver function via the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDR) is a sensitive bed-side tool in critical care. Yet, recent evidence has questioned the value of this method for hyperdynamic conditions. To evaluate this technique in different hemodynamic settings, we analyzed the PDR and corresponding pharmacokinetic models after  or hemorrhagic shock in rats. Male anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hemorrhage (mean arterial pressure 35 ± 5 mmHg, 90 min) and  h of reperfusion, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced moderate or severe (1.0 vs. 10 mg/kg)  for 6 h (each  = 6). Afterwards, PDR was measured, and pharmacokinetic models were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM). Hemorrhagic shock resulted in a significant decrease of PDR, compared with sham controls, and a corresponding attenuation of the calculated ICG clearance in 1- and -compartment models, with the same log-likelihood. The induction of severe, but not moderate , led to a significant reduction of PDR. The calculated ICG blood clearance was reduced in 1-compartment models for both septic conditions. -compartment models performed with a significantly better log likelihood, and the calculated clearance of ICG did not correspond well with PDR in both LPS groups. 3-compartment models did not improve the log likelihood in any experiment. These results demonstrate that PDR correlates well with ICG clearance in 1- and -compartment models after hemorrhage. In , best described by a -compartment model, PDR may not truly reflect the ICG clearance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982555>Lactobacillus plantarum LC27 and Bifidobacterium longum LC67 simultaneously alleviate high-fat diet-induced colitis, , liver steatosis, and obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Long-term feeding of a high-fat diet (HFD) induces  and gastrointestinal inflammation by disturbing gut microbiota composition and membrane permeability, resulting in the acceleration of obesity. Some probiotics exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we hypothesized that anti-inflammatory probiotics could lead to the simultaneous attenuation of , liver steatosis, obesity, and colitis in mice with HFD-induced obesity. Herein, we examined whether Lactobacillus plantarum LC27 and/or Bifidobacterium longum LC, which significantly suppressed NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide- or fecal lysate-stimulated Caco- cells, could simultaneously alleviate liver steatosis and colitis in mice with HFD-induced obesity. Oral administration of LC27, LC67, or their (3:1) mixture (LM) reduced HFD-induced aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and lipopolysaccharide levels in the blood and liver. Their treatments also suppressed HFD-induced NF-κB activation and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and claudin-1 and occludin expression in the liver and colon. Moreover, LC27, LC67, or LM treatment reduced HFD-induced Firmicutes and Proteobacteria populations in gut microbiota and fecal lipopolysaccharide production. The hypothesis was supported by the findings that anti-inflammatory LC27 and/or LC67 simultaneously alleviated liver steatosis, obesity, and colitis by regulating NF-κB and AMPK activation through the inhibition of gut microbiota lipopolysaccharide production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular mechanisms causing immunoparalysis remain unclear; however, changes in cellular metabolism of leukocytes have been linked to immunoparalysis. We investigated the relation of metabolic changes to antimicrobial monocyte functions in endotoxin-induced immunotolerance, as a model for sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. In this study, immunotolerance was induced in healthy males by intravenous endotoxin ( ng/kg, derived from Escherichia coli O:113) administration. Before and after induction of immunotolerance, circulating CD14 monocytes were isolated and assessed for antimicrobial functions, including cytokine production, oxidative burst, and microbial (Candida albicans) killing capacity, as well metabolic responses to ex vivo stimulation. Next, the effects of altered cellular metabolism on monocyte functions were validated in vitro. Ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation induced an extensive rewiring of metabolism in naive monocytes. In contrast, endotoxin-induced immunotolerant monocytes showed no metabolic plasticity, as they were unable to adapt their metabolism or mount cytokine and oxidative responses. Validation experiments showed that modulation of metabolic pathways, affected by immunotolerance, influenced monocyte cytokine production, oxidative burst, and microbial (C. albicans) killing in naive monocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that immunotolerant monocytes are characterized by a loss of metabolic plasticity and these metabolic defects impact antimicrobial monocyte immune functions. Further, these findings support that the changed cellular metabolism of immunotolerant monocytes might reveal novel therapeutic targets to reverse sepsis-induced immunoparalysis.©2019 The Authors.

Elevated blood lactate and slow lactate clearance are associated with mortality; however, regulatory roles are unknown. We hypothesized that lactic acid (LA) contributes to the late phase and is not solely a consequence of bacterial infection. No studies have examined LA effects in sepsis models in vivo or a mechanism by which it suppresses LPS-induced activation in vitro. Because mast cells can be activated systemically and contribute to sepsis, we examined LA effects on the mast cell response to LPS. LA significantly suppressed LPS-induced cytokine production and NF-κB transcriptional activity in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and cytokine production in peritoneal mast cells. Suppression was MCT-1 dependent and reproducible with sodium lactate or formic acid. Further, LA significantly suppressed cytokine induction following LPS-induced  in mice. Because glycolysis is linked to inflammation and LA is a byproduct of this process, we examined changes in glucose metabolism. LA treatment reduced glucose uptake and lactate export during LPS stimulation. LA effects were mimicked by glycolytic inhibitors and reversed by increasing ATP availability. These results indicate that glycolytic suppression and ATP production are necessary and sufficient for LA effects. Our work suggests that enhancing glycolysis and ATP production could improve immune function, counteracting LA suppressive effects in the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490357>EP2 Receptor Blockade Attenuates COX- Upregulation During Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>High levels of PGE2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammatory disorders such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and peritonitis. However, PGE2 has a paradoxical effect: its low levels promote intestinal homeostasis, whereas high levels may contribute to pathology. These concentration-dependent effects are mediated by four receptors, EP1-EP4. In this study, we evaluate the effect of blockade of the low affinity pro-inflammatory receptors EP1 and EP2 on expression of COX-, the rate limiting enzyme in PGE2 biosynthesis, and on gut barrier permeability using cultured enterocytes and three different models of intestinal injury. PGE2 upregulated COX- in IEC-6 enterocytes, and this response was blocked by the EP2 antagonist PF-04418948, but not by the EP1 antagonist ONO-8711 or EP4 antagonist E7046. In the neonatal rat model of NEC, EP2 antagonist and low dose of COX- inhibitor Celecoxib, but not EP1 antagonist, reduced NEC pathology as well as COX- mRNA and protein expression. In the adult mouse  and cecal ligation/puncture models, EP2, but not EP1 genetic deficiency decreased COX- expression in the intestine. Our results indicate that the EP2 receptor plays a critical role in the positive feedback regulation of intestinal COX- by its end-product PGE2 during inflammation and may be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of NEC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30856467>Green tea extract prevents obesity in male mice by alleviating gut dysbiosis in association with improved intestinal barrier function that limits endotoxin translocation and adipose inflammation.</a></h2><p>Gut-derived endotoxin translocation provokes obesity by inducing TLR4/NFκB inflammation. We hypothesized that catechin-rich green tea extract (GTE) would protect against obesity-associated TLR4/NFκB inflammation by alleviating gut dysbiosis and limiting endotoxin translocation. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet containing 0% or % GTE for 8 weeks. At Week 7, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran was administered by oral gavage before assessing its serum concentrations as a gut permeability marker. HF-feeding increased (P<.05) adipose mass and adipose expression of genes involved in TLR4/NFκB-dependent inflammation and macrophage activation. GTE attenuated HF-induced obesity and pro-inflammatory gene expression. GTE in HF mice decreased serum FITC-dextran, and attenuated portal vein and circulating endotoxin concentrations. GTE in HF mice also prevented HF-induced decreases in the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins (TJPs) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α while preventing increases in TLR4/NFκB-dependent inflammatory genes. Gut microbial diversity was increased, and the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio was decreased, in HF mice fed GTE compared with HF controls. GTE in LF mice did not attenuate adiposity but decreased endotoxin and favorably altered several gut bacterial populations. Serum FITC-dextran was correlated with portal vein endotoxin (P<.001; r=0.66) and inversely correlated with colonic mRNA levels of TJPs (P<.05; r=-0.38 to -0.48). Colonic TJPs mRNA were inversely correlated with portal endotoxin (P<.05; r=-0.33 to -0.39). These data suggest that GTE protects against diet-induced obesity consistent with a mechanism involving the gut-adipose axis that limits endotoxin translocation and consequent adipose TLR4/NFκB inflammation by improving gut barrier function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This review examines the following eight controversies: 1) reliance on core temperature for diagnosing and assessing severity of EHS; ) hypothalamic damage induces heat stroke and this mediates "thermoregulatory failure" during the immediate recovery period; 3) EHS is a predictable condition primarily due to overwhelming heat stress; 4) heat-induced  mediates systemic inflammatory response syndrome in all EHS cases; 5) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for EHS prevention; 6) EHS shares similar mechanisms with malignant hyperthermia; 7) cooling to a specific body core temperature during treatment for EHS; and 8) return to physical activity based on physiological responses to a single exercise heat tolerance test.

Several reviews and studies have hypothesized that in vivo PAT toxicity is related to gut barrier dysfunction, but evidence for this is not substantial. The goal of the present study was to further demonstrate the role of the gut barrier in food-borne PAT toxicity. In vitro assays showed that PAT exposure induced significant cell death, inhibited the mRNA expressions of tight junction proteins and increased gut permeability in Caco- cell monolayers. An acute PAT exposure animal trial reported for the first time an association between PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and  in mice. Sub-chronic PAT exposure also inhibited the expression of ZO-1 in the gut and induced both intestinal and systematic inflammation in mice. Dietary supplements with previously reported protective effects on the gut barrier, such as docosahexaenoic acid and Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610, were able to recover the PAT-induced gut barrier dysfunction and significantly alleviate PAT toxicity in vivo. Another L. plantarum strain, CCFM11, with poor gut barrier modulation ability, failed to exhibit identical protective effects against PAT toxicity to L. plantarum CCFM8610. Our results indicated that PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and bacterial translocation may be another toxic mechanism of PAT besides its inherent cytotoxicity. Gut barrier protection may be considered an important target for the prevention of PAT toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961634>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) exacerbate severity of infant sepsis.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are innate defense mechanisms that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. However, the role of NETs in pediatric sepsis is unknown.Infant ( weeks old) and adult (6 weeks old) mice were submitted to sepsis by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of bacteria suspension or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neutrophil infiltration, bacteremia, organ injury, and concentrations of cytokine, NETs, and DNase in the plasma were measured. Production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and release of NETs by neutrophils were also evaluated. To investigate the functional role of NETs, mice undergoing sepsis were treated with antibiotic plus rhDNase and the survival, organ injury, and levels of inflammatory markers and NETs were determined. Blood samples from pediatric and adult sepsis patients were collected and the concentrations of NETs measured.Infant C57BL/6 mice subjected to sepsis or LPS-induced  produced significantly higher levels of NETs than the adult mice. Moreover, compared to that of the adult mice, this outcome was accompanied by increased organ injury and production of inflammatory cytokines. The increased NETs were associated with elevated expression of Padi4 and histone H3 citrullination in the neutrophils. Furthermore, treatment of infant septic mice with rhDNase or a PAD-4 inhibitor markedly attenuated sepsis. Importantly, pediatric septic patients had high levels of NETs, and the severity of pediatric sepsis was positively correlated with the level of NETs.This study reveals a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of pediatric sepsis susceptibility and suggests that NETs represents a potential target to improve clinical outcomes of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471378>Soluble CD14 and  Variants, Other Inflammatory Markers, and Glucose Dysregulation in Older Adults: The Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h2><p>Experimental studies have implicated soluble (s)CD14, an effector of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, in insulin resistance, but its role in human metabolic  has not been studied. We evaluated sCD14 in relation to dysglycemia in older adults and how this compares to other markers of inflammation.We investigated associations of sCD14, interleukin-6 (IL-6), CRP, and white blood cell (WBC) count with insulin resistance (quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index and HOMA  of insulin resistance) and incident type  diabetes in a population-based cohort of older adults. We also assessed the causal role of sCD14 in insulin resistance using an instrumental variable approach by Mendelian randomization.After adjustment for conventional risk factors, each of the four biomarkers showed positive cross-sectional associations with both insulin resistance measures. These associations persisted after mutual adjustment for all markers except sCD14. Over a median follow-up of 11.6 years, 466 cases of diabetes occurred. All biomarkers except sCD14 were positively associated with diabetes, although only WBC count remained associated (hazard ratio 1.43 per doubling [95% CI 1.07, 1.90]) after mutual adjustment. Instrumental variable analysis did not support a causal role for sCD14 in insulin resistance.Among older adults, sCD14 was associated with insulin resistance, but this disappeared after adjustment for other biomarkers, showed no evidence of a causal basis, and was not accompanied by a similar association with diabetes. IL-6, CRP, and WBC count were each associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, WBC count most robustly. These findings do not support a central role for sCD14, but they highlight the preeminence of WBC count as an inflammatory measure of diabetes risk in this population.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877874>Natriuretic Peptides: A Role in Early Septic Acute Kidney Injury?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901075>[Corrigendum] Construction of a lentiviral vector containing shRNA targeting ADAM17 and its role in attenuating  in mice.</a></h2><p>Subsequently to the publication of this article, the authors have realized that the address affiliation contained a misspelling: The name of their institution was inadvertently written as "Renming Hospital", whereas this should have been published as "Renmin Hospital".

The primary outcome was the effect of the DP on faecal microbiota. Secondary endpoints were biochemical parameters, lipopolysaccharide, branched-chain amino acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA) and free fatty acids (FFAs).Patients with T2D exhibited intestinal dysbiosis characterized by an increase in Prevotella copri. Dietary intervention with functional foods significantly modified faecal microbiota compared with P by increasing alpha diversity and modifying the abundance of specific bacteria, independently of antidiabetic drugs. There was a decrease in P. copri and increases in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila, two bacterial species known to have anti-inflammatory effects. The DP group also exhibited significant reductions in areas under the curve for glucose, total and LDL cholesterol, FFAs, HbA (P< 0.05), triglycerides and CRP, and an increase in antioxidant activity (P< 0.01) vs. the P group.Long-term adherence to a high-fibre, polyphenol-enriched and vegetable-protein-based diet provides benefits for the composition of faecal microbiota, and may offer potential therapies for improvement of glycaemic control, dyslipidaemia and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Under septic conditions, the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx covering on the healthy endothelium surface is injured, but the contribution of NE to this injury remains unknown. Our aim was to examine whether NE-induced pulmonary endothelial injury is associated with . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into 9- to 12-week-old granulocyte colony-stimulating factor knockout (G-CSFKO) mice, which harbor few neutrophils, and littermate control mice; in a second assay, mice were injected with the NE-inhibitor sivelestat (0. mg/kg) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after LPS administration. Subsequently, vascular endothelial injury was evaluated through ultrastructural analysis. At 48 hours after LPS injection, survival rate was more than threefold higher among G-CSFKO than control mice, and degradation of both thrombomodulin and syndecan-1 was markedly attenuated in G-CSFKO compared with control mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed attenuated vascular endothelial injury and clear preservation of the endothelial glycocalyx in G-CSFKO mice. Moreover, after LPS exposure, survival rate was approximately ninefold higher among sivelestat-injected mice than control mice, and sivelestat treatment potently preserved vascular endothelial structures and the endothelial glycocalyx.

To furtherly clarify the role of ClC-3 chloride channels in systemic inflammation, we used LPS-induced  model to investigate the response of wild-type and ClC-3 knockout mice to systemic inflammation. The results showed that in the LPS-induced  model, the mortality of mice with ClC-3 deletion was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice. The liver and lung inflammations in mice with ClC-3 deletion were significantly less than those in wild-type mice, and the levels of TNF-α and MIP- in serum were lower than those of wild-type mice. However, intestinal inflammatory cytokines contents and intestinal permeability were higher than wild-type mice. After transfection of THP-1 cells with ClC-3 siRNA, the contents of TNF-α and IL-8 in LPS-induced cell supernatants were significantly decreased. Further experiments revealed that the level of Bax and Cleaved Caspase 3 in intestinal tissue of mice with ClC-3 deletion was significantly increased, while the level of Bcl2 did not change, which indicated that the intestinal apoptosis was increased after LPS-induced mice intestinal integrity destruction.

Diacerein is an interleukin-1β (IL-1β) inhibitor used for osteoarthritis treatment by exerting anti-inflammatory effects. This study aims to investigate the effects of diacerein on -induced AKI.Male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg) for 24 h prior to diacerein treatment (15 mg/kg/day) for another 48 h. Mice were examined by histological, molecular and biochemical approaches.LPS administration showed a time-dependent increase of IL-1β expression and secretion in kidney tissues. Diacerein treatment normalized urine volume and osmolarity, reduced blood urea nitrogen (BUN), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), serum creatinine and osmolarity, and protected renal function in an endotoxemic AKI mice model. In the histopathologic study, diacerein also improved renal tubular damage such as necrosis of the tubular segment. Moreover, diacerein inhibited LPS-induced increase of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and nitric oxide synthase . In addition, LPS administration markedly decreased aquaporin 1 (AQP1), AQP2, AQP3, Na,K-ATPase α1, apical type 3 Na/H exchanger and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter expression in the kidney, which was reversed by diacerein treatment. We also found that diacerein or IL-1β inhibition prevented the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and the decrease of AQP and sodium transporter expression induced by LPS in HK- cells.Our study demonstrates for the first time that diacerein improves renal function efficiently in endotoxemic AKI mice by suppressing inflammation and altering tubular water and sodium handing.

In a day after the LPS injection, we studied endotoxin, corticosterone, sex steroids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity levels in the serum; morphological disorders in the lung, liver, thymus, and spleen; ex vivo production of IL-, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon γ (IFNγ) by splenic cells activated by ConA; and relative amount of T- and B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.After the injection of low-dose LPS, the serum endotoxin level increased only in males and was combined with a more pronounced inflammatory response in the lungs and thymus and an increase in ALT and AST activity levels without any changes in corticosterone level. After the injection of high-dose LPS, the inflammatory and pathological changes in the target organs manifested as severe  and sex differences of pathological changes in the lungs and liver were not revealed. The level of production of IL-, IL-4, IFNγ, and TNF by splenic cells and the number of T-lymphocytes, including cytotoxic cells, in the peripheral blood, decreased in males, which is an evidence of a pronounced suppression of the immune response.We have shown that the morphofunctional changes in the organs of the immune system in females and males, as well as the intensity of the sex differences of inflammation, depend on the severity of systemic inflammatory response, induced by different doses of LPS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810621>Protective effect of dexmedetomidine against organ dysfunction in a two-hit model of hemorrhage/resuscitation and  in rats.</a></h2><p>Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective agonist of α-adrenergic receptors, has anti-inflammation properties and potential beneficial effects against trauma, shock, or infection. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether DEX might protect against multiple-organ dysfunction in a two-hit model of hemorrhage/resuscitation (HS) and subsequent . Eighty Wistar rats were randomized into four groups: NS (normal saline), HS/L (HS plus lipopolysaccharide), HS/L+D (HS/L plus dexmedetomidine), and HS/L+D+Y (HS/L+D plus yohimbine). Six hours after resuscitation, blood gas (PaO2) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urine nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and nitric oxide (NO) were measured. The histopathology was assayed by staining. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were assayed. The PaO2 levels in HS/L rats were lower whereas the ALT, AST, BUN, Cr, TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and NO levels were higher compared to the control group. The HS/L+D increased PaO2 and further increased IL-10 and decreased ALT, AST, BUN, Cr, TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-8, and NO levels of the HS/L groups. In addition, the MDA in the HS/L groups increased whereas SOD activity decreased compared to the control group. Moreover, the HO-1 expression levels were increased by DEX administration in lung, liver, and kidney tissues. Lungs, livers, and kidneys of the HS/L group displayed significant damage, but such damage was attenuated in the HS/L+D group. All of the above-mentioned effects of DEX were partly reversed by yohimbine.

The molecular mechanisms involved in endotoxin tolerance (ET) induction in MCs are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the endocannabinoid -arachidonoylglycerol (-AG) and its receptor, cannabinoid receptor  (CB2), play a role in the establishment of ET in bone marrow-derived MCs from C57BL/6J mice. We found that CB2 antagonism prevented the development of ET and that bone marrow-derived MCs produce -AG in a TLR4-dependent fashion. Exogenous -AG induced ET similarly to LPS, blocking the phosphorylation of IKK and the p65 subunit of NF-κB and inducing the synthesis of molecular markers of ET. LPS caused CB2 receptor trafficking in Rab11-, Rab7-, and Lamp2-positive vesicles, indicating recycling and degradation of the receptor. -AG also prevented LPS-induced TNF secretion in vivo, in a MC-dependent model of , demonstrating that TLR4 engagement leads to -AG secretion, which contributes to the negative control of MCs activation.

However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the association of serum LBP levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations. Methods and Results A total of 2568 community-dwelling Japanese individuals 40 years and older without prior CVD were followed for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum LBP levels were divided into quartiles (quartile 1: .20-9.68 μg/mL; quartile : 9.69-10.93 μg/mL; quartile 3: 10.94-12.40 μg/mL; quartile 4: 12.41-24.34 μg/mL). The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for the incidence of CVD were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 180 individuals developed CVD. The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of CVD increased significantly with higher serum LBP levels ( for trend=0.005). Individuals with higher serum LBP levels had a significantly greater risk of the development of CVD after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (quartile 1: HR, 1.00 [reference]; quartile : HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.60-1.78]; quartile 3: HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.92-.51]; and quartile 4: HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.17-3.09];  for trend=0.01). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( for trend=0.01). However, when additional adjustment was made for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the association was attenuated to the nonsignificant level ( for trend=0.08). Conclusions The present findings suggest that higher serum LBP levels are associated with increased risk of the development of CVD in the general Japanese population.

The bacteremia, , and systemic low-grade inflammation associate periodontitis with systemic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Periodontal pathogens have been detected from atheromatous plaque by amplification of the genetic material by using specific oligonucleotide primers in polymerase chain reaction. Though the association between periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases has been ascertained by systematic reviews and meta-analyses, its pathophysiology is not lucid. MicroRNAs are currently implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes including inflammation and may play a vital role in our understanding of this disease association. In this case-control study, we explored the role of the inflammatory microRNA, miR-146a, in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) subjects with and without chronic periodontitis (CP) and its regulation of the innate immune host response to periodontal pathogens.Three groups each comprising 66 patients each, namely group 1 (ACS patients without CP), group  (ACS patients with CP) and group 3 (CP only) formed the study population. Subgingival plaque samples and serum samples were subjected to quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone pathogen and to assess the levels of circulating miR-146a and associated proinflammatory cytokines.miR-146a associated significantly in group  subjects with an odds ratio 1.434, 95% confidence interval 1.013-.030, P < 0.042, and a predictive percentage of 83.3% and group 1 with a predictive percentage of 76.0.% The associated cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β also showed an upregulation with statistical significance (P < 0.05).microRNA-146a is a key molecule associating periodontitis with acute coronary syndrome.© 2019 American Academy of Periodontology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785235>Endotoxin-induced cerebral pathophysiology: differences between fetus and newborn.</a></h2><p>As the comparative pathophysiology of perinatal infection in the fetus and newborn is uncertain, this study contrasted the cerebral effects of  in conscious fetal sheep and newborn lambs. Responses to intravenous bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) or normal saline were studied on three consecutive days in fetal sheep (LPS 1 μg/kg, n = 5; normal saline n = 5) and newborn lambs (LPS  μg/kg, n = 10; normal saline n = 5). Cerebro-vascular function was assessed by monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) over 12 h each day, and inflammatory responses were assessed by plasma TNF alpha (TNF-α), nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Brain injury was quantified by counting both resting and active macrophages in the caudate nucleus and periventricular white matter (PVWM). An acute cerebral vasoconstriction (within 1 h of LPS injection) occurred in both the fetus (ΔCVR +53%) and newborn (ΔCVR +63%); subsequently prolonged cerebral vasodilatation occurred in the fetus (ΔCVR -33%) in association with double plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations, but not in the newborn. Abundant infiltration of activated macrophages was observed in both CN and PVWM at each age, with the extent being -3 times greater in the fetus (P < 0.001). In conclusion, while the fetus and newborn experience a similar acute disruption of the cerebral circulation after LPS, the fetus suffers a more prolonged circulatory disruption, a greater infiltration of activated macrophages, and an exaggerated susceptibility to brain injury.© 2019 The Authors.

The magnitude of the immune response is dependent on the strength of the external stimulus. Knowledge on leukocyte transcriptional responses altered in response to different stimulus dosages in man is lacking. Here, we sought to identify leukocyte transcriptional signatures dependent on LPS dose in humans. Healthy human volunteers were administered 1 ng/kg (n = 7),  ng/kg (n = 6), or 4 ng/kg (n = 7) LPS intravenously. Blood was collected before (pre-LPS) and 4 h after LPS administration. Total RNA was analyzed by microarrays and generalized linear models. Pathway analysis was performed by using Ingenuity pathway analysis. Leukocyte transcriptomes altered per LPS dosage were predominantly shared, with 47% common signatures relative to pre-LPS. A univariate linear model identified a set of 3736 genes that exhibited a dependency on differing LPS dosages. Neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts explained 38.9% of the variance in the LPS dose-dependent gene set. A multivariate linear model including leukocyte composition delineated a set of 295 genes with a dependency on LPS dose. Evaluation of the 295 gene signature in patients with sepsis due to abdominal infections showed significant correlations. Promoter regions of the LPS dose gene set were enriched for YY1, EGR1, ELK1, GABPA, KLF4, and REL transcription factor binding sites.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential link between glucose control, intestinal permeability, diet and intestinal microbiota in patients with T2D. Thirty-two males with well-controlled T2D and 30 age-matched male controls without diabetes were enrolled in a case-control study. Metabolic parameters, inflammatory markers, , and intestinal microbiota in individuals subdivided into high (HP) and normal (LP) colonic permeability groups, were the main outcomes. In T2D, the HP group had significantly higher fasting glucose (P = 0.034) and plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels (P = 0.049) compared with the LP group. Increased colonic permeability was also linked with altered abundances of selected microbial taxa. The microbiota of both T2D and control HP groups was enriched with Enterobacteriales. In conclusion, high intestinal permeability was associated with poorer fasting glucose control in T2D patients and changes in some microbial taxa in both T2D patients and nondiabetic controls.

Many peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients use acidic, hypertonic dialysates, which could potentially increase gut permeability, resulting in systemic . However, the results from studies measuring endotoxin in PD patients are discordant. We therefore measured systemic endotoxin in 55 PD outpatients attending for routine assessment of peritoneal membrane function; mean age 58.7 ± 16.4 years, 32 (58.%) male, 21 (38.%) diabetic, median duration of PD treatment 19.5 (13 - 31) months, 32 (58.%) using 22.7 g/L dextrose dialysates, and 47 (85.5%) icodextrin. The median systemic endotoxin concentration was 0.0485 (0.0043 - 0.103) Eu/mL. We found no association between endotoxin levels and patient demographics, markers of inflammation, serum albumin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, extracellular volume measured by bioimpedance, blood pressure, PD prescriptions or peritoneal membrane transporter status, or medications. The measurement of endotoxin can be lowered by failure to effectively release protein-bound endotoxin prior to analysis and increased by contamination when taking blood samples and processing and storing the samples. Additionally, contamination with β-glucan from fungal cell walls and the use of different assays to analyze endotoxin can also give differing results. These factors may help to explain the disparate results reported in different studies. Our study would suggest that exposure to standard peritoneal dialysates does not substantially increase systemic endotoxin. However, until endotoxin assays can measure free and bound endotoxin separately, the role of endotoxin causing inflammation in PD patients remains to be determined.Copyright © 2018 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767701>Microbiome-Mediated Effects of the Mediterranean Diet on Inflammation.</a></h2><p>The Mediterranean diet pattern is increasingly associated with improved metabolic health.

Analysis of the human ITPR3 promoter revealed five putative response elements to NF-κB, and promoter activity was inhibited by p65/p50. Nested 0.5- and 1.0-kilobase (kb) deletion fragments of the ITPR3 promoter were inhibited by NF-κB subunits. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that NF-κB interacts with the ITPR3 promoter, with an associated increase in H3K9 methylation. LPS decreased ITPR3 mRNA and protein expression and also decreased sensitivity of bile duct cells to calcium agonist stimuli. This reduction was reversed by inhibition of TLR4. ITPR3 expression was decreased or absent in cholangiocytes from patients with cholestasis of sepsis and from those with severe AH. Conclusion: Stimulation of TLR4 by LPS activates NF-κB to down-regulate ITPR3 expression in human cholangiocytes. This may contribute to the cholestasis that can be observed in conditions such as sepsis or AH.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p></html>
