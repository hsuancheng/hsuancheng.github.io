We detected two major signalling pathways (ion channels and the ERBB signalling family of  kinases) that could be replicated across independent GWA studies meta-analyses. To investigate the significance of these pathways for sleep modulation, we performed transcriptome analyses of short sleeping flies' heads (knockdown for the ABCC9 gene homolog; dSur). We found significant alterations in gene-expression in the short sleeping knockdowns versus controls flies, which correspond to pathways associated with sleep duration in our human studies. Most notably, the expression of Rho and EGFR (members of the ERBB signalling pathway) genes was down- and up-regulated, respectively, consistently with the established role of these genes for sleep consolidation in Drosophila. Using a disease multifactorial interaction network, we showed that many of the genes of the pathways indicated to be relevant for sleep duration had functional evidence of their involvement with sleep regulation, circadian rhythms, insulin secretion, gluconeogenesis and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28585197>Human Protein Kinases and Obesity.</a></h1><p>The action of protein kinases and protein phosphatases is essential for multiple physiological responses. Each protein kinase displays its own unique substrate specificity, and a regulatory mechanism that may be modulated by association with other proteins. Protein kinases are classified by the target amino acid in their substrates. Some protein kinases can phosphorylate both serine/threonine, as well as  residues. This group of kinases has been known as dual specificity kinases. Unlike the dual specificity kinases, a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases are known as dual-specificity phosphatases. These phosphatases remove phosphate groups from  and serine/threonine residues on their substrate. Dual-specificity phosphatases are important signal transduction enzymes that regulate various cellular processes in coordination with protein kinases. The protein kinase-phosphoproteins interactions play an important role in obesity . In obesity, the pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of adipokines and cytokines through intracellular signaling pathways mainly involve the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) systems as well as the inhibitor of kappaB-kinase beta (IKK beta). Impairment of insulin signaling in obesity is largely mediated by the activation of the IKKbeta and the JNK. Furthermore, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activate the JNK pathway which suppresses insulin biosynthesis. Additionally, obesity-activated calcium/calmodulin dependent-protein kinase II/p38 suppresses insulin-induced protein kinase B phosphorylation by activating the ER stress effector, activating transcription factor-4. Obese adults with vascular endothelial dysfunction have greater endothelial cells activation of unfolded protein response stress sensors, RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor-6. The transcriptional regulation of  in obesity is influenced by AGC (protein kinase A (PKA), PKG, PKC) family signaling kinases. Obesity may induce systemic oxidative stress and increase reactive oxygen species in adipocytes. Increase in intracellular oxidative stress can promote PKC-beta activation. Activated PKC-beta induces growth factor adapter Shc phosphorylation. Shc-generated peroxides reduce mitochondrial oxygen consumption and enhances triglyceride accumulation. Obesity is fundamentally caused by cellular energy imbalance and dysregulation. Like adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), N-terminal Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) kinase are nutrient responsive protein kinases and important for proper regulation of glucose metabolism in mammals at both the hormonal and cellular level. Defective responses of AMPK to leptin may contribute to resistance to leptin action on food intake and energy expenditure in obese states.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28513320>CRISPR/Cas9-based Pten knock-out and Sleeping Beauty Transposon-mediated Nras knock-in induces hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic lipid accumulation in mice.</a></h1><p>Both Pten and Nras are downstream mediators of receptor  kinase activation that plays important roles in controlling cell survival and proliferation. Here, we investigated whether and how Pten loss cross-talks with Nras activation in driving liver cancer development in mice. Somatic disruption of hepatic Pten and overexpression of Nras were achieved in out-bred immunocompetent CD-1 mice through a hydrodynamic delivery of plasmids carrying Sleeping Beauty transposon-based integration of Nras and the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Pten knockout system. Concurrent Pten knockout and Nras knock-in induced hepatocellular carcinoma, while individual gene manipulation failed. Tumor development was associated with liver fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, hepatic deposition of lipid droplets and glycogen, and hepatomegaly. At the molecular level, lipid droplet formation was primarily contributed by upregulated expression of genes responsible for  and fatty acid sequestration, such as Srebpf1, Acc, Pparg and its downstream targets. Our findings demonstrated that Pten disruption was synergized by Nras overexpression in driving hepatocyte malignant transformation, which correlated with extensive formation of lipid droplets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27536268>Vanadate Impedes  in Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Different Depots within Bone.</a></h1><p>Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is associated with an increase in bone marrow adiposity, which skews the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitors away from osteoblastogenesis and toward . We have previously found that vanadate, a non-specific protein  phosphatase inhibitor, prevents GIO in rats, but it was unclear whether vanadate directly influenced  in bone-derived MSCs. For the present study, we investigated the effect of vanadate on  in primary rat MSCs derived from bone marrow (bmMSCs) and from the proximal end of the femur (pfMSCs). By passage 3 after isolation, both cell populations expressed the MSC cell surface markers CD90 and CD106, but not the hematopoietic marker CD45. However, although variable, expression of the fibroblast marker CD26 was higher in pfMSCs than in bmMSCs. Differentiation studies using osteogenic and adipogenic induction media (OM and AM, respectively) demonstrated that pfMSCs rapidly accumulated lipid droplets within 1 week of exposure to AM, while bmMSCs isolated from the same femur only formed lipid droplets after 3 weeks of AM treatment. Conversely, pfMSCs exposed to OM produced mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) after 3 weeks, compared to 1 week for OM-treated bmMSCs. Vanadate (10 μM) added to AM resulted in a significant reduction in AM-induced intracellular lipid accumulation and expression of adipogenic gene markers (PPARγ2, aP2, adipsin) in both pfMSCs and bmMSCs. Pharmacological concentrations of glucocorticoids (1 μM) alone did not induce lipid accumulation in either bmMSCs or pfMSCs, but resulted in significant cell death in pfMSCs. Our findings demonstrate the existence of at least two fundamentally different MSC depots within the femur and highlights the presence of MSCs capable of rapid  within the proximal femur, an area prone to osteoporotic fractures. In addition, our results suggest that the increased bone marrow adiposity observed in GIO may not be solely due to direct effect of glucocorticoids on bone-derived MSCs, and that an increase in femur lipid content may also arise from increased  in MSCs residing outside of the bone marrow niche.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068433>Herbal composition Gambigyeongsinhwan (4) from Curcuma longa, Alnus japonica, and Massa Medicata Fermentata inhibits lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and regulates obesity in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats.</a></h1><p>Adipocyte lipid accumulation due to impaired fatty acid oxidation causes adipocyte hypertrophy and adipose tissue increment, leading to obesity. The aim of this study was to determine the antiobesity effects of the herbal composition Gambigyeongsinhwan (4) (GGH(4)) composed of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), Alnus japonica (Thunb.) Steud. (Betulaceae), and the fermented traditional Korean medicine Massa Medicata Fermentata.The effects of GGH(4) and the individual components on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and body weight gain in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were examined using Oil red O staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, quantitative real-time PCR, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) transactivation assay.GGH(4), individual components, and an active principle of Curcuma longa curcumin inhibited lipid accumulation and mRNA levels of adipocyte-specific genes (PPARγ, aP2, and C/EBPα) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with control cells. Treatment with GGH(4), the individual components or curcmumin increased mRNA levels of mitochondrial (CPT-1, MCAD, and VLCAD) and peroxisomal (ACOX and thiolase) PPARα target genes. GGH(4) and the individual components also increased PPARα reporter gene expression compared with control cells. These effects were most prominent in GGH(4)-treated cells. However, the PPARα antagonist GW6471 reversed the inhibitory effects of GGH(4) on . An in vivo study showed that GGH(4) decreased body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and visceral adipocyte size with increasing mRNA levels of adipose tissue PPARα target genes in OLETF rats.These results demonstrate that GGH(4) has an antiobesity effects through the inhibition of adipocyte lipid accumulation, and this process may be mediated in part through adipose PPARα activation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Of the seven STATs, STAT5A and STAT5B are of particular interest for their critical roles in cellular differentiation, , oncogenesis, and immune function. The interactions of STAT5A and STAT5B with cytokine/hormone receptors, nuclear receptors, transcriptional regulators, proto-oncogenes, kinases, and phosphatases all contribute to modulating STAT5 activity. Among these STAT5 interacting proteins, some serve as coactivators or corepressors to regulate STAT5 transcriptional activity and some proteins can interact with STAT5 to enhance or repress STAT5 signaling. In addition, a few STAT5 interacting proteins have been identified as positive regulators of STAT5 that alter serine and  phosphorylation of STAT5 while other proteins have been identified as negative regulators of STAT5 via dephosphorylation. This review article will discuss how STAT5 activity is modulated by proteins that physically interact with STAT5.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968756>Hepatic Insulin Clearance: Mechanism and Physiology.</a></h1><p>Upon its secretion from pancreatic β-cells, insulin reaches the liver through the portal circulation to exert its action and eventually undergo clearance in the hepatocytes. In addition to insulin secretion, hepatic insulin clearance regulates the homeostatic level of insulin that is required to reach peripheral insulin target tissues to elicit proper insulin action. Receptor-mediated insulin uptake followed by its degradation constitutes the basic mechanism of insulin clearance. Upon its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor  kinase, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) takes part in the insulin-insulin receptor complex to increase the rate of its endocytosis and targeting to the degradation pathways. This review summarizes how this process is regulated and how it is associated with insulin-degrading enzyme in the liver. It also discusses the physiological implications of impaired hepatic insulin clearance: Whereas reduced insulin clearance cooperates with increased insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance, it can also cause hepatic insulin resistance. Because chronic hyperinsulinemia stimulates hepatic de novo , impaired insulin clearance also causes hepatic steatosis. Thus impaired insulin clearance can underlie the link between hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Delineating these regulatory pathways should lead to building more effective therapeutic strategies against metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27324794>miR-146a-5p inhibits TNF-α-induced  via targeting insulin receptor in primary porcine adipocytes.</a></h1><p>TNF-α is a multifunctional cytokine participating in immune disorders, inflammation, and tumor development with regulatory effects on energy metabolism. Our work focused on the function of TNF-α in  of primary porcine adipocytes. TNF-α could suppress the insulin receptor (IR) at the mRNA and protein levels. Microarray analysis of TNF-α-treated porcine adipocytes was used to screen out 29 differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs), 13 of which were remarkably upregulated and 16 were intensely downregulated. These 29 differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted to mainly participate in the insulin signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and type 2 diabetes mellitus pathway by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. miR-146a-5p, reportedly involved in immunity and cancer relevant processes, was one of the most highly differentially expressed miRNAs after TNF-α treatment. Red Oil O staining and TG assay revealed that miR-146a-5p suppressed . A dual-luciferase reporter and siRNA assay verified that miR-146a-5p targeted IR and could inhibit its protein expression. miR-146a-5p was also validated to be involved in the insulin signaling pathway by reducing  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1. Our study provides the first evidence of miR-146a-5p targeting IR, which facilitates future studies related to obesity and diabetes using pig models.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634525>Shp2 regulates chlorogenic acid-induced proliferation and adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in .</a></h1><p>Chlorogenic acid (CGA) exhibits various biological properties, including the inhibition of oxidation, obesity, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. CGA is also able to promote cell survival and proliferation. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of CGA on the  of bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Treatment with CGA had a marginal effect on cell proliferation, by promoting the expression levels of phosphorylated Akt and cyclin D1. Furthermore, treatment with CGA also upregulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (Erk) and inhibited the adipocyte differentiation of BMSCs by inhibiting the expression of peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR)γ and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α. However, knockdown of the expression of Shp2 attenuated CGA‑induced proliferation and inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and expression of cyclin D1. Furthermore, CGA treatment upregulated Erk phosphorylation and decreased the expression levels of PPARγ and CEBPα, which was inhibited by treatment with the Shp2 PTPase activity inhibitor, NSC‑87877. The results of the present study suggested that CGA‑induced Akt and Erk pathways regulate proliferation and differentiation and that Shp2 is important in the proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26989847>Selective Inhibition of PTP1B by Vitalboside A from Syzygium cumini Enhances Insulin Sensitivity and Attenuates Lipid Accumulation Via Partial Agonism to PPARγ: In Vitro and In Silico Investigation.</a></h1><p>Although antidiabetic drugs show good insulin-sensitizing property for T2DM, they also exhibit undesirable side-effects. Partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonism with protein  phosphatase 1B inhibition is considered as an alternative therapeutic approach toward the development of a safe insulin sensitizer. Bioactivity-based fractionation and purification of Syzygium cumini seeds led to the isolation and identification of bifunctional Vitalboside A, which showed antidiabetic and anti-adipogenic activities, as measured by glucose uptake in L6 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Nile red assay. A non-competitive allosteric inhibition of protein  phosphatase 1B by Vitalboside A was observed, which was confirmed by docking studies. Inhibitor studies with wortmannin and genistein showed an IRTK- and PI3K-dependent glucose uptake. A PI3K/AKT-dependent activation of GLUT4 translocation and an inactivation of GSK3β were observed, confirming its insulin-sensitizing potential. Vitalboside A exhibited partial transactivation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ with an increase in adiponectin secretion, which was confirmed using docking analysis. Vitalboside A is a bifunctional molecule derived from edible plant showing inhibition of PTP1B and partial agonism to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ which could be a promising therapeutic agent in the management of obesity and diabetes.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28433582>Effects of twenty standard amino acids on biochemical constituents, docosahexaenoic acid production and metabolic activity changes of Crypthecodinium cohnii.</a></h1><p>The influence of 20 standard amino acids was investigated on growth, lipid accumulation, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) production and cell biochemical composition of Crypthecodinium cohnii. C. cohnii efficiently utilize organic nitrogen (predominantly threonine and to a lesser extent  and serine) as compared to inorganic nitrogen (NH)SO. However, No significant effect was observed on major biochemical composition of C. cohnii (lipids, carbohydrates and proteins) under N limitation or supplementation with different N-sources. Key lipogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme, citrate synthase (CS), NAD and NADP dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase were shown to be vital in  of C. cohnii. Our results indicated that the process of lipid accumulation in C. cohnii is growth-associated and does not depend upon the trigger of nitrogen depletion. This unusual behavior would suggest that the metabolism of the cells may not be entirely the same as in other lipid-accumulating microorganisms.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that a combined approach of hepatic PTP1B inhibition and methionine restriction could lead to a synergistic effect on improvements in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism.Male and female hepatic PTP1B knockout (Alb-Ptp1b(-/-)) and control wild-type (Ptp1b(fl/fl)) mice were maintained on control diet (0.86% methionine) or MR diet (0.172% methionine) for 8weeks. Body weight and food intake were recorded and physiological tests for whole-body glucose homeostasis were performed. Serum and tissues were analyzed biochemically.MR decreased body weight and increased food intake in Ptp1b(fl/fl) mice as expected, without changing PTP1B protein expression levels or activity. In females, MR treatment alone improved glucose tolerance in Ptp1b(fl/fl) mice, which was further amplified with hepatic PTP1B deficiency. However, other markers of glucose homeostasis were similar between MR-fed groups. In males, MR improved glucose homeostasis in both, Alb-Ptp1b(-/-) and wild-type Ptp1b(fl/fl) mice to a similar extent. Hepatic PTP1B inhibition in combination with MR could not further enhance insulin-stimulated hepatic protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation compared to MR treatment alone and therefore led to no further increase in hepatic insulin signaling. The combined treatment did not further improve lipid metabolism relative to MR diet alone.Methionine restriction improves glucose and lipid homeostasis; however, adding hepatic PTP1B inhibition to MR is unlikely to yield any additional protective effects.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we have uncovered a distinct positive feedback loop that arises from the reciprocal stabilization of the  kinase ABL and the transcriptional coactivator TAZ. Moreover, we determined that this loop is required for osteoblast differentiation and embryonic skeletal formation. ABL potentiated the assembly and activation of the RUNX2-TAZ master transcription factor complex that is required for osteoblastogenesis, while antagonizing PPARγ-mediated . ABL also enhanced TAZ nuclear localization and the formation of the TAZ-TEAD complex that is required for osteoblast expansion. Last, we have provided genetic data showing that regulation of the ABL-TAZ amplification loop lies downstream of the adaptor protein 3BP2, which is mutated in the craniofacial dysmorphia syndrome cherubism. Our study demonstrates an interplay between ABL and TAZ that controls the mesenchymal maturation program toward the osteoblast lineage and is mechanistically distinct from the established model of lineage-specific maturation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26412543>Expression of NGF, BDNF and their receptors in subcutaneous adipose tissue of lactating cows.</a></h1><p>Currently, there are no reports of neurotrophins in adipose tissue of cows. The distribution of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and their high-affinity  kinase receptors TrkA and TrkB, was investigated by immunohistochemical method in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of cow at mid-lactation. Results revealed the localization of NGF and BDNF along the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of adipocytes. Neurotrophin receptors TrkA and TrkB showed moderate and strong positive staining in adipocytes, respectively. The expression of NGF, BDNF, TRKB--but not of TRKA--was also confirmed at transcriptional level by RT-PCR analyses. Considering the involvement of BDNF on fat metabolism and of NGF on activation of the sympathetic response in human and rodents, these neurotrophins could be related to  and lipolysis occurring during lactation in cows. The local production of these neurotrophins supports their potential paracrine function for the regulation of adipocyte activity and deserve further investigations.Copyright © 2015.

It stimulates proliferation, cytokine, and hyaluronan production, and thyrotropin receptor expression by orbital fibroblasts. Therefore, the PDGF-pathway has been proposed as a target for pharmacological intervention in GO. However, increased  is another major pathological characteristic of GO and it is unknown whether this is affected by PDGF-BB. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PDGF-BB on adipocyte differentiation by orbital fibroblasts.Orbital fibroblasts from five healthy controls and nine GO patients were collected.  was induced by culturing orbital fibroblasts in differentiation medium, either in the presence or absence of PDGF-BB.  was determined by Oil-Red-O staining, triglyceride measurement, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ mRNA expression.Platelet-derived growth factor-BB significantly enhanced adipocyte differentiation by orbital fibroblasts (Oil-Red-O staining [P < 0.0001], triglyceride measurement [P < 0.05], and PPAR-γ mRNA expression [P < 0.05]). It enhanced IL-6 production early during differentiation, but the effect of PDGF-BB on  was independent of autocrine IL-6 signaling as it was not abrogated by IL-6-receptor-α neutralizing antibody. The clinically applicable  kinase inhibitor dasatinib and tyrphostin AG1296, which both block PDGF receptor  kinase activity, inhibited PDGF-BB-enhanced  (P < 0.05) in orbital fibroblasts. Moreover, dasatinib reduced PPAR-γ mRNA expression in cultured GO orbital tissue.Platelet-derived growth factor-BB enhances  in orbital fibroblasts, and, thus, may contribute to adipose tissue expansion in GO.

A diet high in saturated fats can induce inflammation and impair leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. However, the role of saturated fatty acids on hypothalamic leptin signaling, and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism remains largely undiscovered. In this study, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of a saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA, C16:0), on central leptin sensitivity, hypothalamic leptin signaling, inflammatory molecules and hepatic energy metabolism in C57BL/6J male mice. We found that the icv administration of PA led to central leptin resistance, evidenced by the inhibition of central leptin's suppression of food intake. Central leptin resistance was concomitant with impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling (JAK2-STAT3, PKB/Akt-FOXO1) and a pro-inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and pIκBa) in the mediobasal hypothalamus and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the pre-administration of icv PA blunted the effect of leptin-induced decreases in mRNA expression related to gluconeogenesis (G6Pase and PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2) and  (FAS and SCD1) in the liver of mice. Therefore, elevated central PA concentrations can induce pro-inflammatory responses and leptin resistance, which are associated with disorders of energy homeostasis in the liver as a result of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Model systems and human genetics support a role for IDOL in regulating circulating LDL levels. Whether IDOL plays a broader metabolic role and affects development of metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities is unknown. Approach and Results- We studied WT (wild type) and Idol (Idol-KO) mice in 2 models: physiological aging and diet-induced obesity. In both models, deletion of Idol protected mice from metabolic dysfunction. On a Western-type diet, Idol loss resulted in decreased circulating levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. This was accompanied by protection from weight gain in short- and long-term dietary challenges, which could be attributed to reduced hepatosteatosis and fat mass in Idol-KO mice. Although feeding and intestinal fat uptake were unchanged in Idol-KO mice, their brown adipose tissue was protected from lipid accumulation and had elevated expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) and TH ( hydroxylase). Indirect calorimetry indicated a marked increase in locomotion and suggested a trend toward increased cumulative energy expenditure and fat oxidation. An increase in in vivo clearance of reconstituted lipoprotein particles in Idol-KO mice may sustain this energetic demand. In the BXD mouse genetic reference population, hepatic Idol expression correlates with multiple metabolic parameters, thus providing support for findings in the Idol-KO mice. Conclusions- Our study uncovers an unrecognized role for Idol in regulation of whole body metabolism in physiological aging and on a Western-type diet. These findings support Idol inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target multiple metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28934139>Phyllodulcin, a Natural Sweetener, Regulates Obesity-Related Metabolic Changes and Fat Browning-Related Genes of Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Phyllodulcin is a natural sweetener found in  var. . This study investigated whether phyllodulcin could improve metabolic abnormalities in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Animals were fed a 60% HFD for 6 weeks to induce obesity, followed by 7 weeks of supplementation with phyllodulcin (20 or 40 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)/day). Stevioside (40 mg/kg b.w./day) was used as a positive control. Phyllodulcin supplementation reduced subcutaneous fat mass, levels of plasma lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improved the levels of leptin, adiponectin, and fasting blood glucose. In subcutaneous fat tissues, supplementation with stevioside or phyllodulcin significantly decreased mRNA expression of -related genes, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1C () compared to the high-fat group. Phyllodulcin supplementation significantly increased the expression of fat browning-related genes, including PR domain containing 16 (), uncoupling protein 1 (), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (), compared to the high-fat group. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF-TrkB) signaling was upregulated by phyllodulcin supplementation. In conclusion, phyllodulcin is a potential sweetener that could be used to combat obesity by regulating levels of leptin, fat browning-related genes, and hypothalamic BDNF-TrkB signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648832>Loss of Ron receptor signaling leads to reduced obesity, diabetic phenotypes and hepatic steatosis in response to high-fat diet in mice.</a></h1><p>The Ron receptor  kinase is a heterodimeric, membrane-spanning glycoprotein that participates in divergent processes, including proliferation, motility, and modulation of inflammatory responses. We observed male C57BL/6 mice with a global deletion of the Ron  kinase signaling domain (TK(-/-)) to be leaner compared with control (TK(+/+)) mice under a standard diet. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), TK(-/-) mice gained 50% less weight and were more insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant than controls. Livers from HFD TK(-/-) mice were considerably less steatotic and weighed significantly less than TK(+/+) livers. Serum cytokine levels of HFD TK(-/-) mice were also significantly altered compared with TK(+/+) mice. Fewer and smaller adipocytes were present in the TK(-/-) mice on both control and HFD and were accompanied by diminished adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ expression. In vitro  experiments suggested reduced differentiation in TK(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that was rescued by Ron reconstitution. Likewise, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation was diminished in TK(-/-) MEFs but was increased after Ron reconstitution. The adipogenic inhibitors, preadipocyte factor 1 and Sox9, were elevated in TK(-/-) MEFs and increased in both groups after STAT3 silencing. In total, these studies document a previously unknown function for the Ron receptor in mediating HFD-induced obesity and metabolic dysregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26145823>Design and synthesis of a potent inhibitor of class 1 DYRK kinases as a suppressor of .</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of dual-specificity -phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) has been demonstrated in several pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression. It has been recently reported that a gain of function-mutation in the human DYRK1B gene exacerbates metabolic syndrome by enhancing obesity. In the previous study, we developed an inhibitor of DYRK family kinases (INDY) and demonstrated that INDY suppresses the pathological phenotypes induced by overexpression of DYRK1A or DYRK1B in cellular and animal models. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel inhibitor of DYRK family kinases based on the crystal structure of the DYRK1A/INDY complex by replacing the phenol group of INDY with dibenzofuran to produce a derivative, named BINDY. This compound exhibited potent and selective inhibitory activity toward DYRK family kinases in an in vitro assay. Furthermore, treatment of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes with BINDY hampered  by suppressing gene expression of the critical transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα. This study indicates the possibility of BINDY as a potential drug for metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Angiogenic factors have been linked to obesity, yet little is known about their expression during early childhood. To identify associations of angiogenic factors with characteristics on individual and tissue level, subcutaneous white adipose tissue samples were taken from 45 children aged 0-9 years undergoing elective surgery. We measured the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEFGA), fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (FGF1, FGF2), angiopoietin 1 and 2 (ANGPT1, ANGPT2), TEK receptor  kinase (TEK), and von Willebrand factor (VWF). In addition, we determined the mean adipocyte size in histologic tissue sections. We found positive correlations of age with FGF1 and FGF2 and a negative correlation with ANGPT2, with pronounced differences in the first two years of life. FGF1, FGF2, and ANGPT1 correlated positively with adipocyte size. Furthermore, we identified a correlation of ANGPT1 and TEK with body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), a measure to define childhood obesity. Except for ANGPT2, all angiogenic factors correlated positively with the endothelial marker VWF. In sum, our findings suggest that differences related to BMI-SDS begin early in childhood, and the analyzed angiogenic factors possess distinct roles in adipose tissue biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29575149>Exercise decreases CLK2 in the liver of obese mice and prevents hepatic fat accumulation.</a></h1><p>The accumulation of fatty acids in the liver associated with obesity condition is also known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The impaired fat oxidation in obesity condition leads to increased hepatic fat accumulation and increased metabolic syndrome risk. On the other hand, physical exercise has been demonstrated as a potent strategy in the prevention of NAFLD. Also, these beneficial effects of exercise occur through different mechanisms. Recently, the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK2) protein was associated with the suppression of fatty acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis. Thus, obese animals demonstrated elevated levels of hepatic CLK2 and decreased fat acid oxidation. Here, we explored the effects of chronic physical exercise in the hepatic metabolism of obese mice. Swiss mice were distributed in Lean, Obese (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks) and Trained Obese group (fed with high-fat diet during 16 weeks and exercised (at 60% exhaustion velocity during 1 h/5 days/week) during 8 weeks. In our results, the obese animals showed insulin resistance, increased hepatic CLK2 content and increased hepatic fat accumulation compared to the Lean group. Otherwise, the chronic physical exercise improved insulin resistance state, prevented the increased CLK2 in the liver and attenuated hepatic fat accumulation. In summary, these data reveal a new protein involved in the prevention of hepatic fat accumulation after chronic physical exercise. More studies can evidence the negative role of CLK2 in the control of liver metabolism, contributing to the improvement of insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29133512>Exosomes From Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Attenuate Adipose Inflammation and Obesity Through Polarizing M2 Macrophages and Beiging in White Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) play critical roles in controlling obesity-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders. Exosomes from ADSCs exert protective effects in several diseases, but their roles in obesity and related pathological conditions remain unclear. In this study, we showed that treatment of obese mice with ADSC-derived exosomes facilitated their metabolic homeostasis, including improved insulin sensitivity (27.8% improvement), reduced obesity, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. ADSC-derived exosomes drove alternatively activated M2 macrophage polarization, inflammation reduction, and beiging in white adipose tissue (WAT) of diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, exosomes from ADSCs transferred into macrophages to induce anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes through the transactivation of arginase-1 by exosome-carried active STAT3. Moreover, M2 macrophages induced by ADSC-derived exosomes not only expressed high levels of  hydroxylase responsible for catecholamine release, but also promoted ADSC proliferation and lactate production, thereby favoring WAT beiging and homeostasis in response to high-fat challenge. These findings delineate a novel exosome-mediated mechanism for ADSC-macrophage cross talk that facilitates immune and metabolic homeostasis in WAT, thus providing potential therapy for obesity and diabetes.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28025059>MicroRNA-206 prevents hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia by facilitating insulin signaling and impairing .</a></h1><p>The paradox of selective hepatic insulin resistance, wherein the insulin-resistant liver fails to suppress glucose production but continues to produce lipids, has been central to the pathophysiology of hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia. Our study was designed to investigate the mechanism(s) by which microRNA-206 alleviates the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.Dietary obese mice induced by a high fat diet were used to study the role of microRNA-206 in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia. A mini-circle vector was used to deliver microRNA-206 into the livers of mice.Lipid accumulation impaired biogenesis of microRNA-206 in fatty livers of dietary obese mice and human hepatocytes (p<0.01). Delivery of microRNA-206 into the livers of dietary obese mice resulted in the strong therapeutic effects on hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia. Mechanistically, miR-206 interacted with the 3' untranslated region of PTPN1 (protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 1) and induced its degradation. By inhibiting PTPN1 expression, microRNA-206 facilitated insulin signaling by promoting phosphorylation of INSR (insulin receptor) and impaired hepatic  by inhibiting Srebp1c transcription. By simultaneously modulating  and insulin signaling, microRNA-206 reduced lipid (p=0.006) and glucose (p=0.018) production in human hepatocytes and livers of dietary obese mice (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively). Re-introduction of Ptpn1 into livers offset the inhibitory effects of microRNA-206, indicating that PTPN1 mediates the inhibitory effects of microRNA-206 on both hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.MicroRNA-206 is a potent inhibitor of lipid and glucose production by simultaneously facilitating insulin signaling and impairing hepatic . Our findings potentially provide a novel therapeutic agent for both hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.The epidemic of obesity is causing a sharp rise in the incidence of insulin resistance and its major complications, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there are no effective treatments because the mechanisms underlying both disorders are not well described. We identified microRNA-206 as a novel and effective inhibitor for both glucose and lipid production in liver and potentially provide a unique therapeutic drug for both hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), cold exposure increased proliferation of endothelial cells and interstitial cells expressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor, α polypeptide (PDGFRα) by 3- to 4-fold. Surprisingly, brown  and angiogenesis were largely restricted to the dorsal edge of iBAT. Although cold stress did not increase proliferation in inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT), the percentage of BAs, defined as multilocular adipocytes that express uncoupling protein 1, rose from undetectable to 30% of total adipocytes. To trace the origins of cold-induced BAs, we genetically tagged PDGFRα(+) cells and adipocytes prior to cold exposure, using Pdgfra-Cre recombinase estrogen receptor T2 fusion protein (CreER(T2)) and adiponectin-CreER(T2), respectively. In iBAT, cold stress triggered the proliferation and differentiation of PDGFRα(+) cells into BAs. In contrast, all newly observed BAs in ingWAT (5207 out of 5207) were derived from unilocular adipocytes tagged by adiponectin-CreER(T2)-mediated recombination. Surgical denervation of iBAT reduced cold-induced brown  by >85%, whereas infusion of norepinephrine (NE) mimicked the effects of cold in warm-adapted mice. NE-induced de novo brown  in iBAT was eliminated in mice lacking β1-adrenergic receptors. These observations identify a novel tissue niche for brown  in iBAT and further define depot-specific mechanisms of BA recruitment.© FASEB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263933>Prohibitin: a potential therapeutic target in  kinase signaling.</a></h1><p>Prohibitin is a pleiotropic protein that has roles in fundamental cellular processes, such as cellular proliferation and mitochondrial housekeeping, and in cell- or tissue-specific functions, such as  and immune cell functions. The different functions of prohibitin are mediated by its cell compartment-specific attributes, which include acting as an adaptor molecule in membrane signaling, a scaffolding protein in mitochondria, and a transcriptional co-regulator in the nucleus. However, the precise relationship between its distinct cellular localization and diverse functions remain largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that the phosphorylation of prohibitin plays a role in a number of cell signaling pathways and in intracellular trafficking. Herein, we discuss the known and potential importance of the site-specific phosphorylation of prohibitin in regulating these features. We will discuss this in the context of new evidence from tissue-specific transgenic mouse models of prohibitin, including a mutant prohibitin lacking a crucial  phosphorylation site. We conclude with the opinion that prohibitin can be used as a potential target for  kinase signal transduction-targeting therapy, including in insulin, growth factors, and immune signaling pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26523513>Dehydroepiandrosterone-enhanced dual specificity protein phosphatase (DDSP) prevents diet-induced and genetic obesity.</a></h1><p>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) exerts a wide variety of therapeutic effects against medical disorders, such as diabetes and obesity. However, the molecular basis of DHEA action remains to be clarified. Previously, we reported that DHEA-enhanced dual specificity protein phosphatase, designated DDSP, is one of the target molecules of DHEA. To examine the role of DDSP in DHEA signaling, we generated mice that carry a DDSP transgene in which expression is driven by the CAG promoter (DDSP-Tg). DDSP-Tg mice weighed significantly less than wild-type (WT) control mice when a high fat diet was supplied (p < 0.01). No difference in food-intake or locomotor activity was found between DDSP-Tg and WT mice. Oxygen consumption of DDSP-Tg mice was higher than that of WT mice (p < 0.01), which suggested an increase in basal metabolism in DDSP-Tg mice. To further investigate the role of DDSP in genetic obese mice, DDSP-Tg mice with a db/db background were generated (DDSP-Tg db/db). We observed cancellation of obesity by the db/db mutation and development of a cachexic phenotype in DDSP-Tg db/db mice. In conclusion, our study shows that expression of DDSP leads to prevention of diet-induced and genetic (db/db) obesity. Anti-obese effects of DHEA might be mediated through DDSP, which might be a therapeutic target for intervention of obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To discover new genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, preadipocytes were treated with three newly identified pro-adipogenic small molecules and GW7845 (a Pparγ agonist) for 24 hours and transcriptional profiling was analyzed. Four genes, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ), human complement factor D homolog (Cfd), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9 (Ccl9), and GIPC PDZ Domain Containing Family Member 2 (Gipc2) were induced by at least two different small molecules but not by GW7845. Cfd and Ccl9 expressions were specific to adipocytes and they were altered in obese mice. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated knockdown of Cfd in preadipocytes inhibited lipid accumulation and expression of adipocyte markers during adipocyte differentiation. Overexpression of Cfd promoted adipocyte differentiation, increased C3a production, and led to induction of C3a receptor (C3aR) target gene expression. Similarly, treatments with C3a or C3aR agonist (C4494) also promoted . C3aR knockdown suppressed  and impaired the pro-adipogenic effects of Cfd, further suggesting the necessity for C3aR signaling in Cfd-mediated pro-adipogenic axis.

The present study aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets and elucidate the functional networks for the AXL and VIM genes in MDA‑MB‑231 cells. We identified 71 genes upregulated in MDA‑MB‑231 vs. MCF7 cells using BRB‑Array tool to re‑analyse microarray data from six GEO datasets. Gene ontology and STRING analysis showed that 43/71 genes upregulated in MDA‑MB‑231 compared with MCF7 cells, regulate cell survival and migration. Another 19 novel genes regulate migration, metastases, senescence, autophagy and chemoresistance. The Pattern Miner systems biology tool uses specific genes as inputs or 'baits' to identify outputs from the NCI‑60 database. Using five genes regulating cancer cell migration (AXL, VIM, EGFR, CAPN2, and COL4A1) as input 'baits', we used pattern miner to identify statistically significant, co‑expressed genes from the list of 71 genes upregulated in MDA‑MB‑231 compared with MCF7 cells. Outputs were subsets of the 71 genes, which showed significant co‑expression with one or more of the five input genes. These outputs were used to develop functional networks for AXL and VIM. Analysis of these networks verified known properties of AXL and VIM, and suggested novel functions for these two genes. Thus, genes in the AXL network promote migration, metastasis and chemoresistance, whereas the VIM gene network regulates novel tumorigenic processes, such as , senescence and autophagy. Notably, these two networks contain 12 genes not reported for TNBC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25224159>Antidiabetic property of Aerva lanata (L.)

Plant-based therapy could be an ideal choice because of fewer side-effects and wider acceptability. Hence, the antihyperglycemic potential of Aerva lanata, a herb prescribed for diabetes in Ayurveda was evaluated to elucidate its possible mechanism of action.High performance liquid chromatography analysis was used for the characterization of 70% ethanolic (aqueous leaf extract [ALE]) and ethyl acetate (AEA) extracts. Further, they were evaluated for their antioxidant, inhibition of alpha glucosidase, protein glycation dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and stimulation of glucose uptake and glitazone like property (adipogenic potential) using in vitro models. The promising alpha glucosidase inhibitory potential of ALE was further evaluated in normal and streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats.ALE inhibited yeast (IC50 - 81.76 μg/mL) and rat intestinal alpha glucosidase (IC50 - 108.7 μg/mL), protein glycation, DPP IV enzyme (IC50 - 118.62 μg/mL) and PTP1B (IC50 - 94.66 μg/mL). ALE stimulated maximal  at 50 μg/mL and enhanced insulin mediated glucose uptake (threefold of basal) at 100 μg/mL in L6 myotubes. ALE (500 mg/kg b.w.) showed a significant antihyperglycemic activity in sucrose loaded STZ normal (15.57%) and diabetic (18.44%) rats. HPLC analysis of ALE revealed the presence of bioactives like alpha amyrin, betulin and beta sitosterol.Alpha glucosidase inhibition, antiglycation, and adipogenic potential significantly contribute to the antidiabetic property of Aerva lanata.

However, the mechanisms and the factors for hematopoietic cell trans-differentiation remain unknown. In an in vitro culture system, we found that using a conditioned medium from proliferating fibroblasts can induce a subset of hematopoietic cells to become adherent fibroblast-like cells (FLCs). FLCs are not fibroblasts nor other mesenchymal stromal cells, based on their expression of type-1 collagen, and other stromal cell marker genes. To identify the active factors in the conditioned medium, we cultured fibroblasts in a serum-free medium and collected it for further purification. Using the fractions from filter devices of different molecular weight cut-offs, and ammonium sulfate precipitation collected from the medium, we found the active fraction is a protein. We then purified this fraction by using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and identified it by mass spectrometer as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The mechanisms of M-CSF-inducing trans-differentiation of hematopoietic cells seem to involve a  kinase signalling pathway and its known receptor. The FLCs express a number of stem cell markers including SSEA-1 and -3, OCT3/4, NANOG, and SOX2. Spontaneous and induced differentiation experiments confirmed that FLCs can be further differentiated into cell types of three germ layers. These data indicate that hematopoietic cells can be induced by M-CSF to dedifferentiate to multipotent stem cells. This study also provides a simple method to generate multipotent stem cells for clinical applications.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724135>Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor Induces  in Orbital Fibroblasts: Implications for the Pathogenesis of Graves' Orbitopathy.</a></h1><p>Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy (GO).

Previously, we reported that blocking AP-1 using the c-Jun dominant negative mutant TAM67 induced senescence, , or apoptosis in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) whereas inhibition of JunD by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically induced apoptosis. To investigate the role of AP-1 in Src-mediated transformation, we undertook a gene profiling study to characterize the transcriptomes of v-Src-transformed CEFs expressing either TAM67 or the JunD shRNA. Our study revealed a cluster of 18 probe sets upregulated exclusively in response to AP-1/JunD impairment and v-Src transformation. Four of these probe sets correspond to genes involved in the interferon pathway. One gene in particular, death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), is a C/EBPβ-regulated mediator of apoptosis in gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-induced cell death. Here, we show that inhibition of DAPK1 abrogates cell death in v-Src-transformed cells expressing the JunD shRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation data indicated that C/EBPβ was recruited to the DAPK1 promoter while the expression of a dominant negative mutant of C/EBPβ abrogated the induction of DAPK1 in response to the inhibition of AP-1. In contrast, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, JunD was not detected on the DAPK1 promoter under any conditions, suggesting that JunD promotes survival by indirectly antagonizing the expression of DAPK1 in v-Src transformed cells.Transformation by the v-Src oncoprotein causes extensive changes in gene expression in primary cells such as chicken embryo fibroblasts. These changes, determining the properties of transformed cells, are controlled in part at the transcriptional level. Much attention has been devoted to transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB and the control of genes associated with a more aggressive phenotype. In this report, we describe a novel mechanism of action determined by the JunD component of AP-1, a factor enhancing cell survival in v-Src-transformed cells. We show that the loss of JunD results in the aberrant activation of a genetic program leading to cell death. This program requires the activation of the tumor suppressor death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1). Since DAPK1 is phosphorylated and inhibited by v-Src, these results highlight the importance of this kinase and the multiple mechanisms controlled by v-Src to antagonize the tumor suppressor function of DAPK1.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29934339>FTO mediates cell-autonomous effects on  and adipocyte lipid content by regulating gene expression via 6mA DNA modifications.</a></h1><p>SNPs in the first intron of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase () convey effects on adiposity by mechanisms that remain unclear, but appear to include modulation of expression of  itself, as well as other genes in  expression is lower in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons of individuals segregating for  obesity risk alleles.

DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in insulin synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of insulin resistance. The internal and external factors such as obesity, urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected pathways: Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes,  kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κB. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose metabolism, hepatic enzymes activities, and a lipid profile.

However, its treatment mechanisms remain largely unknown. The study aimed to explain the molecular mechanisms of adipogenic differentiation from ASCs based on the roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).Datasets of mRNA-lncRNA (GSE113253) and miRNA (GSE72429) expression profiling were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs), lncRNAs (DELs) and miRNAs (DEMs) between undifferentiated and adipocyte differentiated human ASCs were identified using the Linear Models for Microarray Data method. DELs related co-expression and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to screen crucial target genes.A total of 748 DEGs, 17 DELs and 51 DEMs were identified. A total of 13 DELs and 279 DEGs with Pearson correlation coefficients > 0.9 and -value < 0.01 were selected to construct the co-expression network. A total of 151 interaction pairs among 112 nodes (10 DEMs; eight DELs; 94 DEGs) were obtained to construct the ceRNA network. By comparing the lncRNAs and mRNAs in two networks, five lncRNAs (SNHG9, LINC02202, UBAC2-AS1, PTCSC3 and myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT)) and 32 genes (i.e., such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), protein  phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB)) were found to be shared. PPI analysis demonstrated PIK3R1 , forkhead box O1 (FOXO1; a transcription factor) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) were hub genes, which could be regulated by the miRNAs that interacted with the above five lncRNAs, such as LINC02202-miR-136-5p-PIK3R1, LINC02202-miR-381-3p-FOXO1 and MIAT-miR-18a-5p-ESR1. LINC02202 also could directly co-express with PIK3R1.

However, the underlying mechanisms of stem cell fate specification are unclear. Chirality is one of the most crucial factors that affects stem cell development and is implicated in asymmetrical cell morphology formation; however, its function in heterogeneous cell fate determination remains elusive. In this study, it is reported that the chirality of a constructed 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) differentiates mesenchymal stem cells to diverse lineages of osteogenic and adipogenic cells by providing primary heterogeneity. Molecular analysis shows that left-handed chirality of the ECM enhances the clustering of the mechanosensor Itgα5, while right-handed chirality decreases this effect. These differential adhesion patterns further activate distinct mechanotransduction events involving the contractile state, focal adhesion kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 cascades, and yes-associated protein/runt-related transcription factor 2 nuclear translocation, which direct heterogeneous differentiation. Moreover, theoretical modeling demonstrates that diverse chirality mechanosensing is initiated by biphasic modes of fibronectin tethering.

Baseline plasma perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and the plasma metabolome were measured by liquid-chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between baseline PFASs and changes in glucose homeostasis over follow-up. A metabolome-wide association study coupled with pathway enrichment analysis was performed to evaluate metabolic dysregulation associated with plasma PFASs concentrations. We performed a structural integrated analysis aiming to characterize the joint impact of all factors and to identify latent clusters of children with alterations in glucose homeostasis, based on their exposure and metabolomics profile.Each ln (ng/ml) increase in PFOA and PFHxS concentrations was associated with a 30.6 mg/dL (95% CI: 8.8-52.4) and 10.2 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.7-17.7) increase in 2-hour glucose levels, respectively. A ln (ng/ml) increase in PFHxS concentrations was also associated with 17.8 mg/dL increase in the glucose area under the curve (95% CI: 1.5-34.1). Pathway enrichment analysis showed significant alterations of lipids (e.g., glycosphingolipids, linoleic acid, and de novo ), and amino acids (e.g., aspartate and asparagine, , arginine and proline) in association to PFASs exposure. The integrated analysis identified a cluster of children with increased 2-h glucose levels over follow up, characterized by increased PFAS levels and altered metabolite patterns.This proof-of-concept analysis shows that higher PFAS exposure was associated with dysregulation of several lipid and amino acid pathways and longitudinal alterations in glucose homeostasis in Hispanic youth. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and fully elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

As full agonists of PPARγ, thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs elicit antidiabetic effects by targeting PPARγ but is accompanied by weight gain, fluid retention and cardiovascular risk associated with their transcriptional agonism potency. We here identify a natural product chelerythrine as a unique selective PPAR modulator (SPPARM) with a potent PPARγ binding activity but much less classical receptor transcriptional agonism. Structural analysis reveals that chelerythrine exhibits unique binding in parallel with H3 of PPARγ. Unlike TZDs, chelerythrine destabilizes helix 12, especially residue  473, resulting in a loose configuration of AF-2 and a selective cofactor profile distinct from TZDs, leading to a differential target gene profile in  in db/db diabetic mice. Moreover, chelerythrine improved insulin sensitivity by more potently blocking the phosphorylation of PPARγ by CDK5 compared to TZDs. These data fundamentally elucidate the mechanism by which chelerythrine retains the benefits of improving insulin sensitivity while reducing the adverse effects of TZDs, suggesting that the natural product chelerythrine is a very promising pharmacological agent by selectively targeting PPARγ for further development in the clinical treatment of insulin resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25697345>Arginine vasopressin inhibits  in human adipose-derived stem cells.</a></h1><p>Intracellular Ca(2+) signaling is important for stem cell differentiation and there is evidence it may coordinate the process. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide hormone secreted mostly from the posterior pituitary gland and increases Ca(2+) signals mainly via V1 receptors. However, the role of AVP in  of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) is unknown. In this study, we identified the V1a receptor gene in hASCs and demonstrated that AVP stimulation increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration during . This effect was mediated via V1a receptors, Gq-proteins and the PLC-IP3 pathway. These Ca(2+) signals were due to endoplasmic reticulum release and influx from the extracellular space. Furthermore, AVP supplementation to the adipogenic medium decreased the number of adipocytes and adipocyte marker genes during differentiation. The effect of AVP on adipocyte formation was reversed by the V1a receptor blocker V2255. These findings suggested that AVP may function to inhibit adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolite in Panax ginseng (P. ginseng, Aralicaceae) berries depending on the ripen stages and evaluate its potential inhibition on adipocyte differentiation in 3 T3-L1 cells.Different ripening stage samples of P. ginseng berry were analyzed through global metabolite profiling by NMR spectroscopy. Lipid accumulation in the cells was analyzed by Oil Red O staining.The PLS-DA clearly distinguished P. ginseng berry extract (PGBE) according to the partial ripe (PR), ripe(R) and fully ripe (FR) stage. Lipid accumulation of PGBE was examined by measuring triglyceride content and Oil-Red O staining. These results suggested that the FR stage of PGBE decrease in lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation and the amount of threonine, asparagine, fumarate, tyraine, , and phenylalanine increased with longer ripening of ginseng berries.Metabolite profiling of P. ginseng was identified by 1H NMR spectra.

The mechanisms of high-energy-diet-induced metabolic disorders are complex and largely unknown. The non-receptor  kinase c-Abl plays an important role in  in vitro but its role in vivo in the regulation of metabolism is still elusive. Hence, we sought to address the role of c-Abl in diet-induced obesity and obesity-associated insulin resistance.The expression of c-Abl in different fat tissues from obese humans or mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were first analysed by western blotting and quantitative PCR. We employed conditional deletion of the c-Abl gene (also known as Abl1) in adipose tissue using Fabp4-Cre and 6-week-old mice were fed with either a chow diet (CD) or an HFD. Age-matched wild-type mice were treated with the c-Abl inhibitor nilotinib or with vehicle and exposed to either CD or HFD, followed by analysis of body mass, fat mass, glucose and insulin tolerance. Histological staining, ELISA and biochemical analysis were used to clarify details of changes in physiology and molecular signalling.c-Abl was highly expressed in subcutaneous fat from obese humans and HFD-induced obese mice. Conditional knockout of c-Abl in adipose tissue improved insulin sensitivity and mitigated HFD-induced body mass gain, hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. Consistently, treatment with nilotinib significantly reduced fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice. Further biochemical analyses suggested that c-Abl inhibition improved whole-body insulin sensitivity by reducing HFD-triggered insulin resistance and increasing adiponectin in subcutaneous fat.Our findings define a new biological role for c-Abl in the regulation of diet-induced obesity through improving insulin sensitivity of subcutaneous fat. This suggests it may become a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845630>N-stearoyltyrosine dipotassium ameliorates high-fat diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6 mice.</a></h1><p>N-stearoyltyrosine dipotassium (NST-2K) as a neuroprotective candidate is currently in preclinical studies in China. This study investigated the anti-obese effect of NST-2K in high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. The DIO mice were induced from male C57BL/6 mice by feeding high-fat diet for 11-weeks and treated orally with NST-2K for other 4 weeks. The treatments of DIO mice with NST-2K at 60 or 100 mg/kg/day suppressed the body weight gain, decreased both visceral fat weight and adipocyte size without influence on food intake. To evaluate the effect of NST-2K on lipid metabolism, lipid parameters and several key molecules in the plasma, liver, duodenum mucosa and adipose tissue were analyzed. NST-2K ameliorated the low-grade inflammation in liver, inhibited pancreatic lipase activity in duodenum mucosa, activated β-oxidation system and reduced , thus suppressed lipid accumulation in the liver, reduced adipocyte size and improved lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, without influence on food intake, NST-2K ameliorated high-fat diet-induced obesity via suppressing liver inflammation, inhibiting dietary fat absorption, promoting lipolysis and reducing .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A recent proteomic analysis has predicted that the nonreceptor  kinase Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (c-Abl) is a putative key regulator of , but the underlying mechanism remained obscure. We found that c-Abl was activated during the early phase of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Moreover, c-Abl activity was essential and its inhibition blocked differentiation to mature adipocytes. c-Abl directly controlled the expression and activity of the master adipogenic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma 2 (PPARγ2). PPARγ2 physically associated with c-Abl and underwent phosphorylation on two  residues within its regulatory activation function 1 (AF1) domain. We demonstrated that this process positively regulates PPARγ2 stability and . Remarkably, c-Abl binding to PPARγ2 required the Pro12 residue that has a phenotypically well-studied common human genetic proline 12 alanine substitution (Pro12Ala) polymorphism. Our findings establish a critical role for c-Abl in adipocyte differentiation and explain the behavior of the known Pro12Ala polymorphism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882999>miR-193b-Regulated Signaling Networks Serve as Tumor Suppressors in Liposarcoma and Promote  in Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.</a></h1><p>Well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WDLS/DDLS) account for approximately 13% of all soft tissue sarcoma in adults and cause substantial morbidity or mortality in the majority of patients. In this study, we evaluated the functions of miRNA (miR-193b) in liposarcoma  and  Deep RNA sequencing on 93 WDLS, 145 DDLS, and 12 normal fat samples demonstrated that miR-193b was significantly underexpressed in DDLS compared with normal fat. Reintroduction of miR-193b induced apoptosis in liposarcoma cells and promoted  in human adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). Integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of miR-193b-target networks identified novel direct targets, including CRK-like proto-oncogene (CRKL) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). miR-193b was found to regulate FAK-SRC-CRKL signaling through CRKL and FAK. miR-193b also stimulated reactive oxygen species signaling by targeting the antioxidant methionine sulfoxide reductase A to modulate liposarcoma cell survival and ASC differentiation state. Expression of miR-193b in liposarcoma cells was downregulated by promoter methylation, resulting at least in part from increased expression of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in WDLS/DDLS. , miR-193b mimetics and FAK inhibitor (PF-562271) each inhibited liposarcoma xenograft growth. In summary, miR-193b not only functions as a tumor suppressor in liposarcoma but also promotes  in ASC. Furthermore, this study reveals key  kinase and DNA methylation pathways in liposarcoma, some with immediate implications for therapeutic exploration. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29110748>Perinatal maternal high-fat diet induces early obesity and sex-specific alterations of the endocannabinoid system in white and brown adipose tissue of weanling rat offspring.</a></h1><p>Perinatal maternal high-fat (HF) diet programmes offspring obesity. Obesity is associated with overactivation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in adult subjects, but the role of the ECS in the developmental origins of obesity is mostly unknown. The ECS consists of endocannabinoids, cannabinoid receptors (cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) and cannabinoid type-2 receptor (CB2)) and metabolising enzymes. We hypothesised that perinatal maternal HF diet would alter the ECS in a sex-dependent manner in white and brown adipose tissue of rat offspring at weaning in parallel to obesity development. Female rats received standard diet (9 % energy content from fat) or HF diet (29 % energy content from fat) before mating, during pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, male and female offspring were killed for tissue harvest. Maternal HF diet induced early obesity, white adipocyte hypertrophy and increased lipid accumulation in brown adipose tissue associated with sex-specific changes of the ECS's components in weanling rats. In male pups, maternal HF diet decreased CB1 and CB2 protein in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In female pups, maternal HF diet increased visceral and decreased subcutaneous CB1. In brown adipose tissue, maternal HF diet increased CB1 regardless of pup sex. In addition, maternal HF diet differentially changed oestrogen receptor across the adipose depots in male and female pups. The ECS and oestrogen signalling play an important role in ,  and thermogenesis, and we observed early changes in their targets in adipose depots of the offspring. The present findings provide insights into the involvement of the ECS in the developmental origins of metabolic disease induced by inadequate maternal nutrition in early life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27802075>Kinase Inactive  Kinase (Tyk2) Supports Differentiation of Brown Fat Cells.</a></h1><p>It has been known for decades that brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a central role in maintaining body temperature in hibernating animals and human infants. Recently, it has become evident that there are also depots of brown fat in adult humans, and the mass of brown fat is inversely correlated with body weight. There are a variety of transcription factors implicated in the differentiation of classical Myf5+ brown preadipocytes, one of the most important of which is PRDM16. We have recently identified that in addition to PRDM16, the  kinase Tyk2 and the STAT3 transcription factor are required for the differentiation of Myf5 positive brown preadipocytes both in cell culture and in mice. Tyk2 is a member of the Jak family of  kinases, which are activated by exposure of cells to different cytokines and growth factors. In this study we report the surprising observation that a mutated form of Tyk2, which lacks  kinase activity (Tyk2KD) restores differentiation of brown preadipocytes in vitro as well as in Tyk2-/- mice. Furthermore, expression of the Tyk2KD transgene in brown fat reverses the obese phenotype of Tyk2-/- animals. Treatment of cells with Jak-selective inhibitors suggests that the mechanism by which Tyk2KD functions to restore BAT differentiation is by dimerizing with kinase active Jak1 or Jak2. These results indicate that there are redundant mechanisms by which members of the Jak family can contribute to differentiation of BAT.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542621>Cross-talk of SFRP4, integrin α1β1, and Notch1 inhibits cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells.</a></h1><p>Signaling pathways play an important role in cardiogenesis. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), a member of the Wnt family, contributes to  and tumorigenesis. However, how SFRP4 participates in cardiogenesis and the detailed molecular mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. The aim of this work was to determine cross-talk between SFRP4, integrin α1β1, and Notch1 during cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells. Using a well-established in vitro P19CL6 cell cardiomyocyte differentiation system, we found that SFRP4 inhibited P19CL6 cell cardiac differentiation via SFRP4 overexpression or knockdown. In addition, the SFRP4 overexpression augmented Notch1 and HES1 production. Further investigation demonstrated that SFRP4 bound to integrin α1β1 to activate the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway and that phosphorylated FAK Y397 (p-FAK Y397) aided Notch intracellular domain 1 (NICD1) nuclear translocation to form a p-FAK Y397-NICD1 complex that activated the Hes1 promoter. Taken together, the cross-talk between SFRP4, integrin α1β1, and Notch1 suppresses the cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of APS on insulin-sensitizing of adipocytes. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used as a model. The results showed that APS increased preadipocytes proliferation in a dose dependent manner, and 0.1 μg/mL APS sufficiently increased Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) content ( < 0.01). Moreover, APS enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation and mRNA expression of proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ,  < 0.01), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα,  < 0.01) and fatty acid binding protein (P2,  < 0.01). As expected, corresponding protein contents were elevated. Importantly, APS increased 2-(-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) uptake ( < 0.01). Meanwhile, both mRNA and protein content of glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) were elevated by APS ( < 0.01). The APS treatment enhanced  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1,  < 0.05) and phosphor-Akt content ( < 0.01). Besides, phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) content was increased in the APS treated cells ( < 0.01). Taken together, APS improved insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake, possibly through AMPK activation.

Inadequate BMSC differentiation is occasionally implicated in chronic bone metabolic disorders. However, specific signaling pathways directing BMSC differentiation have not been elucidated. Here, we explored the roles of spleen  kinase (Syk) in BMSC differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts. We found that Syk phosphorylation was increased in the early stage, whereas its protein expression was gradually decreased during the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of two mouse mesenchymal stromal cell lines, ST2 and 10T(1/2), and a human BMSC line, UE6E-7-16. Syk inactivation with either a pharmacological inhibitor or Syk-specific siRNA suppressed adipogenic differentiation, characterized by decreased lipid droplet appearance and the gene expression of fatty acid protein 4 (Fabp4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (Pparg2), CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α (C/EBPα), and C/EBPβ. In contrast, Syk inhibition promoted osteogenic differentiation, represented by increase in matrix mineralization and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, as well as the expression levels of osteocalcin, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5) mRNAs. We also found that Syk-induced signals are mediated by phospholipase C γ1 (PLCγ1) in osteogenesis and PLCγ2 in . Notably, Syk-activated PLCγ2 signaling was partly modulated through B-cell linker protein (BLNK) in adipogenic differentiation. On the other hand, growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2) was involved in Syk-PLCγ1 axis in osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, these results indicate that Syk-PLCγ signaling has a dual role in regulating the initial stage of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879345>[Investigating the effects of compound WS090152 on non-alcoholic fatty liver in mice].</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects and the mechanism of compound WS090152 on non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), the compound was administrated in C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet at 50 mg·kg(-1) by lavage. The lipid accumulation in liver was determined by the content of hepatic triglyceride (TG) and the histological pathological analysis. The levels of body weight gain, serum total cholesterol (TC) and TG were measured to evaluate lipid metabolism. Insulin sensitivity was determined by glucose infusion rate (GIR) value in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test. The expression of related proteins in liver was measured by Western blot. The effect on the target protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was assessed by the activity of recombinate human PTP1B in vitro, and by the expressions of PTP1B in vivo, respectively. The content of hepatic TG (P<0.05) and the pathological changes of the livers (P<0.01) were attenuated, insulin resistance was improved, (P<0.01), and the levels of serum TC (P<0.01) and serum TG (P<0.05) were reduced by WS090152 treatment in the mice. The recombinant h PTP1B activity was significantly inhibited with IC50 value of 0.34 μmol·L(-1); the expression of PTP1B was significantly downregulated, and the phosphorylation of its downstream insulin receptor (IR), and AKT was upregulated by WS090152 administration in the livers of NAFL mice. The expression of hepatic -related proteins-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was attenuated. These results suggest that compound WS090152 can ameliorate NAFL by increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing hepatic  probably through inhibition of PTP1B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28192880>Ameliorating effect of betanin, a natural chromoalkaloid by modulating hepatic carbohydrate metabolic enzyme activities and glycogen content in streptozotocin - nicotinamide induced experimental rats.</a></h1><p>Betanin, a chromoalkaloid of beetroot, has shown significant biological effects of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities. So, we attempted to determine whether betanin (a natural pigment) would be protective against hyperglycemia in streptozotocin (STZ) - nicotinamide (NA) induced diabetic rats. Rats were injected with STZ (40mg/kgb.w.) 15 mins after the administration of NA (110mg/kgb.w.) by intraperitonially (i.p.) 30days for the induction of experimental diabetes mellitus. After 72h diabetic rats were treated with betanin orally at a doses of 10, 20 and 40mg/kg b.w., respectively in a dose dependent manner and glibenclamide (600μg/kgb.w.). The promising character of betanin against diabetic rats was evaluated by performing the various biochemical parameters and histomorphological changes in liver and pancreas. Among the three doses, 20mg/kgb.w. of betanin was able to positively regulate plasma glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels by significantly increasing the activity of glycolytic enzyme (glucokinase and pyruvate kinase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and significantly decreasing the activity of gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) thereby increasing the glycogen content in the liver. We put forward that betanin could significantly restore the levels of carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes to near normal in diabetic rat. Immunohistochemical observation of pancreas revealed that betanin treated diabetic rats showed increased insulin immunoreactive β-cells, which confirmed the biochemical findings. Taken together, present study suggests that betanin modulates the carbohydrate metabolism and has beneficial effects in glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Based on their mechanism of action, FGFs can be categorized into intracrine, autocrine/paracrine and endocrine subgroups. Both autocrine/paracrine and endocrine FGFs are secreted from their cells of origin and exert their effects on target cells by binding to and activating specific single-pass transmembrane  kinase receptors (FGFRs). Moreover, FGF binding to FGFRs requires specific cofactors, namely heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans or Klothos for autocrine/paracrine and endocrine FGF signaling, respectively. FGFs are vital for embryonic development and mediate a broad spectrum of biological functions, ranging from cellular excitability to angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. Over the past decade certain FGFs (e.g. FGF1, FGF10, FGF15/FGF19 and FGF21) have been further recognized as regulators of energy homeostasis, metabolism and , constituting novel therapeutic targets for obesity and obesity-related cardiometabolic disease. Until recently, translational research has been mainly focused on FGF21, due to the pleiotropic, beneficial metabolic actions and the relatively benign safety profile of its engineered variants. However, increasing evidence regarding the role of additional FGFs in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis and recent developments regarding novel, engineered FGF variants have revitalized the research interest into the therapeutic potential of certain additional FGFs (e.g. FGF1 and FGF15/FGF19).

However, whether these changes are an early event in the development of NAFLD or are primarily associated with later stages of the disease, has not yet been clarified. Using a pair-feeding model, we determined the effects of a short-term intake of a fat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (FFC) on the development of early hepatic steatosis and markers of intestinal barrier function in mice treated with and without non-resorbable antibiotics (AB). For four days, C57BL/6J mice were either pair-fed a control diet or a FFC diet ± AB (92 mg/kg body weight (BW) polymyxin B and 216 mg/kg BW neomycin). Hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation, lipidperoxidation and intestinal barrier function were assessed. Lipid accumulation and early signs of inflammation found in the livers of FFC-fed mice were markedly attenuated in FFC + AB-fed animals. In FFC-fed mice the development of NAFLD was associated with a significant loss of tight junction proteins and an induction of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in the upper parts of the small intestine as well as significantly higher portal endotoxin levels and an induction of dependent signaling cascades in the liver. As expected, portal endotoxin levels and the expression of dependent signaling cascades in liver tissue were almost at the level of controls in FFC + AB-fed mice. However, FFC + AB-fed mice were also protected from the loss of zonula occludens-1 and partially of occludin protein in small intestine. Our data suggest that the development of early diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice at least in part results from alterations of intestinal barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26859361>Hexim1, a Novel Regulator of Leptin Function, Modulates Obesity and Glucose Disposal.</a></h1><p>Leptin triggers signaling events with significant transcriptional responses that are essential to metabolic processes affecting obesity and glucose disposal. We asked whether hexamethylene bis-acetamide inducible-1 (Hexim1), an inhibitor of RNA II polymerase-dependent transcription elongation, regulates leptin-Janus kinase 2 signaling axis in the hypothalamus. We subjected C57BL6 Hexim1 heterozygous (HT) mice to high-fat diet and when compared with wild type, HT mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced weight gain and remain insulin sensitive. HT mice exhibited increased leptin-pY(705)Stat3 signaling in the hypothalamus, with normal adipocyte size, increased type I oxidative muscle fiber density, and enhanced glucose transporter 4 expression. We also observed that normal Hexim1 protein level is required to facilitate the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) required for  and inducible suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS) expression. Further support on the role of Hexim1 regulating C/EBPs during adipocyte differentiation was shown when HT 3T3L1 fibroblasts failed to undergo . Hexim1 selectively modulates leptin-mediated signal transduction pathways in the hypothalamus, the expression of C/EBPs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR γ) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue during the adaptation to metabolic stress.

We aim to examine the central effect of n-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (ARA) on leptin sensitivity and leptin-regulated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that intracerebroventricular injection of ARA (25 nmol/day) for 2.5 days reversed the effect of central leptin on hypothalamic JAK2, pSTAT3, pAkt, and pFOXO1 protein levels, which was concomitant with a pro-inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. ARA also attenuated the effect of central leptin on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by reversing the mRNA expression of the genes involved in gluconeogenesis (G6Pase, PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2),  (FAS, SCD1), and cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase). These results indicate that an increased exposure to central n-6 PUFA induces central cellular leptin resistance with concomitant defective JAK2-STAT3 and PI3K-Akt signaling.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a classical non-transmembrane  phosphatase, is a pivotal regulator and promising drug target in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Recently it has received renewed attention in liver diseases and represents an intriguing opportunity as a drug target by modulating hepatocyte death and survival, hepatic  and so on. Here, the multiple roles of PTP1B in liver diseases will be presented, with respect to liver regeneration, drug-induced liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the herbal composition Gambigyeongsinhwan (4) (GGH(4)), composed of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), Alnus japonica (Thunb.) Steud. (Betulaceae), and the fermented traditional Korean medicine Massa Medicata Fermentata, regulates hepatic steatosis and inflammation.The effects of GGH(4) on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats and HepG2 cells were examined using Oil red O, hematoxylin and eosin, and toluidine blue staining, immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) transactivation assay.Administration of GGH(4) to OLETF rats improved hepatic steatosis and lowered serum levels of alanine transaminase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids. GGH(4) increased mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation enzymes (ACOX, HD, CPT-1, and MCAD) and decreased mRNA levels of  genes (FAS, ACC1, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c) in the liver of OLETF rats. In addition, infiltration of inflammatory cells and expression of inflammatory cytokines (CD68, TNFα, and MCP-1) in liver tissue were reduced by GGH(4). Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of oleic acid and palmitoleic acid induced significant lipid accumulation, but GGH(4) inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also increased PPARα reporter gene expression. These effects of GGH(4) were similar to those of the PPARα activator fenofibrate, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW6471 reversed the inhibitory effects of GGH(4) on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.These results suggest that GGH(4) inhibits obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and that this process may be mediated by regulation of the expression of PPARα target genes and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also suppressed obesity-related hepatic inflammation. Thus, GGH(4) may be a promising drug for the treatment of obesity-related liver diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study describes a simple method for creating distinct micropatterns via microphase separation resulting from polymer demixing of poly(desaminotyrosyl- carbonate) (PDTEC) and polystyrene (PS). Substrates with co-continuous (ribbons) or discontinuous (islands and pits) PDTEC regions were obtained by varying the ratio of PDTEC and sacrificial PS. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured on co-continuous PDTEC substrates for 3 days in bipotential adipogenic/osteogenic (AD/OS) induction medium showed no change in cell morphology but exhibited increased anisotropic cytoskeletal organization and larger focal adhesions when compared to MSCs cultured on discontinuous micropatterns. After 14 days in bipotential AD/OS induction medium, MSCs cultured on co-continuous micropatterns exhibited increased expression of osteogenic markers, whereas MSCs on discontinuous PDTEC substrates showed a low expression of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation markers. Substrates with graded micropatterns were able to reproduce the influence of local underlying topography on MSC differentiation, thus demonstrating their potential for high throughput analysis. This work presents polymer demixing as a simple, non-lithographic technique to produce a wide range of micropatterns on surfaces with complex geometries to influence cellular and tissue regenerative responses.A better understanding of how engineered microenvironments influence stem cell differentiation is integral to increasing the use of stem cells and materials in a wide range of tissue engineering applications. In this study, we show the range of topography obtained by polymer demixing is sufficient for investigating how surface topography affects stem cell morphology and differentiation. Our findings show that co-continuous topographies favor early (3-day) cytoskeletal anisotropy and focal adhesion maturation as well as long-term (14-day) expression of osteogenic differentiation markers. Taken together, this study presents a simple approach to pattern topographies that induce divergent responses in stem cell morphology and differentiation.Copyright © 2018.

Our study aims to explore the underlying mechanism of perinatal NIC exposure increases obesity susceptibility in adult female rat offspring. In our model, we found that adult NIC-exposed females presented higher body weight and subcutaneous and visceral fat mass, as well as larger adipocytes, while no change was found in food intake. Serum profile showed a higher serum glucose, insulin and leptin levels in NIC-exposed females. In adipose tissue and liver, the leptin signaling pathway was blocked at 26 weeks, presented lower Janus  kinase 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gene expression, higher suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 gene expression (in adipose tissue) and lower leptin receptors gene expression (in liver), indicating that peripheral leptin resistance occurred in NIC-exposed adult females. In female rats, the expression of lipolysis genes was affected dominantly in adipose tissue, but  genes was affected in liver. Furthermore, the glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed a delayed glucose clearance and a higher area under the curve in NIC-exposed females. Therefore, perinatal NIC exposure programed female rats for adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity in adult life, through the leptin resistance in peripheral tissue.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanism of Shp2 during  is not fully understood. The present study investigated the role of Shp2 in the terminal differentiation of preadipocytes. The results showed that Shp2 suppressed adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells; overexpression of Shp2 reduced lipid droplet production in 3T3-L1 cells, whereas Shp2 knockdown increased lipid droplet production in 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Shp2 activity also enhanced adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, Shp2 expression was specifically decreased early during differentiation in response to stimulation with the dexamethasone-methylisobutylxanthine-insulin (DMI) hormone cocktail. During the first 2 days of differentiation, Shp2 overexpression impaired the DMI-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in 3T3-L1 cells and blocked the peak expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins β and δ during preadipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, Shp2 downregulated the early stages of hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and inhibited the expression of the first wave of transcription factors by suppressing the DMI-induced STAT3 signaling pathway. These discoveries point to a novel role of Shp2 during  and support the hypothesis that Shp2 could be a therapeutic target for the control of obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669657> kinase receptor c-ros-oncogene 1 mediates TWIST-1 regulation of human mesenchymal stem cell lineage commitment.</a></h1><p>The TWIST-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor important in mediating skeletal and head mesodermal tissue development. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSC), express high levels of TWIST-1, which is down regulated during ex vivo expansion. Cultured BMSC over-expressing TWIST-1 display decreased capacity for osteogenic differentiation and an enhanced capacity to undergo , suggesting that TWIST-1 is a mediator of lineage commitment. However, little is known regarding the mechanism(s) by which TWIST-1 mediates cell fate determination. In this study, microarray analysis was used to identify a novel downstream TWIST-1 target,  kinase receptor c-ros-oncogene 1 (C-ROS-1), which was down regulated in TWIST-1 over-expressing BMSC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that TWIST-1 directly bound to two E-box binding sites on the proximal C-ROS-1 promoter. Knock-down of C-ROS-1 in human BMSC and cranial bone cells resulted in a decreased capacity for osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Conversely, suppression of C-ROS-1 in BMSC resulted in an enhanced capacity to undergo . Furthermore, reduced C-ROS-1 levels led to activation of different components of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signalling pathway during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Collectively, these data suggest that C-ROS-1 is involved in BMSC fate switching between osteogenesis and , mediated via PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signalling.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ISL exhibits anti-oxidant activity, and this activity has been shown to play a beneficial role in various health conditions. However, it is unclear whether the anti-oxidant activity of ISL affects insulin signaling pathway and lipid accumulation of adipocytes. We sought to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of ISL on insulin-stimulated  in 3T3-L1 cells. We investigated whether ISL attenuates insulin-induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation, and whether ISL inhibits the lipid accumulation and the expression of adipogenic-genes during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. ISL blocked the ROS generation, suppressed the lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte-specific proteins, which are increased in response to insulin stimulation during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. We also investigated whether the anti-oxidant capacity of ISL is involved in regulating the molecular events of insulin-signaling cascade in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ISL restores PTP1B activity by inhibiting PTP1B oxidation and IR/PI3K/AKT phosphorylation during the early stages of insulin-induced . Our findings show that the anti-oxidant capacity of ISL attenuated insulin IR/PI3K/AKT signaling through inhibition of PTP1B oxidation, and ultimately attenuated insulin-induced adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A genetic screen targeting regulators of mitochondrial dynamics revealed that mitochondrial fusion is required for the maintenance of male germline stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila melanogaster. Depletion of Mitofusin (dMfn) or Opa1 led to dysfunctional mitochondria, activation of Target of rapamycin (TOR) and a marked accumulation of lipid droplets. Enhancement of lipid utilization by the mitochondria attenuated TOR activation and rescued the loss of GSCs that was caused by inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, constitutive activation of the TOR-pathway target and  factor Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) also resulted in GSC loss, whereas inhibition of SREBP rescued GSC loss triggered by depletion of dMfn. Our findings highlight a critical role for mitochondrial fusion and lipid homeostasis in GSC maintenance, providing insight into the potential impact of mitochondrial and metabolic diseases on the function of stem and/or germ cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26833123>The Ephrin-A1/EPHA2 Signaling Axis Regulates Glutamine Metabolism in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of receptor  kinases (RTK) contributes to cellular transformation and cancer progression by disrupting key metabolic signaling pathways. The EPHA2 RTK is overexpressed in aggressive forms of breast cancer, including the HER2(+) subtype, and correlates with poor prognosis. However, the role of EPHA2 in tumor metabolism remains unexplored. In this study, we used in vivo and in vitro models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer to investigate the mechanisms by which EPHA2 ligand-independent signaling promotes tumorigenesis in the absence of its prototypic ligand, ephrin-A1. We demonstrate that ephrin-A1 loss leads to upregulated glutamine metabolism and lipid accumulation that enhanced tumor growth. Global metabolic profiling of ephrin-A1-null, HER2-overexpressing mammary tumors revealed a significant increase in glutaminolysis, a critical metabolic pathway that generates intermediates for . Pharmacologic inhibition of glutaminase activity reduced tumor growth in both ephrin-A1-depleted and EPHA2-overexpressing tumor allografts in vivo Mechanistically, we show that the enhanced proliferation and glutaminolysis in the absence of ephrin-A1 were attributed to increased RhoA-dependent glutaminase activity. EPHA2 depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of Rho, glutaminase, or fatty acid synthase abrogated the increased lipid content and proliferative effects of ephrin-A1 knockdown. Together, these findings highlight a novel, unsuspected connection between the EPHA2/ephrin-A1 signaling axis and tumor metabolism, and suggest potential new therapeutic targets in cancer subtypes exhibiting glutamine dependency.

In this study, we show that Prep1 hypomorphic heterozygous (Prep1) mice, expressing low levels of protein, featured a 23% and a 25% reduction of total body lipid content and epididymal fat, respectively. The percentage of the small adipocytes (25-75 μm) was 30% higher in Prep1 animals than in the WT, with a reciprocal difference in the large adipose cells (100-150 and >150 μm). Insulin-stimulated insulin receptor  and Akt serine phosphorylation markedly increased in Prep1 mice, paralleled by 3-fold higher glucose uptake and a significant increase of proadipogenic genes such as C/EBPα, GLUT4, and FABP4. Moreover, T cells infiltration and TNF-α, IFNγ and leptin expression were reduced in adipose tissue from Prep1 mice, while adiponectin levels were 2-fold higher. Furthermore, Prep1 mature adipocytes released lower amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher amount of adiponectin compared to WT cells. Incubation of murine liver cell line (NMuLi) with conditioned media (CM) from mature adipocytes of Prep1 mice improved glucose metabolism, while those from WT mice had no effect. Consistent with these data, Prep1 overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes impaired  and insulin signaling, and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion. All these findings suggest that Prep1 silencing reduces inflammatory response and increases insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue. In addition, CM from mature adipocytes of Prep1 mice improve metabolism in hepatic cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This is clearly evident from the composition of Ayurvedic preparation for diabetes 'Nisakathakadi Kashayam' where this is one of the main ingredients of this preparation AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aims in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the insulin sensitizing effects of Symplocos cochinchinensis ethanol extract (SCE) using a high fructose and saturated fat (HFS) fed insulin resistant rat model.Experimental groups consisted of normal diet (ND), ND+SCE 500mg/kg bwd, HFS+vehicle, HFS+metformin 100mg/kg bwd, HFS+SCE 250/500mg/kg bwd. Initially the animals were kept under HFS diet for 8 weeks, and at the end of 8 week period, animals were found to develop insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Post-administration of SCE, metformin or vehicle were carried out for 3 weeks. Gene and protein expressions relevant to insulin signalling pathway were analysed.HFS significantly altered the normal physiology of animals via proteins and genes relevant to metabolism like stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), protein  phosphatse 1B (PTP1B), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and glucokinase.

Its etiology is unknown but in analogy to central obesity, chronic low-level inflammation in adipose tissue has been suggested. There seems to be an increased propagation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes contributing to the massive enlargement of subcutaneous adipose tissue. We investigated whether  kinases might be involved. Proteins from adipose tissue harvested during microcannular tumescent liposuction in lipedema and in lipomas were subjected to 10% polyacrylamide-gel, transferred to a polyvinylidenfluorid membrane and immunoblotted with indicated P-Tyr-100 antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. A survey of all blots did not reveal -phosphorylated proteins with a molecular weight >100 kD in lipedema tissue and controls. These investigations suggest absence of activated growth factor receptors. Some signals indicating unspecific -phosphorylation of smaller proteins were detected in tissue of both lipedema patients and controls.

NAFLD begins with excessive lipid accumulation in the liver and progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely linked to dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Although recent studies have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates lipid metabolism, the roles of EGFR and EGFR inhibitors as modulators of lipid metabolism are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR  kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in liver tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo  and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance. In conclusion, these results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in NAFLD and is a potential therapeutic target.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026683>In Vivo and In Vitro Characterization of Basal Insulin Peglispro: A Novel Insulin Analog.</a></h1><p>The aim of this research was to characterize the in vivo and in vitro properties of basal insulin peglispro (BIL), a new basal insulin, wherein insulin lispro was derivatized through the covalent and site-specific attachment of a 20-kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG; specifically, methoxy-terminated) moiety to lysine B28. Addition of the PEG moiety increased the hydrodynamic size of the insulin lispro molecule. Studies show there is a prolonged duration of action and a reduction in clearance. Given the different physical properties of BIL, it was also important to assess the metabolic and mitogenic activity of the molecule. Streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic rats were used to study the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of BIL. Binding affinity and functional characterization of BIL were compared with those of several therapeutic insulins, insulin AspB10, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). BIL exhibited a markedly longer time to maximum concentration after subcutaneous injection, a greater area under the concentration-time curve, and a longer duration of action in the STZ-treated diabetic rat than insulin lispro. BIL exhibited reduced binding affinity and functional potency as compared with insulin lispro and demonstrated greater selectivity for the human insulin receptor (hIR) as compared with the human insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. Furthermore, BIL showed a more rapid rate of dephosphorylation following maximal hIR stimulation, and reduced mitogenic potential in an IGF-1 receptor-dominant cellular model. PEGylation of insulin lispro with a 20-kDa PEG moiety at lysine B28 alters the absorption, clearance, distribution, and activity profile receptor, but does not alter its selectivity and full agonist receptor properties.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750960>A novel role for PTK2B in cultured beige adipocyte differentiation.</a></h1><p>Adipocyte differentiation is a tightly regulated process which requires the sequential and organized expression of numerous genes and proteins. Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins and key transcription factors represents a critical regulatory mechanism of the process leading to adipocyte maturation and modulation of associated metabolic pathways. Despite the recognition of the importance of protein phosphorylation in adipocyte biology, relatively little is known about the role of specific kinases in thermogenic (brown or beige) adipocyte differentiation and function. In this study, we demonstrate that the non-receptor protein  kinase 2 beta (PTK2B) plays a critical role in murine beige adipocyte differentiation. We observed that PTK2B protein expression is associated with beige adipocyte differentiation in cultured, immortalized, inguinal stromal vascular fraction cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out of Ptk2b results in non-differentiating white adipocytes, and differentiated beige adipocytes with significantly reduced thermogenic gene and protein expression, enlarged lipid droplet size, and altered mitochondrial respiration. Together, our data in a cell culture system provides evidence for a role of PTK2B in the differentiation of murine beige adipocytes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, effects on bone are less clear for ErbB-targeting  kinase inhibitors or their combination use with cytotoxic drugs. This study examined the effects of individual or combination treatments with breast cancer drugs lapatinib (a dual ErbB1/ErbB2 inhibitor) and paclitaxel (a microtubule-stabilizing cytotoxic agent) on bone and bone marrow of rats. Wistar rats received lapatinib (240 mg/kg) daily, paclitaxel (12 mg/kg) weekly, or their combination for 4 weeks, and effects on bone/bone marrow were examined at the end of week 4. Microcomputed tomographical structural analyses showed a reduction in trabecular bone volume in tibia following the lapatinib, paclitaxel or their combination treatments ( P < 0.05). Histomorphometry analyses revealed marked increases in bone marrow adipocyte contents in all treatment groups. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction gene expression studies with bone samples and cell culture studies with isolated bone marrow stromal cells showed that the all treatment groups displayed significantly reduced levels of osterix expression and osteogenic differentiation potential but increased expression levels of  transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. In addition, these treatments suppressed the expression of Wnt10b and/or increased expression of Wnt antagonists (secreted frizzled-related protein 1, Dickkopf-related protein 1 and/or sclerostin). Furthermore, all treatment groups showed increased numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclasts on trabecular bone surfaces, although only the lapatinib group displayed increased levels of osteoclastogenic signal (receptor activator of nuclear factor κΒ ligand/osteoclastogenesis inhibitor osteoprotegrin expression ratio) in the bones. Thus, inhibiting ErbB1 and ErbB2 by lapatinib or blocking cell division by paclitaxel or their combination causes significant trabecular bone loss and bone marrow adiposity involving a switch in osteogenesis/ potential, altered expression of some major molecules of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, and increased recruitment of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28106077>Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in tight-skin mice identifies miR-151-5p as a therapeutic target for systemic sclerosis.</a></h1><p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease, may cause significant osteopenia due to activation of the IL4Rα/mTOR pathway. Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) can ameliorate immune disorders in SSc via inducing immune tolerance. However, it is unknown whether MSCT rescues osteopenia phenotype in SSc. Here we show that MSCT can effectively ameliorate osteopenia in SSc mice by rescuing impaired lineage differentiation of the recipient bone marrow MSCs. Mechanistically, we show that donor MSCs transfer miR-151-5p to the recipient bone marrow MSCs in SSc mice to inhibit IL4Rα expression, thus downregulating mTOR pathway activation to enhance osteogenic differentiation and reduce adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, systemic delivery of miR-151-5p is capable of rescuing osteopenia, impaired bone marrow MSCs, tight skin, and immune disorders in SSc mice, suggesting that miR-151-5p may be a specific target for SSc treatment.

Acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA) is a compound that was obtained from chemical modifications of tanshinone IIA (TIIA), a potent anticancer agent extracted from the dried roots of the Chinese herbal medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. A previous investigation indicated that ATA is more effective in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer especially cells with HER2 overexpression. However, the molecular mechanism(s) mediating this cytotoxic effect on HER2-positive breast cancer remained undefined. Studies described here report that ATA induced G1/S phase arrest and apoptosis in the HER2-positive MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-3, and BT-474 breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the ATA-induced apoptosis effect is associated with remarkably down-regulation of receptor  kinases (RTKs) EGFR/HER2 and inhibition of their downstream pro-survival signaling pathways. Interestingly, ATA was found to trigger oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses and to activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) leading to inactivation of key enzymes involved in lipid and protein biogenesis. Intraperitoneal administration of ATA significantly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-453 xenografts in athymic mice without causing weight loss and any other side effects. Additionally, transwell migration, invasion, and wound healing assays revealed that ATA could suppress tumor angiogenesis in vitro.

Although brown adipocytes have been highlighted as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type II diabetes in adult humans, the molecular mechanism underlying brown  is not fully understood. We recently found that protein  phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB) expression dramatically decreased during brown adipogenic differentiation. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of PTPRB and its regulatory mechanism during brown adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of PTPRB led to a reduced brown adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the  phosphorylation of VEGFR2, whereas a catalytic inactive PTPRB mutant showed no effects on differentiation and phosphorylation. Consistently, the expression of brown adipocyte-related genes, such as UCP-1, PGC-1α, PRDM16, PPAR-γ, and CIDEA, were significantly inhibited by PTPRB overexpression. Overall, these results suggest that PTPRB functions as a negative regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation through its phosphatase activity-dependent mechanism and may be used as a target protein for the regulation of obesity and type II diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748419>Singular effects of PPAR agonists on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease of diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>To assess the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists on glucose tolerance and hepatic lipid metabolism in diet-induced obese mice.Male C57BL/6 mice received a standard chow diet (SC, 10% energy as lipids) or high-fat diet (HF, 50% energy as lipids) for 10 weeks, after which treatment was initiated, forming the groups: SC group, HF group, HF-BZ group (HF + bezafibrate, pan-PPAR agonist), HF-WY group (HF + WY-14643, PPARalpha agonist) and HF-GW group (HF + GW1929, PPARgamma agonist). Treatments lasted for four weeks. Insulin resistance and liver remodeling were evaluated by biochemical and molecular approaches.The HF and HF-GW mice were overweight. Conversely, the HF-BZ and HF-WY mice presented with body masses equal to those of the SC mice. All treatments restored insulin sensitivity and blood lipid and adiponectin levels. Hepatic steatosis was prevented in the HF-WY and HF-BZ mice as shown by the elevated mRNA levels of PPARalpha and Carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1a in both groups, which favored enhanced beta-oxidation. Marked decreases in liver triacylglycerol levels confirmed these findings. In contrast, the HF-GW mice exhibited increased PPARgamma and fatty acid translocase/CD136 mRNA levels, contributing to enhanced hepatic .The WY14643 and bezafibrate treatments most effectively improved the adverse metabolic and hepatic effects caused by obesity and IR.

A progressive decrease in tibial trabecular bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was observed when wild-type (WT), Ddr2 , and Ddr2 mice were compared. These changes were associated with reduced trabecular number (Tb.N) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and increased trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) in both males and females, but reduced cortical thickness only in Ddr2 females. Bone changes were attributed to decreased bone formation rather than increased osteoclast activity. Significantly, marrow fat and adipocyte-specific mRNA expression were significantly elevated in Ddr2 animals. Additional skeletal defects include widened calvarial sutures and reduced vertebral trabecular bone. To examine the role of DDR2 signaling in cell differentiation, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were grown under osteogenic and adipogenic conditions. Ddr2 cells exhibited defective osteoblast differentiation and accelerated . Changes in differentiation were related to activity of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and PPARγ, transcription factors that are both controlled by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation. Specifically, the defective osteoblast differentiation in calvarial cells from Ddr2 mice was associated with reduced ERK/MAP kinase and RUNX2-S319 phosphorylation and could be rescued with a constitutively active phosphomimetic RUNX2 mutant. Also, DDR2 was shown to increase RUNX2-S319 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity while also increasing PPARγ-S112 phosphorylation, but reducing its activity. DDR2 is, therefore, important for maintenance of osteoblast activity and suppression of marrow  in vivo and these actions are related to changes in MAPK-dependent RUNX2 and PPARγ phosphorylation.© 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915506>Maternal diethylhexyl phthalate exposure affects adiposity and insulin tolerance in offspring in a PCNA-dependent manner.</a></h1><p>The ubiquitous plasticizer, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), is a known endocrine disruptor. However, DEHP exposure effects are not well understood. Changes in industrial and agricultural practices have resulted in increased prevalence of DEHP exposure and has coincided with the heightened occurrence of metabolic syndrome and obesity. DEHP and its metabolites are detected in the umbilical cord blood of newborns; however, the prenatal and perinatal effects of DEHP exposure have not been intensively studied. Previously, we discovered that phosphorylation (p) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at  114 (Y114) is required for  and diet-induced obesity in mice. Here, we show the unique ability of DEHP to induce p-Y114 in PCNA in vitro. We also show that while DEHP promotes  of wild type (WT) murine embryonic fibroblasts, mutation of Y114 to phenylalanine (Y114F) in PCNA blocked adipocyte differentiation. Given the induction of p-Y114 in PCNA by DEHP and the relationship to obesity, WT and Y114F PCNA mice were exposed to DEHP during gestation or lactation, followed by high fat diet feeding. Paradoxically, in utero exposure of Y114F PCNA females to DEHP led to a significant increase in body mass and was associated with augmented expression of PPARγ, a critical regulator of obesity, compared to WT controls. In utero exposure of WT mice to DEHP led to insulin sensitivity while Y114F mutation ablated this phenotype, indicating that PCNA is an important regulator of early DEHP exposure and ensuing metabolic phenotypes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Alterations in the normal fate of differentiating MSCs are involved in the development of obesity and osteoporosis. Here, we report that viable motheaten (me(v)) mice, which are deficient in the SH2-domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP1), develop osteoporosis spontaneously. Consistently, MSCs from me(v)/me(v) mice exhibit significantly reduced osteogenic potential and greatly increased adipogenic potential. When MSCs were transplanted into nude mice, SHP1-deficient MSCs resulted in diminished bone formation compared with wild-type MSCs. SHP1 was found to bind to GSK3β and suppress its kinase activity by dephosphorylating pY216, thus resulting in β-catenin stabilization. Mice, in which SHP1 was deleted in MSCs using SHP1(fl/fl)Dermo1-cre, displayed significantly decreased bone mass and increased adipose tissue. Taken together, these results suggest a possible role for SHP1 in controlling tissue homeostasis through modulation of MSC differentiation via Wnt signaling regulation.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

The molecular mechanisms that are accountable for the negative correlation between bone mass and bone marrow adiposity are incompletely understood. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has critical functions in proliferation and differentiation of many cell types; however, its roles in osteoblast lineage cells are largely unknown. We show herein that mice lacking FAK in Osterix-expressing cells exhibited decreased osteoblast number and low bone mass as well as increased bone marrow adiposity. The decreased bone mass in FAK-deficient mice was accounted for by decreased proliferation, compromised osteogenic differentiation, and increased adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow Osterix-expressing cells resulting from downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling due to the reduced expression of canonical Wnt ligands. In contrast, FAK loss in calvarial preosteoblasts had no adverse effect on their proliferation and osteogenic differentiation and these cells had intact Wnt/β-catenin signaling.© 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28752043>Adipocyte lipid synthesis coupled to neuronal control of thermogenic programming.</a></h1><p>The de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids (DNL) through fatty acid synthase (FASN) in adipocytes is exquisitely regulated by nutrients, hormones, fasting, and obesity in mice and humans. However, the functions of DNL in adipocyte biology and in the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis are not fully understood.Here we show adipocyte DNL controls crosstalk to localized sympathetic neurons that mediate expansion of beige/brite adipocytes within inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). Induced deletion of FASN in white and brown adipocytes of mature mice (iAdFASNKO mice) enhanced glucose tolerance, UCP1 expression, and cAMP signaling in iWAT. Consistent with induction of adipose sympathetic nerve activity, iAdFASNKO mice displayed markedly increased neuronal  hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) content in iWAT. In contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) of iAdFASNKO mice showed no increase in TH or NPY, nor did FASN deletion selectively in brown adipocytes (UCP1-FASNKO mice) cause these effects in iWAT.These results demonstrate that downregulation of fatty acid synthesis via FASN depletion in white adipocytes of mature mice can stimulate neuronal signaling to control thermogenic programming in iWAT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322467>Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1 Protects Against Hepatic Insulin Resistance and Hepatic Steatosis.</a></h1><p>Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional uptake receptor for chylomicron remnants in the liver. In vascular smooth muscle cells LRP1 controls reverse cholesterol transport through platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β) trafficking and  kinase activity. Here we show that LRP1 regulates hepatic energy homeostasis by integrating insulin signaling with lipid uptake and secretion. Somatic inactivation of LRP1 in the liver (hLRP1KO) predisposes to diet-induced insulin resistance with dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis. On a high-fat diet, hLRP1KO mice develop a severe Metabolic Syndrome secondary to hepatic insulin resistance, reduced expression of insulin receptors on the hepatocyte surface and decreased glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) translocation. While LRP1 is also required for efficient cell surface insulin receptor expression in the absence of exogenous lipids, this latent state of insulin resistance is unmasked by exposure to fatty acids. This further impairs insulin receptor trafficking and results in increased hepatic , impaired fatty acid oxidation and reduced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride secretion.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

In the current study, we aimed to determine and compare possible alterations in the activity of carbonic anhydrase I (CA I) and carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) isozymes by using estrogens and progestagens in female smokers and nonsmokers.Blood samples from 30 smoker and 30 nonsmoker volunteers were drawn after obtaining informed consent. The blood samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma and erythrocytes. Thereafter, hemolysate was prepared from the red cells. CA I and CA II were purified from human erythrocytes with a simple one-step procedure using Sepharose 4B--sulfonamide affinity column. CAI and CA II isozymes were treated with estrogen and progesterone-containing drugs, after which the inhibition or activation of the enzyme was determined.CA I and CA II enzyme activity was observed to be increased in female smokers. The results of this study show that dienogest is the most effective inhibitor for human erythrocytes CA I when compared with micronized progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol hemihydrate in both female smokers and nonsmokers. All active ingredients have been shown to have a stronger inhibition in smokers than nonsmokers for CA I activity. Additionally, estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate have stronger inhibition against CA II enzyme activity in women who smoke.The results of the current study provide important information to clinicians about how to consider the possible adverse effects of these drugs which are produced as a result of inhibition of CA I and CA II enzyme. Clinicians should take into consideration the side effects caused by CA I and CA II enzyme inhibition when prescribing these drugs in the treatment of different clinical conditions, especially in women who smoke.Copyright © 2015.

Several lines of evidence have also suggested that Tks4 has a role in adipocyte biology; however, its roles in the various types of adipocytes at the cellular level and in transcriptional regulation have not been studied. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tks4 functions as an organizing molecule in signaling networks that regulate adipocyte homeostasis. Our aims were to study the white and brown adipose depots of Tks4 knockout (KO) mice using immunohistology and western blotting and to analyze gene expression changes regulated by the white, brown, and beige adipocyte-related transcription factors via a PCR array. Based on morphological differences in the Tks4-KO adipocytes and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of Tks4-KO mice, we concluded that the beigeing process was more robust in the WAT of Tks4-KO mice compared to the wild-type animals. Furthermore, in the Tks4-KO WAT, the expression profile of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-regulated -related genes was shifted in favor of the appearance of beige-like cells. These results suggest that Tks4 and its downstream signaling partners are novel regulators of adipocyte functions and PPARγ-directed white to beige adipose tissue conversion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122708>Mechanisms of activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 by redox stressors, nutrient cues, and energy status and the pathways through which it attenuates degenerative disease.</a></h1><p>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the basal and stress-inducible expression of a battery of genes encoding key components of the glutathione-based and thioredoxin-based antioxidant systems, as well as aldo-keto reductase, glutathione S-transferase, andquinone oxidoreductase-1 drug-metabolizing isoenzymes along with multidrug-resistance-associated efflux pumps. It therefore plays a pivotal role in both intrinsic resistance and cellular adaptation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and xenobiotics. Activation of Nrf2 can, however, serve as a double-edged sword because some of the genes it induces may contribute to chemical carcinogenesis by promoting futile redox cycling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites or confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by increasing the expression of efflux pumps, suggesting its cytoprotective effects will vary in a context-specific fashion. In addition to cytoprotection, Nrf2 also controls genes involved in intermediary metabolism, positively regulating those involved in NADPH generation, purine biosynthesis, and the β-oxidation of fatty acids, while suppressing those involved in  and gluconeogenesis. Nrf2 is subject to regulation at multiple levels. Its ability to orchestrate adaptation to oxidants and electrophiles is due principally to stress-stimulated modification of thiols within one of its repressors, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is present in the cullin-3 RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex CRLKeap1. Thus modification of Cys residues in Keap1 blocks CRLKeap1 activity, allowing newly translated Nrf2 to accumulate rapidly and induce its target genes. The ability of Keap1 to repress Nrf2 can be attenuated by p62/sequestosome-1 in a mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent manner, thereby allowing refeeding after fasting to increase Nrf2-target gene expression. In parallel with repression by Keap1, Nrf2 is also repressed by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), present in the Skp1-cullin-1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex SCFβ-TrCP. The ability of SCFβ-TrCP to suppress Nrf2 activity is itself enhanced by prior phosphorylation of the transcription factor by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through formation of a DSGIS-containing phosphodegron. However, formation of the phosphodegron in Nrf2 by GSK-3 is inhibited by stimuli that activate protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. In particular, PKB/Akt activity can be increased by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mTORC2, thereby providing an explanation of why antioxidant-responsive element-driven genes are induced by growth factors and nutrients. Thus Nrf2 activity is tightly controlled via CRLKeap1 and SCFβ-TrCP by oxidative stress and energy-based signals, allowing it to mediate adaptive responses that restore redox homeostasis and modulate intermediary metabolism. Based on the fact that Nrf2 influences multiple biochemical pathways in both positive and negative ways, it is likely its dose-response curve, in terms of susceptibility to certain degenerative disease, is U-shaped. Specifically, too little Nrf2 activity will lead to loss of cytoprotection, diminished antioxidant capacity, and lowered β-oxidation of fatty acids, while conversely also exhibiting heightened sensitivity to ROS-based signaling that involves receptor  kinases and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1. By contrast, too much Nrf2 activity disturbs the homeostatic balance in favor of reduction, and so may have deleterious consequences including overproduction of reduced glutathione and NADPH, the blunting of ROS-based signal transduction, epithelial cell hyperplasia, and failure of certain cell types to differentiate correctly. We discuss the basis of a putative U-shaped Nrf2 dose-response curve in terms of potentially competing processes relevant to different stages of tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2015.
