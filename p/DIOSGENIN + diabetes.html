In this study, the protective effect of  was checked on the aorta from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats received  (40 mg·kg·d) for 7 weeks starting 1 week after intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Aortic reactivity of endothelium-intact and -denuded rings to potassium chloride, phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and isosorbide dinitrate were measured and some involved mechanisms were explored. The results showed that  has a hypoglycemic effect and attenuates maximum contractile response of endothelium-intact and -denuded rings to PE. In addition, endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was greater in -treated diabetics with no significant change for endothelium-independent relaxation to isosorbide dinitrate and addition of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, as a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor eliminated this beneficial effect. Furthermore,  significantly attenuated aortic DNA fragmentation as an index of apoptosis and malondialdehyde content, lowered the aortic expression of angiotensin converting enzyme and transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and raised expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase with no significant effect on the activity of superoxide dismutase.

Polygonatum kingianum has been used in the treatment of  and related diseases in China for centuries. Total saponins (TSPK) and total polysaccharides (PSPK) were reported to be major types of active constituents of P. kingianum. This research aims at investigation of their therapeutical mechanisms on  based on the regulation of gut microbiota.Type 2  (T2D) rats were induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin-injection from male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The blood biochemical indicators were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota and the contents of the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were discussed.T2D rats were treated with TSPK (0.025 and 0.1g/kg) and PSPK (0.1g/kg) for 56 days. Major biochemical indexes, such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota were discussed based on the sequencing results on V4 region of 16S rDNA. Moreover, the contents of the SCFAs in faeces, which were fermentation products produced from gut microbiota were determined by gas chromatography (GC).Oral administration of TSPK and PSPK prevented the increase of FBG. TSPK (0.025g/kg) enhancing the content of FINS at the end of research. Furthermore, TSPK and PSPK improved the intestinal microecology by decreasing the abundances of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and increasing that of Firmicutes. However, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H displayed discrepant regulation roles on Firmicutes. TSPK.L and PSPK significantly increased the abundance of Ruminococcaceae family and Ruminococcus genus in Firmicutes phylum, however, TSPK.H increased the abundances of Veillonellaceae family and Anaerovibrio genus. 57 Key variables, altered after treated by TSPK and PSPK, correlated to the alternations of FBG, FINS, LPS and body weight were identified. In addition, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H showed different adjustment on the contents of SCFAs.These results suggested that, compared to the normal rats, the structure of gut microbiota was significantly changed in diabetic rats. Oral administration with TSPK and PSPK could prevent T2D by its regulation role on the gut microbiota.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

(DSG) possesses a variety of biological activities. The present study was designed to examine the effect of DSG on GD and to investigate the possible mechanism in C57BL/KsJ-Lep (db/+) mice. We found that DSG could remarkably ameliorated GD in pregnant db/+ mice, as reflected by the improvement of glucose and insulin intolerance, and the decrease of fasting blood glucose and insulin level and the increase of hepatic glycogen content. The results showed that DSG could inhibit oxidative stress in pregnant db/+ mice, as evidenced by decrease of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, increase of glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. DSG could also attenuate the abnormal changes of lipid profiles, including TC, TG and LDL, in pregnant db/+ mice. The increase of the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1) and its target genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), was inhibited by DSG in pregnant db/+ mice. Moreover, overexpression of SREBP-1 by LV-SREBP-1 injection could markedly inhibit the protective effect of DSG against disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in GD mice. The data demonstrated that SREBP-1 may be of major target of DSG that mediated its anti-diabetic activities in GD. The data provide novel insights into the biological activities of DSG and pave way for the investigation of the anti-diabetic activities against GD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Treatments with DSG, 5-MOP, and their combination were performed, respectively. The result showed that the incubation of HepG2 cells with high concentration insulin markedly decreased glucose consumption and glycogen synthesis. However, treatment with DSG, 5-MOP, or their combination significantly reversed the condition and increased the phosphorylated expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα), sarcoma (Src), Akt/protein kinase B, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 (PI3Kp85). At the transcriptional level, expression of the genes mentioned above also increased except for the negative regulation of GSK-3β mRNA. The increased expression of glucose transport-4 (GLUT-4) was meanwhile observed through immunofluorescence. Nevertheless, the synergistic effect of DSG and 5-MOP on improving glycometabolism was not obvious in the present study.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of DT intake on inflammatory cytokines, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and metabolic biomarkers in T2DM.The study included 50 patients with T2DM. The patients had received 3 cups (600ml) of DT extract or placebo (PL) extract per day during a period of 12 weeks. Intracellular cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) as well as the glycemic and lipid profiles were measured at baseline and after the treatment period. The active constituents of the medicinal plants included in DT were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).Ingestion of DT suppressed CD4+ T cell expression of IL-1β and Il-8 (p<0.05) and up-regulated the expression of IL-10 and the Treg/IL-17 ratio (p<0.05) which was not shown in PL. A significant decrease in HbA1c and LDL was observed at the end of the study period (p<0.05) in DT. The GC/MS analyses of DT indicated the presence of lupeol, β-Amyrin and β-sitosterol. Also analyses of individual herbs showed the presence of higher levels of lupeol and β-Amyrin in Nuga Ficus bengalensis and β-sitosterol in the Attikka Ficus racemosa, indicating that the active ingredients of DT are concentrated in these two herbs.The present study provides evidence that DT has hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic properties. Interestingly, DT has anti-inflammatory effects. These properties are attributed to the flavonoids, triterpenes and phytosterol contents of the tea.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dioscin on apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells induced by high glucose.Pancreatic cell line RNAKT-15 was treated with 20 mM glucose with or without different concentrations of dioscin and viability and apoptosis of cells were measured. Western blot assay was used to measure the expression levels of some proteins such as phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin. Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the pro-inflammatory cytokines.High-glucose could significantly increase cell RNAKT-15 apoptosis and reduce cell viability (p < 0.01). Dioscin could improve the cell degeneration (p < 0.05). The results demonstrated that high-glucose could increase the proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (INF-γ), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), while these effects were reduced when treated with dioscin (p < 0.05). Western blot results demonstrated that high-glucose affects p-GSK 3β and β-catenin expression levels (p < 0.01) and dioscin could significantly reduce these two protein levels (p < 0.05).The effects of dioscin against high-glucose induced apoptosis of pancreatic cells may occur through the Wnt signaling pathway. High-glucose led to increased pancreatic cell apoptosis and dioscin could attenuate these impairments. These findings highlight an important role of dioscin in the treatment potential of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26400229>[Effectiveness of phytotherapy in supportive treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus II. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum)].</a></h2><p>Fenugreek seeds are known for their characteristic smell of soup seasoning and as an ingredient of Indian curry. Traditionally the seeds are used as macerate for the treatment of diabetes, cough, and flatulence, to increase breast milk secretion, and for anti-inflammatory and aphrodisiac effects. The use is limited by its unpleasant smell and bitter taste which can be modified by adding mint leaves to the macerate. Antidiabetic properties are attributed mainly to galactomannan, 4-hydroxyisoleucin (4-OH-Ile),  and trigonelline. These substances demonstrate direct antidiabetic properties in clinical studies by increasing insulin secretion (4-OH-Ile), decreasing insulin resistance and glucose resorption from the GIT (galactomannan) and improvement in B-cells regeneration (trigonelline). Besides this main effect, the herb improves blood lipid spectre (4-OH-Ile, ), and has reno-protective (4-OH-Ile, trigonelline), neuroprotective (trigonelline) and antioxidant (, trigonelline) effects. Antidiabetic efficacy of trigonelline is comparable to glibenclamide treatment and more effective than sitagliptine therapy. Given the large body of evidence and promising results in comparison with standard pharmacotherapy, fenugreek active substances have a potential to become a source of new antidiabetic medication.Key words: fenugreek Trigonella foenum-graecum diabetes mellitus type 2 biological activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814084>Dioscin Attenuates Myocardial Damages in Diabetic Rats maybe by Regulating NO-sGC-cGMP-PKG Pathway.</a></h2><p>The objective of this research was to explore the effect of dioscin on myocardium in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the underlying mechanisms.Diabetic rat model was established by a single intravenous injection of streptozocin (STZ). The rats were divided into 5 groups: control group, control+dioscin group, model group (), DDL group (diabetic rats treated with 100 μg/kg/day dioscin) and DDH group (diabetic rats treated with 200 μg/kg/day dioscin). Each group was continuously intervened for 6 weeks. Hemodynamic parameters were detected and pathological alterations of myocardium were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Inflammatory response and related proteins in the NO-sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway were detected by western blot.Dioscin treatment can increase ejection fraction (EF) and decrease left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) as well as time constant of left ventricular pressure decay (Tau) parameters in diabetic rats, suggesting the improvement of left ventricular function. By histopathology observation, we found that dioscin treatment can also improve myocardial histological lesions caused by . In addition, the levels of inflammatory cytokines TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-1β of the model group were remarkably higher than those in the control group (<0.01), while after being treated with dioscin these cytokines were obviously decreased (<0.05). The levels of PDE-5, PKG and p-VASP in the diabetic rats were significantly declined after being treated by dioscin in a dose-dependent manner (<0.05).Dioscin may prevent the myocardial injury in diabetic rats by up-regulating NO-sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway.© 2019 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993510>Modulatory effects of  on attenuating the key enzymes activities of carbohydrate metabolism and glycogen content in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Fenugreek and its active compound  are ancient herbal medicines recommended by the World Health Organization. In this study, the effect of  on changes in carbohydrate metabolic enzymes and glycogen content in muscle and kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetes rats were evaluated.Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin. The  at different doses (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally to normal and streptozotocin-diabetic rats for 45 days.Streptozotocin intoxication led to a significant increase (p<0.05) in blood glucose and a decrease in insulin levels. The carbohydrate metabolic enzymes and glycogen content were also altered. The daily oral administration of  at different doses (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg body weight) to diabetic rats for 45 days resulted a significant (p<0.05) decline in blood glucose level and a significant increase in plasma insulin level. The altered activities of carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes in muscle and kidneys of diabetic rats were significantly (p<0.05) reverted to near normal level by the administration of . The obtained results were compared with glibenclamide, a standard oral hypoglycemia drug.The modulatory effects of  on attenuating the activities of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes afford a promise for persistent use for the treatment of diabetes in the future, even though clinical studies to evaluate this possibility may be warranted.Copyright © 2014 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Morroniside (Mor) of  and  (Dio) of  formed an innovative formula named M + D. The aims of the present study were to investigate myocardial protective effect of M + D on diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) through the inhibition of expression levels of caspase-3 protein, and identify the advantage of M + D compared with Mor, Dio, and the positive drug metformin (Met). We detected cell viability, cell apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 protein in rat cardiomyocytes. In result, Mor, Dio, and M + D increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and decreased ROS levels. Additionally, the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 protein was modulated and the expression levels of caspase-3 protein were markedly decreased. Among the treatment groups, M + D produced the most prominent effects. In conclusion, our data showed for the first time that Mor, Dio, and M + D prevented high glucose (HG)-induced myocardial injury by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes. Among all the groups, M + D produced the strongest effect, while Mor and Dio produced weaker effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231447>Traditional management of  in Pakistan: Ethnobotanical investigation from Traditional Health Practitioners.</a></h2><p>The uses of anti-diabetic plants are well anchored in the traditional health care system of Pakistan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ethno-botanical study about the uses of plants for the treatment of . The aim of the study is to record indigenous knowledge on anti-diabetic plants from Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) and diabetic patients. In addition, it is aimed to ascertain and validate the traditional uses of anti-diabetic plants by citing pharmacological activities and phytochemical constitutes from previously published literature.The ethno-medicinal data was documented during 14 field surveys, each comprising of 10 days, from 3 regions of Pakistan (Islamabad, Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa and Deserts of Sindh). In total, 113 THPs and 44 diabetic patients were interviewed using open-ended and semi-structured questionnaires. Quantitative indices, including Relative Frequency of Citation percentage (RFC %) and Disease Consensus Index (DCI) were calculated. The documented data is authenticated by comparing with 28 published articles on ethno-botanical aspects and many pharmacological studies.In total, 120 plant species belonging to 50 families were reported. The ethno-botanical results indicated that Moraceae (11 species); herb (56 reports) is dominant life form; the leaves (56 reports) are the most used plant part and decoction (24%) is the preferred mode of preparation. The quantitative analysis shows that RFC% ranges from 14 to 42 and DCI varies from 0.15 to 0.74. By comparing to previous studies, 64 species are reported new in traditional treatment of DM; 40 species are new to pharmacological evidence and 3 species are new to phytochemical studies.This study recoded the significant indigenous knowledge about anti-diabetic plants among the THPs and diabetic patients in Pakistan. This type of ethno-botanical knowledge on traditional use of anti-diabetic plants is an important step in designing detailed pharmacological and clinical trials for  Miletus treatment. It is recommended that further pharmacological and phytochemical analysis should be conducted on those species which lack previous references in literature and have highest Frequency of Citation (FC), Disease Consensus Index (DCI) and Relative Frequency of Citation percentage (RFC%).Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, dietary fenugreek seed flour and  were evaluated on a model of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by abdominal aortas isolated from rats receiving high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFHSD). 60 male Wistar rats were randomized into six groups: (i) negative control getting conventional rat feed regimen; (ii) positive control receiving HFHSD; (iii) a test group fed 2 g/kg bw/day fenugreek seed flour (containing 10 mg/kg bw/day ) + HFHSD; (iv) three test groups fed 1, 10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day  + HFHSD. Alimentary treatments were carried out for six weeks. The abdominal aortas were isolated, and 2 mm wide rings were sectioned off and mounted at a resting tension of 10 mN in organ baths containing Krebs solution (36 °C) exposed to 95% O₂ and 5% CO₂. After 60-min incubation, a norepinephrine concentration-response (E/c) curve was generated to determine their half-maximal effective concentration (EC) value. After 60-min wash-out, a pre-contraction with norepinephrine EC was made, followed by an acetylcholine E/c curve. Plasma glutathione levels, glutathione-handling enzyme activities and blood antioxidant capacities were also determined. HFHSD significantly decreased the dilatory response to acetylcholine and increased plasma glutathione levels and these effects were significantly reversed by fenugreek seed flour, 10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day . Both fenugreek and  treatments prevent HFHSD-induced endothelial dysfunction and redox changes. As fenugreek treatment was more effective at lower acetylcholine concentrations than  treatments, components of fenugreek other than  may contribute to the beneficial effects of dietary fenugreek seed flour.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743227>Antidiabetic effect of total saponins from Polygonatum kingianum in streptozotocin-induced daibetic rats.</a></h2><p>Polygonatum kingianum has been used in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and related metabolic syndrome in Asian counties for centuries. In this study, the blood glucose regulation activity and mechanism of total saponins from P. kingianum (TSPK) were investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats in this research.TSPK (0.025g/kg and 0.1mg/kg) was administrated by gavage to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 8 weeks. Changes of body weight, food intakes, blood glucose, serum insulin and lipid indexes were observed. Genome-wide expression profiling was applied to explore the gene expression alternation after treated with TSPK. Expressions of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the relative transcript level of glucose kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (GK/G6P) in the liver were investigated. Meanwhile, contents of AMPK, and glucose transporter subtype-4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle, and peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) in adipose tissue were investigated.TSPK could effectively alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic rats. Genome-wide expression profiling showed that TSPK up-regulated the expression of GLUT4 while down-regulated the expression of G6P in insulin signal pathway. In the liver, the expression of AMPK and GK are increased. Further more, TSPK promoted the expressions of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, respectively.These results provide possible mechanisms for the antidiabetic effects of TSPK. TSPK could promote not only glycogenesis but also glucose utilization in peripheral tissue. Our results suggested that TSPK may be used as adjuvant therapy to control blood glucose and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic individuals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Till date, no clinically simulated animal model and therapy for NSAID-induced gastroenteropathic damage (NSAID-iGD) in T2DM patients. T2DM was developed using high-fat diet plus multiple low doses of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg, IP). Rats treated with ethanolic extract of Insulin plant (EIP; 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, PO; b.i.d.)/Quercetin (QCT; 50 mg/kg)/vehicle for total 10 days. Diclofenac sodium (DCF; 7.5 mg/kg, PO, b.i.d.) administered for final five days of EIP/vehicle administration. Rats fasted after last dose on the 9th day; water was provided ad libitum. 12 h after the last dose on 10th day, GI tracts assessed for haemorrhagic damage, XO activity, LPO, intestinal permeability, luminal pH alterations along with haematological, biochemical and histological parameters. The evidence suggested that DCF administration caused significant gastroenteropathic damage. In presence of T2DM, NSAID-iGD significantly exacerbated. Whereas, QCT/EIP treatment significantly attenuated T2DM dependent exacerbation of NSAID-iGD, and also efficiently managed T2DM in a dose-dependent manner. Low amount of QCT in EIP(190.96 ± 7.5 ng/mg) than its effective dose(50 mg/kg) indicates that EIP's other phytoconstituents (e.g. Kaempferol, Ascorbic acid, Lupeol, , β-sitosterol, Stigmasterol, β-amyrin, etc.) giving synergistic actions.
