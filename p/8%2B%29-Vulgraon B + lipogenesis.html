However, little is known about its direct impact on the liver.To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate acid for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its  target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate acid-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κ signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κ pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813326>The Antagonist Effect of Arachidonic Acid on  Gene Expression by Nuclear Receptor Type II Regulation.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a complex disease that has a strong association with diet and lifestyle. Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty acid (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and arachidonic acid (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and . Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947166>Maternal obesity stimulates lipotoxicity and up-regulates inflammatory signaling pathways in the full-term swine placenta.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the effects of back-fat thickness (BF), at mating of sows, on placental lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. We performed iTRAQ labeling-based proteomic analysis on term placentas obtained by vaginal delivery from BFI (15-20 mm, control) and BFII (21-27 mm, obese) sows formed according to BF at mating. Proteomic analysis revealed 413 proteins to be significantly different in placenta from BFII sows by ≥1.2-fold. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified proteins related to lipid metabolism and inflammatory response to be altered in placenta from obese sows. Indicative of a lipotoxic placental environment, increased placental lipid, and up-regulated mRNA expression of lipogenic genes, including ADRP (p = .06), PPARD, FASN, ACACA, DGAT1, and LIPIN3, were associated with decreased AMPK and increased activation of WNT signaling in placenta from BFII group (p < .05). Furthermore, we observed a 18% decrease in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), increased mRNA content of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α, and increased activation of inflammatory NF-κ and JNK signaling in placenta from BFII sows that was significantly associated with macrophage accumulation (p < .05). These findings suggest that maternal obesity aggravates a lipotoxic environment in pig term placenta that may be associated with placental dysfunction and impaired fetal growth.© 2018 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700810>Depletion of  cell-activating factor attenuates hepatic fat accumulation in a murine model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Obesity-induced adipose-tissue dysfunction is a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  cell-activating factor (BAFF) is an adipokine related to impaired insulin sensitivity, and the serum BAFF concentration is associated with NAFLD severity. In this study, we aimed to determine the direct in vivo role of BAFF in the development of insulin resistance, adipocyte dysfunction, and hepatic steatosis using BAFF mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). HFD-fed BAFF mice exhibited significantly improved insulin sensitivity despite their increased weight gain and adiposity relative to HFD-fed wild-type mice. Moreover, inflammation, especially the accumulation of CD11c adipose-tissue macrophages, and fibrosis of epididymal adipose tissue were reduced, contributing to healthy adipose-tissue expansion in obese BAFF mice. In line with metabolically healthy obesity, hepatic steatosis also decreased, and we observed attenuated de novo  in both the livers and hepatocytes of BAFF mice. Our data revealed that BAFF serves as a potential stimulator of unhealthy adipose-tissue expansion by triggering inflammation and fibrosis and ultimately leading to enhanced insulin resistance and NAFLD. Therefore, these results suggest that BAFF is a promising target for diabetes and NAFLD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967664>Polyphenol Stilbenes from Fenugreek ( L.)

In our previous study, three polyphenol stilbenes were separated from fenugreek seeds. Here, we investigated the effect of polyphenol stilbenes on  and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Oil Red O staining and triglyceride assays showed that polyphenol stilbenes differently reduced lipid accumulation by suppressing the expression of adipocyte-specific proteins.

In present studies, it was found that polyphenol stilbenes had the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and mitochondrial membrane potentials suggested that mitochondria play a critical role in insulin resistance and related signaling activation, such as AKT and AMPK.

It has been reported that icariin is beneficial for estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis, and alcohol-induced osteoporosis; whether icariin has protective effects on diabetes-induced osteoporosis has not been reported. In this study, a rat model of diabetic osteoporosis was established by streptozotocin injection, the bone protective effects and potential mechanism of icariin on diabetes-induced bone loss was observed. Thirty 8-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control group (vehicle treatment), T1DM (diabetic) group and T1DM-icariin (ICA) group (diabetic rats treated with icariin), 10 rats in each group. The bone histomorphometry parameters, bone mineral density (BMD), serum bone turnover markers, and bone marrow  were analyzed after 8 weeks of icariin administration. The results showed consumption of icariin at a doses of 100 mg kg decreased blood glucose, and increased the BMD of diabetic rats. Icariin effectively decreased serum bone turnover marker levels, including CTX-1, ALP, TRACP 5b, osteocalcin, and PINP. Meanwhile, the bone histomorphometry parameters, the number of osteoclasts per bone perimeter were turned to be normal level, and the icariin treatment suppressed bone marrow . The runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX 2), as well as the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ  ligand (RANKL) ratio in serum and bone tissues were increased significantly after icariin treatment in diabetic rats. All of the above indicate that oral administration of icariin can prevent diabetic osteoporosis; the effect is mainly related to its ability to reduce blood glucose, inhibit bone turnover and bone marrow , as well as up-regulate bone RUNX 2, and OPG expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29954133>CFTR Deletion Confers Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Disrupts Lipid Homeostasis in Intestinal Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease in which the intestine exhibits oxidative and inflammatory markers. As mitochondria are the central source and the main target of reactive oxygen species, we hypothesized that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) defect leads to the disruption of cellular lipid homeostasis, which contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction.Mitochondrial functions and lipid metabolism were investigated in Caco-2/15 cells with CFTR knockout (CFTR) engineered by the zinc finger nuclease technique. Experiments were performed under basal conditions and after the addition of the pro-oxidant iron-ascorbate (Fe/Asc) complex.Mitochondria of intestinal cells with CFTR, spontaneously showed an altered redox homeostasis characterised by a significant decrease in the expression of PPAR&alpha; and nuclear factor like 2. Consistent with these observations, 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase, responsible for repair of ROS-induced DNA lesion, was weakly expressed in CFTR cells. Moreover, disturbed fatty acid &beta;-oxidation process was evidenced by the reduced expression of CPT1 and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long-chain in CFTR cells. The decline of mitochondrial cytochrome c and -cell lymphoma 2 expression pointing to magnified apoptosis. Mitochondrial respiration was also affected as demonstrated by the low expression of respiratory oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes and a high adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio. In contrast, the FAS and ACC enzymes were markedly increased, thereby indicating  stimulation. This was associated with an augmented secretion of lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in CFTR cells. The addition of Fe/Asc worsened while butylated hydroxy toluene partially improved these processes.CFTR silencing results in lipid homeostasis disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the marked abnormalities in response to CFTR deletion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354669>Progenitor recruitment and adipogenic lipolysis contribute to the anabolic actions of parathyroid hormone on the skeleton.</a></h2><p>Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone formation in vivo and also suppresses the volume of bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT). In contrast, a calorie-restricted (CR) diet causes bone loss and induces BMAT in both mice and humans. We used the CR model to test whether PTH would reduce BMAT in mice by both altering cell fate and inducing lipolysis of marrow adipocytes. Eight-week-old mice were placed on a control (Ctrl) diet or CR diet. At 12 wk, CR and Ctrl mice were injected daily with PTH (CR/PTH or Ctrl/PTH) or vehicle for 4 wk. Two other cohorts were CR and simultaneously injected (CR + PTH or CR + Veh) for 4 wk. CR mice had low bone mass and increased BMAT in the proximal tibias. PTH significantly increased bone mass in all cohorts despite calorie restrictions. Adipocyte density and size were markedly increased with restriction of calories. PTH reduced adipocyte numbers in CR + PTH mice, whereas adipocyte size was reduced in CR/PTH-treated mice. In contrast, osteoblast number was increased 3-8-fold with PTH treatment. In vitro, bone marrow stromal cells differentiated into adipocytes and, treated with PTH, exhibited increased production of glycerol and fatty acids. Moreover, in cocultures of bone marrow adipocyte and osteoblast progenitors, PTH stimulated the transfer of fatty acids to osteoblasts. In summary, PTH administration to CR mice increased bone mass by shifting lineage allocation toward osteogenesis and inducing lipolysis of mature marrow adipocytes. The effects of PTH on bone marrow adiposity could enhance its anabolic actions by providing both more cells and more fuel for osteoblasts during bone formation.-Maridas, D.

Furthermore, we know very little about the metabolic and regulatory factors that regulate lipid metabolism in late embryos or newly-hatched chicks. In the present study, we examined hepatic transcriptomes of 12 embryos and 12 hatchling chicks during the peri-hatch period-or the metabolic switch from chorioallantoic to pulmonary respiration.Initial hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct, albeit opposing, patterns of hepatic gene expression. Cluster A genes are largely lipolytic and highly expressed in embryos. While, Cluster  genes are lipogenic/thermogenic and mainly controlled by the lipogenic transcription factor THRSPA. Using pairwise comparisons of embryo and hatchling ages, we found 1272 genes that were differentially expressed between embryos and hatchling chicks, including 24 transcription factors and 284 genes that regulate lipid metabolism. The three most differentially-expressed transcripts found in liver of embryos were MOGAT1, DIO3 and PDK4, whereas THRSPA, FASN and DIO2 were highest in hatchlings. An unusual finding was the "ectopic" and extremely high differentially expression of seven feather keratin transcripts in liver of 16 day embryos, which coincides with engorgement of liver with yolk lipids. Gene interaction networks show several transcription factors, transcriptional co-activators/co-inhibitors and their downstream genes that exert a 'ying-yang' action on lipid metabolism during the embryo-to-hatching transition. These upstream regulators include ligand-activated transcription factors, sirtuins and Kruppel-like factors.Our genome-wide transcriptional analysis has greatly expanded the hepatic repertoire of regulatory and metabolic genes involved in the embryo-to-hatchling transition. New knowledge was gained on interactive transcriptional networks and metabolic pathways that enable the abrupt switch from ectothermy (embryo) to endothermy (hatchling) in the chicken. Several transcription factors and their coactivators/co-inhibitors appear to exert opposing actions on lipid metabolism, leading to the predominance of lipolysis in embryos and  in hatchlings. Our analysis of hepatic transcriptomes has enabled discovery of opposing, interconnected and interdependent transcriptional regulators that provide precise ying-yang or homeorhetic regulation of lipid metabolism during the critical embryo-to-hatchling transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29945982>INT-767 prevents NASH and promotes visceral fat brown  and mitochondrial function.</a></h2><p>The bile acid receptors, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), regulate multiple pathways, including glucose and lipid metabolism. In a rabbit model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome, long-term treatment with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 reduces visceral adipose tissue accumulation, hypercholesterolemia and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. INT-767 significantly improves the hallmarks of insulin resistance in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and induces mitochondrial and brown fat-specific markers. VAT preadipocytes isolated from INT-767-treated rabbits, compared to preadipocytes from HFD, show increased mRNA expression of brown  markers. In addition, INT-767 induces improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and dynamic, reduced superoxide production and improved insulin signaling and lipid handling in preadipocytes. Both  and  treatments with INT-767 counteract, in preadipocytes, the HFD-induced alterations by upregulating genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In preadipocytes, INT-767 behaves mainly as a TGR5 agonist, directly activating dose dependently the cAMP/PKA pathway. However,  experiments also suggest that FXR activation by INT-767 contributes to the insulin signaling improvement. INT-767 treatment counteracts HFD-induced liver histological alterations and normalizes the increased pro-inflammatory genes. INT-767 also induces a significant reduction of fatty acid synthesis and fibrosis markers, while increasing lipid handling, insulin signaling and mitochondrial markers. In conclusion, INT-767 significantly counteracts HFD-induced liver and fat alterations, restoring insulin sensitivity and prompting preadipocytes differentiation toward a metabolically healthy phenotype.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067497>Phosphorylation dependent proteostasis of sterol regulatory element binding proteins.</a></h2><p>Lipid homeostasis is critically dependent on the liver.

Previous studies identified miRNAs that regulate transcription factors, including Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG), in adipocytes, but whether they influence  via such regulatory loops remain elusive. Here we predicted and validated a novel feed-forward loop regulating  and involved miR-27a/-3p, PPARG and Secretory Carrier Membrane Protein 3 (SCAMP3). In this loop, expression of both PPARG and SCAMP3 was independently suppressed by miR-27a/-3p overexpression. Knockdown of PPARG downregulated SCAMP3 expression at the late phase of , whereas reduction of SCAMP3 mRNA levels increased PPARG expression at early phase in differentiation. The latter was accompanied with upregulation of adipocyte-enriched genes, including ADIPOQ and FABP4, suggesting an anti-adipogenic role for SCAMP3. PPARG and SCAMP3 exhibited opposite behaviors regarding correlations with clinical phenotypes, including body mass index, body fat mass, adipocyte size, lipolytic and lipogenic capacity, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. While adipose PPARG expression was associated with more favorable metabolic phenotypes, SCAMP3 expression was linked to increased fat mass and insulin resistance.

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has an important role in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism of this remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of fexaramine (Fex), an FXR agonist, on lipid metabolism. For this purpose, 6‑week‑old db/db mice were treated with Fex for 8 weeks via oral gavage and db/db mice treated with corn oil were used as controls. Body weight and food intake were monitored daily and bi‑weekly, respectively. A glucose tolerance test was performed during the final week of feeding. Blood samples were obtained for the analysis of lipids and enzymes related to hepatic function, and liver tissues were analyzed by histology and molecular examination. The results indicated that serum and liver triglyceride levels were decreased in db/db mice administered with Fex. Fewer small lipid droplets were observed in the liver. Small heterodimer partner (SHP), a downstream gene of FXR, was upregulated following Fex treatment. The mRNA and protein expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation [acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α (CPT1‑α) and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑coactivator‑1α] was also increased. Additionally, the expression of AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) was also increased. However, the expression of sterol‑regulatory element binding protein‑1c and fatty acid synthase, which are associated with fatty acid synthesis, was not significantly different. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that activation of FXR and its downstream gene SHP may induce the AMPK‑ACC‑CPT1‑α signaling pathway, which promotes fatty acids oxidation, ultimately achieving its lipid‑lowering effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373507>Alcohol-induced microtubule acetylation leads to the accumulation of large, immobile lipid droplets.</a></h2><p>Although steatosis (fatty liver) is a clinically well-described early stage of alcoholic liver disease, surprisingly little is known about how it promotes hepatotoxicity. We have shown that ethanol consumption leads to microtubule hyperacetylation that can explain ethanol-induced defects in protein trafficking. Because almost all steps of the lipid droplet life cycle are microtubule dependent and because microtubule acetylation promotes , we examined droplet dynamics in ethanol-treated cells. In WIF- cells treated with ethanol and/or oleic acid (a fatty acid associated with the "Western" diet), we found that ethanol dramatically increased lipid droplet numbers and led to the formation of large, peripherally located droplets. Enhanced droplet formation required alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol metabolism, and peripheral droplet distributions required intact microtubules. We also determined that ethanol-induced microtubule acetylation led to impaired droplet degradation. Live-cell imaging revealed that droplet motility was microtubule dependent and that droplets were virtually stationary in ethanol-treated cells. To determine more directly whether microtubule hyperacetylation could explain impaired droplet motility, we overexpressed the tubulin-specific acetyltransferase αTAT1 to promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Droplet motility was impaired in αTAT1-expressing cells but to a lesser extent than in ethanol-treated cells. However, in both cases, the large immotile droplets (but not small motile ones) colocalized with dynein and dynactin (but not kinesin), implying that altered droplet-motor microtubule interactions may explain altered dynamics. These studies further suggest that modulating cellular acetylation is a potential strategy for treating alcoholic liver disease. Chronic alcohol consumption with the "Western diet" enhances the development of fatty liver and leads to impaired droplet motility, which may have serious deletrious effects on hepatocyte function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010959>Statins Promote Interleukin-1β-Dependent Adipocyte Insulin Resistance Through Lower Prenylation, Not Cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Statins lower cholesterol and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but this drug class increases diabetes risk. Statins are generally anti-inflammatory. However, statins can promote inflammasome-mediated adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance through an unidentified immune effector. Statins lower mevalonate pathway intermediates beyond cholesterol, but it is unknown whether lower cholesterol underpins statin-mediated insulin resistance. We sought to define the mevalonate pathway metabolites and immune effectors that propagate statin-induced adipose insulin resistance. We found that LDL cholesterol lowering was dispensable, but statin-induced lowering of isoprenoids required for protein prenylation triggered NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-dependent insulin resistance in adipose tissue. Multiple statins impaired insulin action at the level of Akt/protein kinase  signaling in mouse adipose tissue. Providing geranylgeranyl isoprenoids or inhibiting caspase-1 prevented statin-induced defects in insulin signaling. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) impaired insulin signaling in adipose tissue from wild-type and IL-18 mice, but not IL-1β mice. Atorvastatin decreased cell-autonomous insulin-stimulated  but did not alter lipolysis or glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results show that statin lowering of prenylation isoprenoids activates caspase-1/IL-1β inflammasome responses that impair endocrine control of adipocyte . This may allow the targeting of cholesterol-independent statin side effects on adipose lipid handling without compromising the blood lipid/cholesterol-lowering effects of statins.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067509>Neuromedin  receptor disruption impairs  in mice and 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Neuromedin , a bombesin-like peptide, and its receptor, are expressed in white adipose tissue with undefined roles.

Here we showed that adipose stem/stromal cells (ASC) from perigonadal fat of female NB-R knockout mice, exposed to a differentiation protocol in vitro, accumulated less lipid (45%) than wild-type, suggesting reduced capacity to differentiate under adipogenic input. To further explore mechanisms, preadipocytes 3T3-L1 cells were incubated in the presence of NB-R antagonist (PD168368) during the first three days in culture. Cells were analyzed in the end of the treatment (Day 3) and later when fully differentiated (Day 21). NB-R antagonist induced lower number of cells at day 3 and 21 (33-39%), reduced cell proliferation at day 3 (-53%) and reduced lipid accumulation at day 21 (-86%). The mRNA expressions of several adipocyte differentiation markers were importantly reduced at both days: CEBPb and PPARg, and Fabp4, Plin-1 and Adipoq, and additionally Lep mRNA at day 21. The antagonist had no effect when incubated with mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Therefore, genetically disruption of NB-R in mice ASC or pharmacological antagonism of NB-R in 3T3-L1 cells impairs . The mechanisms suggested by results in 3T3-L1 cells involve reduction of cell proliferation and of early genes expressions, leading to decreased number of mature adipocytes.

Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome, one of the chronic liver diseases in laying hens, has great similarity to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans. It is characterized by the pathological accumulation of liver fat. Non-invasive techniques are needed for early identification of fibrosis. As primary de novo  in the liver of chicken is similar to that of humans, mature chicken is an ideal animal model for the understanding of NAFLD. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationships between gut microbiota and natural chronic liver disease (i.e., non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH] and fibrosis stages) in a well-characterized laying hen population. One hundred 20-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were used and fed with basal diets until 52 wk of age. At the end of the experiment, birds were killed for sampling blood, liver, and cecal contents, and then classified by liver histology measurement into different groups. We investigated microbial community structure of cecum using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Subjects in stage 0 fibrosis without NASH were classified as low NAFLD (Group A), subjects in stage 1-2 fibrosis with mild to moderate NASH were defined as low NASH (Group ), and subjects in stage 3 fibrosis were defined as severe NASH (Group C). The abundance of Firmicutes was reduced in Groups  and C (P < 0.001), whereas opposite results were observed for the abundance of Bacteroidetes. Additionally, the families Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae Lachnospiraceae, and lactobacillae were significantly different between groups of differing fibrosis stages (P < 0.001), driven entirely by alterations of Bacteroides and lactobacillus and lachnospiraceae genera (P < 0.001), were observed. Results indicated that cecal dysbiosis was linked with the severity of fibrosis and NASH; importantly, increased levels of serum AST, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid were accompanied with liver fibrosis and NASH severity. Collectively, these data highlight the role of gut-liver axis and associations between the gut microbiota and fibrosis and NASH severity.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523118>Modulation of HIF-2α PAS- domain contributes to physiological responses.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors in the basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) protein family that contain internal hydrophobic cavities within their PAS-A and PAS- domains. Among HIFs, the HIF-2α PAS- domain contains a relatively large cavity exploited for the development of specific artificial ligands such as PT2399. Administration of PT2399 could suppress HIF-2α target gene expression without affecting HIF-1 activity in mice under hypoxia conditions. A single mutation (S305M) within the HIF-2α PAS- domain suppressed HIF-2α activity while conferring resistance to PT2399 in vivo, indicating the vital role of PAS- domain in HIF-2α hypoxia response. In contrast, the mutant mice did not phenocopy PT2399 intervention in wild-type mice under metabolic stress. Under a high-fat diet (HFD), the mutant mice exert enhanced  and obtain larger adipose mass and body weight gain compared to wild type. However, administration of PT2399 along with HFD feeding sufficiently suppressed HFD-induced body weight and adipose mass increase through suppression of  and . The accompanying decreased lipid accumulation in the liver and improved glucose tolerance in wild-type mice were not observed in the mutant mice indicating negative regulation of HIF-2α on obesity and a complex role for the PAS- domain in metabolic regulation. Notably, short-term administration of PT2399 to obese mice decreased adipose mass and improved metabolic condition. These results indicate a regulatory role for HIF-2α in obesity progression and suggest a therapeutic opportunity for PT2399 in obesity and associated metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354792>Co-Expression Networks Reveal Potential Regulatory Roles of miRNAs in Fatty Acid Composition of Nelore Cattle.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid (FA) content affects the sensorial and nutritional value of meat and plays a significant role in biological processes such as  and immune response. It is well known that, in beef, the main FAs associated with these biological processes are oleic acid (C18:1 cis9, OA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA-c9t11), which may have beneficial effects on metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we performed differential expression and co-expression analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and partial correlation with information theory (PCIT), to uncover the complex interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in skeletal muscle associated with FA content. miRNA and mRNA expression data were obtained from skeletal muscle of Nelore cattle that had extreme genomic breeding values for OA and CLA. Insulin and MAPK signaling pathways were identified by WGCNA as central pathways associated with both of these fatty acids. Co-expression network analysis identified bta-miR-33a/, bta-miR-100, bta-miR-204, bta-miR-365-5p, bta-miR-660, bta-miR-411a, bta-miR-136, bta-miR-30-5p, bta-miR-146b, bta-let-7a-5p, bta-let-7f, bta-let-7, bta-miR 339, bta-miR-10b, bta-miR 486, and the genes  and  as potential regulators of fatty acid synthesis.

However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced  and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty acid synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-PAHSA was also impaired by high glucose conditions. Thus, high glucose concentrations impaired 5-PAHSA action by inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway and promoting nuclear factor-kappa- (NF-κ) mediated inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628041>MIGA2 Links Mitochondria, the ER, and Lipid Droplets and Promotes De Novo  in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Physical contact between organelles is vital to the function of eukaryotic cells. Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles specialized in lipid storage that interact physically with mitochondria in several cell types. The mechanisms coupling these organelles are, however, poorly understood, and the cell-biological function of their interaction remains largely unknown. Here, we discover in adipocytes that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein MIGA2 links mitochondria to LDs. We identify an amphipathic LD-targeting motif and reveal that MIGA2 binds to the membrane proteins VAP-A or VAP- in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We find that in adipocytes MIGA2 is involved in promoting triglyceride (TAG) synthesis from non-lipid precursors. Our data indicate that MIGA2 links reactions of de novo  in mitochondria to TAG production in the ER, thereby facilitating efficient lipid storage in LDs. Based on its presence in many tissues, MIGA2 is likely critical for lipid and energy homeostasis in a wide spectrum of cell types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we defined several kinds of regulatory mechanisms of SR-B1 expression and function. Here, we have dissected the function of a novel miR-24 on SR-B1 expression, HDL uptake and lipid metabolism. We showed that miR-24 was upregulated in HepG2 cells cultured in the mimicked hyperlipidemic condition and in the livers of dietary induced and genetic obesity mice. Overexpression of miR-24 inhibited SR-B1 expression by directly targeting SR-B1 3' UTR and repressed HDL uptake and steroidogenesis in steroidogenic cells. HepG2 cells with miR-24 showed attenuation of TG levels and lipid accumulation. Moreover, we validated that overexpression of miR-24 downregulated the expression of certain genes involved in , FASN, ACLY and SCD1, and increased the expression of genes of cholesterol synthesis, HMGCR, DHCR24 and SREBP2. Taken together, we demonstrated that obesity induced miR-24 repressed HDL uptake, steroid hormone synthesis and lipid metabolism by targeting SR-B1.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: 1) controls, 2) STZ rats 3) STZ rats treated daily with NAR (40 mg/kg .w.) for 30 days. NAR prevented increases in serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase activities in STZ rats. The flavonoid blocked serum lipid alterations, but not the biometric parameters in STZ rats. Microscopic examination in liver from STZ rats revealed morphological changes indicative of increased  and cell death and inflammation, which were all mitigated by the flavonoid. NAR inhibited the NFκ/IL-6/Cox-2 overexpressions triggered by oxidative stress in STZ rats. The iNOS/NO/nitrosylated protein pathway was also blocked by NAR. The increment in the protein expression of Fas/FasL/caspase-3 and in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio showed that both pathways of apoptosis were increased by the diabetes, effects that were abrogated by NAR treatment. In conclusion, NAR protects against the liver damage caused by STZ-induced diabetes and it could be a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent the non alcoholic fatty liver disease associated with the type 1Diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, little investigation has been carried out to explore whether GEM affected the intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition of goat. To explore the role of GEM gene in goat, this gene was cloned and its tissue and temporal expression profile were detected. Effect of GEM on  was examined by losing function of GEM in vitro.

What remains unclear, however, is whether HA holds a similar potential for stimulating the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs to that of a more frequently used osteogenic-inducing medium (OIM). To that end, we used PHBV electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds to directly compare the osteogenic capacities of HA with OIM over MSCs. Through the observation of cellular morphology, the staining of osteogenic markers, and the quantitative measuring of osteogenic-related genes, as well as microRNA analyses, we not only found that HA was as capable as OIM for differentiating MSCs down an osteogenic lineage; albeit, at a significantly slower rate, but also that numerous microRNAs are involved in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs through multiple pathways involving the inhibition of cellular proliferation and stemness, chondrogenesis and , and the active promotion of osteogenesis.

Here we projected that doxorubicin would impede  and elevated lipolysis in adipose tissue would elevate the circulatory lipid profile and leads to insulin resistance. Further exacerbated lipid profile in circulation would impair the lipid metabolism in hepatic tissue which leads to fatty liver condition and consequently related disease during doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin impairs the  through PPARγ and augments lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation through ATGL and PPARα in adipose tissue. Increased fatty acid level by adipose tissue in circulation would translocate into the liver and dysregulates AHR, PXR, PPARγ, ATGL and Apo ,which further develop insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis condition.

In this study, we investigated the effect of BITC on the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes during adipocyte differentiation. The treatment of BITC during the differentiation-inducing stage significantly ameliorated the lipid accumulation, whereas it had no inhibitory effect during the differentiation-maintaining stage. BITC also significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of the adipocyte-specific markers, such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. BITC significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, whereas it enhanced that of AMP-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, BITC significantly suppressed the intracellular 2-deoxyglucose uptake as well as glucose transporter 4 expression.

The 2 types of thermogenic adipocytes, brown and beige, are thought to be of different origins but share functionally similar phenotypes. Here, we report that lysine-specific demethylase 2 (LSD2) regulates the expression of genes associated with lineage identity during the differentiation of brown and beige adipogenic progenitors in mice. In HB2 mouse brown preadipocytes, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of LSD2 impaired formation of lipid droplet-containing adipocytes and down-regulated brown -associated genes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that myogenesis-associated genes were up-regulated in LSD2-KD cells under adipogenic induction. In addition, loss of LSD2 during later phases of differentiation had no obvious influence on adipogenic traits, suggesting that LSD2 functions during earlier phases of brown adipocyte differentiation. Using adipogenic cells from the brown adipose tissues of LSD2-knockout (KO) mice, we found reduced expression of brown  genes, whereas myogenesis genes were not affected. In contrast, when LSD2-KO cells from inguinal white adipose tissues were subjected to beige induction, these cells showed a dramatic rise in myogenic gene expression.

Whereas the central circadian clock in the brain is primarily entrained by light signals, peripheral circadian clocks, which are in most cells in the body, receive cues not only from the central pacemaker but also endocrine and other systemic and tissue-specific signals. Prior studies have connected peripheral circadian clocks to metabolism, primarily with studies focused on the robust clock in the liver that responds to feeding/fasting cycles. Adipose tissue is also critical for metabolism and adipocytes have circadian clocks. Yet, the role of the circadian clock in adipocytes is poorly understood. Here we describe our studies that revealed components of the circadian clock in primary adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) in mice. We made the surprising discovery of a particularly prominent role for the circadian gene Period 3 (Per3) in the APC clock. Furthermore, we elucidated that Per3 directly regulates an output pathway of the APC clock to modulate the expression of the Kruppel-like factor 15 (Klf15) gene.

The findings of inverse associations for VLCSFAs with -NHLs other than CLL/SLL and for VLCSFA and MUFA with T-NHL suggest an influence of fatty acid metabolism on lymphomagenesis.© 2018 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153959>An overview of epidermal lamellar bodies: Novel roles in biological adaptations and secondary barriers.</a></h2><p>The epidermal lamellar bodies (LBs) are specialized organelles that contain pro-barrier lipids imparting a fully lamellar internal structure, but also other cargoes such as enzymes (lipid metabolizing and proteolytic), enzyme inhibitors, and antimicrobial peptides. Thus, the LB secretory system, by virtue of delivering these cargoes to the stratum corneum (SC) interstices, is essential for forming the various skin barriers located in the SC. Ultrastructural studies have suggested that the morphologic features of LBs reflect the functional status of the SC. Several ichthyotic skin diseases as well as experimental animal models with defective epidermal  show only partial lamellar contents or even empty appearing LB, reflecting an abnormal cargo composition. We suggest that LB polymorphism reflects a wide array of barrier adaptations to environmental challenges, rather than just a defective barrier function, based on observations on a) LB morphology in inherited skin disorders of lipid metabolism (Refsum disease, Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome) characterized by deficiency of lamellar lipids and accumulation of toxic metabolites; ) Psoriasis (with a high expression of Psoriasin antimicrobial peptide within lesions) and c) the Pitohui, a toxic bird where diet-derived toxin is eliminated via the LB secretory system that creates a chemical defense system. Morphological features of LBs from these models suggest a hitherto unrecognized function for the LBs in elimination of toxic substances from the body. We also provide preliminary evidence that indicate yet another function for the LBs- as a type of recycling endosomes allowing for uptake of certain topically applied materials by the epidermis.Copyright © 2018.

The development of an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) model that reflects the dynamic remodeling of extracellular matrices (ECMs) during simultaneous osteogenesis and  of hMSCs can provide a useful tool to mimic the process and to investigate how 3D ECMs balance the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. In this study, ECMs secreted by hMSCs during their stepwise osteogenesis-co- were deposited on hybrid meshes of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and collagen to prepare biomimetic PLGA-collagen-ECM hybrid scaffolds. Four types of stepwise differentiation ECMs were prepared: ECMs secreted by hMSCs at early stages of osteogenesis and  (EOEA-ECMs), hMSCs at early stages of osteogenesis and late stages of  (EOLA-ECMs), hMSCs at late stages of osteogenesis and early stages of  (LOEA-ECMs) and hMSCs at late stages of osteogenesis and late stages of  (LOLA-ECMs). The deposited ECMs had different compositions that were dependent on the different stages of osteogenesis and . They also showed different effects on balancing the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The EOEA-ECM scaffold had a promotive effect on  and a suppressive effect on the osteogenesis of hMSCs. The LOEA-ECM and LOLA-ECM scaffolds showed a promotive effect on osteogenesis and a moderate effect on the adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The EOLA-ECM scaffold exhibited a suppressive effect on both osteogenesis and  of hMSCs. However, the EOLA-ECM scaffold promoted hMSC proliferation more strongly than the other ECM scaffolds. The results indicated that dynamically remodeling ECM scaffolds could affect the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs and should provide a useful 3D cell culture model for the investigation of ECM-cell interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339434>IGFBP7 downregulation or overexpression effect on bovine preadipocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>The insulin-like growth factor binding-protein 7 (IGFBP7) has binding affinities to IGFs and is able to either positively or negatively regulate the IGFs signaling pathway. It also plays a crucial role in cell growth, differentiation and development in an IGF-independent manner. Herein, we investigated the specific regulation of the gene encoding for IGFBP7during the differentiation process of the adipocyte cells of the Yan Yellow Cattle by interfering with or by overexpressing the  gene. As a result, we found that the mRNA expression levels of IGFBP7 were significantly increased during the formation of progenitor cells. In addition, the expression levels of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα) were also significantly increased.  gene overexpression and RNA interfering promoted and inhibited respectively the lipid accumulation and triglyceride production in mature adipocytes, and the expression of the LPL and transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα). The changes in the protein expression levels of IGFBP7 and adipogenic factors were in accord with the changes observed in the mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results indicate that IGFBP7 plays an important regulatory role in the differentiation of preadipocyte cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497225>Vitisin  as a novel fatty acid synthase inhibitor induces human breast cancer cells apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. Novel therapies and chemo-therapeutic drugs are still in urgent need to be developed for the treatment of breast cancer. One of the most important metabolic hallmarks of breast cancer cells is enhanced . Increasing evidences suggest that fatty acid synthase (FAS) plays an important role in the development of human breast cancer, for the expression of FAS is significantly higher in breast cancer cells than in normal cells. In addition, FAS inhibitors, such as curcumin, ursolic acid, and resveratrol, have shown anti-cancer potential. In the present study, we discovered that vitisin , a natural stilbene isolated from the seeds of  Pall. var. chinensis (Fisch.), was a novel FAS inhibitor. We found that vitisin  could down-regulate FAS expression and inhibit intracellular FAS activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. Also, we reported for the first time that vitisin  exhibited apoptotic effect on human breast cancer cells. Given all of this, we proposed a hypothesis that vitisin  has an application potential in the chemoprevention and treatment of breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089788>Identification of the lipid-lowering component of triterpenes from Alismatis rhizoma based on the MRM-based characteristic chemical profiles and support vector machine model.</a></h2><p>It has been demonstrated that triterpenes in Alismatis rhizoma (Zexie in Chinese, ZX) contributed to the lipid-lowering effect on high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Alisol  23-acetate, one of the abundant triterpenes in ZX, was used as the marker of quality control for ZX in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, while it could not reflect the lipid-lowering effect because other triterpenes in ZX also had prominent medicinal efficacy. To identify the significantly bioactive triterpenes in ZX, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based characteristic chemical profile (CCP)-support vector machine (SVM) model was used to explore the relationship between triterpenes and lipid-lowering effect of ZX. Firstly, the content of 87 targeted triterpenes was quantified by the MRM-based CCP using UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS. Secondly, the lipid-lowering effect of 30 ZX samples was assessed by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Thirdly, 9 of the 87 triterpenes possessing high mean impact value were identified to have significant lipid-lowering effect via the particle swarm-optimized SVM model. The new SVM model constructed by the 9 triterpenes showed good prediction performance and the overall prediction accuracy reached 81.94%. Finally, the real activity of these triterpenes was partly confirmed and was consistent with the prediction of SVM. These results showed that the method for discovery of triterpenes with prominent lipid-lowering activity in ZX was reliable. The proposed method is expected to provide an efficient and rapid approach for screening of active component and drug discovery in traditional herbs.

Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a key transcriptional regulator controlling . Moreover, androgen receptor (AR) has been well defined to play an important role in lethal PCa aggressiveness from androgen-responsive to castration-resistant status. In this study, we showed that the quality-assured  ethanol extract (GTEE), a Chinese natural and herbal product, significantly inhibited expression of SREBP-1 and its downstream genes associated with  in PCa cells. Through inhibiting SREBP-1, GTEE reduced the levels of intracellular fatty acids and lipids in PCa cells. Importantly, GTEE also downregulated the expression of AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in both androgen-responsive and castration-resistant PCa cells. By blocking the SREBP-1/AR axis, GTEE suppressed cell growth and progressive behaviors, as well as activating the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in PCa cells. These data provide a new molecular basis of GTEE for the development of a potential therapeutic approach to treat PCa malignancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007129>Biochanin A prevents 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced adipocyte dysfunction in cultured 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental pollutant. TCDD accumulates in the food chain, mainly in the fatty tissues of the human body where it causes various toxic effects. Biochanin A is a natural organic compound in the class of phytochemicals known as flavonoids. We investigated whether biochanin A suppresses TCDD-induced loss of adipogenic action using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell culture model of wasting syndrome. In the present study, biochanin A suppressed TCDD-induced loss of lipid accumulation. Pretreating the cells with biochanin A increased the levels of the -associated factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adiponectin, which were inhibited by TCDD. TCDD decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was effectively restored by pretreatment with biochanin A. Biochanin A also inhibited the TCDD-driven decrease in production of insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transporter 4. These results suggest a preventive effect of biochanin A against TCDD in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. TCDD increased production of intracellular calcium ([Ca]), prostaglandin E, cytosolic phospholipase A2, and cyclooxygenase-1, while reducing the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. However, biochanin A inhibited these TCDD-induced effects.

LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages show reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression and lowered pro-inflammatory cytokine production when treated with CAE and pure phenolics. Inflammatory crosstalk created by stimulating adipocytes with macrophage-conditioned media (CM) is arrested; CAE diminishes tumor necrosis factor-α (67%) and promotes adiponectin secretion (12.3-fold). Mitochondrial function, measured by reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial content, and activity, is preserved in CM-treated adipocytes through up-regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α expression. Increases in insulin receptor (9-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (3-fold), protein kinase  (4-fold) phosphorylation, and a decrease in insulin receptor substrate 1 serine phosphorylation induce increased glucose uptake (34%) and glucose transporter 4 translocation (14-fold) in CM-induced adipocytes.CAE phenolics promote a beige phenotype in adipocytes. Macrophages-adipocytes inflammatory interaction is reduced preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance.

We observed that HA accumulated during maturation of adipocytes in vitro and was associated with increased expression of preadipocyte factor 1, zinc finger protein 423, and early  cell factor 1. Although HA is normally abundant in the extracellular matrix, a further increase in HA staining occurred in mice at sites of reactive  following injury of colon by dextran sodium sulfate or injury of skin from infection with Staphylococcus aureus. HA also abundantly accumulated around adipocytes seen in the colons of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This HA was necessary for adipocyte maturation because digestion of HA by administration of soluble hyaluronidase or transgenic expression of hyaluronidase 1 inhibited  in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, hyaluronidase also suppressed inflammation of both skin and colon and decreased antimicrobial peptide expression by developing preadipocytes. This resulted in increased bacterial transit across the epithelial barrier despite decreased tissue injury from inflammation. These observations suggest HA plays an important role in reactive  and host defense after injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927369>Oral administration of a new HRI activator as a new strategy to improve high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and hypertriglyceridaemia through FGF21.</a></h2><p>FGF21 has emerged as a therapeutic strategy for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus due to its antidiabetic effects, and this has led to the development of long-acting analogues of FGF21. However, these compounds have some limitations, including a need to be administered by s.c. injection and their prolonged pharmacodynamic effect compared with native FGF21, which might be responsible for their reported side effects.We have previously demonstrated that i.p. administration of haem-regulated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase (HRI) activators increases hepatic and circulating levels of FGF21. In this study, we examined the effects of p.o. administration of a new HRI activator, EPB-53, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and hypertriglyceridaemia, and compared them with those of metformin.EPB-53 administration for the last 2 weeks, to mice fed a HFD for 10 weeks, reduced body weight gain, improved glucose intolerance, and prevented hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridaemia, whereas metformin only ameliorated glucose intolerance. Moreover, EPB-53, similar to the reported effects of FGF21, reduced  in cultured human hepatocytes and in the liver of mice fed a HFD. Administration of EPB-53 to Fgf21-knockout mice had no effects, demonstrating that its efficacy is dependent on this hormone.Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that p.o. administration of HRI activators, by increasing FGF21, is a promising strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935037>Melatonin Improves Fatty Liver Syndrome by Inhibiting the  Pathway in Hamsters with High-Fat Diet-Induced Hyperlipidemia.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on hepatic lipid metabolism in hamsters with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced dyslipidemia. Male Syrian hamsters were kept on either a chow control (C) or HFD for four weeks. After four weeks, animals fed the HFD were further randomly assigned to four groups: high-fat only (P), melatonin low-dosage (L), medium-dosage (M), and high-dosage (H) groups. The L, M, and H groups, respectively, received 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg/day of a melatonin solution, while the P and C groups received the ethanol vehicle. After eight weeks of the intervention, results showed that a low dose of melatonin significantly reduced HFD-induced hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides; decreased plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( < 0.05). In addition, melatonin markedly decreased activities of the hepatic lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) ( < 0.05), and elevated the relative hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α expression in hamsters with HFD-induced hyperlipidemia. Consequently, melatonin reduced activities of the hepatic lipogenic enzymes, ACC and FAS. In summary, chronic melatonin administration improved HFD-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in Syrian hamsters with HFD-induced dyslipidemia, which might have occurred through inhibiting the  pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116420>Health outcomes of a high fructose intake: the importance of physical activity.</a></h2><p>Fructose metabolism is generally held to occur essentially in cells of the small bowel, the liver, and the kidneys expressing fructolytic enzymes (fructokinase, aldolase  and a triokinase). In these cells, fructose uptake and fructolysis are unregulated processes, resulting in the generation of intracellular triose phosphates proportionate to fructose intake. Triose phosphates are then processed into lactate, glucose and fatty acids to serve as metabolic substrates in other cells of the body. With small oral loads, fructose is mainly metabolized in the small bowel, while with larger loads fructose reaches the portal circulation and is largely extracted by the liver. A small portion, however, escapes liver extraction and is metabolized either in the kidneys or in other tissues through yet unspecified pathways. In sedentary subjects, consumption of a fructose-rich diet for several days stimulates hepatic de novo , increases intrahepatic fat and blood triglyceride concentrations, and impairs insulin effects on hepatic glucose production. All these effects can be prevented when high fructose intake is associated with increased levels of physical activity. There is also evidence that, during exercise, fructose carbons are efficiently transferred to skeletal muscle as glucose and lactate to be used for energy production. Glucose and lactate formed from fructose can also contribute to the re-synthesis of muscle glycogen after exercise. We therefore propose that the deleterious health effects of fructose are tightly related to an imbalance between fructose energy intake on one hand, and whole-body energy output related to a low physical activity on the other hand.© 2019 The Authors.

Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play a pivotal role in . Here, we have identified a novel lncRNA, Plnc1, which is transcribed from a position ∼25,000 bp upstream of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 ( PPAR-γ2) gene. Plnc1 is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, and obese mice have higher Plnc1 expression in adipose tissue than nonobese mice. Plnc1 was induced in established adipogenic lines ST2, 3T3-L1, and C3H10T1/2 as well as in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) after adipogenic treatment. Plnc1 knockdown blocked differentiation of ST2 cells and BMSCs into mature adipocytes, along with the reduction of PPAR-γ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α, and adipocyte protein 2. Conversely, overexpression of Plnc1 promoted ST2 cells and BMSCs to fully differentiate. Mechanism studies revealed that Plnc1 could reduce the methylation level of CpG region in the PPAR-γ2 promoter and enhance the transcriptional activity of the promoter and thereby increase PPAR-γ2 transcription. Our study suggests that Plnc1 promotes adipogenic differentiation through controlling the key adipogenic transcription factor PPAR-γ and highlights the potential of Plnc1 as a target for new therapies to control metabolic disorders like obesity.-Zhu, E., Zhang, J., Li, Y., Yuan, H., Zhou, J., Wang, .

Salvianolic acid  (Sal ), a water-soluble ingredient derived from , has been shown to reduce obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases by suppressing . However, the role of Sal  in white adipose tissue (WAT) is not yet clear.Illumina Hiseq 4000 was used to study the effects of Sal  on the expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA) in epididymal white adipose tissue induced by a high fat diet in obese mice.RNA-Seq data showed that 234 lncRNAs, 19 circRNAs, and 132 mRNAs were differentially expressed in WAT under Sal  treatment. The up-regulated protein-coding genes in WAT of the Sal -treated group were involved in the insulin resistance pathway, while the down-regulated genes mainly participated in the IL-17 signaling pathway. Other pathways may play an important role in the formation and differentiation of adipose tissue, such as  cell receptor signaling. Analysis of the lncRNA-mRNA network provides potential targets for lncRNAs in energy metabolism.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays an important role in . Increased Nogo- expression can be determined in the liver of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo- expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo- expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo- promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo- transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo- promoter. Using a liver specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo- expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo- and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high-fat diet (HFD) induced fatty liver associated with increased hepatic Nogo- and PPARγ expression in mice. Similarly, serum Nogo- levels in patients with NAFLD were increased. However, rosiglitazone treatment reduced HFD-induced fatty liver and Nogo- expression. In summary, our study identifies Nogo- as a new molecular target of PPARγ, and suggests increased Nogo- might be a potential indicator for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019.

We previously reported that time-imposed feeding during the sleep phase (daytime feeding, DF) induces obesity and metabolic disorders compared with mice fed only during the active phase (nighttime feeding, NF). The present study aimed to determine whether leptin resistance is caused by DF, and whether it is involved in the underlying mechanisms of DF-induced obesity in mice, since leptin plays an essential role in regulating energy expenditure and adiposity in addition to food intake. We compared leptin sensitivity by evaluating the effects of exogenous injected leptin on food intake and body weight in wild-type C57BL/6J mice under NF and DF. The mice were fed with a high-fat high-sucrose diet throughout the study. To determine whether leptin resistance is a cause or a result of DF-induced obesity with metabolic disorders, we restricted the feeding times of leptin resistant db/db mice. We also examined leptin sensitivity in leptin deficient ob/ob mice under NF and DF to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of DF-induced leptin resistance. C57BL/6J mice under DF gained more weight and adiposity compared with mice under NF, and developed hyperleptinemia and hypothermia. We found that six days of DF abolished exogenous leptin-induced hypophagia and reduction in body weight in mice. We also found that the leptin injection significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of NF, but not in DF mice, suggesting that short-term DF was sufficient to induce metabolic leptin resistance. The DF-induced increases in body weight gain, food efficiency, adipose tissue mass, lipogenic gene expression in metabolic tissues, and hepatic lipid accumulation were abolished in db/db mice, suggesting that the leptin resistance is a cause of DF-induced metabolic disorders. DF resulted in deep hypothermia in db/db, as well as in wild-type mice, suggesting that a decrease in energy expenditure was not the main cause of DF-induced obesity. Exogenous leptin reduced the body weight of ob/ob mice under both NF and DF, and the effect was significantly higher in DF- than in NF-ob/ob mice. Therefore, the development of DF-induced leptin resistance requires endogenous leptin, and central leptin sensitivity fluctuates in a circadian manner. The present findings suggest that leptin resistance is responsible for DF-induced obesity and metabolic disorders, and that the circadian fluctuation of central leptin sensitivity might be involved in leptin resistance induced by DF, although further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of metabolic disorders that depend on the time of feeding.

In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, exposure of the cells to 1.5 mM oleic acid (OA) for 24 h caused steatosis and distorted cell morphology, induced the expression of mRNA for enzymes that are involved in  and fatty acid oxidation ( and ), and impaired indices of aerobic energy metabolism ( mRNA expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and galactose-supported ATP production). Co-treatment with 10 µM of selected polyphenols all strongly protected against the steatosis and changes in cell morphology. All polyphenols, except cyanidin, inhibited the effects on  and  and further increased  expression, suggesting a shift toward increased β-oxidation. Resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, and cyanidin, however not kuromanin or berberine, ameliorated the decreases in MMP and galactose-derived ATP. Berberine was unique in worsening the decrease in galactose-derived ATP. In further investigations of the mechanisms involved, resveratrol, catechin, and berberine increased SIRT1 enzyme activity and p-AMPKα protein, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, selected polyphenols all protected against steatosis with similar effectiveness, however through different mechanisms that increased aerobic lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29968318>EPA plays multiple roles in regulating lipid accumulation of grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella adipose tissue in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to assess the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) on lipid accumulation in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella adipose tissue both in vitro and in vivo. EPA was observed to inhibit the adipocyte viability in a time and dose-dependent manner. EPA was also found to induce reactive oxygen species accumulation in vitro. The mRNA levels of caspase 3a and caspase 3b, as well as the activity of Caspase 3 increased significantly in vitro and in vivo, whereas the value of  cell leukemia 2-Bcl-2 associated X protein decreased significantly. Besides, the pro-apoptotic effect was relieved by α-tocopherol. Dietary 0.52% EPA had no apparent effect on intraperitoneal fat index. Moreover, EPA promoted the hydrolytic gene expressions in vitro and in vivo, including adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase-a. Meanwhile, the lipogenic gene expressions of liver X receptor α, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and fatty-acid synthase were down-regulated by EPA in vitro and in vivo. However, EPA also acted to promote the marker gene expressions of , including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and lipoprotein lipase in vitro and in vivo. Contents of EPA increased significantly in the treatment groups in vitro and in vivo. These results support that EPA affects multiple aspects of lipid metabolism, including hydrolysis, ,  and apoptosis. However, it barely functioned in decreasing the lipid accumulation of Ctenopharyngodon idella under the current culture conditions.© 2018 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145872>Cytoskeletal transgelin 2 contributes to gender-dependent adipose tissue expandability and immune function.</a></h2><p>During , preadipocytes' cytoskeleton reorganizes in parallel with lipid accumulation. Failure to do so may impact the ability of adipose tissue (AT) to shift between lipid storage and mobilization. Here, we identify cytoskeletal transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) as a protein expressed in AT and associated with obesity and inflammation, being normalized upon weight loss. TAGLN2 was primarily found in the adipose stromovascular cell fraction, but inflammation, TGF-β, and estradiol also prompted increased expression in human adipocytes.  knockdown revealed a key functional role, being required for proliferation and differentiation of fat cells, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing  using the adipocyte protein 2 promoter disclosed remarkable sex-dependent variations, in which females displayed "healthy" obesity and hypertrophied adipocytes but preserved insulin sensitivity, and males exhibited physiologic changes suggestive of defective AT expandability, including increased number of small adipocytes, activation of immune cells, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired metabolism together with decreased insulin sensitivity. The metabolic relevance and sexual dimorphism of TAGLN2 was also outlined by genetic variants that may modulate its expression and are associated with obesity and the risk of ischemic heart disease in men. Collectively, current findings highlight the contribution of cytoskeletal TAGLN2 to the obese phenotype in a gender-dependent manner.-Ortega, F. J., Moreno-Navarrete, J. M., Mercader, J.

Fluoxetine (FLX) is the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to be widely available for the treatment of depression. The present study focuses on the effects and mechanisms of the lipid metabolism abnormalities caused by FLX in patients and in a mouse model of depression. Depression severity was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) serum levels were assessed in 28 patients with depression, aged 31.2±3.3 years, treated with FLX (20 to 60 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Meanwhile, the serum levels of other lipid metabolism-related parameters, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) and apolipoprotein  (ApoB), were also determined. The infiuence of FLX on the hepatic lipid profile and hepatic gene expression of both lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes was evaluated in a mouse model of depression treated with FLX (10 mg·kg·d, ip) for 4 weeks. We showed that the serum TG, TC and LDL levels were significantly increased in patients with depression after FLX treatment. The elevation in serum TG levels in the patients was not affected by gender or family history. FLX treatment did not significantly alter serum HDL, APOA1 or APOB levels in the patients. We further demonstrated in mice with depression that FLX treatment increased the hepatic TG level by increasing the expression of lipogenic enzymes and decreasing the expression of lipolytic enzymes in the liver. Antidepressive therapy with FLX is associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities, which are in part mediated by disturbances in hepatic lipid metabolism homeostasis. The findings contribute to the uncovering of metabolic adverse reactions in the pharmacological therapy of depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393485>Anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice (Oryza sativa L.

Although anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice (AEBR) was reported to have a beneficial effect on diabetic rats, no studies have been performed on whether black rice anthocyanins are beneficial for diabetic osteoporosis. Therefore, in this study, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model was established to investigate the protective effect of AEBR on diabetes-induced osteoporosis and its possible mechanism. AEBR at three doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g kg d) were administered by oral gavage to diabetic rats for 8 weeks. The blood glucose, BMD, bone histomorphometry parameters, serum bone turnover biomarkers, bone marrow adipocyte numbers, as well as osteoprotegerin (OPG), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX 2), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ  ligand (RANKL) protein expression in bone and serum were detected. The results indicated that AEBR dose-dependently decreased the blood glucose, increased the BMD, and decreased the serum bone turnover markers. The bone microstructure and osteoclast numbers in bone tissues returned to normal in the high AEBR dosage group; at the same time, the AEBR dose-dependently suppressed bone marrow . The RUNX 2 as well as the OPG/RANKL ratio in diabetic rats' bone tissues increased significantly in the AEBR treatment group. Our results indicate that AEBR administration can ameliorate bone loss caused by diabetes; this is mainly attributed to its inhibition of bone turnover, suppression of bone marrow , and up-regulation of RUNX 2 and the OPG/RANKL expression ratio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160110>Milk-Derived Tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) Enhance Insulin Sensitivity and Prevent Insulin Resistance in 3T3-F442A Preadipocytes.</a></h2><p>There is great interest in developing naturally derived compounds, especially bioactive peptides with potential insulin sensitizing effects and/or preventing insulin resistance. Previously, we showed adipogenic and insulin mimetic actions of IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro), the milk-derived tripeptides on cultured preadipocytes, in addition to their previously characterized antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory functions. However, the effect of these peptides on insulin signaling is not known. Therefore, we examined IPP and VPP effects on insulin signaling in preadipocytes, a well-established model for studying insulin signaling. Our results suggested both peptides enhanced insulin signaling and contributed toward the prevention of insulin resistance in the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Inhibition of inflammatory mediator NF-kB under TNF stimulation was a likely contributor to the prevention of insulin resistance. VPP further enhanced the expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in adipocytes and restored glucose uptake in TNF-treated adipocytes.

Recent work has shown that FAM134B plays a pivotal role in autophagy-mediated turnover of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, tumor inhibition and lipid homeostasis. In this study, we provide mechanistic links between FAM134B and ARF-related protein 1 (ARFRP1) and further show that FAM134B resides in the Golgi apparatus. Here, we found that FAM134B increased lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Transport vehicle number and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family gene expression were also increased by FAM134B overexpression, suggesting that vesicular transport activity enhanced lipid accumulation. ARF-related protein 1 (ARFRP1) is a GTPase that promotes protein trafficking. We show that FAM134B regulates the expression of ARFRP1, and the knockdown of ARFRP1 abolishes enhancement on lipid accumulation caused by FAM134B. In addition, FAM134B upregulates the PAT family protein (PAT), which associates with the lipid droplets (LDs) surface and promotes lipolysis by recruiting adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL). These findings indicate that FAM134B promotes lipid accumulation and adipogenic differentiation by increasing vesicle transport activity in the Golgi apparatus and inhibiting the lipolysis of LDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929597>Efficient bioconversion of enzymatic corncob hydrolysate into biomass and lipids by oleaginous yeast  KM281510.</a></h2><p>This study aims to valorize of enzymatic corncob hydrolysate (ECH) for biomass and lipid productions via microbial bioconversion by the efficient oleaginous yeast  KM281510. Biomass (5.63 g/L), lipids (3.29 g/L), and lipid content (58% (g/g)) were observed by batch cultivation in shaking flask. The effect of total sugar concentration in ECH, agitation rate, temperature, and initial pH were investigated in both batch and fed-batch cultivations by shaking flask and 3.0 L airlift bioreactor. Biomass, lipids, and lipid content of 27.77 g/L, 20.27 g/L, and 70% (g/g) were obtained with 100 g/L total sugar (68 g/L glucose, 29 g/L xylose, and 3 g/L arabinose), pH 6.5, 25 °C, 6.0 vvm, for 7 days by batch cultivation in bioreactor. Surprisingly, production parameters were improved by fed-batch, wherein these promising high biomass (36.06 g/L), lipid production (25.12 g/L), and lipid productivity (2.52 g/L/d) values were achieved. Moreover, fed-batch cultivation promoted the utilization of xylose (2.5-times) and arabinose (3.4-times) higher than batch cultivation, achieving lipid content (70% (g/g)) with oleic acid (53%).

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation represents a promising alternative for treating liver pathologies in both human and veterinary medicine. Interestingly, these pathologies appear with a common clinical and pathological profile in the human and canine species; as a consequence, dogs may be a spontaneous model for clinical investigations in humans. The aim of this work was to characterize canine adipose-derived MSCs (cADSCs) and compare them to their human counterpart (hADSCs) in order to support the application of the canine model in cell-based therapy of liver diseases. Both cADSCs and hADSCs were successfully isolated from adipose tissue samples. The two cell populations shared a common fibroblast-like morphology, expression of stemness surface markers, and proliferation rate. When examining multilineage differentiation abilities, cADSCs showed lower adipogenic potential and higher osteogenic differentiation than human cells. Both cell populations retained high viability when kept in PBS at controlled temperature and up to 72 h, indicating the possibility of short-term storage and transportation. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of autologous ADSCs transplantation in dogs with liver diseases. All animals exhibited significantly improved liver function, as evidenced by lower liver biomarkers levels measured after cells transplantation and evaluation of cytological specimens. These beneficial effects seem to be related to the immunomodulatory properties of stem cells. We therefore believe that such an approach could be a starting point for translating the results to the human clinical practice in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30729607>Effects of dietary resveratrol supplementation during gestation and lactation of sows on milk composition of sows and fat metabolism of sucking piglets.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this article was to investigate the effects of dietary resveratrol supplementation during gestation and lactation of sows on the milk composition of sows and the fat metabolism of sucking piglets. Forty sows were allotted to two experimental treatment groups that included the following: (a) control sows (CON treatment, n = 20) fed with a corn-soybean meal control diet and () treatment sows (RES treatment, n = 20) fed with a control diet with addition of 300 mg/kg resveratrol. The results showed that the content of lactose in the colostrum was increased (p < 0.05) and the content of fat in 21-day milk was increased (p < 0.05) by dietary resveratrol supplementation. In the RES treatment group, the concentrations of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), lipase activity and insulin (INS) in plasma of sucking piglets were increased (p < 0.05). In the adipose tissue, the enzyme activities of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased significantly by RES treatment (p < 0.05), and the mRNA levels of acetyl coenzyme A-alpha (ACCα), LPL, fatty acid transport protein (FATP1) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein gene (C/EBPα) were higher in the RES treatment group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, resveratrol supplementation on gestational and lactating sows improved the content of lactose in the colostrum and the content of fat in milk at day 21 of lactation. In addition, resveratrol supplementation on sows increased HDL and LDL in the plasma of piglets. In piglet adipose tissue, the enzyme activity and mRNA level related to lipolysis, fatty acid uptake from circulating triacylglycerols and  are partially improved by resveratrol supplementation on sows.

Human LO2 cells nonalcoholic fatty liver models were established by using palmitic acid( PA). Then psoralen and isopsoralen were administered for intervention. Intracellular triglyceride( TG) and total cholesterol( TC) content,the cell supernatant alanine aminotransferase( ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase( AST) levels were determined by enzyme method. Cell supernatant proinflammatory cytokines( IL-6,TNF-α) and chemokines( IL-8,MCP-1) were determined by ELISA method. Western blot method was conducted to detect the protein expression of intracellular nuclear factor( NF-κ) p65 phosphorylation( p-p65),nonphosphorylated protein( p65),and transforming factor TGF-β1. Result showed that as compared with the model group,intracellular TG and TC levels,the cell supernatant ALT and AST levels,proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were decreased( P < 0. 01,P <0. 05); the p-p65/p65 ratio and TGF-β1 protein expression were also significantly decreased( P< 0. 01,P< 0. 05) in psoralen intervention group.

In this study, we examined whether any cross talk exists between glucocorticoids and AMPK in the regulation of the liver bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Dexamethasone treatment decreased the growth performance of broiler chickens. The liver mRNA levels of fatty acid transport protein (FATP-1), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), AMPK alpha 1 subunit (AMPKα1), and glucocorticoid receptor were significantly upregulated in DEX-treated broilers; the gene expression of liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) was significantly downregulated. The protein level of liver CYP7A1 was significantly decreased by DEX treatment at both 24 and 72 h, while the protein level of p-AMPK/ t-AMPK stayed unchanged. In the in vitro cultured hepatocytes, compound C pretreatment blocked the increase in CYP7A1 protein level by DEX and significantly suppressed FATP-1, SREBP-1c, FXR, and CYP7A1 gene expression stimulated by DEX. Compound C treatment significantly reduces the protein level of p-AMPK, and the combination of compound C and DEX significantly reduces the protein level of t-AMPK. Thus, glucocorticoids affected liver AMPK and the bile acid synthesis signal pathway, and AMPK might be involved in the glucocorticoid effect of liver bile acid synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

White adipose tissue (WAT) is not only a major tissue for energy storage, but also an endocrine tissue that secretes various adipokines. Recent reports have demonstrated that alterations in the characteristics of WAT can impact whole-body metabolism and lifespan. Hence, we hypothesized that functional alterations in WAT may play important roles in the beneficial effects of CR. Previously, using microarray analysis of WAT from CR rats, we found that CR enhances fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, and identified sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), a master regulator of FA synthesis, as a mediator of CR. These findings were validated by showing that CR failed to upregulate factors involved in FA biosynthesis and to extend longevity in SREBP-1c knockout mice. Furthermore, we revealed that SREBP-1c is implicated in CR-associated mitochondrial activation through the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Notably, these CR-associated phenotypes were observed only in WAT. We conclude that CR induces SREBP-1c-dependent metabolic remodeling, including the enhancement of FA biosynthesis and mitochondrial activation, via PGC-1α in WAT, resulting in beneficial effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30461201>Cartilage/bone interface fabricated under perfusion: Spatially organized commitment of adipose-derived stem cells without medium supplementation.</a></h2><p>Tissue engineering of an osteochondral interface demands for a gradual transition of chondrocyte- to osteoblast-prevailing tissue.

Markers for stem cell criteria, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis,  and angiogenesis were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell distribution, Sox9 protein expression and proteoglycans were assessed by histology. In group 2 (perfusion culture), chondrogenic Sox9 was upregulated toward the cartilage-mimicking side compared to pure PLGA. On the bone-mimicking side, Sox9 experienced a downregulation, which was confirmed on the protein level. Vice versa, expression of osteocalcin was upregulated on the bone-mimicking side, while it was unchanged on the cartilage-mimicking side. In group 1 (static culture), CD31 was upregulated in the presence of aCaP compared to pure PLGA, whereas Sox9 and osteocalcin expression were not affected. aCaP nanoparticles incorporated in electrospun PLGA drive the differentiation behavior of human ASCs in a dose-dependent manner.

The hepatic adaptation is affected by prepartal energy intake level and is potentially associated with inflammatory responses. To study the changes in the liver function during the periparturient period, 16 cows (body condition score = 3.7 ± 0.3, mean ± standard deviation; parity = second through fourth) were allocated to a grass silage-based controlled-energy diet (104 MJ/d) or a high-energy diet (135 MJ/d) during the last 6 wk before the predicted parturition. Liver samples were collected by biopsy at 8 d before the predicted parturition (-8 d) and at 1 and 9 d after the actual parturition (1 and 9 d). The lipidomic profile of liver samples collected at -8 and 9 d was analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. Liver samples from all the time points were subjected to microarray analysis and the subsequent pathway analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA). Prepartal energy intake level affected hepatic gene expression and lipidomic profiles prepartum, whereas little or no effect was observed postpartum. At -8 d, hepatic  was promoted by prepartal high-energy feeding through the activation of X receptor/retinoid X receptor pathway and through increased transcription of thyroid hormone-responsive (THRSP). Hepatic inflammatory and acute phase responses at -8 d were suppressed (z-score = -2.236) by prepartal high-energy feeding through the increase in the mRNA abundance of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and the decrease in the mRNA abundance of interleukin 1 (IL1), nuclear factor kappa  1 (NFKB1), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), serum amyloid A3 (SAA3), haptoglobin (HP), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 3 (ITIH3). Moreover, prepartal high-energy feeding elevated hepatic concentrations of C18- (7%), C20- (17%), C21- (26%), C23-sphingomyelins (26%), and total saturated sphingomyelin (21%). In addition, cows in both groups displayed increased  at the gene expression level after parturition and alterations in the concentration of various sphingolipids between the first and last samplings.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis  or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and . At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29684791>The Role of Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein in Steatosis-Associated Hepatic Tumors Related to Chronic Hepatitis  virus Infection.</a></h2><p>The persistence of hepatitis  surface antigen (HBsAg) is a risk factor for the development of steatosis-associated tumors in chronic hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection, yet little is known about the metabolic link with this factor. We correlated HBV-related pathogenesis in genetically engineered mice and human carriers with metabolic proteomics and lipogenic gene expression profiles. The immunohistochemistry showed that the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML, a tumor suppressor involved in genome maintenance and fatty acid oxidation), being inversely influenced by the dynamic HBsAg levels from acute phase to seroclearance, appeared as a lipo-metabolic switch linking HBsAg-induced steatosis () to HBsAg-lost fat-burning hepatocarcinogenesis (lipolysis). Knockdown of PML in HBsAg-transgenic mice predisposed to obesity and drove early steatosis-specific liver tumorigenesis. Proteome analysis revealed that the signaling pathways corresponding to energy metabolism and its regulators were frequently altered by suppression or depletion of PML in the HBsAg-transgenic mice, mainly including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. Expression profiling further identified upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) and epigenetic methylation of NDUFA13 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1c in concordance to the increased severity of lipodystrophy and neoplasia in the livers of HBsAg-transgenic mice with PML insufficiency. The defect in lipolysis in PML-deficient HBsAg-transgenic mice made the HBsAg-induced adipose-like liver tumors vulnerable to synthetic lethality from toxic saturated fat accumulation with a Scd1 inhibitor.

Immediate early genes (IEGs) are overexpressed in patients with active GO compared to healthy controls. The aim of this study was to study the effects of tobacco smoking and simvastatin on preadipocytes and orbital fibroblasts (OFs) in the adipogenic process.Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was generated by a validated pump system. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or OFs were exposed to 10% CSE with or without simvastatin. Gene expression was studied in preadipocytes and OFs exposed to CSE with or without simvastatin and compared to unexposed cells or cells treated with a differentiation cocktail.In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, Cyr61, Ptgs2, Egr1, and Zfp36 expression levels were at least 3-fold higher in cells exposed to CSE than in unexposed cells. Simvastatin downregulated expression of these genes (1.7-fold, 5.5-fold, 3.3-fold, 1.4-fold). CSE alone could not stimulate preadipocytes to differentiate. Scd1, Ppar-γ and  were downregulated in simvastatin-treated preadipocytes compared to nontreated preadipocytes 55-, 44- and 1.7-fold, respectively. In OFs, similar effects of CSE were seen on the expression of CYR61 (1.4-fold) and PTGS2 (3.2-fold). Simvastatin downregulated , PPAR-γ (2.6-fold) and SCD (41-fold) in OFs.CSE upregulated early adipogenic genes in both mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and human OFs but did not by itself induce . Simvastatin inhibited the expression of both early and late adipocyte genes and  in preadipocytes and human OFs. The effect of simvastatin should be investigated in a clinical trial of patients with GO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632024>Dietary leucine affects glucose metabolism and  involved in TOR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for juvenile blunt snout bream Megalobrama amblycephala.</a></h2><p>The present study evaluated the mechanisms governing insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and  in juvenile fish fed with different dietary leucine levels. Fish were fed six practical diets with graded leucine levels ranging from 0.90 to 2.94% of dry basis for 8 weeks. The trial results showed that, compared to the control group (0.90%), optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) resulted in the up-regulation of mRNA expression related to insulin signaling pathway, including target of rapamycin (TOR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase  (Akt). However, an excessive leucine level (2.94%) led to protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) overexpression and inhibited TOR, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt mRNA expressions. The protein level of TOR, S6K1, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt showed a similar result with mRNA level of these genes. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) significantly improved plasma insulin content, while high level of leucine showed an inhibiting phenomenon. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) could reduce plasma glucose by enhancing the ability of glycometabolism including improving glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), glucokinase (GK) expressions and down-regulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression. While an excessive leucine level (2.94%) resulted in high plasma glucose by inhibiting the ability of glycometabolism including lowering GLUT2 and GK expressions, and improving glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and PEPCK expressions. The relative expressions of pyruvate kinase (PK) and glycogen synthase (GS) were not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. Dietary leucine level of 1.33% could improve plasma triglyceride content (TG) by enhancing  including improving sterol-response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) expressions compared to the control group (0.90%). Total cholesterol (TC) was not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. The present results indicate that optimal leucine level could improve glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis through improving insulin sensitivity in juvenile blunt snout bream. However, excessive dietary leucine level resulted in high plasma glucose, which led to insulin resistance by inhibiting the gene expressions of insulin signaling pathway and activating gluconeogenesis-related gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103920>Bm-iAANAT and its potential role in fatty acid amide biosynthesis in Bombyx mori.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this research is to unravel the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of an insect arylalkylamine N-acyltransferase from Bombyx mori (Bm-iAANAT) and to determine if this enzyme will catalyze the formation of long chain N-acylarylalkylamides in vitro. However, the determination of substrates and products for Bm-iAANAT in vitro is no guarantee that these same molecules are substrates and products for the enzyme in the organism. Therefore, RT-PCR was performed to detect the Bm-iAANAT transcripts and liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) analysis was performed on purified lipid extracts from . mori larvae (fourth instar, Bmi4) to determine if long chain fatty acid amides are produced in . mori. Ultimately, we found that recombinant Bm-iAANAT will utilize long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters as substrates and identified Bm-iAANAT transcripts and long-chain fatty acid amides in Bmi4. Together, these data show Bm-iAANAT will catalyze the formation of long-chain N-acylarylalkylamides in vitro and provide evidence demonstrating that Bm-iAANAT has a role in fatty acid amide biosynthesis in . mori, as well.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated whether cell-based screening could detect hepatitis  virus (HBV) in human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) isolated from HBV-infected donors to understand the susceptibility of HUMSCs to HBV infection.HBV assay was performed in HUMSCs derived from healthy and HBV-infected donors with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) assay, and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. Further, HBV DNA was assayed in HUMSCs derived from healthy donors after incubation with human sera containing a high titer of HBV using FQ-PCR.HBV antigen/antibody and DNA failed to be detected using ELISA, FQ-PCR, and ddPCR. After incubation with HBV infection sera, HBV DNA could be detected, but below the valid titer of the assay kit. The HBV DNA levels in HBV-incubated HUMSCs gradually decreased with medium change every 2 days and then significantly decreased, not even detected after passage.The current cell-based screening methods could not detect HBV in HUMSCs derived from HBV-infected donors, indicating the importance of more stringent donor eligibility to reduce the risk of transmission of communicable diseases in cell-based therapy. To solve the problem of an occult HBV window period in donor eligibility determination, we recommend that the donors undergo another HBV serological test 3 months after the first serological communicable disease screening.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480505>Flavonoids and Their Anti-Diabetic Effects: Cellular Mechanisms and Effects to Improve Blood Sugar Levels.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevailing global health metabolic disorder, with an alarming incidence rate and a huge burden on health care providers. DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in insulin synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of insulin resistance. The internal and external factors such as obesity, urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and ) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected pathways: Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κ. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose metabolism, hepatic enzymes activities, and a lipid profile. Most studies illustrate a positive role of specific dietary flavonoids on diabetes, but the mechanisms of action and the side effects need more clarification. Overall, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of diabetes treatment using flavonoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155483>Lipid Deprivation Induces a Stable, Naive-to-Primed Intermediate State of Pluripotency in Human PSCs.</a></h2><p>Current challenges in capturing naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) suggest that the factors regulating human naive versus primed pluripotency remain incompletely defined. Here we demonstrate that the widely used Essential 8 minimal medium (E8) captures hPSCs at a naive-to-primed intermediate state of pluripotency expressing several naive-like developmental, bioenergetic, and epigenomic features despite providing primed-state-sustaining growth factor conditions. Transcriptionally, E8 hPSCs are marked by activated lipid biosynthesis and suppressed MAPK/TGF-β gene expression, resulting in endogenous ERK inhibition. These features are dependent on lipid-free culture conditions and are lost upon lipid exposure, whereas short-term pharmacological ERK inhibition restores naive-to-primed intermediate traits even in the presence of lipids. Finally, we identify de novo  as a common transcriptional signature of E8 hPSCs and the pre-implantation human epiblast in vivo. These findings implicate exogenous lipid availability in regulating human pluripotency and define E8 hPSCs as a stable, naive-to-primed intermediate (NPI) pluripotent state.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to investigate the antiobesity properties of yacon roots in a high-fat-diet (HFD) model and the underlying mechanisms. A total of 30 Wistar male rats were divided into five groups (=6): the standard chow diet (SD) group was fed a SD; the HFD group was fed a HFD; and the HFD Y340 and HFD Y680 groups were fed a HFD plus yacon flour (340 and 680 mg FOS/kg . w./day, respectively). HFD Y340 and HFD Y680 rats exhibited marked attenuation of weight gain, a decrease in visceral fat pad weight, a restoration of the serum lipid profile and atherogenic index in a dose-dependent manner, being the higher dose more effective ( < 0.05). In addition, we found that HFD Y680 rats showed lower glucose and insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity ( < 0.5). A downregulation of several adipocyte specific-transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPAR-2), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBP-a) and activating protein (aP2) mRNA levels, was determined in the visceral adipose tissue of HFD Y680 rats ( < 0.05). An improvement of adipokine profile in HFD Y680 rats and decreased serum proinflammatory cytokine levels ( < 0.05) were determined by ELISA. Decreased macrophage infiltration and F4/80 and MCP-1 expression in the visceral adipose tissue of HFD Y680 rats ( < 0.5), together with a higher pAkt/Akt expression ( < 0.05) were also observed by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. A significant increase in glucagon (Gcg) and PYY mRNA levels in distal ileum of HFD Y680 rats ( < 0.05) were also detected. In the second approach, we determined that yacon supplementation potentiates the effects of the HFD reversion to a standard diet. In conclusion, yacon showed antiobesity properties by inhibiting  and improving the visceral adipose tissue function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496777>Linking the metabolic syndrome and obesity with vitamin D status: risks and opportunities for improving cardiometabolic health and well-being.</a></h2><p>The global death toll from noncommunicable diseases is exceptionally high, reported to cause 71% of global deaths worldwide. Metabolic syndrome risk factors, especially excessive adiposity and obesity, are at the heart of the problem resulting in increased co-morbidities such as cardiometabolic diseases and cancer, increased health costs, poorer quality of life, and shortened survival. Vitamin D can positively reverse many of these adverse effects and outcomes through blocking signaling mechanisms that predispose to cardiometabolic and metastatic disease. As an affordable natural agent, vitamin D can be used to counteract obesity-induced inflammation, block early , enhance glucose uptake, counteract hyperleptinemia, ameliorate insulin resistance, and reduce hypertension. This is supported by data from in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological studies and clinical trials. We propose that everyone in general and obese patients in particular consider raising 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels through UVB exposure and/or supplemental vitamin D intake to reduce cardiometabolic and metastatic disease and increase longevity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266807>The mitophagy receptor Bcl-2-like protein 13 stimulates  by regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis in mice.</a></h2><p>Metabolic programming of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) could influence the function of progenitor osteoblasts or adipocytes and hence determine skeletal phenotypes. Adipocytes predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation, whereas osteoblasts use glycolysis to meet ATP demand. Here, we compared progenitor differentiation from the marrow of two inbred mouse strains, C3H/HeJ (C3H) and C57BL6J (B6). These strains differ in both skeletal mass and bone marrow adiposity. We hypothesized that genetic regulation of metabolic programs controls skeletal stem cell fate. Our experiments identified Bcl-2-like protein 13 (Bcl2l13), a mitochondrial mitophagy receptor, as being critical for adipogenic differentiation. We also found that Bcl2l13 is differentially expressed in the two mouse strains, with C3H adipocyte progenitor differentiation being accompanied by a >2-fold increase in Bcl2l13 levels relative to B6 marrow adipocytes. Bcl2l13 expression also increased during adipogenic differentiation in mouse ear mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) and the murine preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. The higher Bcl2l13 expression correlated with increased mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis. Importantly,  knockdown significantly impaired adipocyte differentiation in both 3T3-L1 cells and eMSCs. Mechanistically,  knockdown reprogrammed cells to rely more on glycolysis to meet ATP demand in the face of impaired oxidative phosphorylation.  knockdown in eMSCs increased mitophagy. Moreover, Bcl2l13 prevented apoptosis during . Our findings indicate that the mitochondrial receptor Bcl2l13 promotes  by increasing oxidative phosphorylation, suppressing apoptosis, and providing mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. We conclude that genetic programming of metabolism may be important for lineage determination and cell function within the bone marrow.© 2019 Fujiwara et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234600>Anti-Obesity Effects of Dietary Calcium: The Evidence and Possible Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a serious health challenge worldwide and is associated with various comorbidities, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Developing effective strategies to prevent obesity is therefore of paramount importance. One potential strategy to reduce obesity is to consume calcium, which has been implicated to be involved in reducing body weight/fat. In this review, we compile the evidence for the anti-obesity roles of calcium in cells, animals, and humans. In addition, we summarize the possible anti-obesity mechanisms of calcium, including regulation of (a) , () fat metabolism, (c) adipocyte (precursor) proliferation and apoptosis, (d) thermogenesis, (e) fat absorption and excretion, and (f) gut microbiota. Although the exact anti-obesity roles of calcium in different subjects and how calcium induces the proposed anti-obesity mechanisms need to be further investigated, the current evidence demonstrates the anti-obesity effects of calcium and suggests the potential application of dietary calcium for prevention of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534842>Crucial lncRNAs associated with adipocyte differentiation from human adipose-derived stem cells based on co-expression and ceRNA network analyses.</a></h2><p>Injection of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) is a promising treatment for facial contour deformities. However, its treatment mechanisms remain largely unknown. The study aimed to explain the molecular mechanisms of adipogenic differentiation from ASCs based on the roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).Datasets of mRNA-lncRNA (GSE113253) and miRNA (GSE72429) expression profiling were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs), lncRNAs (DELs) and miRNAs (DEMs) between undifferentiated and adipocyte differentiated human ASCs were identified using the Linear Models for Microarray Data method. DELs related co-expression and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to screen crucial target genes.A total of 748 DEGs, 17 DELs and 51 DEMs were identified. A total of 13 DELs and 279 DEGs with Pearson correlation coefficients > 0.9 and -value < 0.01 were selected to construct the co-expression network. A total of 151 interaction pairs among 112 nodes (10 DEMs; eight DELs; 94 DEGs) were obtained to construct the ceRNA network. By comparing the lncRNAs and mRNAs in two networks, five lncRNAs (SNHG9, LINC02202, UBAC2-AS1, PTCSC3 and myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT)) and 32 genes (i.e., such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type  (PTPRB)) were found to be shared. PPI analysis demonstrated PIK3R1 , forkhead box O1 (FOXO1; a transcription factor) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) were hub genes, which could be regulated by the miRNAs that interacted with the above five lncRNAs, such as LINC02202-miR-136-5p-PIK3R1, LINC02202-miR-381-3p-FOXO1 and MIAT-miR-18a-5p-ESR1. LINC02202 also could directly co-express with PIK3R1. Furthermore, PTPRB was predicted to be modulated by co-expression with LINC01119.MIAT, LINC02202 and LINC01119 may be potentially important, new lncRNAs associated with adipogenic differentiation of ASCs.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of oregonin on the epigenetic regulation in cells as well as its ability to modulate DNA methylating enzymes expression and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies. Our results show that oregonin altered the expression of DNA methyltransferases and mtDNA copy numbers in dependency on concentration and specificity of cells genotype. A close correlation between mtDNA copy numbers and mRNA expression of the mtDnmt1 and Dnmt3b was established. Moreover, molecular modeling suggested that oregonin fits the catalytic site of DNMT1 and partially overlaps with binding of the cofactor. These findings further extend the knowledge on oregonin, and elucidate for the first time its potential to affect the key players of the DNA methylation process, namely DNMTs transcripts and mtDNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30198336>Adipoinductive effect of extracellular matrix involves cytoskeleton changes and SIRT1 activity in adipose tissue stem/stromal cells.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) homeostasis and expansion are dependent on complex crosstalk between resident adipose stromal/stem cells (ASCs) and AT extracellular matrix (ECM). Although adipose tissue ECM (atECM) is one of the key players in the stem cell niche, data on bidirectional interaction of ASCs and atECM are still scarce. Here, we investigated how atECM guides ASCs' differentiation. atECM altered shape and cytoskeleton organization of ASCs without changing their proliferation, β-galactosidase activity and adhesion. Cytoskeleton modifications occurred due to fostered parallel organization of F-actin and elevated expression of Vimentin in ASCs. After seven-day cultivation, atECM impaired osteogenesis of ASCs, simultaneously decreasing expression of Runx2. In addition, atECM accelerated early  concomitantly with altered Vimentin organization in ASCs, slightly increasing PPARγ, while elevated Adiponectin and Vimentin mRNA expression. Early  triggered by atECM was followed by upregulated mitochondrial activity and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression in ASCs. Proadipogenic events induced by atECM were mediated by SIRT1, indicating the supportive role of atECM in -related metabolic state of ASCs. These results provide a closer look at the effects of atECM on ASC physiology and may support the advancement of engineering design in soft tissue reconstruction and fundamental research of AT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29723075>Orlistat as a FASN inhibitor and multitargeted agent for cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells have increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis.

As fatty acid synthase (FASN) plays a pivotal role in this process, it is an attractive target for cancer therapy.This is a review of the lipogenic phenotype of cancer and how this phenomenon can be exploited for cancer therapy using inhibitors of FASN, with particular emphasis on orlistat as a repurposing drug.Disease stabilization only has been observed with a highly selective FASN inhibitor used as a single agent in clinical trials. It is too early to say whether the absence of tumor responses other than stabilization results because even full inhibition of FASN is not enough to elicit antitumor responses. The FASN inhibitor orlistat is a 'dirty' drug with target-off actions upon at least seven targets with a proven role in tumor biology.

The present study was to investigate the effect of Asiatic acid from Potentilla chinensis (AAPC) on liver cell lipid metabolism, exploring the underlying mechanism of AAPC against NAFLD. In vivo, the animal NAFLD model was induced by feeding rats with high fat diet (HFD) for 18 weeks, and meanwhile the rats were treated with AAPC from weeks 8 to 18; In vitro experiment, the effect of AAPC on dyslipidemia induced by oleic acid (OA) in hepatic cells (HepG2) was evaluated. The results showed that AAPC significantly decreased lipidosis in rats and in HepG2 cells; it notably alleviated hepatocyte damage and lipid disturbance in rats. Moreover, the cell experiments showed that AAPC strongly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation. It markedly decreased hepatocyte  by regulating the key lipid metabolism-related factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), encoding carboxylase, liver X Receptor Rα (LXRα), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The further study elucidated that AAPC treatment significantly alleviated inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, AAPC significantly alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis and lipid metabolism disorder through reducing the extent of ERS. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that AAPC significantly ameliorates NAFLD by inhibiting the ERS pathway and lipid deposition, which may be a potential natural medicine for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

We decipher the impact of short-chain CAD (SCAD) on adiposity and insulin resistance. BALB/cBy strain mice derived from BALB/c strain are deficient in SCAD activity because of a spontaneous deletion in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases () gene. Adiposity, , and insulin sensitivity were compared in BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice subjected to high-fat diets (HFDs). A whole hepatic transcriptome profiling experiment with microarrays was performed to evaluate the mechanisms by which SCAD deficiency protects against insulin resistance. -deficient mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance as compared with control mice. Reduced obesity results from decreased triglyceride content due to activation of AMPK in liver that would reduce hepatic content of malonyl-CoA, resulting in decreased hepatic  . Improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced diacylglycerol content commensurate with reduced PKC-ε activity and increased protein kinase  (AKT) activation in liver and skeletal muscle. Additionally, -deficient mice displayed significantly higher expression of the endoplasmic chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, which was further associated with the AKT activation in the primary hepatocytes.

Identifying the critical players in this process might be crucial for the generation of novel and effective anti-neoplastic therapies. In the present investigation, we determined the importance of carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), a central player in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in the liver, on the development of HCC in in vitro and in vivo models. We found that genetic deletion of ChREBP (that will be referred to as ChREBPKO mice) strongly delays or impairs hepatocarcinogenesis driven by AKT or AKT/c-Met overexpression in mice, respectively. In contrast, HCC development was found to be completely unaffected by ChREBP depletion in mice co-expressing AKT and N-Ras protooncogenes. In mouse and human HCC cell lines, suppression of ChREBP via specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) resulted in decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Of note, these cellular events were strongly augmented by concomitant inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The present data indicate that ChREBP activity might be required or dispensable for HCC growth, depending on the oncogenes involved. In particular, the activation of Ras/MAPK signaling might represent a possible mechanism of resistance to ChREBP depletion in this tumor type. Additional studies are needed to unravel the molecular mechanisms rendering HCC cells insensitive to ChREBP suppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569751>High Energy Intake Induced Overexpression of Transcription Factors and Its Regulatory Genes Involved in Acceleration of Hepatic : A Rat Model for Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by impaired insulin action and its secretion. The objectives of the present study were to establish an economical and efficient animal model, mimicking pathophysiology of human T2DM to understand probable molecular mechanisms in context with lipid metabolism. In the present study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Animals were fed with high fat diet (HFD) except healthy control (HC) for 12 weeks. After eight weeks, intra peritoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. After confirmation of glucose intolerance, diabetic control (DC) group was injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg .w., i.p.). HFD fed rats showed increase ( ≤ 0.001) in glucose tolerance and HOMA-IR as compared to HC. Diabetes rats showed abnormal ( ≤ 0.001) lipid profile as compared to HC. The hepatocyte expression of transcription factors  and  and their target genes were found to be upregulated, while  and  expressions were downregulated as compared to the HC.

Recent studies have indicated that AEBP1 might function as a candidate oncogene and is overexpressed in several human malignancies. However, the role of AEBP1 in gastric cancer (GC) remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern, prognostic significance and biological function of AEBP1 in human gastric cancer and to explore the underlying mechanism. We found that both the mRNA and protein levels of AEBP1 were significantly increased in human GC tissues. Elevated AEBP1 expression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival in patients with both early-stage (Tumor, Node, Metastases (TNM) TNM I and II) and late-stage (TNM III and IV) GC.

The role and underlying mechanism of chemerin in developing IR of the granulosa cells from PCOS remain unclear. Plasma, follicular fluid, and human granulosa-lutein cells (hGLs) were collected from non-PCOS and patients with PCOS with or without IR. The chemerin levels were elevated in both follicular fluid and hGL samples from patients with PCOS with IR, and the hGLs from patients with PCOS with IR showed decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose uptake capacity. Moreover, treatment of chemerin attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by decreasing phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 Tyr612, phosphorylation of protein kinase  Ser473, and membrane translocation of glucose transporter type 4 through increasing Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS1 in cultured hGLs. These effects could be abolished by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of chemokine-like receptor 1. Furthermore, insulin induced the expression of chemerin in hGLs. Our findings demonstrate a novel role of chemerin in the metabolic dysfunction of PCOS, which suggested that chemerin and its receptor can be further implicated as potential therapeutic targets in the future treatment of PCOS.-Li, X., Zhu, Q., Wang, W., Qi, J., He, Y., Wang, Y., Lu, Y., Wu, H., Ding, Y., Sun, Y.

Here, we demonstrate that TACI-deficient mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) are protected from weight gain and dysregulated glucose homeostasis. Resistance to HFD-induced metabolic changes in TACI-deficient mice does not involve TACI-mediated . Instead, accumulation of M2 macrophages (Mϕs), eosinophils, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is implicated in the protection from obesity-induced assaults. In support of this hypothesis, adoptively transferred TACI-deficient peritoneal or adipose tissue Mϕs, but not  cells, can improve glucose metabolism in the obese host. Interestingly, the transferred TACI-deficient Mϕs not only home to host VAT but also trigger the accumulation of host M2 Mϕs and eosinophils in VAT. The increase in host M2 Mϕs in VAT is likely a result of eosinophil recruitment in response to eotaxin-2 produced by TACI-deficient Mϕs. Insulin signaling experiments revealed that IL-10 secreted by TACI-deficient Mϕs is responsible for maintaining adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Thus, the adoptive transfer experiments offer a model where TACI-deficient Mϕs accumulate in VAT and protect against metaflammation and obesity-associated dysregulation of glucose metabolism.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551508>Hydroxytyrosol supplementation ameliorates the metabolic disturbances in white adipose tissue from mice fed a high-fat diet through recovery of transcription factors Nrf2, SREBP-1c, PPAR-γ and NF-κ.</a></h2><p>White adipose tissue (WAT) have a relevant metabolic and inflammatory function, in overweight or obesity conditions. In this regard, the WAT under over feeding nutrition present a significant increment in oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory status and depletion of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid.

In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of GN against ethanol-induced liver injury using in vivo and in vitro experiments. Histopathological examination revealed that GN administration to chronic-binge ethanol exposure mice significantly reduced ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis through reducing  gene expression and increasing fatty acid oxidation gene expression, and prevented liver injury by lowering the serum levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Further, it significantly inhibited cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) gene expression and enzyme activity, and enhanced antioxidant genes and glutathione level in hepatic tissues, which led to decreased hepatic malondialdehyde levels. It also lowered inflammation gene expression. Finally, GN administration promoted hepatic sirtuin1 (SIRT1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in ethanol-fed mice. Consistent with in vivo data, treatment with GN decreased  gene expression and increased fatty acid oxidation gene expression in ethanol-treated HepG2 cells, thereby preventing ethanol-induced triglyceride accumulation. Furthermore, it inhibited reactive oxygen species generation by downregulating CYP2E1 and upregulating antioxidant gene expression, and suppressed inflammatory gene expression. Moreover, GN prevented ethanol-mediated reduction in SIRT1 and phosphorylated AMPK. These findings indicate that GN has therapeutic potential against alcoholic liver disease through inhibiting hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569380>Curcumin Attenuates  by Inducing Preadipocyte Apoptosis and Inhibiting Adipocyte Differentiation.</a></h2><p>Patients with metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The principal risk factor for development of metabolic syndrome is obesity, defined as a state of pathological hyperplasia or/and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on  and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Adipogenic differentiation was identified using Oil-Red O staining, and levels of peroxisome proliferator activator γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) α/β were determined by Western blot analyses. Antioxidant activity was measured using an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE).Treatment with curcumin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in IL-1β-induced synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Decrease in lipid droplets and expression of PPARγ and c/EBPα/β were noted in fibroblasts treated with curcumin during adipose differentiation. CSE- or H2O2-induced ROS synthesis was significantly lower in curcumin-treated fibroblasts in comparison with the control.

MicroRNA (miRNA) is an endogenous non-coding RNA that can play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of mammalian preadipocyte differentiation. Previously, we identified that bta-miR-130a regulates milk fat biosynthesis by targeting PPARG mRNA. However, the role of miR-130 in the regulation of bovine adipocyte differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we found that overexpression of bta-miR-130a/ led to significantly decreased cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) levels during  process as well as reduced lipid droplet formation. In contrast, the inhibition of bta-miR-130a/ resulted in larger lipid droplets and TAG accumulation. In addition, overexpression of bta-miR-130a/ inhibited the expression of adipocyte differentiation-related genes, including PPARG, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, FABP4, LPIN1, and LPL. Western blot analysis verified qPCR results on the expression of PPARG and CYP2U1. A luciferase reporter assay further verified bta-miR-130a/ significantly affects PPARG and CYP2U1 expression by directly binding to their 3'-untranslated regions (UTR). We conducted in vitro rescue assay to confirm that bta-miR-130a/ affect bovine adipocyte differentiation by targeting PPARG and CYP2U1. This study shows that bta-miR-130a and bta-miR-130b play similar roles in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation in beef muscles by targeting the 3'UTR of PPARG and CYP2U1.

In this study, the TNF family member cytokine lymphotoxin-like inducible protein that competes with glycoprotein D for herpesvirus entry on T cells (LIGHT), also known as TNF super family protein 14 (TNFSF14), can inhibit adipose precursor differentiation into beige adipocytes. In acute cold stress, LIGHT deficiency in mice accelerated browning in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). Further experiments showed that LIGHT interacting with lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) on adipose precursors blocked beige fat biogenesis. LTβR signals attenuated the JNK pathway, which contributed to their antibeiging effect. Blocking JNK activation using a small molecular inhibitor prevented cold-induced scWAT beiging. Furthermore, LIGHT/LTβR signals acted as an attenuator of white . LIGHT deficiency in mice promoted obesity during high-fat diet feeding. These findings identify the LIGHT axis as a regulator of adipose tissue homeostasis and suggest that LIGHT signaling functions as a mechanism to divert energy in favor of immune activation.-Kou, Y., Liu, Q., Liu, W., Sun, H., Liang, M., Kong, F., Zhang, ., Wei, Y., Liu, Z., Wang, Y.

In vivo, obese SD rats induced by high fat diet (HFD) were randomly divided into three groups treated with oral gavage: (a) normal control diet with distilled water, () HFD with distilled water, (c) HFD with 800 mg LFBE/kg body weight (bw).In vitro, LFBE and the PC in the extraction significantly inhibited  and potentiated browning of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, rather than RBE. In vivo, we observed remarkable decreases in the body weight, serum lipid levels, white adipose tissue (WAT) weights and cell sizes of brown adipose tissues (BAT) in the LFBE group after 10 weeks. LFBE group could gain more mass of interscapular BAT (IBAT) and promote the dehydrogenase activity in the mitochondria.

However, effective agents for the prevention or treatment of obesity remain limited. This study investigated the anti-obesity effect and mechanism of chitosan oligosaccharide capsules (COSCs) on rats suffering from obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). After the eight-week administration of COSCs on obese rats, the body weight gain, fat/body ratio, and related biochemical indices were measured. The hepatic expressions of the leptin signal pathway (JAK2-STAT3) and gene expressions of -related targets were also determined. Our data showed that COSCs can regulate body weight gain, lipids, serum alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, as well as upregulate the hepatic leptin receptor- (LepRb) and the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Meanwhile, marked increased expressions of liver sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, adiponectin, adipose peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein α, adipose differentiation-related protein, and SREBP-1c were observed. The results suggested that COSCs activate the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway to alleviate leptin resistance and suppress  to reduce lipid accumulation.

With the current study we aimed to verify the modulatory effect of endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)-signaling on perilipin 2 (PLIN2)-mediated lipophagy. Here, we demonstrate that a global knockout of the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CB1) reduced the expression of the lipid droplet binding protein PLIN2 in the livers of CB1 and hepatitis  surface protein (HBs)-transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. In addition, the pharmacologic activation and antagonization of CB1 in cell culture also caused an induction or reduction of PLIN2, respectively. The decreased PLIN2 expression was associated with suppressed  and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and enhanced autophagy as shown by increased colocalization of LC3B with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in HBs/CB1 mice. The induction of autophagy was further supported by the increased expression of LAMP1 in CB1 and HBs/CB1 mice. LAMP1 and PLIN2 were co-localized in HBs/CB1 indicating autophagy of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) i.e., lipophagy. Lipolysis of lipid droplets was additionally indicated by elevated expression of lysosomal acid lipase. In conclusion, these results suggest that loss of CB1 signaling leads to reduced PLIN2 abundance, which triggers lipophagy. Our new findings about the association between CB1 signaling and PLIN2 may stimulate translational studies analyzing new diagnostic and therapeutic options for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017523>Citrus peel flavonoids improve lipid metabolism by inhibiting miR-33 and miR-122 expression in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Citrus plants are rich in flavonoids and beneficial for lipid metabolism. However, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Both citrus peel flavonoid extracts (CPFE) and a mixture of their primary flavonoid compounds, namely, nobiletin, tangeretin and hesperidin, citrus flavonoid purity mixture (CFPM), were found to have lipid-lowering effects on oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α) gene was markedly increased, while the fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene was significantly decreased by both CPFE and CFPM in oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells. Flavonoid compounds from citrus peel suppressed miR-122 and miR-33 expression, which were induced by oleic acid. Changes in miR-122 and miR-33 expression, which subsequently affect the expression of their target mRNAs FAS and CPT1α, are most likely the principal mechanisms leading to decreased lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.

Insufficient intramuscular (IM) fat and excessive subcutaneous (SC) fat are paramount pork quality challenges. IM fat and SC fat, which are modulated by the  of IM and SC adipocytes, play key roles in pork quality. Galectin-12 (LGALS12) was proven to be an important regulator of fat deposition in porcine. However, the current knowledge of the transcriptome-wide role of LGALS12 in adipocytes is still limited. This study was aimed to discover the different regulatory mechanisms of LGALS12 in porcine IM and SC adipocyte.The siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of LGALS12 identified 1075 and 3016 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IM and SC adipocytes, respectively. Among these, 585 were up- and 490 were downregulated in the IM adipocytes, while 2186 were up- and 830 were downregulated in the SC adipocytes. Moreover, 418 DGEs were observed only in the IM adipocytes, 2359 DGEs only in the SC adipocytes, and 657 DGEs in both types of adipocytes. According to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, DEGs in both IM and SC adipocytes were mainly enriched in categories related to lipids or fat cell differentiation. Pathway analysis of the DEGs revealed 88 changed signaling pathways in the IM adipocytes and 86 in the SC adipocytes. The signaling pathways present in only one type of adipocyte were identified from among the top 50 signaling pathways in each type of adipocyte. Four signaling pathways, encompassing PI3K-AKT, cardiac muscle contraction, fatty acid metabolism and Ras, were significantly enriched in the IM adipocytes. On the other hand, four different signaling pathways, encompassing TNF, WNT, cGMP-PKG and NF-kappa , were greatly enriched in the SC ones. The pathway changes were confirmed by chemical inhibition assays.Our data reveals that LGALS12 knockdown alters the expression of numerous genes involved in key biological processes in the development of adipocytes. These observations provide a global view of the role of LGALS12 in porcine IM and SC adipocytes; thus, improving our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which this gene acts in fat development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109090>Alterations of Fatty Acid Profile May Contribute to Dyslipidemia in Chronic Kidney Disease by Influencing Hepatocyte Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia. Our aim was firstly to investigate patterns of fatty acids (FA) composition through various stages of CKD, and secondly, to evaluate the effect of CKD-specific FA disturbances on the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism at a cellular level. Serum FA composition was analyzed in 191 patients with consecutive severity stages of CKD, and 30 healthy controls free from CKD. Next, HepG2 human hepatic cells were treated with major representatives of various FA groups, as well as with FA extracted from a mix of serums of controls and of CKD stage 5 patients. Across worsening stages of CKD severity, there was an increasing monounsaturated FA (MUFA) content. It was associated with a concomitant decrease in n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated FA. The incubation of hepatocytes with FA from CKD patients (compared to that of healthy subjects), resulted in significantly higher mRNA levels of genes involved in FA synthesis (fatty acid synthase () increased 13.7 ± 3.5 times, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 () increased 4.26 ± 0.36 times), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) formation (apolipoprotein  ) increased 7.35 ± 1.5 times, microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein () increased 2.74 ± 0.43 times).

Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with relevant predictive values, SNPs in the  gene were associated with decreased risk of BC during SERM therapy, and SNPs in the  gene with an increased risk. ZNF423, which was not previously associated with BC is a multifunctional transcription factor known to have a role in development, neurogenesis, and  and is implicated in other types of cancer. ZNF423 is transcriptionally controlled by the homolog ZNF521, early  cell factor transcription factor, epigenetic silencing of the promoter by CpG island hyper-methylation, and also by ZNF423 itself in an auto-regulatory loop.

Fourteen cows were randomly assigned to either a high-energy (OVE; net energy for lactation = 1.60 Mcal/kg of dry matter; n = 7) or control (CON; net energy for lactation = 1.30 Mcal/kg of dry matter; n = 7) diet for 6 wk. Immediately after slaughter, liver, kidneys, and mammary gland were separated and weighed. The adipose tissue mass in the omental, mesenteric, and perirenal depots was dissected and weighed. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected from the tail-head region and was used as follows: control, bovine insulin (INS) at 1 µmol/L, tumor necrosis factor-α at 5 ng/mL (TNF), and their combination. Despite a lack of difference in final body condition score, OVE cows had greater energy intake and were heavier than CON cows. Furthermore, overfeeding led to greater mass of mesenteric and perirenal adipose, liver, and mammary gland. Overall, SAT incubated with INS had an upregulation of insulin receptor (INSR), interleukin-10 (IL10), small ubiquitin-like modifier 3 (SUMO3), and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2I (UBC9), whereas TNF upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), interleukin-6 (IL6), nuclear factor kappa  subunit 1 (NFKB1), small ubiquitin-like modifier 2 (SUMO2), and UBC9. Regardless of in vitro treatment, feeding OVE upregulated PPARG, fatty acid synthase (FASN), and insulin induced gene 1 (INSIG1). Abundance of PPARG was greater in SAT of OVE cows cultured individually with INS and TNF. The interaction between diet and in vitro treatment revealed that sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) had greater abundance in SAT from the CON group in response to culture with INS, whereas SAT from OVE cows had greater SREBF1 abundance in response to culture with TNF. The mRNA abundance of IL6 and NFKB1 was greater in response to TNF treatment and overall in CON cows. Furthermore, SAT from these cows had greater IL10 abundance when cultured with INS and TNF. Overall, data highlighted that overfeeding energy increases adipose tissue mass in part by stimulating transcription of key genes associated with insulin signaling, , and . Because SAT thickness or mass was not measured, the lack of effect of overfeeding on body condition score limits its use to predict overall body lipid storage. An overt inflammatory response in SAT after a 6-wk period of over-consumption of energy could not be discerned.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, currently available anti-obesity drugs have failed in the long-term maintenance of weight control. It has been a challenge to design novel drugs that could potentially treat obesity or prevent uncontrolled weight-gain which lies underneath the pathology of obesity. Since obesity in a way is a consequence of the accumulating new mature adipocytes from undifferentiated precursors which is a process also termed as , drugs that might control  could be beneficial for the treatment of obesity. In the current study, combined effect of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate (NaB) and pluronic F68 on adipogenic differentiation was examined by administering various combinations of the two agents to human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) in in vitro. Immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to evaluate the levels of -promoting genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), fatty acid binding protein (FABP4), and adiponectin. Results indicated that expressions of all these three genes were restrained. Furthermore, Oil Red O staining revealed that lipid vesicle formation was reduced in hADSCs treated with differentiation medium containing NaB/F68 combination. Finally, expression levels of Hippo pathway kinases Lats2, MST1, and scaffold protein Sav1 were reduced in these cells, suggesting a possible link between Hippo pathway-dependent downregulation of PPARγ and the NaB/F68 treatment. Herein, we showed that combination of NaB and F68 curtails adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting the adipogenic transcriptional program leading to a decrease in lipid accumulation in adipocytes even at very low doses, thereby uncovered a striking opportunity to use this combination in obesity treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29928446>Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of fatty acid synthase attenuates the proliferation and metastasis of human gastric cancer cells via the mTOR/Gli1 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid synthase (FASN), the main enzyme involved in  , is overexpressed in several types of tumor tissues. In addition, it is associated with tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a poor prognosis. However, the precise functions and internal mechanisms of FASN with regard to the proliferation, metastasis and EMT in gastric cancer (GC) cells remain elusive. The present study investigated FASN protein expression in 18 randomly selected pairs of GC tumors and matched normal tissues by western blot analysis. FASN-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was then transfected into SGC-7901 cells to examine the effect of FASN on proliferation and migration . Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of FASN, EMT-related markers and key signaling molecules of the mechanistic target of rapamycin/zinc finger protein GLI1 (mTOR/Gli1) pathway. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to detect the mRNA expression of FASN and EMT-related markers. The FASN level was higher in the GC tissues compared with that in the surrounding normal tissues. Knockdown of FASN suppressed GC cell proliferation and metastasis .

The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which Sal  regulates osteogenesis and . We used MC3T3-E1 and 3T3-L1 as the study model to explore the changes of cell differentiation induced by Sal . The results indicated that Sal  at different concentrations had no obvious toxicity effects on cell proliferation during differentiation. Furthermore, Sal  facilitated osteogenesis but inhibited  by increasing the expression of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Accordingly, TAZ knock-down offset the effects of Sal  on cell differentiation into osteoblasts or adipocytes. Notably, the Sal  induced up-expression of TAZ was blocked by U0126 (the MEK-ERK inhibitor), rather than LY294002 (the PI3K-Akt inhibitor). Moreover, Sal  increased the p-ERK/ERK ratio to regulate the TAZ expression as well as the cell differentiation. In summary, this study suggests for the first time that Sal  targets TAZ to facilitate osteogenesis and reduce  by activating MEK-ERK signalling pathway, which provides evidence for Sal  to be used as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of bone diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

We have previously found that the cell surface receptor CD24 regulates  as measured by lipid accumulation and gene expression in mature adipocytes. How CD24 regulates these processes remains unknown. To begin answering this question, we first determined that CD24 does not affect glucose uptake in differentiating adipocytes in vitro. We then examined changes in global gene expression via DNA microarray in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with siRNA-mediated knock-down of CD24 expression. We found that CD24 expression is necessary for upregulation of up to 134 genes. We validated the CD24-mediated regulation of 4 of these genes during in vitro  of 3T3-L1 and primary cells isolated from the inguinal white adipose tissue depots of CD24 knockout mice. Surprisingly, we found that only 1 of these genes was also regulated by CD24 in cells from the epididymal depot. Overall, these data suggest that CD24 is necessary for select gene expression in a depot-specific manner during  in vitro. These findings could help elucidate the mechanisms regulating lipid accumulation in adipocytes thereby aiding in the development of novel treatment strategies for obesity and lipodystophy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427606>Mechanism of Interleukin-4 Reducing Lipid Deposit by Regulating Hormone-Sensitive Lipase.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation participates in the pathophysiological progress from insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic abnormalities, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our previous study reveals that interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibits  and promotes lipolysis to decrease lipid deposits by enhancing the activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). The present study further dissects and characterizes the molecular mechanism of IL-4 in regulating HSL expression and lipolytic activity in the terminal differentiated 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes. Our results showed that IL-4 increased cAMP which then enhanced PKA activity and subsequent phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin. The phosphorylated HSL (p-HSL) translocated from cytoplasm to the surface of lipid droplets and exhibited lipolytic function. After being phosphorylated, p-perilipin also facilitated lipolysis through interacting with p-HSL. The in vitro findings were further verified by in vivo study in which IL-4 exhibited pro-lipolytic activity and enhanced HSL activity. In summary, the net outcome of IL-4 treatment is to reduce lipid storage by promoting lipolysis through enhancing HSL activity via cAMP/PKA pathway, the major route leading to lipolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709906>Dibenzoylmethane Suppresses Lipid Accumulation and Reactive Oxygen Species Production through Regulation of Nuclear Factor (Erythroid-Derived 2)-Like 2 and Insulin Signaling in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dibenzoylmethane (1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione, DBM) from licorice roots on lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in 3T3-L1 cells. DBM effectively inhibited lipid accumulation during , and its inhibitory effect was shown to be due to the down-regulation of adipogenic factors such as CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). DBM was observed to exert its inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation in the early adipogenic stage (days 0-2) by regulating early adipogenic factors including CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) and Krueppel-like factor (KLF) 2. DBM significantly increased the translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2(Nrf2) into the nucleus, promoting the protein expression of its target gene, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). DBM significantly suppressed the insulin-mediated activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase  (Akt), which are components of insulin signaling. In addition, intracellular ROS production was effectively reduced by DBM treatment, which upregulated antioxidant genes such as glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, DBM significantly regulated the expression of the adipokines, resistin and adiponectin. This DBM-mediated regulation of lipid accumulation, ROS production, and adipokine production was shown to be involved in the regulation of the Nrf2 and insulin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29898623>Depletion of Sirt3 leads to the impairment of adipogenic differentiation and insulin resistance via interfering mitochondrial function of adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Upregulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism is a hallmark in the differentiation of stem cells. However, the mechanism underlying the metabolic reprogramming and upregulation of mitochondrial function during the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is largely unclear. Sirt3 has emerged as a sensor in regulating mitochondrial function and antioxidant defence system in cellular response to energy demand or environmental stimuli, but its roles in stem cell differentiation have not been fully understood. In this study, we used adipose-derived hMSCs (ad-hMSCs) to investigate the role of Sirt3 in adipogenic differentiation and in the function of mature adipocytes. We showed that at the early stage of adipogenic differentiation, Sirt3 upregulation is essential for the activation of biogenesis and bioenergetic function of mitochondria. In addition, we found that induction of Forkhead Box O 3a (FoxO3a), an upstream factor that regulates MnSOD gene transcription, is involved in the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes at the early stage of adipogenic differentiation. Silencing of Sirt3 by shRNA decreased the protein level of FoxO3a and subsequently downregulated a number of FoxO3a-mediated antioxidant enzymes and increased oxidative stress in ad-hMSCs after adipogenic induction. Importantly, depletion of Sirt3 compromised the ability of ad-hMSCs to undergo adipogenic differentiation and led to adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance. These findings suggest that Sirt3-mediated protein deacetylation plays an important role in regulating oxidative metabolism and antioxidant defence in stem cell differentiation, and that Sirt3 deficiency may be related to insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444955>Punicalagin, a Pomegranate-Derived Ellagitannin, Suppresses Obesity and Obesity-Induced Inflammatory Responses Via the Nrf2/Keap1 Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Punicalagin (PCG) is one of the most abundant phytochemicals found in pomegranates. The effects and mechanistic action of PCG on obesity and obesity-induced inflammatory and oxidant responses are investigated in vitro and in vivo.The effect of PCG on  is examined using Oil red O staining. The effects and mechanism of action of PCG on inflammatory responses are determined in adipocyte-conditioned medium (ACM)-cultured macrophages, a cell-to-cell contact system, and a transwell system. The effects of PCG on obesity and obesity-induced inflammatory/oxidant responses are examined in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. PCG effectively suppresses lipid accumulation in adipocytes and adipocyte-induced inflammatory responses in adipocyte-macrophage co-culture systems. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection indicates that the PCG-mediated anti-inflammatory effect is exerted via the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(Nrf2/Keap1) pathway. PCG administration results in a significant reduction in body and white adipose tissue (WAT) weights. PCG favorably regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, downregulating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis demonstrates that PCG differentially modulates the distribution of complement component 3 receptor 4 subunit (CD11c) and cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206). PCG regulates the level of antioxidant and oxidant molecules by activating Nrf2/Keap1 signaling.PCG ameliorates obesity and obesity-induced inflammatory responses via activation of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling, suggesting that PCG has potential as an oral agent to control obesity-mediated diseases.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Obesity contributes to diabetes, with a strong causal relationship existing between diabetes and insulin resistance, especially in patients with Diabetes mellitus II. Adipocytes emerge as key constituents of adipose tissue physiology. In their pre-mature form to mature state transformation, adipocytes fully exemplify one of the key adipogenic actions of insulin. Poised to a) gain insight into  leading to antidiabetic factors, and ) investigate  through careful examination of insulin contributions to interwoven mechanistic pathways, a systematic comparative study was launched involving well-defined metal-citrates (zinc and vanadium), the chemical reactivity of which was in line with their chemistry under physiological conditions. Selection of the specific compounds was based on their common aqueous coordination chemistry involving the physiological chelator citric acid. Cellular maturation of pre-adipocytes to their mature form was pursued in the presence-absence of insulin and employment of closely linked genetic targets, key to adipocyte maturation (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), Glucose transporter 1,3,4 (GLUT 1,3,4), Adiponectin (ADIPOQ), Glucokinase (GCK), and Insulin receptor (INS-R)). The results show a) distinct adipogenic biological profiles for the metalloforms involved in a dose-, time- and nature-dependent manner, and ) metal ion-specific adipogenic response-signals at the same or higher level than insulin toward all selected targets.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on proliferating, differentiating and maturating human visceral pre/adipocytes (HPA-v). Three stages of cell culture were conducted under constant or variable glycemic conditions.  progress was assessed using BODIPY 505/515 staining. Lipid content typical for normal and hyperglycemic conditions of adipocytes was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy and imaging. Expression of adipogenic markers, PPARγ and C/EBPα, was determined at the mRNA and protein levels. We also examined expression of miRNAs proven to target PPARγ (miR-34a-5p) and C/EBPα (miR-137-3p), employing TaqMan Low-Density Arrays (TLDA) cards. Hyperglycemia altered morphology of differentiating HPA-v in relation to normoglycemia by accelerating the formation of lipid droplets and making their numbers and volume increase. Raman results confirmed that the qualitative and quantitative lipid composition under normal and hyperglycemic conditions were different, and that the number of lipid droplets increased in (HG)-treated cells. Expression profiles of both examined genes markedly changed either during  under physiological and hyperglycemic conditions, orat particular stages of  upon chronic and/or variable glycemia. Expression levels of PPARγ seemed to correspond to some expression changes of miR-34a-5p. miR-137-3p, whose expression was rather stable throughout the culture, did not seem to affect C/EBPα. Our observations revealed that chronic and intermittent hyperglycemia change the morphology of visceral pre/adipocytes during . Moreover, hyperglycemia may utilize miR-34a-5p to induce some expression changes in PPARγ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384531>Ablation of gut microbiota alleviates obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance by modulating bile acid metabolism in hamsters.</a></h2><p>Since metabolic process differs between humans and mice, studies were performed in hamsters, which are generally considered to be a more appropriate animal model for studies of obesity-related metabolic disorders. The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic  and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily  member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile acid profile with increased tauro--muricholic acid (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver. This study is of potential translational significance in determining the role of gut microbiota-mediated bile acid metabolism in modulating diet-induced glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in the hamster.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018763>Profiling and characterization of miRNAs associated with intramuscular fat content in Yorkshire pigs.</a></h2><p>miRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to complementary regions of the target mRNA. The miRNAs associated with the deposition of intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pigs, which is an important meat quality trait, still remain to be investigated. In this study, the longissimus dorsi muscles (LDMs) from 234 individuals were collected from Yorkshire pigs at 90 kg body weight and the miRNA deep sequencing was conducted by using two tailed groups which were taken five individuals each from high (2.94 ± 0.04%) and low (1.62 ± 0.02%) IMF samples. The results showed that total 268 mature miRNAs were identified, of which 70 were previously known, 162 were conserved among species and 36 were identified specifically in pigs. Moreover, 28 miRNAs involved in  were differentially expressed in the two groups, and five out of 16 miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using stem loop primers. Our results may serve as a fundamental basis for understanding the roles of miRNA in IMF development in pigs.

A hallmark of both disorders is hepatic lipid accumulation, derived in part from increased de novo . Despite the popularity of high-protein diets for weight loss, the effect of dietary protein on de novo  is poorly studied. We aimed to characterize the effect of dietary protein on de novo lipid synthesis.METHODSWe use a 3-way crossover interventional study in healthy males to determine the effect of high-protein feeding on de novo , combined with in vitro models to determine the lipogenic effects of specific amino acids. The primary outcome was a change in de novo -associated triglycerides in response to protein feeding.RESULTSWe demonstrate that high-protein feeding, rich in glutamate, increases de novo -associated triglycerides in plasma (1.5-fold compared with control; P < 0.0001) and liver-derived very low-density lipoprotein particles (1.8-fold; P < 0.0001) in samples from human subjects (n = 9 per group). In hepatocytes, we show that glutamate-derived carbon is incorporated into triglycerides via palmitate. In addition, supplementation with glutamate, glutamine, and leucine, but not lysine, increased triglyceride synthesis and decreased glucose uptake. Glutamate, glutamine, and leucine increased activation of protein kinase , suggesting that induction of de novo  occurs via the insulin signaling cascade.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide mechanistic insight into how select amino acids induce de novo  and insulin resistance, suggesting that high-protein feeding to tackle diabetes and obesity requires greater consideration.FUNDINGThe research was supported by UK Medical Research Council grants MR/P011705/1, MC_UP_A090_1006 and MR/P01836X/1.

Here we showed that ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme converting citrate to acetyl-CoA, is highly induced in the kidney of overweight or obese patients with CKD and ob/ob BTBR mice. ACL induction is associated with increased ectopic lipid accumulation (ELA), glomerulosclerosis, and albuminuria. Acetyl-CoA is the substrate for   as well as for histone acetylation. By raising acetyl-CoA concentration ACL promotes H3K9/14 and H3K27 hyperacetylation leading to up-regulation of several rate-limiting lipogenic enzymes and fibrogenic factors. On the other hand, the excess acetyl-CoA generated as a result of ACL induction provides the substrate for these lipogenic enzymes to drive   leading to ELA, a detrimental event toward renal injury. In mesangial cells, ACL is synergistically induced by high glucose, palmitate, and TNF-α  NF-κ and PKA pathways. Under these conditions, H3K9/14 and H3K27 hyperacetylation, as well as the induction of the lipogenic and fibrogenic proteins, are completely blocked in the presence of an ACL inhibitor. Collectively, these data suggest that ACL is an epigenetic regulator that promotes renal ELA and fibrogenesis leading to renal injury in obesity.-Chen, Y., Deb, D.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased   and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

It possesses a wide range of medicinal properties suggesting its potential clinical utility that requires further investigation. The present review intends to highlight the efficacy of kaempferol and its molecular mechanisms of action in regulating bone metabolism. Many reports have acknowledged the bone-protecting property of kaempferol and kaempferol-containing plants using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Kaempferol supplementation showed bone-sparing effects in newborn rats, glucocorticoid-induced and ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic models as well as bone fracture models. It achieves the bone-protective effects by inhibiting , inflammation, oxidative stress, osteoclastic autophagy and osteoblastic apoptosis while activating osteoblastic autophagy. The anti-osteoporotic effects of kaempferol are mediated through regulation of estrogen receptor, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. In summary, kaempferol exhibits beneficial effects on skeleton, thus is potentially effective for the prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis.© 2019 Wong et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728842>Amifostine Suppresses the Side Effects of Radiation on BMSCs by Promoting Cell Proliferation and Reducing ROS Production.</a></h2><p>This study is aimed at investigating the effect of amifostine (AMI) on rat bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) exposed to 2 Gy radiation.

Sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) is the master regulator of lipid metabolism. The epigenetic mechanism whereby SREBP activity is regulated remains incompletely understood. We have previously shown that systemic knockdown of brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), a chromatin remodeling protein, attenuates steatosis in mice by down-regulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators. Here we show that hepatocyte conditional Brg1 knockout (HepcKO) mice were largely protected from high-fat diet (HFD) induced steatosis as evidenced by decelerated weight gains, improved insulin sensitivity, ameliorated steatotic injuries, and diminished hepatic inflammation. Brg1 contributed to lipid metabolism by trans-activating the genes involved in fatty acid esterification. Mechanistically, Brg1 interacted with and was recruited by sterol response element binding protein (SREBP1c) to the promoters of SREBP target genes and optimized the chromatin structure to facilitate SREBP1c binding. Therefore, our data have identified a previously unrecognized role for Brg1 in hepatic lipid metabolism by portraying Brg1 as an essential epigenetic co-factor for SREBP1c.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Hyperglycemia is known to affect cells while occurring acutely and chronically. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on human visceral pre/adipocytes from the perspective of microRNAs. The relative expression of 78 microRNAs was determined by TaqMan Low Density Arrays at three stages of HPA-v  conducted under normoglycemia, chronic, and intermittent hyperglycemia (30 mM). Hierarchical clustering/Pearson correlation revealed the relationship between various microRNAs' expression profiles, while functional analysis identified the genes and signaling pathways regulated by differentially expressed microRNAs. Hyperglycemia affected microRNAs' expression patterns during , and at the stage of pre-adipocytes, differentiated and matured adipocytes compared to normoglycemia. Interestingly, the changes that were evoked upon hyperglycemic exposure during one  stage resembled those observed upon chronic hyperglycemia. At least 15 microRNAs were modulated during normoglycemic and/or hyperglycemic  and/or upon intermittent/chronic hyperglycemia. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the involvement of these microRNAs in cell cycles, lipid metabolism, ECM⁻receptor interaction, oxidative stress, signaling of insulin, MAPK, TGF-β, p53, and more. The obtained data suggests that visceral pre/adipocytes exposed to chronic/intermittent hyperglycemia develop a microRNAs' expression pattern, which may contribute to further visceral dysfunction, the progression of diabetic phenotype, and diabetic complications possibly involving "epi"-memory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352713>Kojyl cinnamate esters are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ dual agonists.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin is an adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-aging properties. Compounds with the ability to promote adiponectin secretion are of interest for the development of anti-aging drugs to improve skin-aging phenotypes. In the phenotypic assay to measure adiponectin secretion during  in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs), kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives increased adiponectin secretion. A target identification study showed that the kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives competitively bound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ (PPARα/γ). The upregulation of adiponectin production induced by kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives was significantly correlated with PPARα and PPARγ binding activities. Kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives significantly increased the transcription of genes encoding cholesterol and fatty acid synthesizing enzymes in hAT-MSCs. Notably, the kojyl cinnamate esters upregulated the gene transcription of lipid metabolic enzymes in human epidermal keratinocytes, which are important in the integrity of skin permeability barrier. In addition, the kojyl cinnamate esters that function as PPARα/γ dual modulators inhibited ultraviolet  irradiation-induced inflammation in human epidermal keratinocytes. Therefore, kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives are a novel class of PPARα/γ dual agonists with the potential to improve skin-aging phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Responsible for the cellular injury is an increased level of oxidative stress, however the underlying mechanistic network is still not fully understood.We developed a phenomenological mathematical model of key processes of hepatic lipid metabolism linked to pathways of oxidative stress. The model allows the simulation of hypoxia (i.e. ischemia-like conditions) and reoxygenation (i.e. reperfusion-like conditions) for various degrees of steatosis and predicts the level of hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) as a marker of cell damage caused by oxidative stress.Our modeling results show that the underlying feedback loop between the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and LPO leads to bistable systems behavior. Here, the first stable state corresponds to a low basal level of ROS production. The system is directed to this state for healthy, non-steatotic livers. The second stable state corresponds to a high level of oxidative stress with an enhanced formation of ROS and LPO. This state is reached, if steatotic livers with a high fat content undergo a hypoxic phase. Theoretically, our proposed mechanistic network would support the prediction of the maximal tolerable ischemia time for steatotic livers: Exceeding this limit during the transplantation process would lead to severe IRI and a considerable increased risk for liver failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631282>Systemic Factors During Metabolic Disease Progression Contribute to the Functional Decline of Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Reproductive Aged Females.</a></h2><p>It is known that advanced metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes compromise the functional and regenerative capacity of endogenous adipose-tissue resident stem cells (ADSCs). It is, however, still unclear at which stage of disease progression ADSCs become compromised and whether systemic factors contribute to their functional decline. It was therefore hypothesized that inflammatory changes in the systemic microenvironment during distinct stages of disease progression negatively affect the functional capacity of ADSCs. A total of forty-seven ( = 47) black African reproductive aged females (32 ± 8 years; mean ± SD) were included in this study and subdivided into: (a) healthy lean (C; body mass index, BMI ≤ 25 kg/m), () healthy overweight/obese (OB; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m), (c) obese metabolic syndrome (MetS; BMI ≥ 30 kg/m), and (d) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; previously diagnosed and on treatment) groups. Participants underwent anthropometric assessments and a DXA scan to determine their body composition and adipose indices. Each persons' systemic metabolic- (cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and blood glucose) and inflammatory profiles (CRP, SDF1α, TNFα, IL6, IL8, IL10, and IFNy) were also evaluated. Participant-derived serum was then used to treat an ADSC cell line  and its effect on viability (MTT-based assay), proliferation (BrdU), migration (wound healing assay), and osteogenic differentiation assessed. When exposed to serum derived from overweight/obese individuals (with or without metabolic syndrome), both the proliferative and migratory responses of ADSCs were less pronounced than when exposed to healthy control serum. Serum IL6 concentrations were identified as a factor influencing the proliferation of ADSCs, suggesting that long-term disruption to the systemic cytokine balance can potentially disrupt the proliferative responses of ADSCs. Obese participant-derived serum (with and without metabolic syndrome) furthermore resulted in lipid accumulation during osteogenic differentiation. This study, therefore demonstrated that systemic factors in obese individuals, regardless of the presence of metabolic syndrome, can be detrimental to the multifunctional properties of ADSCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30387338>A high-fat diet increases body fat mass and up-regulates expression of genes related to  and inflammation in a genetically lean pig.</a></h2><p>Because of their physiological similarity to humans, pigs provide an excellent model for the study of obesity. This study evaluated diet-induced adiposity in genetically lean pigs and found that body weight and energy intake did not differ between controls and pigs fed the high-fat (HF) diet for three months. However, fat mass percentage, adipocyte size, concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), insulin, and leptin in plasma were significantly higher in HF pigs than in controls. The HF diet increased the expression in backfat tissue of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis such as Insig-1 and Insig-2. Lipid metabolism-related genes including sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase 1 (FASN1), diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) were significantly up-regulated in backfat tissue, while the expression of proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT2), both involved in fatty acid oxidation, was reduced. In liver tissue, HF feeding significantly elevated the expression of SREBP-1c, FASN1, DGAT2, and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α) mRNAs. Microarray analysis further showed that the HF diet had a significant effect on the expression of 576 genes. Among these, 108 genes were related to 21 pathways, with 20 genes involved in adiposity deposition and 26 related to immune response.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 20% fructose drink for eight weeks. The insulin sensitivity, serum lipid profiles, and hepatic lipids contents were measured. The results showed that paeoniflorin significantly decreased serum insulin and glucagon levels, improved insulin sensitivity and serum lipids profiles, and alleviated hepatic steatosis in fructose-fed rats. Moreover, paeoniflorin enhanced the phosphorylation level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase  (PKB/AKT) and inhibited the phosphorylation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)1 in liver. Paeoniflorin also increased the hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)-1 mRNA and protein expression and decreased the mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)1c, stearyl coenzyme A decarboxylase (SCD)-1 and fatty acid synthetase (FAS). Furthermore, we found that paeoniflorin significantly increased the heptatic protein expression of tumor suppressor serine/threonine kinase (LKB)1 but not Ca/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK)β. These results suggest that the protective effects of paeoniflorin might be involved in the activation of LKB1/AMPK and insulin signaling, which resulted in the inhibition of , as well as the activation of β-oxidation and glycogenesis, thus ameliorated the insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.

As opposed to chronic myeloid leukemia,  lymphoma or multiple myeloma, AML is one of the rare malignant hemopathies the therapy of which has not significantly improved during the past 30 years despite intense research efforts. One promising approach is to determine metabolic dependencies in AML cells. Moreover, two key metabolic enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH1/2), are mutated in more than 15% of AML patient, reinforcing the interest in studying metabolic reprogramming, in particular in this subgroup of patients. : Using a multi-omics approach combining proteomics, lipidomics, and isotopic profiling of [U-C] glucose and [U-C] glutamine cultures with more classical biochemical analyses, we studied the impact of the IDH1 R132H mutation in AML cells on lipid biosynthesis. : Global proteomic and lipidomic approaches showed a dysregulation of lipid metabolism, especially an increase of phosphatidylinositol, sphingolipids (especially few species of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphinganine), free cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids in IDH1 mutant cells. Isotopic profiling of fatty acids revealed that higher lipid anabolism in IDH1 mutant cells corroborated with an increase in  fluxes. : This integrative approach was efficient to gain insight into metabolism and dynamics of lipid species in leukemic cells. Therefore, we have determined that lipid anabolism is strongly reprogrammed in IDH1 mutant AML cells with a crucial dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and fluxes, both being mediated by 2-HG (2-Hydroxyglutarate) production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802154>Identification of an intrinsic lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity in the lipolytic inhibitor G/G switch gene 2 (G0S2).</a></h2><p>G/G switch gene 2 (G0S2) is a specific inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Recent studies show that G0S2 plays a critical role in promoting triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in the liver, and its encoding gene is a direct target of a major lipogenic transcription factor liver X receptor (LXR)α. Here we sought to investigate a lipolysis-independent role of G0S2 in hepatic triglyceride synthesis. Knockdown of G0S2 decreased hepatic TG content in mice with ATGL ablation. Conversely, overexpression of G0S2 promoted fatty acid incorporation into TGs and diacylglycerols in both wild-type and ATGL-deficient hepatocytes. Biochemical characterization showed that G0S2 mediates phosphatidic acid synthesis from lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and acyl-coenzyme A. In response to a high-sucrose lipogenic diet, G0S2 is up-regulated  LXRα and required for the increased TG accumulation in liver. Furthermore, deletion of a distinct 4-aa motif necessary for the LPA-specific acyltransferase (LPAAT) activity impaired G0S2's ability to mediate TG synthesis both  and . These studies identify G0S2 as a dual-function regulator of lipid metabolism as well as a novel mechanism whereby hepatic TG storage is promoted in response to lipogenic stimulation. In addition to its role as a lipolytic inhibitor, G0S2 is capable of directly promoting TG synthesis by acting as a lipid-synthesizing enzyme.-Zhang, X., Xie, X., Heckmann, . L., Saarinen, A.

Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing M2-polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice.

The role of miR-455 has been implicated in various human diseases such as cartilage development, , preeclampsia, and cancers, e.g., colon cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cancer, oral squamous cancer, skin cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Recently, our laboratory discovered the biomarker and therapeutic relevance of miR-455-3p in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our global microarray analysis of serum samples from AD patients, mild cognitive individuals (MCI), and healthy subjects unveiled the high level of miR-455-3p in AD patients relative to MCI and healthy controls. Further, validation analysis using different kinds of AD samples such as serum, postmortem brains, AD fibroblasts, AD -lymphocytes, AD cell lines, AD mouse models, and AD cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the biomarker potential of miR-455-3p. The mechanistic link of miR-455-3p in AD was determined via modulation of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and amyloid-β (Aβ) levels. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed AβPP as validated target of miR-455-3p. Our study on mouse neuroblastoma cells revealed the protective role of miR-455-3p against Aβ-induced toxicities.

Clinical studies and animal models have shown a shift of gut microbiota from bacteroidetes to firmicutes in NAFLD patients and a diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that these 2 groups of bacteria may have differential effects on lipid metabolism in the liver, which further contributed to pathogenesis of NAFLD. To elucidate these effects, we inoculated two species of Bacteroidetes (-group) or five species of Firmicutes (F-group) which were isolated from healthy individuals into germ-free mice. We found that the F-group induced elevated body weight, liver weight, and hepatic steatosis compared to the -group under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. The mRNA expression level of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) was elevated in the F-group compared to that in the -group. Increased mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were also seen under HFD conditions in the F-group compared to that in the -group. In addition, the expression level of miR802-5p was only elevated in the F-group under HFD conditions. Taken together, our results suggested that these specific species of Firmicutes may induce more hepatic steatosis by modulating fatty acid influx and  compared to those of Bacteroidetes.

However, the potential mechanism of this phenomenon was unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism involved in enhanced  mRNA expression and improvement of insulin sensitivity in mice. Ob/ob mice were treated with HDACi every second day for 3 weeks. At the end of treatment, an insulin tolerance test was performed and epididymal adipose tissue obtained for fractionation into adipocytes and preadipocytes. HDACi improved insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice and significantly increased  mRNA in epididymal adipose tissue. Further, epididymal adipocytes of ob/ob mice showed a tendency towards a larger size distribution, while HDACi increased the proportion of smaller sized cells in fractionated preadipocytes.  knocked-down 3T3-L1 cells down-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ1) protein expression during , which suppressed adipocyte differentiation. These data indicate that DBP promotes adipocyte differentiation via direct up-regulation of PPAR-γ1 production in preadipocytes. In fractionated preadipocytes of ob/ob mice, DBP binding to the promoter region of the  gene and splicing variant of  () mRNA expression were suppressed. HDACi significantly increased DBP binding to the  gene and  transcription.

The objectives of this study were to look for the optimal production condition of antioxidant crude chalaza hydrolysates and evaluate the in vivo antioxidant capacity via a chronic alcohol consumption mouse model.Antioxidant crude chalaza hydrolysates (CCH-As) could be produced by protease A at 1:100 ratio (w/w) and 0.5 h hydrolytic period. After our analyses, CCH-As were rich in leucine, arginine, phenylalanine, valine, lysine and antioxidant dipeptides (anserine and carnosine), and the major molecular masses were lower than 15 kDa. Regarding protective effects of CCH-As against oxidative damage in alcoholic-liquid-diet-fed mice, alcohol-fed mice had lower (P < 0.05) liver antioxidant capacities, and higher (P < 0.05) liver lipid contents, serum lipid/liver damage indices and IL-1β/IL-6 values. CCH-A supplementation reversed (P < 0.05) liver antioxidant capacities and reduced (P < 0.05) serum/liver lipids in alcohol-fed mice, which may result from increased (P < 0.05) fecal lipid output, upregulated (P < 0.05) fatty acid β-oxidation and downregulated (P < 0.05)  in the liver.Taken together, this CCH-A should benefit the liquid-egg industry, while also offering consumers a choice of healthy ingredients from animal sources. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735525>Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease.

Although recent studies have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates lipid metabolism, the roles of EGFR and EGFR inhibitors as modulators of lipid metabolism are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in liver tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase  signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo  and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance. In conclusion, these results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in NAFLD and is a potential therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29786471>The effects of polyphenol supplementation on adipose tissue morphology and gene expression in overweight and obese humans.</a></h2><p>Dietary polyphenols have beneficial effects on adipose tissue mass and function in rodents, but human studies are scarce. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, 25 (10 women) overweight and obese humans received a combination of the polyphenols epigallocatechin-gallate and resveratrol (282 mg/d, 80 mg/d, respectively, EGCG+RES, n = 11) or placebo (PLA, n = 14) supplementation for 12 weeks. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) biopsies were collected for assessment of adipocyte morphology and micro-array analysis. EGCG+RES had no effects on adipocyte size and distribution compared with PLA. However, we identified pathways contributing to , cell cycle and apoptosis were significantly downregulated by EGCG+RES versus PLA. Furthermore, EGCG+RES significantly decreased expression of pathways related to energy metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune defense as compared with PLA. In conclusion, the SAT gene expression profile indicates a reduced cell turnover after 12-week EGCG+RES in overweight-obese subjects. It remains to be elucidated whether these alterations translate into long-term metabolic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30402866>HOTAIR alleviates ox-LDL-induced inflammatory response in Raw264.7 cells via inhibiting NF-κ pathway.</a></h2><p>To investigate the possible role of hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its underlying mechanism.The expression of HOTAIR in peripheral blood lymphocytes of atherosclerosis (AS) and healthy controls was detected by quantitative Real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In vitro AS model was established by ox-LDL induction in Raw264.7 cells. Viability of Raw264.7 cells after ox-LDL induction was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Levels of TC (total cholesterol), TG (triglyceride), LDL-C (low density lipoprotein cholesterol) and HDL-C (high density lipoprotein cholesterol) in Raw264.7 cells were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overexpression plasmid of HOTAIR was constructed. Levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL were detected again after HOTAIR overexpression by ELISA. CD68+ cells and CD168+ cells in Raw264.7 cells were detected by flow cytometry. Protein expressions of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes were detected by Western blot. Lipid metabolism in Raw264.7 cells was evaluated by oil red O staining and Western blot, respectively. Finally, rescue experiments were conducted to explore the specific mechanism of HOTAIR in regulating AS development.HOTAIR was lowly expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of AS patients and Raw264.7 cells induced by ox-LDL. Overexpression of HOTAIR upregulated adipose genes (PPARα and CPT-1) and downregulated  genes (SREBP-1c and ACS). Besides, overexpression of HOTAIR decreased expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), but increased expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). In the in vitro AS model, FXR1 was remarkably downregulated in Raw264.7 cells. HOTAIR reduced inflammatory response via promoting FXR1 expression in Raw264.7 cells. Rescue experiments showed that the effect of HOTAIR on nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) pathway was reversed by FXR1 knockdown.We found that TAIR was lowly expressed in AS patients. Overexpression of HOTAIR can reduce the lipid accumulation and inhibit inflammatory response by suppressing FXR1 via NF-κ pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602604>LXR Alpha Restricts Gammaherpesvirus Reactivation from Latently Infected Peritoneal Cells.</a></h2><p>Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous viruses that establish lifelong infections. Importantly, these viruses are associated with numerous cancers and lymphoproliferative diseases. While risk factors for developing gammaherpesvirus-driven cancers are poorly understood, it is clear that elevated viral reactivation from latency often precedes oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the liver X receptor alpha isoform (LXRα) restricts gammaherpesvirus reactivation in an anatomic-site-specific manner. We have previously demonstrated that deficiency of both LXR isoforms (α and β) leads to an increase in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in primary macrophage cultures, with a corresponding increase in gammaherpesvirus replication. Interestingly, expression of fatty acid synthesis genes was not derepressed in LXRα-deficient hosts, indicating that the antiviral effects of LXRα are independent of . Additionally, the critical host defenses against gammaherpesvirus reactivation, virus-specific CD8 T cells and interferon (IFN) signaling, remained intact in the absence of LXRα. Remarkably, using a murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) reporter virus, we discovered that LXRα expression dictates the cellular tropism of MHV68 in the peritoneal cavity. Specifically, LXRα mice exhibit reduced latency within the peritoneal  cell compartment and elevated latency within F4/80 cells. Thus, LXRα restricts gammaherpesvirus reactivation through a novel mechanism that is independent of the known CD8 T cell-based antiviral responses or changes in lipid synthesis and likely involves changes in the tropism of MHV68 in the peritoneal cavity. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that mediate cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. Importantly, as ligand-activated transcription factors, LXRs represent potential targets for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Here, we demonstrate that LXRα, one of the two LXR isoforms, restricts reactivation of latent gammaherpesvirus from peritoneal cells. As gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous oncogenic agents, LXRs may represent a targetable host factor for the treatment of poorly controlled gammaherpesvirus infection and associated lymphomagenesis.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339471>MTCH2 promotes  in intramuscular preadipocytes via an mA-YTHDF1-dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>Intramuscular fat is considered a potential factor that is associated with meat quality in animal production and insulin resistance in humans. N-methyladenosine (mA) modification of mRNA plays an important role in regulating . However, the effects of mA on the  of intramuscular preadipocytes and associated mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we performed mA sequencing to compare mA methylome of the longissimus dorsi muscles (LDMs) between Landrace pigs (lean-type breed) and Jinhua pigs (obese-type breed with higher levels of intramuscular fat). Transcriptome-wide mA profiling of porcine LDMs was highly conserved with humans and mice. Furthermore, we identified a unique methylated gene in Jinhua pigs named mitochondrial carrier homology 2 ( MTCH2). The mA levels of MTCH2 mRNA were reduced by introducing a synonymous mutation, and  test results showed that the MTCH2 mutant was inferior with regard to  compared with the MTCH2 wild-type. We then found that MTCH2 protein expression was positively associated with mA levels, and an YTH domain family protein 1-RNA immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR assay indicated that MTCH2 mRNA was a target of the YTH domain family protein 1. This study provides comprehensive mA profiles of LDM transcriptomes in pigs and suggests an essential role for mA modification of MTCH2 in intramuscular fat regulation.-Jiang, Q., Sun, ., Liu, Q., Cai, M., Wu, R., Wang, F., Yao, Y., Wang, Y., Wang, X.

They are usually expanded for multiple passages  to increase cell yield prior to transplantation. Unfortunately, prolonged culture leads to cell senescence, a major drawback from successful outcomes in cell therapy approaches. Here, we show that an extract from early Zebrafish embryo (ZF1) counteracted senescence progression in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) along multiple culture passages (from the 5th to the 20th). Exposure to ZF1 strongly reduced the expression of senescence marker beta-galactosidase. Both stemness (, , and ) and anti-senescence (, and telomerase reverse transcriptase - ) related genes were overexpressed at specific experimental points, without recruitment of the cyclin-dependent kinase Inhibitor 2A (, ali-as ). Increased telomerase activity was associatt-ed with  overexpression. Both osteogenic and adipogenic abilities were enhanced. In conclusion, hASCs exposure to ZF1 is a feasible tool to counteract and reverse human stem cell senescence in long-term culturing conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30212233>Timing of food intake is more potent than habitual voluntary exercise to prevent diet-induced obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Inappropriate eating habits such as skipping breakfast and eating late at night are associated with risk for abnormal weight-gain and adiposity. We previously reported that time-imposed feeding during the daytime (inactive phase) induces obesity and metabolic disorders accompanied by physical inactivity in mice. The present study compares metabolic changes induced in mice by time-imposed feeding under voluntary wheel-running (RW) and sedentary (SED) conditions to determine the effects of voluntary wheel-running activity on obesity induced in mice by feeding at inappropriate times. Mice were individually housed in cages with or without running-wheels. We compared food consumption, core body temperature, hormonal and metabolic variables in the blood, lipid accumulation in the liver, circadian expression of clock and metabolic genes in peripheral tissues, and gains in body weight between mice allowed access to food only during the sleep phase (daytime feeding; DF) or only during the active phase (nighttime feeding; NF) under SED or RW conditions. Only a high-fat high-sucrose diet was available to the mice throughout restricted feeding. Nocturnal activity was maintained in both NF and DF mice under RW conditions, but significantly suppressed during the latter half of the dark phase in DF mice. Nocturnal fluctuations in core body temperature were maintained in DF and NF mice under both SED and RW conditions, although DF attenuated the day-night amplitude more under SED, than RW conditions. The degrees of DF-induced increases in body weight gain, food efficiency, adipose tissue mass, lipogenic gene expression in metabolic tissues, and hepatic lipid accumulation were essentially identical between SED and RW conditions. Daytime feeding also induced hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia under both SED and RW conditions, although DF-induced hyperleptinemia was slightly attenuated by wheel-running. The temporal expression of circadian clock genes became synchronized to feeding cycles in the liver but not in the skeletal muscle of mice under both SED and RW conditions. Chronic voluntary exercise on running-wheels minimally affected obesity and adiposity in mice caused by daily feeding at unusual times. The timing of food intake might be more important than physical exercise for preventing metabolic disorders.

We sought the molecular basis for this sensitivity by utilizing a panel of mice possessing specific deletions of GHR signaling pathways. Metabolic clamps and glucose homeostasis tests were undertaken in these obese adult C57BL/6 male mice, which indicated impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis. Insulin sensitivity and glucose disappearance rate were enhanced in muscle and adipose of mice lacking the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5  the GHR (-391) as for GHR-null () mice. These changes were associated with a striking inhibition of hepatic glucose output associated with altered glycogen metabolism and elevated hepatic glycogen content during unfed state. The enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity was associated with increased insulin receptor β and insulin receptor substrate 1 activation along with activated downstream protein kinase  signaling cascades. Although phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ()- expression was unchanged, its inhibitory acetylation was elevated because of decreased sirtuin-2 expression, thereby promoting loss of PCK1. Loss of STAT5 signaling to defined chromatin immunoprecipitation targets would further increase , supporting hepatosteatosis while lowering glucose output. Finally, up-regulation of IL-15 expression in muscle, with increased secretion of adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor 1 from adipose tissue, is expected to promote insulin sensitivity.-Chhabra, Y., Nelson, C.

This study examines the anti-adipogenic and pro-apoptotic effect of red pepper seed water extract (RPS) prepared at 4℃ (RPS4) in 3T3-L1 cells.Effect of RPS4 or its fractions on lipid accumulation was determined in 3T3-L1 cells using oil red O (ORO) staining. The expressions of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adipogenic associated proteins [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins α (C/EBP α), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)] were measured in 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4. Apoptosis and the expression of Akt and Bcl-2 family proteins [-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), Bcl-2 like protein 4 (Bax), Bal-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak)] were measured in mature 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4.Treatment of RPS4 (0-75 µg/mL) or its fractions (0-50 µg/mL) for 24 h did not have an apparent cytotoxicity on pre and mature 3T3-L1 cells. RPS4 significantly suppressed differentiation and cellular lipid accumulation by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and reducing the expression of PPAR-γ, C/EBP α, SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC. In addition, all fractions except ethyl acetate fraction significantly suppressed cellular lipid accumulation. RPS4 induced the apoptosis of mature adipocytes by hypophosphorylating Akt, increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bak, Bax, and Bad, and reducing the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and p-Bad.These finding suggest that RPS4 can reduce the numbers as well as the size of adipocytes and might useful for preventing and treating obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845793>Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type  (PTPRB) Inhibits Brown Adipocyte Differentiation through Regulation of VEGFR2 Phosphorylation.</a></h2><p>Brown adipocytes have an important role in the regulation of energy balance through uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1)-mediated nonshivering thermogenesis. Although brown adipocytes have been highlighted as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type II diabetes in adult humans, the molecular mechanism underlying brown  is not fully understood. We recently found that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type  (PTPRB) expression dramatically decreased during brown adipogenic differentiation. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of PTPRB and its regulatory mechanism during brown adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of PTPRB led to a reduced brown adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR2, whereas a catalytic inactive PTPRB mutant showed no effects on differentiation and phosphorylation. Consistently, the expression of brown adipocyte-related genes, such as UCP-1, PGC-1α, PRDM16, PPAR-γ, and CIDEA, were significantly inhibited by PTPRB overexpression. Overall, these results suggest that PTPRB functions as a negative regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation through its phosphatase activity-dependent mechanism and may be used as a target protein for the regulation of obesity and type II diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29708458>Use of C-glucose by primary cultures of mature rat epididymal adipocytes.

FASN is over-expressed in several cancers and is often associated with a high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. Differential expression of FASN in cancer cells and their normal counterparts leads to the impression that FASN can be an attractive druggable target in cancer therapy. Present study focuses on identification of inhibitors against FASN ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain from Asinex Biodesign compound database using in silico tools. Virtual screening resulted in the identification of two hit compounds BDD27845077 and BDD27845082 with a common core structure.

Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including metabolic syndrome and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase  (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to . This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the browning of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group.

We found that p-synephrine suppressed the 3T3-L1 cell  by reducing the expression level of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which subsequently led to a reduction in the fatty acid-binding protein 4 (aP2) expression. p-Synephrine treatment markedly activated the protein kinase  (PKB/Akt) pathway and sequentially inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity. Inhibition of GSK3β activity by LiCl was found to partially ameliorate the above-mentioned effects. All these data suggested that p-synephrine exhibited the anti-adipogenic effects via the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the suppression of -related proteins. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Citrus aurantium often uses as herbal or dietary supplement in various countries around the world, including in Seville, Spain and South Africa. In traditional Chinese herbs, it is referred to as "Fructus aurantii immaturus," "Zhi shi," or "Zhi ke," and has been used for hundreds of years for various digestive problems. Its primary protoalkaloid, p-synephrine, exhibited lipolytic effects and energy expenditure, which has rapidly replaced ephedrine as an "ephedra-free" alternative dietary supplement. The current study firstly demonstrated the anti-adipogenic effects of p-synephrine in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which was due to the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the subsequent suppression of -related proteins. The present study may offer invaluable opinions into the mechanisms of body weight/fat-losing activities of p-synephrine in theory, and scientific experimental evidence on dietary supplement in practice. p-Synephrine could be utilized for the preventive and therapeutic uses against metabolic syndrome.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30715741>Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Enhances Autophagic Flux in Mouse and Rat Hepatocytes and Protects Against Palmitate Lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a protein that is required for the development and survival of enteric, sympathetic, and catecholaminergic neurons. We previously reported that GDNF is protective against high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis in mice through suppression of hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ and genes encoding enzymes involved in de novo . We also reported that transgenic overexpression of GDNF in mice prevented the HFD-induced liver accumulation of the autophagy cargo-associated protein p62/sequestosome 1 characteristic of impaired autophagy. Here we investigated the effects of GDNF on hepatic autophagy in response to increased fat load, and on hepatocyte mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and cell survival. GDNF not only prevented the reductions in the liver levels of some key autophagy-related proteins, including Atg5, Atg7, Beclin-1 and LC3A/-II, seen in HFD-fed control mice, but enhanced their levels after 12 weeks of HFD feeding. In vitro, GDNF accelerated autophagic cargo clearance in primary mouse hepatocytes and a rat hepatocyte cell line, and reduced the phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex downstream-target p70S6 kinase similar to the autophagy activator rapamycin. GDNF also enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation in primary mouse and rat hepatocytes, and protected against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity. Conclusion: We demonstrate a role for GDNF in enhancing hepatic autophagy and in potentiating mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation. Our studies show that GDNF and its receptor agonists could be useful for enhancing hepatocyte survival and protecting against fatty acid-induced hepatic lipotoxicity.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29852170>Suppression of NF-κ activation by PDLIM2 restrains hepatic  and inflammation in high fat diet induced mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and a systemic pro-inflammatory response, a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we showed that PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) was an effective suppressor of steatohepatitis. After 16 weeks on a high fat diet (HFD), obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic dyslipidemia and inflammation were markedly aggravated in PDLIM2-knockout (KO) mice. PDLIM2 deletion resulted in lipid accumulation in liver tissue samples of HFD-induced mice, as evidenced by the significant increase of hepatic TG and TC through reducing the expression of - and transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism-related genes and enhancing fatty acid oxidation-associated molecules. In addition, PDLIM2-ablation promoted the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activating nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) signaling pathway, as supported by the remarkable increase of phosphorylated IKKβ, Iκα and NF-κ expressions in liver of HFD-fed mice. Of note, the in vitro study demonstrated that PDLIM2 ablation-enhanced inflammatory response and disorder of lipid metabolism were abrogated by suppressing NF-κ activity.

Previous studies revealed that Coreopsis tinctoria (CT) flower tea increases insulin sensitivity and, in some high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats, even prevents hepatic metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CT improves insulin resistance are not known. In this study, six-week-old rats were fed a normal diet (ND), an HFD or an HFD supplemented with CT for 8 weeks. Serum samples were collected, and the livers were extracted for RNA-seq gene expression analysis. Real-time PCR and western blotting further verified the RNA-seq results. In our results, dietary CT ameliorated HFD-induced hepatosteatosis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. In the HFD group, 1667 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified compared with the ND group. In the CT group, 327 DEGs were identified compared with the HFD group. Some of these DEGs were related to insulin signalling, hepatic  and glucose homeostasis. This study suggested that insulin resistance with hyperinsulinaemia, and not insulin insufficiency, is an early problem in HFD-fed rats, and CT downregulates insulin secretion genes (e.g., Rasd1, Stxbp1 and Sfxn1). Hepatic gene and protein expression analyses indicated that the regulatory effects of CT on glucose and lipid homeostasis are likely mediated via the Akt/FoxO1 signalling pathway and are regulated by the transcription factors hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). Our study provides transcriptomic evidence of the complex pathogenic mechanism involved in hepatic insulin resistance and proves that supplementation with CT improves insulin resistance at a global scale.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30011383>Female rats are more susceptible to metabolic effects of dehydroepiandrosterone treatment.</a></h2><p>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid hormone that presents several effects on metabolism; however, most of the studies have been performed on male animals, while few authors have investigated possible sex differences regarding the metabolic effects of DHEA. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different doses of DHEA on metabolic parameters of male and ovariectomized female Wistar rats. Sex differences were found in the metabolism of distinct substrates and in relation to the effect of DHEA. In respect to the glucose metabolism in the liver, the conversion of glucose to CO and the synthesis of lipids from glucose were 53% and 33% higher, respectively, in males. Also, DHEA decreased hepatic  only in females. Regarding the hepatic glycogen synthesis pathway, females presented 73% higher synthesis than males, and the effect of DHEA was observed only in females, where it decreased this parameter. In the adipose tissue, glucose uptake was 208% higher in females and DHEA decreased this parameter. In the muscle, glucose uptake was 168% higher in females and no DHEA effect was observed. In summary, males and females present a different metabolic profile, with females being more susceptible to the metabolic effects of DHEA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30064293>Role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma Pro12Ala polymorphism in human adipose tissue: assessment of  and adipocyte glucose and lipid turnover.</a></h2><p>The protective mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) Pro12Ala polymorphism in type 2 diabetes (T2D) are unclear. We obtained subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) before and 3 h after oral glucose (OGTT) in carriers and non-carriers of the Ala allele (12 Pro/Pro, 15 Pro/Ala, and 13 Ala/Ala). , adipocyte glucose uptake and lipolysis as well as PPARγ target gene expression were investigated and compared between the genotype groups. During fasting and post-OGTT, neither basal nor insulin-stimulated adipocyte glucose uptake differed between genotypes. Compared to fasting, a decreased hormone-sensitive lipase gene expression in Pro/Pro (p < 0.05) was accompanied with a higher antilipolytic effect of insulin post-OGTT (p < 0.01). The adipocyte size was similar across groups. Preadipocyte differentiation rates between Pro/Pro and Ala/Ala were unchanged. In conclusion, no major differences in AT differentiation, glucose uptake, lipolysis or expression of PPARγ target genes were observed between different PPARγ Pro12Ala genotypes. Albeit small, our study may suggest that other pathways in AT or effects exerted in other tissues might contribute to the Pro12Ala-mediated protection against T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096039>Endothelin-1 differentially directs lineage specification of adipose- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Blood vessels composed of endothelial cells (ECs) contact with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in different tissues, suggesting possible interaction between these 2 types of cells. We hypothesized that endothelin-1 (ET1), a secreted paracrine factor of ECs, can differentially direct the lineages of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). Predifferentiated ASCs and BMSCs were treated with ET1 for 2 cell passages and then induced for multilineage differentiation. Our results showed that  of ET1-pretreated ASCs and osteogenesis of ET1-pretreated BMSCs were increased compared to those of control cells. The effect of ET1 on enhancing  of ASCs and osteogenesis of BMSCs was attenuated by blocking endothelin receptor type A (ETAR) and/or endothelin receptor type  (ETBR). Western blot analysis indicated that regulation by ET1 was mediated through activation of the protein kinase  and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. We analyzed subpopulations of ASCs and BMSCs with or without ETAR and/or ETBR, and we found that ETAR/ETBR and ETAR/ETBR subpopulations of ASCs and those of BMSCs pretreated with ET1 were prone to turning into adipocytes and osteoblasts, respectively, after differentiation induction. Our findings provide insight into the differential regulation of MSC specification by ET1, which may help develop viable approaches for tissue regeneration.-Lee, M.-S., Wang, J., Yuan, H., Jiao, H., Tsai, T.-L., Squire, M.

Family with Sequence Similarity 134, Member  (FAM134B) is a cis-Golgi transmembrane protein that known to be necessary for the long-term survival of nociceptive and autonomic ganglion neurons. Recent work has shown that FAM134B plays a pivotal role in lipid homeostasis and was identified as its significant m A level difference between Chinese local Jinhua pigs and Landrace through RNA-sequence. Here, we construct the non-m A FAM134B coding sequence (CDS) plasmid (FAM134B-MUT) and found one important m A site on its CDS. Expression of FAM134B-MUT was more effective in promoting porcine preadipocytes adipogenic differentiation and lipid deposition than wild-type FAM134B (FAM134B-WT) both in early and ultimate differentiation stage. FAM134B-MUT functions better in promoting fat deposition by upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) level. The m A reader protein YTH m A RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) interacts with FAM134B mRNA and down regulated its protein level. These results demonstrate that FAM134B was the target of YTHDF2, which may recognize and binds the m A site of FAM134B to reduce its mRNA lifetime and reduce its protein abundance.© 2018 IUBMB Life, 71(5):580-586, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493100>Patterns and prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients with different etiologies of chronic liver disease.</a></h2><p>Liver disease impacts on hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins and  but data on dyslipidemia during disease progression are limited. We assessed the patterns of dyslipidemia in (i) different liver disease etiologies and discriminated (ii) non-advanced (non-ACLD) from advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) as it is unclear how progression to ACLD impacts on dyslipidemia-associated cardiovascular risk.Patients with alcoholic liver disease (n = 121), hepatitis C (n = 1438), hepatitis  (n = 384), metabolic/fatty liver disease (n = 532), cholestatic liver disease (n = 119), and autoimmune hepatitis (n = 114) were included. Liver stiffness ≥15 kPa defined ACLD. Dyslipidemia was defined as total cholesterol >200 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol >130 mg/dL and triglycerides >200 mg/dL.Across all etiologies, total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in ACLD, when compared to non-ACLD. Accordingly, LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower in ACLD due to hepatitis C, hepatitis , metabolic/fatty liver disease and autoimmune hepatitis. Triglyceride levels did not differ due to disease severity in any etiology. Despite lower total and LDL cholesterol levels in ACLD, etiology-specific dyslipidemia patterns remained similar to non-ACLD. Contrary to this "improved" lipid status in ACLD, cardiovascular comorbidities were more prevalent in ACLD: arterial hypertension was present in 26.6% of non-ACLD and in 55.4% of ACLD patients (p < 0.001), and diabetes was present in 8.1% of non-ACLD and 25.6% of ACLD patients (p < 0.001).Liver disease etiology is a major determinant of dyslipidemia patterns and prevalence.

Postmenopausal women are strongly associated with osteoporosis and obesity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the water extract of  (WDR) on bone loss and obesity in ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Body weight, gonadal fat weight, histological findings, and morphometric parameters in trabecular bone were evaluated after OVX mice were treated with WDR and HFD for four weeks. The receptor activator of nuclear κ- ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) was examined. Phytochemical identification of WDR using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed. WDR reversed the changes in body weight gain, gonadal fat mass, and trabecular bone parameters by ovariectomy. However, ovariectomy-induced uterine atrophy was not affected by WDR. WDR decreased adipocyte size and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in gonadal fats and lipid accumulation in the bone marrow, which were induced by ovariectomy. WDR significantly decreased RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in BMMs. Fifteen phytochemicals were identified in WDR: Seven and nine with anti-osteoporotic and anti-adipogenic activities, respectively.

This study further investigated whether KMUP-1 affects  and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. KMUP-1 (1⁻40 µM) concentration-dependently attenuated Oil Red O (ORO) staining and decreased triglyceride (TG) accumulation, indicating  inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells. In contrast, the β-agonist ractopamine increased ORO staining and TG accumulation and . KMUP-1 (1⁻40 µM) also reduced MAPKs/Akt/PPARγ expression, PPARγ1/PPARγ2 mRNA, and p-ERK immunoreactivity at the  stage, but enhanced hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) immunoreactivity at the lipolysis stage. Addition of protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase G (PKG) antagonist (KT5720 or KT5728) to adipocytes did not affect HSL immunoreactivity. However, KMUP-1 did increase HSL immunoreactivity and the effect was reduced by PKA or PKG antagonist. Simvastatin, theophylline, caffeine, and sildenafil, like KMUP-1, also enhanced HSL immunoreactivity. Phosphorylated HSL (p-HSL) was enhanced by KMUP-1, indicating increased lipolysis in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Decreases of MAPKs/Akt/PPARγ during  contributed to inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, and increases of PKA/PKG at lipolysis contributed to HSL activation and TG hydrolysis.

Characterization of regulators that are associated with adipose development is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying obesity and other metabolic disorders. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a secreted glycoprotein that was first described as a neurotrophic factor. The role of PEDF in lipid metabolism was established when adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a major triglyceride hydrolase, was characterized as its binding partner. In this study, we investigated the downstream effects of PEDF on adipogenic differentiation using rat adipose-derived stem cells (AdSCs) and the mouse pre-adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. Knocking down PEDF in differentiating cells resulted in elevated levels of ATGL and CD36, as well as other adipogenic markers, with a concomitant increase in adipocyte number. CD36, a scavenger receptor for a variety of ligands, regulated proliferation and lipogenic gene expression during . The CD36 increase due to PEDF down-regulation might be a result of elevated PPARγ. We further demonstrated that PEDF expression was regulated by dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that is widely used for  at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our findings highlight that PEDF negatively regulates  through the regulation of various signaling intermediates, and it may play a crucial role in lipid metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31033380>Fibroblast feeder layer supports adipogenic differentiation of human adipose stromal/progenitor cells.</a></h2><p>Adipose stromal/progenitor cells (ASCs) can differentiate into adipocytes in the course of . This process is governed by systemic factors and signals of the adipose stem cell niche. ASCs isolated from fat tissues and amplified in vitro provide an essential and reliable model system to study . However, current cell culture models routinely grow ASCs on plastic surfaces largely missing niche parameters. In the present communication, we employed human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) monolayers as feeder cells for ASCs, which were isolated from human subcutaneous white adipose tissue and amplified in vitro. We found that PPARγ2 and several adipocyte markers were significantly higher expressed in differentiated ASCs growing on feeder layers relative to plastic dishes. Moreover, a significant higher number of adipocytes was generated from ASCs cultured on feeder layer and these adipocytes contained larger fat droplets. Insulin strongly stimulated glucose uptake into adipocytes produced on feeder layer suggesting that these cells show characteristic metabolic features of fat cells.  Finally, we show that the HFF feeder layer allows adipogenic differentiation of low-density-seeded ASCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the HFF feeder layer increases adipocyte differentiation of ASCs and allows differentiation of low density seeded progenitor cells  into functional adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29987205>Antiadipogenic Effects of Loganic Acid in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes and Ovariectomized Mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is caused by an excess storage of body fat, resulting from a chronic imbalance between energy intake and expenditure.  L. (GL) root has been reported to reduce lipid accumulation in the aortic wall of diabetic rats. Here, we performed fractionation and isolation of the bioactive constituent(s) that may be responsible for the antiadipogenic effects of the GL root extract. A single compound, loganic acid, was identified as a candidate component in the 30% ethanol extract of GL. Loganic acid treatment significantly decreased the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of key -related genes such as adiponectin (), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (), lipoprotein lipase (), perilipin1 (), fatty acid binding protein 4 (), glucose transporter type 4 (), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha () were significantly reduced following treatment with loganic acid. In vivo experiments in an ovariectomy-induced obesity mouse model showed that loganic acid (oral administration with 10 and 50 mg/kg/day) significantly inhibited body weight gain, total fat increase, fatty hepatocyte deposition in the liver, and adipocyte enlargement in the abdominal visceral fat tissues.

Baicalin is a flavonoid isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis georgi (Huang-qin) and exerts anti-inflammation effects in various diseases. Here, we investigated the protective effects of baicalin treatment and the potential mechanism in AS progression on AS mouse model. After ApoE-/- mice with high-lipid diets had received 12 weeks' of baicalin treatment at different concentrations, plasma lipids levels and atherosclerotic plaque areas in aorta were measured and there exhibited a prominent improvement in the baicalin treated mice compared with mice in AS model group. The expression of lipolysis related proteins (PPARα, CPT-1) was increased while the expression of  related proteins (SREBP-1c, ACS) was decreased by baicalin treatment, indicating the anti-adipogenic effect of baicalin. Moreover, baicalin up-regulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px) and down-regulated the activity of oxidative parameter MDA compared with AS model group, indicating the anti-oxidant effect of baicalin. The increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, sVE-cadherin) induced by AS were also decreased by baicalin treatment, indicating that baicalin acted as an anti-inflammation regulator in AS. In addition, we further explored the potential mechanism of baicalin treatment on AS, and found that baicalin treatment attenuated the high phosphorylation levels of JNK, p65, p-38 and ERK1/2 induced by AS, indicating that baicalin treatment inhibited the NF-κ and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in AS. In conclusion, baicalin treatment inhibited the NF-κ and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, thereby achieved its anti-adipogenic effect, anti-oxidant effect and anti-inflammation effect in a dose-dependent manner in AS.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo , fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT).

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo  but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704067>The Cholesterol-Modulating Effect of Methanol Extract of Pigeon Pea ( (L.)

Millsp.) is a legume crop consumed as an indigenous vegetable in the human diet and a traditional medicinal plant with therapeutic properties. The current study highlights the cholesterol-modulating effect and underlying mechanisms of the methanol extract of  L. leaves (MECC) in HepG2 cells. We found that MECC increased the LDLR expression, the cell-surface LDLR levels and the LDL uptake activity in HepG2 cells. We further demonstrated that MECC suppressed the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mRNA and protein expression, but not affected the expression of other cholesterol or lipid metabolism-related genes including inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL), HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MECC down-regulated the PCSK9 gene expression through reducing the amount of nuclear hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HNF-1α), a major transcriptional regulator for activation of PCSK9 promoter, but not that of nuclear sterol-responsive element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) in HepG2 cells. Finally, we identified the cajaninstilbene acid, a main bioactive stilbene component in MECC, which significantly modulated the LDLR and PCSK9 expression in HepG2 cells. Our current data suggest that the cajaninstilbene acid may contribute to the hypocholesterolemic activity of  L. leaves.

To investigate the changes in three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure and its mediated gene expression during  and myogenesis, we comprehensively mapped 3D chromatin organization for four cell types (3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, 3T3-L1-D adipocytes, C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12-D myotubes). We demonstrate that the dynamic spatial genome architecture affected gene expression during cell differentiation. A considerable proportion (~22%) of the mouse genome underwent compartment A/ rearrangement during adipogenic and myogenic differentiation, and most (~80%) upregulated marker genes exhibited an active chromatin state with  to A switch or stable A compartment. More than half (65.4%-73.2%) of the topologically associating domains (TADs) are dynamic. The newly formed TAD and intensified local interactions in the  gene cluster indicated more precise structural regulation of the expression of pro-differentiation genes during . About half (32.39%-59.04%) of the differential chromatin interactions (DCIs) during differentiation are promoter interactions, although these DCIs only account for a small proportion of genome-wide interactions (~9.67% in  and ~4.24% in myogenesis). These differential promoter interactions were enriched with promoter-enhancer interactions (PEIs), which were mediated by typical adipogenic and myogenic transcription factors. Differential promoter interactions also included more differentially expressed genes than nonpromoter interactions.

PCa metabolome is characterized by the accumulation of metabolic intermediates and an increased expression of genes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the induction of de novo  and cholesterogenesis. PCa cells can induce different alterations in their microenvironment by modulating the crosstalk between cancer and stromal cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470850>Raloxifene inhibits adipose tissue inflammation and  through Wnt regulation in ovariectomized rats and 3 T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Loss of ovarian function, as in menopause or after ovariectomy (OVX), is closely associated with obesity and white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation. Estrogen replacement protects against postmenopausal obesity but increases the risks of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of long-term treatment of raloxifene (RAL), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on the features of estrogen deficiency-induced obesity and explored the involvement of canonical and non-canonical Wnt regulation in vivo and in vitro.Adult female rats received bilateral OVX and divided into 5 groups: (1) Sham, (2) OVX, (3) OVX + E: OVX rats were administered with E (50 μg/kg, s.c., 3 times/week), (4) OVX + RAL: OVX rats were treated with RAL (gavage, 1 mg/kg/day) suspended in 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), (5) OVX + CMC: 0.8% CMC as vehicle control. All treatments were given for 8 weeks beginning at 1 week after OVX. In 3 T3-L1 cells, the effects of RAL on  and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation were evaluated.Treatment with RAL significantly decreased body weight, visceral fat pad mass, adipocyte size and plasma levels of glucose but increased plasma adiponectin. RAL reduced the elevation of HIF-1α, VEGF-A and proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1 and TNF-α) expression by inhibition of NF-κ p65 and JNK cascades in retroperitoneal WAT. This anti-inflammatory capacity of RAL may result from upregulation of secreted frizzle-related protein 5 (SFRP5), an adipokine that repressed Wnt5a signaling. Furthermore, RAL inhibited adipogenic factors such as PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, and FABP4, and preserved canonical Wnt10b/β-catenin protein expression. In 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, RAL (20 μM) diminished lipid accumulation and inhibited adipogenic factors accompanied with the induction of β-catenin, which were effectively reversed by the β-catenin inhibitor IWR-1-endo. In addition, RAL reduced LPS-induced NF-κ p65 and p-Iκ expression as well as TNF-α secretion. Suppression of SFRP5 by small interfering RNA significantly abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of RAL.Distinct activation of canonical β-catenin on inhibition of  and non-canonical SFRP5 on suppression of WAT inflammation may contribute to the beneficial effects of RAL. Therefore, this study provides a rationale for the therapeutic potential of RAL for postmenopausal obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846317>CHP1 Regulates Compartmentalized Glycerolipid Synthesis by Activating GPAT4.</a></h2><p>Cells require a constant supply of fatty acids to survive and proliferate. Fatty acids incorporate into membrane and storage glycerolipids through a series of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzymes, but how these enzymes are regulated is not well understood. Here, using a combination of CRISPR-based genetic screens and unbiased lipidomics, we identified calcineurin  homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a major regulator of ER glycerolipid synthesis. Loss of CHP1 severely reduces fatty acid incorporation and storage in mammalian cells and invertebrates. Mechanistically, CHP1 binds and activates GPAT4, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in glycerolipid synthesis. GPAT4 activity requires CHP1 to be N-myristoylated, forming a key molecular interface between the two proteins. Interestingly, upon CHP1 loss, the peroxisomal enzyme, GNPAT, partially compensates for the loss of ER lipid synthesis, enabling cell proliferation. Thus, our work identifies a conserved regulator of glycerolipid metabolism and reveals plasticity in lipid synthesis of proliferating cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have identified an unexpected role for  cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), a critical regulator of immunity, in the developmental expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue. In adipocyte-specific knockout mice (Bcl6), we found that Bcl6 deletion results in strikingly increased inguinal, but not perigonadal, adipocyte size and tissue mass in addition to marked insulin sensitivity. Genome-wide RNA expression and DNA binding analyses revealed that BCL6 controls gene networks involved in cell growth and fatty acid biosynthesis. Using deuterium label incorporation and comprehensive adipokine and lipid profiling, we discovered that ablation of adipocyte Bcl6 enhances subcutaneous adipocyte , increases levels of adiponectin and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), and prevents steatosis. Thus, our studies identify BCL6 as a negative regulator of subcutaneous adipose tissue expansion and metabolic health.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Both animal models and to a lesser extent human studies, have associated BMI, a measure of obesity, with alterations in sperm DNA methylation and RNAs. Sperm RNAs from the Assessment of Multiple Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation trial, were isolated and sequenced. A Generalized Linear Model identified 487 BMI associated human sperm RNA elements (short exon-sized sequences). They partitioned into four patterns; a continual increase with BMI, increase once obese (BMI>30 kg/m); a steady decrease with BMI; and decrease once overweight (BMI 25 - 30 kg/m). Gene Ontology revealed a unique relationship between BMI and transcripts associated with chromosome organization, , cellular stress and obesity-related inflammation. Coregulatory networks linked by Chromatin remodeler cofactors, RNA interactors, Erasers and Writers (CREWs) were uncovered to reveal a hierarchical epigenetic response pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331100>Transcriptome Analysis of Landrace Pig Subcutaneous Preadipocytes during Adipogenic Differentiation.</a></h2><p>Fat deposition in pigs, which significantly contributes to meat quality, fattening efficiency, reproductive performance, and immunity, is critically affected by preadipocyte adipogenic differentiation. We elucidated  in pigs using transcriptome analysis. Preadipocytes from subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of Landrace piglets were differentiated into adipocytes in vitro. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during preadipocyte differentiation up to day 8 revealed 15,918 known and 586 novel genes. We detected 21, 144, and 394 DEGs, respectively, including 16 genes differentially expressed at days 2, 4 and 8 compared to day 0. Th number of DEGs increased time-dependently. Lipid metabolism, cell differentiation and proliferation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, and steroid biosynthesis were significant at days 2, 4, and 8 compared to day 0 (adjusted  < 0.05). Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis obtained 26 clusters of differential gene expression patterns, and nine were significant ( < 0.05). Functional analysis showed many significantly enriched lipid deposition- and cellular process-related biological processes and pathways in profiles 9, 21, 22, and 24. Glycerolipid and fatty-acid metabolism, PPAR signaling, fatty-acid degradation, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase  (Akt), and TNF signaling were observed during preadipocyte differentiation in vitro. These findings will facilitate the comprehension of preadipocyte differentiation and fat deposition in pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30448348>Channeling of newly synthesized fatty acids to cholesterol esterification limits triglyceride synthesis in SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells.</a></h2><p>SND1 is a putative oncoprotein whose molecular function remains unclear. Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid metabolism that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and fatty acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of oleic acid, the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

Initial is revealed that alterations of macroautophagy disturb adipogenic differentiation in cultured cells, and in mice, leading to a drastic reduction of adipose tissue depots. Nevertheless, more recent studies indicate that autophagy participates in the control of adipose tissue biology in a more complex manner. The protein TP53INP2 activates the formation of autophagosomes by binding to ATG8 proteins such as LC3 or GATE16, and its genetic elimination reduces but does not cancel this activity. TP53INP2 deficiency increases adipogenic differentiation and induces a gain in adiposity in the mouse. At the cellular level, TP53INP2 promotes the sequestration of the regulatory protein GSK3β in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by a process that involves autophagic activity and the participation of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Through this mechanism, TP53INP2 stabilizes and activates β-catenin, which in turn triggers the inhibition of . In summary, autophagic pathways provide a whole set of mechanisms that may regulate in an opposite way the biology of adipose tissue, and consequently, have a variable impact on the whole body adiposity. This concept may be extensible to other cell types.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30721637> Expression Is Regulated by Cell Differentiation and Overfeeding in Human Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>: The  gene variant rs7903146 has the largest effect on type 2 diabetes risk reported in genome-wide association studies, however its role in adipose tissue development and function is unknown. We investigate the association between gene variant rs7903146 and metabolic parameters and examine in vitro and ex vivo gene expression of  in human adipose tissue and progenitor cells from two independent populations of young healthy men with increased risk of type 2 diabetes due to low birth weight (LBW). : Adipose tissue biopsies were excised from 40 healthy young men with low and normal birth weights (NBW) after a control and 5-day high-fat overfeeding diet. In another cohort including 13 LBW and 13 NBW men, adipocyte progenitor cells were isolated and cultivated. Transcriptome-wide expression was performed on RNA extracted from biopsies or cell cultures. : Diet-induced peripheral insulin resistance is more pronounced in carriers of the T-risk allele rs7903146, whereas no association with hepatic insulin resistance was shown.  expression increased during  in isolated preadipocytes from both LBW and NBW men (p < 0.001) and correlated positively with markers of progenitor cell proliferation and maturation capacity. In the mature adipose tissue, LBW men had lower expression of  compared to NBW men at baseline (p = 0.03) and  expression was suppressed by short-term overfeeding in NBW men (p = 0.005). : The results suggest a regulation of  expression during  and in mature adipose tissue upon overfeeding, and further that young men exposed to an adverse intrauterine environment have reduced mature adipose tissue  expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30588186>Melatonin and Vitamin D Orchestrate Adipose Derived Stem Cell Fate by Modulating Epigenetic Regulatory Genes.</a></h2><p>Melatonin, that regulates many physiological processes including circadian rhythms, is a molecule able to promote osteoblasts maturation in vitro and to prevent bone loss in vivo, while regulating also adipocytes metabolism. In this regard, we have previously shown that melatonin in combination with vitamin D, is able to counteract the appearance of an adipogenic phenotype in adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), cultured in an adipogenic favoring condition. In the present study, we aimed at evaluating the specific phenotype elicited by melatonin and vitamin D based medium, considering also the involvement of epigenetic regulating genes. ADSCs were cultured in a specific adipogenic conditioned media, in the presence of melatonin alone or with vitamin D. The expression of specific osteogenic related genes was evaluated at different time points, together with the histone deacetylases epigenetic regulators, HDAC1 and Sirtuins (SIRT) 1 and 2. Our results show that melatonin and vitamin D are able to modulate ADSCs commitment towards osteogenic phenotype through the upregulation of HDAC1, SIRT 1 and 2, unfolding an epigenetic regulation in stem cell differentiation and opening novel strategies for future therapeutic balancing of stem cell fate toward adipogenic or osteogenic phenotype.</p></html>
