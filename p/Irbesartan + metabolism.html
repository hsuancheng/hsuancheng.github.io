Pretreatment baseline blood pressure (BP) and posttreatment BP on the 28th day were measured. Plasma  concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence. The KCNJ11 I337V gene polymorphism was determined using high-throughput TaqMan technology.The HapMap data in the Han Chinese population showed that the I337V was used as a representative for 4 common functional polymorphisms. Our results showed that the association of antihypertensive response to  and the KCNJ11 genetic variant in the total sample was not significant. However, in nonsmokers, relative to the GG genotype, subjects with the homozygous AA genotype had a significantly higher therapeutic response to  (adjusted beta ± SE: 4.7±1.9 mm Hg, P = 0.015). In smokers, the subjects with the homozygous AA genotype had a significantly lower therapeutic response to  (adjusted beta ± SE: -5.6±2.5 mm Hg, P = 0.026). A multivariate linear regression model confirmed that there was a significant interactive effect between the KCNJ11 gene and smoking on  treatment (interaction P = 0.001).The interactive effect of smoking status and the KCNJ11 genotype may influence the antihypertensive effects of , which indicates a consideration for future individualized antihypertensive drug treatment.© American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2015.

Relating the initial albuminuria reduction to subsequent renoprotection assumes that the initial ARB-induced albuminuria reduction remains stable during follow-up. The aim of this study was to assess individual albuminuria fluctuations after the initial ARB response and to determine whether taking individual albuminuria fluctuations into account improves renal outcome prediction.Patients with diabetes and nephropathy treated with losartan or  in the RENAAL and IDNT trials were included. Patients with >30% reduction in albuminuria 3 months after ARB initiation were stratified by the subsequent change in albuminuria until Month 12 in enhanced responders (>50% albuminuria reduction), sustained responders (between 20 and 50% reduction), and response escapers (<20% reduction). Predictive performance of the individual albuminuria exposure until Month 3 was compared with the exposure over the first 12 months using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.Following ARB initiation, 388 (36.3%) patients showed an >30% reduction in albuminuria. Among these patients, the albuminuria level further decreased in 174 (44.8%), remained stable in 123 (31.7%), and increased in 91 (23.5%) patients. Similar albuminuria fluctuations were observed in patients with <30% albuminuria reduction. Renal risk prediction improved when using the albuminuria exposure during the first 12 months versus the initial Month 3 change [ROC difference: 0.78 (95% CI 0.75-0.82) versus 0.68 (0.64-0.72); P < 0.0001].Following the initial response to ARBs, a large within-patient albuminuria variability is observed. Hence, incorporating multiple albuminuria measurements over time in risk algorithms may be more appropriate to monitor treatment effects and quantify renal risk.© The Author 2016.

Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) efficaciously suppressed angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis by blocking insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) signaling. However, the detailed mechanism by which ANG II induces ERK-mediated IGF-IIR signaling remains elusive. Here, we found that ANG II activated ERK to upregulate IGF-IIR expression via the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT R). ERK activation subsequently phosphorylates HSF1 at serine 307, leading to a secondary phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase III (GSK3) at serine 303. Moreover, we found that ANG II mediated ERK/GSK3-induced IGF-IIR protein stability by downregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase of IGF-IIR RING finger protein CXXVI (RNF126). The expression of RNF126 decreased following ANG II-induced HSF1 phosphorylation, resulting in IGF-IIR protein stability and increased cardiomyocyte injury. Inhibition of GSK3 significantly alleviated ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that HSF1 phosphorylation stabilizes IGF-IIR protein stability by downregulating RNF126 during cardiac hypertrophy. ANG II activates ERK/GSK3 to phosphorylate HSF1, resulting in RNF126 degradation, which stabilizes IGF-IIR protein expression and eventually results in cardiac hypertrophy. HSF1 could be a valuable therapeutic target for cardiac diseases among hypertensive patients.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992096>Twenty-Four-Hour Urine α -Microglobulin as a Marker of Hypertension-Induced Renal Impairment and Its Response on Different Blood Pressure-Lowering Drugs.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the role of urine α -microglobulin as a marker of hypertension-induced renal damage compared with estimated glomerular filtration rate, (eGFR), urine albumin, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Its response on different blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs was also studied. Sixty never-treated hypertensive patients (65.0% men, 46.9 years, BP 141.4/94.0 mm Hg) were randomized to an  (an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) or a diltiazem (a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker [CCB])-based regimen. Patients with diabetes or established cardiovascular, renal, or liver disease were excluded. Blood samples and 24-hour urine were analyzed at baseline and 6 months after pharmaceutical BP normalization. Serum creatinine was measured and eGFR was calculated. Urine albumin, creatinine, and α -microglobulin were measured and ACR was calculated. Minor changes (P=not significant [NS]) in eGFR were noted during follow-up in both groups (from 111.0 mL/min/1.73 m to 108.4 mL/min/1.73 m in the ARB group and from 111.3 mL/min/1.73 m to 114.0 mL/min/1.73 m in the CCB group). Twenty-four-hour urine indices were all significantly improved (P<.01) in the ARB group (albumin from 19.4 mg/L to 8.2 mg/L, ACR from 21.5 mg/g to 10.0 mg/g, α -microglobulin from 5.06 mg/L to 3.64 mg/L) but not (P=NS) in the CCB group (albumin from 15.6 mg/L to 13.9 mg/L, ACR from 17.6 mg/g to 17.1 mg/g, α -microglobulin from 4.94 mg/L to 4.79 mg/L). These differences between groups remained significant (P<.05) after adjusting for office heart rate and BP. α -Microglobulin was significantly correlated (P<.05) with albumin and ACR both at baseline (r=0.283 and 0.299, respectively) and at the end of follow-up (r=0.432 and 0.465, respectively) but not (P=NS) with eGFR. It was also significantly related (P<.05) to cardiovascular risk scores (Framingham and HeartScore) both at baseline (r=0.264 and 0.436, respectively) and at the end of follow-up (r=0.308 and 0.472, respectively). Urine α -microglobulin emerges as a potentially usable marker of hypertension-induced renal impairment. Its excretion rate and its response to treatment appears similar to that of albumin.  but not diltiazem seems to be associated with reduced excretion of α -microglobulin in urine.© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756096>Protective Effect of  an Angiotensin (AT1) Receptor Antagonist in Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress Induced Depression in Mice.</a></h2><p> Oxidative stress and alternation of renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various cardio vascular, endocrine including mood and anxiety disorders.

Apart from their activity towards the circulatory system, ARBs also penetrate the blood-brain barrier and display neuroprotective effects. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous metabolite of tryptophan produced by kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) in the brain. Antagonism towards all ionotropic glutamate (GLU) receptors is the main mechanism of KYNA action. An elevated brain level of KYNA is linked with memory impairment and psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of three ARBs: , losartan, and telmisartan on KYNA production and KAT II activity in rat brain. The effect of ARBs on KYNA production was analyzed in rat brain cortical slices and on isolated KAT II enzyme. , losartan, and telmisartan decreased KYNA production and KAT II activity in a dose-dependent manner in rat brain cortex in vitro. Molecular docking suggested that the examined ARBs could bind to an active site of KAT II. In conclusion, ARBs decrease KYNA production in rat brain by direct inhibition of KAT II enzymatic activity. This novel mechanism of ARBs action may be advantageous in the treatment of cognitive impairment or the management of schizophrenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216240>Chinese herbal medicine Tangshen Formula treatment of patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease with macroalbuminuria: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus and the main cause of end-stage renal disease.

However, the underlying mechanisms that improve hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis are unclear. This study investigated the effects of Irb on lipid  and hepatic steatosis using the spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model. The results demonstrated body and liver weight, food consumption, lipid content in serum and liver tissue, and liver dysfunction as well as hepatic steatosis were increased in db/db mice compared with db/m mice, whereas the increases were reversed by Irb treatment. Moreover, Irb administration resulted in an increase in LC3BII as well as the LC3BII/I ratio through activating PPAR-γ and p-AMPK and inhibiting p-Akt and p-mTOR, thereby inducing autophagy in the db/db mouse liver. Therefore, our findings suggest that Irb can ameliorate hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis by upregulating the expression of PPAR-γ, activating the AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing liver autophagy.Copyright © 2016.

However, its mechanisms still remain unclear. We examined the extent to which the angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker (AT1RB)  and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril affected the apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats.Animals were divided into five groups of eight each, four of which received STZ (60mg/kg in a single dose, i.p.) to induce diabetes. The groups were performed as untreated diabetic; non-diabetic control; daily  (15mg/kg/day) or perindopril (6mg/kg/day) and also combined  and perindopril (respectively, 5mg/kg/day, 3mg/kg/day) were applied by gavage for 30days to STZ-diabetic rats. The kidney tissue analysis was performed by using immunohistochemical staining with Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 antibodies and by using Western blot analysis with caspase-3 and cytochrome-c antibodies.Immunoreactivity of Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 was increased in the tubuli and glomeruli of the untreated diabetic group, but decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In the  and perindopril treated diabetic groups Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was higher than that of the untreated diabetic group. Caspase-3 and cytoplasmic cytochrome-c protein levels increased in the untreated diabetic group.We conclude that the increased expression of Bax and caspase-3, and the increased level of cytoplasmic cytochrome-c relate to renal tissue injury. This case is also seen in the early stages of diabetes as a result of the damage caused by local increased expression of renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the renal tissue, which is induced by hyperglycemia. The increase of the cytosolic cytochrome-c, caspase-3 and Ku70 expression in the tubuli is suggestive of apoptosis. Overall, our results show that treatments of  and perindopril are effective and efficient in preventing renal tissue injury and apoptosis by blocking the RAS in experimental diabetic nephropathy and reducing the expression of proteins associated with apoptosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The angiotensin II/AT1R/AT2R signaling pathway and its biological effects in the context of ESCC were investigated in vitro and in vivo.In human samples, AT1R overexpression was univariately associated with inferior overall survival and remained multivariately independent (hazard ratio=1.812). In vitro, angiotensin II stimulated the growth of ESCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with  or AT1R-RNAi knockdown but not treatment with PD123319 significantly decreased the level of angiotensin II-induced ESCC cell proliferation. Angiotensin II also caused mTOR activation in a dose-dependent manner, and everolimus or mTOR-RNAi knockdown significantly suppressed the level of angiotensin II-induced ESCC cell proliferation. Furthermore, AT1R-RNAi knockdown suppressed the activation of mTOR. Clinically, AT1R expression was also correlated with phosphorylated mTOR expression. In a xenograft model, local angiotensin II injection enhanced tumor growth, and this effect could be decreased by treatment with  or everolimus. In a 4-NQO-induced-ESCC murine model,  significantly decreased the incidence of esophageal tumor.These findings suggest that AT1R overexpression is an independent adverse prognosticator for patients with ESCC and that angiotensin II/AT1R signaling stimulates ESCC growth, in part through mTOR activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29635129>Renal protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin alone and in combination with  in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Considering the complementary mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors and angiotensin inhibitors on kidney, it is postulated that combination of both agents could afford greater protection against diabetic renal injury. So, we investigated renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, alone and in combination with  in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats, injected with nicotinamide-streptozotocin, were treated orally for 12 weeks with either vehicle, dapagliflozin 2 mg/kg/day,  30 mg/kg/day, or combination of both drugs; respectively. Biochemical analysis included blood glucose, HbA1c, urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, TGF-β1, sRAGE, oxidative markers, and histopathological examination of kidneys. Treatment with dapagliflozin, , and especially their combination, produced significant reduction in albuminuria, improved renal function parameters, increased sRAGE level and improved inflammatory and oxidative markers, together with amelioration of renal histopathological changes. Beside glycemic control, dapagliflozin produced higher sRAGE levels than , suggesting that inhibition of AGE-RAGE axis is important in its renoprotective action. Combination of dapagliflozin and  produced more remarkable protective effects on renal function and structure, than use of either agent alone.

While laboratory studies have shown that pharmaceuticals can affect fish behaviour, there is a lack of understanding if behaviour is similarly affected in natural environments. Here, we exposed sea trout (Salmo trutta) smolts to two concentrations of two pharmaceutical pollutants often detected in surface waters: temazepam (a benzodiazepine, anxiolytic) or  (an angiotensin II receptor blocker, anti-hypertensive). We tested the hypothesis that changes to behavioural traits (anxiety and activity) measured in laboratory trials following exposure are predictive of behaviour in the natural environment (downstream migration). Measures of anxiety and activity in the laboratory assay did not vary with temazepam treatment, but temazepam-exposed fish began migrating faster in the field. Activity in the laboratory assay did predict overall migration speed in the field. In contrast to temazepam, we found that  exposure did not affect behaviour in the laboratory, field, or the relationship between the two endpoints. However,  was also not readily taken up into fish tissue (i.e. below detection levels in the muscle tissue), while temazepam bioconcentrated (bioconcentration factor 7.68) rapidly (t < 24 h). Our findings add to a growing literature showing that benzodiazepine pollutants can modulate fish behaviour and that laboratory assays may be less sensitive at detecting the effects of pollutants compared to measuring effects in natural settings. Therefore, we underscore the importance of measuring behavioural effects in the natural environment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We excluded patients with previous history of coronary artery disease and/or ischemic pattern of hyper enhancement on LGE MRI. Myocardial enhancement was defined using signal intensity >2SD above the mean signal intensity of a remote myocardium. Major adverse cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular death and heart failure requiring hospitalization.During a mean follow up period of 851 ± 609 days, 10 events (2 cardiovascular death, 8 hospitalization for heart failure decompensation) were observed. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of LGE% for the detection of future events was 0.721 (95% CI: 0.628-0.802). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that LGE% is an independent predictor of future events after the adjustment with prognostic 5 factors - age, diabetes mellitus, New York Heart Association classification, history of heart failure hospitalization and left ventricular ejection fraction - which were identified in the I-PRESERVE study ( in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Study) (hazard ratio=7.913, 95% CI: 1.603-39.05, P=0.012).Larger size of LGE was significantly associated with high rate of future cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization, suggesting that the quantification of myocardial focal fibrosis by LGE MRI could be useful for the risk stratification in HFpEF patients.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We investigated whether the phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate may enhance the antiproteinuric effect of RAS inhibitors in patients with CKD.Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover trial.Between November 2013 and December 2014, we enrolled 53 patients with CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs)>15mL/min/1.73m and residual proteinuria with protein excretion≥0.5g/24h despite maximal tolerated ramipril and/or  therapy from 2 nephrology units in Italy.After stratification by serum phosphate level, ≤4 or>4mg/dL, patients were randomly assigned to 3 months of sevelamer (1,600mg thrice daily) treatment followed by 3 months without sevelamer separated by a 1-month washout period or 3 months without sevelamer followed by 3 months with sevelamer, also separated by a 1-month washout period.The primary outcome was 24-hour proteinuria (n=49patients). Secondary outcomes included measured GFR (using iohexol plasma clearance), office blood pressure (BP), serum lipid levels, levels of inflammation and bone  biomarkers, urinary electrolyte levels, and arterial stiffness.Changes in proteinuria during the 3-month treatment with (from 1.36 [IQR, 0.77-2.51] to 1.36 [IQR, 0.77-2.60] g/24h) or without (from 1.36 [IQR, 0.99-2.38] to 1.48 [IQR, 0.81-2.77] g/24h) sevelamer were similar (P=0.1). Sevelamer reduced urinary phosphate excretion without affecting serum phosphate levels. Sevelamer reduced C-reactive protein (CRP), glycated hemoglobin, and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels without affecting levels of office BP, measured GFR, fibroblast growth factor 23, klotho, intact parathyroid hormone, serum vitamin D, or other urinary electrolytes. Results were similar in the low- and high-phosphate groups. Sevelamer was well tolerated. Adverse events were comparable between treatment periods. One case of transient hypophosphatemia was observed during treatment with sevelamer.Short treatment duration, lower pretreatment proteinuria than expected.3-month sevelamer treatment did not reduce proteinuria in patients with CKD on maximal RAS blockade. Amelioration of inflammation and dyslipidemia with sevelamer treatment raises the possibility that it may confer benefit in patients with CKD beyond reduction of proteinuria.Sanofi (Milan, Italy).Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with study number .Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

The aim of our study was to determine the efficacy of rapamycin, everolimus,  and captopril, alone and in combination, as antifibrotic agents in the Mdr2(-/-) model of cholestasis both in early injury and established disease.Mdr2(-/-) mice were treated for 4 weeks with vehicle, rapamycin (1 mg/kg) or everolimus (5 mg/kg) every second day or with captopril (30 mg/kg/day),  (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Further groups of 3-week-old Mdr2(-/-) mice were treated with rapamycin and  in combination (1 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day) or with rapamycin (2 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Liver injury and fibrosis were compared between treated and untreated animals.There were no significant improvements in liver injury, histology, hepatic hydroxyproline or profibrogenic gene expression following treatment with rapamycin, everolimus, captopril or  at any time point studied. Likewise, there were no improvements in liver histology or profibrogenic gene expression following combination therapy or high-dose rapamycin treatment.The antifibrotic effects of rapamycin, everolimus, captopril and  seen in other models of fibrosis were not replicated in the Mdr2(-/-) model in this study. This highlights the clear need to test specific antifibrotic agents in a number of different animal models. We believe this animal model is ideal to study usefulness of antifibrotic agents in cholestatic liver disease because of the similarity in genetics and hepatic histopathology to human cholestatic liver disease.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Four randomized, double-blind, parallel group studies with a similar design, including 1469 hypertensive patients uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy and with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor, compared the efficacy of a combination of a sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor (zofenopril at 30 or 60 mg) or an ARB ( at 150 or 300 mg) plus HCTZ 12.5 mg. The extent of blood pressure (BP)-lowering was assessed in the office and over 24 h. Pleiotropic features of the treatments were evaluated by studying their effect on systemic inflammation, organ damage, arterial stiffness, and  biochemical parameters. Both treatments similarly reduced office and ambulatory BPs after 18-24 weeks. In the ZODIAC study a larger reduction in high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was observed under zofenopril (-0.52 vs. +0.97 mg/dL under , p = 0.001), suggesting a potential protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis. In the ZENITH study the rate of carotid plaque regression was significantly larger under zofenopril (32% vs. 16%; p = 0.047). In the diabetic patients of the ZAMES study, no adverse effects of treatments on blood glucose and lipids as well as an improvement of renal function were observed. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension of the ZEUS study, a slight and similar improvement in renal function and small reductions in pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI), and central systolic BP were documented with both treatments. Thus, the fixed combination of zofenopril and HCTZ may have a relevant place in the treatment of high-risk or monotherapy-treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients requiring a more prompt, intensive, and sustained BP reduction, in line with the recommendations of current guidelines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405294>Angiotensin II and the Natriuretic and Blood Pressure Response to Mental Stress in African Americans.</a></h2><p>To test the hypothesis that Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a contributing factor to the response pattern in African Americans (AAs) who retain rather than excrete sodium during mental stress.Double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial of 87 healthy AAs aged 18 to 50 years.The study participants received either a placebo or , (150 mg PO), an Ang II receptor antagonist, for seven days prior to stress testing.

The target compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few μg/L, which are in the range commonly found in municipal wastewater of the studied area. The changes in concentrations between two sampling points were negligible for most compounds, i.e. from -10 to 10%. A higher decrease in concentrations (25-60 %) during the pass through the pipe was observed for diltiazem, citalopram, clarithromycin, bezafibrate and amlodipine. Negative removal was calculated for sulfamethoxazole (-66 ± 15%) and  (-58 ± 25%), which may be due to the conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds in the sewer. The results show that microbial transformation of pharmaceuticals begins in sewer, albeit to different extents for different compounds. Therefore, the in-sewer transformation of pharmaceuticals should be assessed especially when their concentrations are used to estimate and refine the estimation of their per capita consumption in a catchment of interest in the sewage epidemiology approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26909689>Effects of Uric Acid on the NO Production of HUVECs and its Restoration by Urate Lowering Agents.</a></h2><p>Although urate impaired the endothelial function, its underlying mechanism remains unknown.

Our previous research found that carnosic acid (CA) or rosemary extract can effectively improve glucose and lipid  disorder by inhibiting SREBPs.In this study, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of CA on the DN.The mice glomerular mesangial cells (mGMCs) were used to evaluate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammation effects of CA under high glucose (HG) condition. Furthermore, db/db mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of CA against DN in vivo.The results showed that CA activated Nrf2, inhibited NF-κB pathway and regulated related downstream genes in mGMC under HG condition. A 14-week treatment of mice with CA reduced water uptake and urine volume, attenuated diabetes-induced albuminuria, increased urine creatinine, and subsequently improved the glomerular sclerosis and mesangial expansion in db/db mice. Similarly, a 20-week oral administration of CA improved kidney damage in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In addition, CA inhibited the expression of profibrotic factors, such as TGF-β1, fibronectin and E-cadherin. Compared to , CA exerted better glucose lowering effect, and in kidney, CA was more potent to reduce fibronectin and E-cadherin expression. In all the animal experiment, CA did not lead to abnormal damages to other tissues.These findings suggest that CA is a safe compound which exerts the protective effects on diabetes-induced kidney complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

All ARBs have high affinity for the AT receptor, expressed in various tissues, including smooth muscle cells, heart, kidney, and brain. Since activation of ATR, the target of these drugs, leads, among other effects, to vascular smooth muscle cell growth, proliferation and contraction, activation of fibroblasts, cardiac hypertrophy, aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, thirst-fluid intake (hypervolemia), etc., the ARBs are nowadays one of the most useful cardiovascular drug classes used in clinical practice. However, significant differences in their pharmacological and clinical properties exist that may favor use of particular agents over others within the class, and, in fact, two of these drugs, candesartan and valsartan, continuously appear to distinguish themselves from the rest of the 'pack' in recent clinical trials. The reason(s) for the potential superiority of these two agents within the ARB class are currently unclear but under intense investigation. The present short review gives an overview of the clinical properties of the ARBs currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, with a particular focus on candesartan and valsartan and the areas where these two drugs seem to have a therapeutic edge. In the second part of our review, we outline recent data from our laboratory (mainly) on the molecular effects of the ARB drugs on aldosterone production and on circulating aldosterone levels, which may underlie (at least in part) the apparent clinical superiority of candesartan (and valsartan) over most other ARBs currently in clinical use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669009>Neuroprotective effects of AT1 receptor antagonists after experimental ischemic stroke: what is important?</a></h2><p>The present study conducted in rats defines the requirements for neuroprotective effects of systemically administered AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) in acute ischaemic stroke. The inhibition of central effects to angiotensin II (ANG II) after intravenous (i.v.) treatment with candesartan (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) or  and losartan (3 and 30 mg/kg) was employed to study the penetration of these ARBs across the blood-brain barrier. Verapamil and probenecid were used to assess the role of the transporters, P-glycoprotein and the multidrug resistance-related protein 2, in the entry of losartan and  into the brain. Neuroprotective effects of i.v. treatment with the ARBs were investigated after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min. The treatment with the ARBs was initiated 3 h after the onset of MCAO and continued for two consecutive days. Blood pressure was continuously recorded before and during MCAO until 5.5 h after the onset of reperfusion. The higher dose of candesartan completely abolished, and the lower dose of candesartan and higher doses of  and losartan partially inhibited the drinking response to intracerebroventricular ANG II. Only 0.3 mg/kg candesartan improved the recovery from ischaemic stroke, and 3 mg/kg candesartan did not exert neuroprotective effects due to marked blood pressure reduction during reperfusion. Both doses of  and losartan had not any effect on the stroke outcome. An effective, long-lasting blockade of brain AT1 receptors after systemic treatment with ARBs without extensive blood pressure reductions is the prerequisite for neuroprotective effects in ischaemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27129187>Blood pressure-independent renoprotection in diabetic rats treated with AT1 receptor-neprilysin inhibition compared with AT1 receptor blockade alone.</a></h2><p>ARNI [dual AT1 (angiotensin II type 1) receptor-neprilysin inhibition] exerts beneficial effects on blood pressure and kidney function in heart failure, compared with ARB (AT1 receptor blockade) alone. We hypothesized that ARNI improves cardiac and kidney parameters in diabetic TGR(mREN2)27 rats, an angiotensin II-dependent hypertension model. Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin for 5 or 12 weeks. In the final 3 weeks, rats were treated with vehicle,  (ARB) or +thiorphan (ARNI). Blood pressure, measured by telemetry in the 5-week group, was lowered identically by ARB and ARNI. The heart weight/tibia length ratio in 12-week diabetic animals was lower after ARNI compared with after ARB. Proteinuria and albuminuria were observed from 8 weeks of diabetes onwards. ARNI reduced proteinuria more strongly than ARB, and a similar trend was seen for albuminuria. Kidneys of ARNI-treated animals showed less severe segmental glomerulosclerosis than those of ARB-treated animals. After 12 weeks, no differences between ARNI- and ARB-treated animals were found regarding diuresis, natriuresis, plasma endothelin-1, vascular reactivity (acetylcholine response) or kidney sodium transporters. Only ARNI-treated rats displayed endothelin type B receptor-mediated vasodilation. In conclusion, ARNI reduces proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and heart weight in diabetic TGR(mREN2)27 rats more strongly than does ARB, and this occurs independently of blood pressure.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818100>Degradation of seventeen contaminants of emerging concern in municipal wastewater effluents by sonochemical advanced oxidation processes.</a></h2><p>The simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants in effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) of Bogotá-Colombia was studied using high frequency ultrasound (375 kHz). The considered compounds in the effluent corresponded to pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, losartan, , sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, trimethoprim and clindamycin); cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine. Due to limitation of the MWTP for the pollutants elimination, ultrasound was applied to remove these compounds. Interestingly, ultrasonic physical action led to releasing of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from suspended solids, whereas the chemical effects induced degradation of the rest of compounds. For the latter ones, an interesting correlation between the sonodegradation and arithmetic multiplication between hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was established. Afterwards, the sonochemical process was complemented with ferrous ions (sono-Fenton), ferrous ions plus light (sono-photo-Fenton) or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid (sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid). Additionally, to clarify fundamental aspects of the different systems, individual treatments in distilled water of a model pollutant (valsartan) were performed. The complemented processes significantly enhanced all compounds degradation, following the order: sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid > sono-photo-Fenton ∼ sono-Fenton > sonochemistry. The Fe addition improved the pollutants elimination by generation of more hydroxyl radicals in the solution bulk. Meanwhile, oxalic acid avoided Fe precipitation favoring the iron catalytic cycle. Thus, the work demonstrates the high potentiality of the sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid system for the pollutants elimination in real-world wastewater matrices.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease, which is related to very high cost and mortality. Novel biomarkers can provide insight into the novel mechanism, facilitate early detection, and monitor progression of CKD and its response to therapeutic interventions. To identify potential biomarkers, we applied an UPLC-HDMS together with univariate and multivariate statistical analyses using plasma samples from patients with CKD of diverse etiologies (100 sera in discovery set and 120 sera in validation set) and two different rat models of CKD. Using comprehensive screening and validation workflow, we identified a panel of seven metabolites that were shared by all patients and animals regardless of the underlying cause of CKD. These included ricinoleic acid, stearic acid, cytosine, LPA(16:0), LPA(18:2), 3-methylhistidine, and argininic acid. The combination of these seven biomarkers enabled the discrimination of patients with CKD from healthy subjects with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 96.7%.

In the present study, we examined the relative potencies of all the currently used in the clinic AT₁R antagonist drugs (angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs, or sartans) at preventing activation of these two signaling mediators (G proteins and βarrs) at the AngII-bound AT1R and, consequently, at suppression of aldosterone in vitro. All ARBs were found to be potent inhibitors of G protein activation at the AT₁R. However, candesartan and valsartan were the most potent at blocking AngII-induced βarr activation at this receptor, among the tetrazolo-biphenyl-methyl derivatives, translating into excellent efficacies at aldosterone suppression in H295R cells. Conversely,  and losartan were largely G protein-selective inhibitors at the AT₁R, with very low potency towards βarr inhibition. As a result, they were very weak suppressors of βarr1-dependent aldosterone production in H295R cells.

Hyperglycemia induces several pathological alterations which upregulate this system, accounting for overexpression of its downstream signaling molecules, amongst which angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone hold prime pathological notoriety. Although it is well known that elevated plasma levels of Ang II play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of type-II diabetic mellitus, by inducing and aggravating insulin resistance, it is not quite much known that it equally elevates the possibility/risk of development of diabetic complications. Also, amongst the various diabetic complications, the effects of Ang II upregulation are more widely acknowledged in studies concerning the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy; however, its role in exacerbating diabetic retinopathy has not received much attention. Ang II, indeed, plays a detrimental role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy by augmenting the principal events involved in its pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, angiogenesis and inflammation. The utility of angiotensin receptor blockers has shown positive results in research studies and hence, might potentially provide a novel adjuvant therapy for treating this complication and preventing the associated vision-loss in diabetic patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The Shen-Yan-Fang-Shuai Formula (SYFSF) is a traditional Chinese formula composed of Astragali radix, ,  Baill, and four other herbs. It has been widely used as an effective treatment for DKD patients in China. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying SYFSF's renoprotection. In this study, we compared the protective effect of SYFSF to  on the histology and renal cells in type 2 DKD rat model and high-glucose (HG) cultured mesangial cells, respectively. We found that SYFSF could significantly decrease urinary albumin, cholesterol, and triglyceride. And a decrease in serum creatinine was also found in SYFSF-treated group compared with -treated rats. In addition, SYFSF inhibited the interstitial expansion and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic rats. Notably, SYFSF markedly downregulated the expression of MCP-1, TGF-1, collagen IV, and fibronectin in diabetic rat models and HG-induced mesangial cell models. The renoprotection was closely associated with a reduced expression of TNF- and phosphorylated NF-Bp65. Our study suggests that SYFSF may ameliorate diabetic kidney injury. The observed renoprotection is probably attributable to an inhibition of inflammatory response and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation mediated by TNF-/NF-Bp65 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27496805>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-dependent renoprotection of murine kidney by .</a></h2><p>Activation of renal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is renoprotective, but there is no safe PPARα activator for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Studies have reported that  (Irbe), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) widely prescribed for CKD, activates hepatic PPARα. However, Irbe's renal PPARα-activating effects and the role of PPARα signalling in the renoprotective effects of Irbe are unknown. Herein, these aspects were investigated in healthy kidneys of wild-type (WT) and Ppara-null (KO) mice and in the murine protein-overload nephropathy (PON) model respectively. The results were compared with those of losartan (Los), another ARB that does not activate PPARα. PPARα and its target gene expression were significantly increased only in the kidneys of Irbe-treated WT mice and not in KO or Los-treated mice, suggesting that the renal PPARα-activating effect was Irbe-specific. Irbe-treated-PON-WT mice exhibited decreased urine protein excretion, tubular injury, oxidative stress (OS), and pro-inflammatory and apoptosis-stimulating responses, and they exhibited maintenance of fatty acid . Furthermore, the expression of PPARα and that of its target mRNAs encoding proteins involved in OS, pro-inflammatory responses, apoptosis and fatty acid  was maintained upon Irbe treatment. These renoprotective effects of Irbe were reversed by the PPARα antagonist MK886 and were not detected in Irbe-treated-PON-KO mice. These results suggest that Irbe activates renal PPARα and that the resultant increased PPARα signalling mediates its renoprotective effects.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25830765>Optimum AT1 receptor-neprilysin inhibition has superior cardioprotective effects compared with AT1 receptor blockade alone in hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>Neprilysin inhibitors prevent the breakdown of bradykinin and natriuretic peptides, promoting vasodilation and natriuresis.

Low- but not high-dose thiorphan prevented this rise. Only during exposure to low-dose thiorphan plus  did heart weight/body weight ratio, cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide expression, and myocyte size decrease significantly. Circulating endothelin-1 was not affected by low-dose thiorphan with or without , but increased after treatment with high-dose thiorphan plus . This endothelin-1 rise was accompanied by an increase in renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 protein abundance, and an upregulation of constrictor vascular endothelin type B receptors. Consequently, the endothelin type B receptor antagonist BQ788 no longer enhanced endothelin-1-induced vasoconstriction (indicative of endothelin type B receptor-mediated vasodilation), but prevented it. Thus, optimal neprilysin inhibitor dosing reveals additional cardioprotective effects on top of AT1 receptor blockade in renin-dependent hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155324>Angiotensin receptor blocker  reduces stress-induced intestinal inflammation via AT1a signaling and ACE2-dependent mechanism in mice.</a></h2><p>Stress is associated with pathophysiology of both irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang II type I receptor axis (AT1). Inhibition of the classical RAS pathway is also involved in upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which activates the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway to counteract inflammatory signaling and acts as a partner of the amino acid transporter, BAT-1, to absorb tryptophan for regulation of microbiota-gut-brain axis. In this study, we determined the effects of ARB  on stress-induced intestinal inflammation. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress. They were orally treated during the stress with either vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day . Restraint stress resulted in colon inflammation with higher histological damage scores, increased expression of Nox4, TLR-4 and IL1-β, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of the ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis. Stress also downregulated intestinal amino acid transporter, ACE2/BAT-1, and activity of intestinal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), resulting in decrease in α-defensins, changes in intestinal microbial contents, and perturbation of tryptophan  with activation of the kynurenine pathway. Administration of  inhibited activation of stress-induced AT1 pathway to reduce intestinal ROS accumulation and inflammation, restored expression of ACE2/BAT-1, activity of mTOR and p70S6K, dysbiosis and tryptophan . Our results suggest that AT1 is a potentially suitable therapeutic target in stress-induced intestinal inflammation, and that  could be beneficially suitable for the treatment of stressed patients with IBS.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We compared plasma copeptin concentration, a surrogate marker for vasopressin secretion, between patients with resistant hypertension and those with controlled blood pressure (CBP), in a post hoc analysis of the Prise en charge de l'Hypertension Artérielle RESistante au traitement trial.After 4-week treatment with  300 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day, and amlodipine 5 mg/day (baseline), 166 patients were classified as having resistant hypertension (n = 140) or CBP (n = 26) by ambulatory BP monitoring. Patients with resistant hypertension were then randomized for 12 weeks of sequential nephron blockade (n = 74) or sequential renin-angiotensin system blockade (n = 66). Plasma copeptin concentration was measured at baseline and week 12 by immunoassay.Baseline plasma copeptin concentration was positively associated with male sex, plasma osmolality, BP, and negatively with glomerular filtration rate. It was higher in the resistant hypertension than in the CBP group [geometric mean 5.7 (confidence interval 95% 5.1-6.4) vs. 2.9 (2.3-3.9) fmol/ml, adjusted P < 0.0001). The relationship between plasma copeptin concentration and urinary osmolality was similar in the two groups. At 12 weeks, plasma copeptin concentration in patients whose BP was controlled by sequential nephron blockade or sequential renin-angiotensin system blockade [6.8 (5.6-8.2) and 4.3 (3.0-5.9) fmol/ml, respectively) remained significantly higher than in patients with CBP at baseline (P < 0.0001 vs. both).In patients with resistant hypertension, plasma copeptin concentrations were approximately two-fold higher than those of patients with CBP, after adjustment for plasma osmolality.

Patients (n = 151) were randomly allocated to rosuvastatin (10 mg/d) plus telmisartan 80 mg/d (RT group, n = 52) or  300 mg/d (RI group, n = 48) or olmesartan 20 mg/d (RO group, n = 51). Total and intermediate HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels did not change in any group. Large HDL-C increased, while small HDL-C decreased significantly in all the groups (P = not significant between the groups). The mass of HDL lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (HDL-Lp-PLA2) and the activities of paraoxonase 1 remained unchanged in all the groups. However, HDL-Lp-PLA2 activity increased only in the RT group (+21.4%; P < .01 vs baseline) and did not change in the RI (-4.3%; P = .005 vs RT group) and RO (+3.2%; P = .01 vs RT) groups.

Therefore, AT1R blockers (ARBs) have been widely used as therapeutic drugs for these diseases. Recent basic research and clinical studies have resulted in the discovery of interesting phenomena associated with AT1R function. For example, ligand-independent activation of AT1R by mechanical stress and agonistic autoantibodies, as well as via receptor mutations, has been shown to decrease the inverse agonistic efficacy of ARBs, though the molecular mechanisms of such phenomena had remained elusive until recently. Furthermore, although AT1R is believed to exist as a monomer, recent studies have demonstrated that AT1R can homodimerize and heterodimerize with other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), altering the receptor signaling properties. Therefore, formation of both AT1R homodimers and AT1R-GPCR heterodimer may be involved in the pathogenesis of human disease states, such as atherosclerosis and preeclampsia. Finally, biased AT1R ligands that can preferentially activate the β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathway have been discovered. Such β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligands may be better therapeutic drugs for cardiovascular diseases. New findings on AT1R described herein could provide a conceptual framework for application of ARBs in the treatment of diseases, as well as for novel drug development. Since AT1R is an extensively studied member of the GPCR superfamily encoded in the human genome, this review is relevant for understanding the functions of other members of this superfamily.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated roles of Apelin in aortic remodeling and fibrosis in rats with transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to TAC and then randomized to daily deliver Apelin-13 (50μg/kg) or angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker  (50mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Pressure overload resulted in myocardial hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, aortic remodeling and adventitial fibrosis with reduced levels of Apelin in ascending aortas of rat after TAC compared with sham-operated group. These changes were associated with marked increases in levels of miRNA-122, TGFβ1, CTGF, NFAT5, LGR4, and β-catenin. More importantly, Apelin and  treatment strikingly prevented TAC-mediated aortic remodeling and adventitial fibrosis in pressure overloaded rats by blocking AT1 receptor and miRNA-122 levels and repressing activation of the CTGF-NFAT5 and LGR4-β-catenin signaling. In cultured primary rat adventitial fibroblasts, exposure to angiotensin II (100nmolL) led to significant increases in cellular migration and levels of TGFβ1, CTGF, NFAT5, LGR4 and β-catenin, which were effectively reversed by pre-treatment with Apelin (100nmolL) and miRNA-122 inhibitor (50nmolL). In conclusion, Apelin counterregulated against TAC-mediated ascending aortic remodeling and angiotensin II-induced promotion of cellular migration by blocking AT1 receptor and miRNA-122 levels and preventing activation of the TGFβ1-CTGF-NFAT5 and LGR4-β-catenin signaling, ultimately contributing to attenuation of aortic adventitial fibrosis.

This study explored the renal protective effect and possible mechanism of gliquidone in mice with diabetic nephropathy.Animal model of diabetic nephropathy was established in KKAy mice. The renal protective effect of gliquidone was studied by evaluating the kidney function through measures of urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr) and serum triglyceride (TG) that were performed using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The levels of oxidative stress indicators, such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were evaluated in renal tissue homogenates using the automatic biochemical analyzer. The inhibitory effect of gliquidone on renal interstitial fibrosis and its association with Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy was investigated using molecular biological techniques.It was found that low-, medium- and high-dose gliquidone improved the mice's general health condition, such as mental status, fur condition, eating, and drinking. Gliquidone reduced the body weight and the kidney weight /body weight ratio of mice. Gliquidone improved the kidney function, indicated by reductions in urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine and triglyceride. Gliquidone treatment increased levels of nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase, but decreased level of malondialdehyde. The expression of Jagged1/Notch1/hes1/Snail1/α-SMA decreased, while the expression of E-cadherin increased in gliquidone-treated kidneys. High dose gliquidone showed the best effect, one that was similar to that of the positive control drug .Taken together, our results suggested that gliquidone can ameliorate the diabetic symptoms of diabetic nephropathy through inhibiting Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway, improving anti -oxidative response and delaying renal interstitial fibrosis. The efficacy of gliquidone is dose-dependent.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

However currently clinical laboratory and histopathological tests do not provide region-specific and accurate biomarkers for early detection of kidney disease. The present study was conducted to identify sensitive biomarkers for early detection and progression of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy in aristolochic acid I-induced rats at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Biomarkers were validated using aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) rats at week 24, adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats and CKD patients. Compared with control rats, AAN rats showed anemia, increased serum urea and creatinine, progressive renal interstitial fibrosis, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-fibrotic proteins at weeks 8 and 12. However, no significant difference was found at week 4. Metabolomics identified 12-ketodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodesoxycholic acid, LPC(15:0) and docosahexaenoic acid as biomarkers for early detection of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy. With prolonging aristolochic acid I exposure, LPE(20:2), cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and LPC(17:0) were identified as biomarkers for progression from early to advanced AAN and lysoPE(22:5), indoxyl sulfate, uric acid and creatinine as biomarkers of advanced AAN.

The effects of ATR1 (), ATR2 (PD123319) and combined ATR1 and ATR2 blockade on the expression and activity of the MMPs and the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were investigated in explant culture experiments. Paired atheroma samples were incubated with the intervention or media control for 4 days. Protein levels (MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-4, ATR1 and ATR2) were determined by ELISA. Overall gelatinase activity and specific activation were measured by chromogenic activity assays and zymography, respectively.ATR1 blockade, but not ATR2 blockade significantly reduced TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 expression in atheroma supernatant. Combined ATR1 and ATR2 blockade significantly reduced MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression.

Fifteen compounds, commonly present in HWW, were considered: acetaminophen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, loratadine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, , sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Initially, HWW was characterized in terms of global parameters and the pharmaceuticals content. HWW contained a moderate amount of organic matter (i.e., total organic carbon: 131.56 mg L (C)) mainly associated to biodegradable components. However, the most of pharmaceuticals were found at levels upper than their predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Then, a conventional biological treatment was applied to the HWW. After 36 h, such process mainly removed biodegradable substances, but had a limited action on the pharmaceuticals. The resultant biotreated water was submitted to the sonochemical process (375 kHz and 88 W L, 1.5 h), which due to its chemical (i.e., radical attacks) and physical (i.e., suspended solids disaggregation) effects induced a considerable pharmaceuticals degradation (pondered removal: 58.82%), demonstrating the complementarity of the proposed combination. Afterwards, Fe (5 ppm) and UVC light (4 W) were added to the sonochemical system (generating sono-photo-Fenton process), which significantly increased up to 82.86% the pondered pharmaceuticals removal. Subsequently, to understand fundamental aspects of the pharmaceuticals degradations, a model compound (norfloxacin) in distilled water was treated by sonochemical system, sono-photo-Fenton process and their sub-systems (i.e., sono-Fenton and UVC alone). This allowed proving the hydroxyl radical action in sonochemical treatment, plus the contribution of Fenton reaction and direct photodegradation in the pharmaceuticals removal by sono-photo-Fenton. Finally, it was found that 91.13% of the initial pharmaceuticals load in HWW was removed by the biological/sono-photo-Fenton combination. The high pollutants abatement evidenced that this combination is a powerful alternative for removing pharmaceuticals from complex-matrix waters, such as raw HWW.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

CYP induces granulosa cell apoptosis and oxidative stress.  (IRB) is a unique ARB with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) agonistic activity. As PPAR-ɣ activation exerts anti-inflammatory effects and reduces ROS production, IRB may further reduce inflammatory chemokine expression and suppress apoptotic cell death. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of IRB on the development of CYP-induced ovarian damage. Rats were divided into four groups: control group, IRB group (100 mg/kg, orally), CYP group (100 mg/kg, i.p. single injection), and IRB+CYP group (IRB administered 9 days before and 6 days after CYP administration). Rats sacrificed on day 16 of experiment; estradiol (E2), FSH, and TNF-α levels were estimated in serum. Reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and caspase-3 activities, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and IL-10 levels were determined in ovarian tissues. Protein expressions of p53, caspase-3, Ki-67, and Rad-51 were estimated by immunohistochemical and Western blot techniques. CYP produced ovarian damage as indicated from the decline in serum E2; elevation in FSH; unbalance in tissue oxidative stress parameters; increase in MPO, TNF-α levels, caspase-3 activity/expression, p53, and Rad-51 expression; and decrease in IL-10 contents, without effect on Ki-67.

No available antimalarial drugs specifically target the endothelial disruptions underlying this complication, which is responsible for the majority of malaria-associated deaths. Here, we have demonstrated that ruptured Pf-iRBCs induce activation of β-catenin, leading to disruption of inter-endothelial cell junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Inhibition of β-catenin-induced TCF/LEF transcription in the nucleus of HBMECs prevented the disruption of endothelial junctions, confirming that β-catenin is a key mediator of P. falciparum adverse effects on endothelial integrity. Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) or stimulation of the type 2 receptor (AT2) abrogated Pf-iRBC-induced activation of β-catenin and prevented the disruption of HBMEC monolayers. In a mouse model of cerebral malaria, modulation of angiotensin II receptors produced similar effects, leading to protection against cerebral malaria, reduced cerebral hemorrhages, and increased survival. In contrast, AT2-deficient mice were more susceptible to cerebral malaria. The interrelation of the β-catenin and the angiotensin II signaling  opens immediate host-targeted therapeutic possibilities for cerebral malaria and other diseases in which brain endothelial integrity is compromised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078953>The application of a novel high-resolution mass spectrometry-based analytical strategy to rapid metabolite profiling of a dual drug combination in humans.</a></h2><p>Metabolite profiling of combination drugs in complex matrix is a big challenge. Development of an effective data mining technique for simultaneously extracting metabolites of one parent drug from both background matrix and combined drug-related signals could be a solution. This study presented a novel high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based data-mining strategy to fast and comprehensive metabolite identification of combination drugs in human. The model drug combination was verapamil- (VER-IRB), which is widely used in clinic to treat hypertension. First, mass defect filter (MDF), as a targeted data mining tool, worked effectively except for those metabolites with similar MDF values. Second, the accurate mass-based background subtraction (BS), as an untargeted data-mining tool, was able to recover all relevant metabolites of VER-IRB from the full-scan MS dataset except for trace metabolites buried in the background noise and/or combined drug-related signals. Third, the novel ring double bond (RDB; valence values of elements in structure) filter, could show rich structural information in more sensitive full-scan MS chromatograms; however, it had a low capability to remove background noise and was difficult to differentiate the metabolites with RDB coverage. Fourth, an integrated strategy, i.e., untargeted BS followed by RDB, was effective for metabolite identification of VER and IRB, which have different RDB values. Majority of matrix signals were firstly removed using BS. Metabolite ions for each parent drug were then isolated from remaining background matrix and combined drug-related signals by imposing of preset RDB values/ranges around the parent drug and selected core substructures. In parallel, MDF was used to recover potential metabolites with similar RDB. As a result, a total of 74 metabolites were found for VER-IRB in human plasma and urine, among which ten metabolites have not been previously reported in human. The results demonstrated that the combination of accurate mass-based multiple data-mining techniques, i.e., untargeted background subtraction followed by ring double bond filtering in parallel with targeted mass defect filtering, can be a valuable tool for rapid metabolite profiling of combination drug.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Competing-risk-adjusted proportional hazard models were developed based on the  Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and externally validated in the Reduction of Endpoints NIDDM with Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial.Predictors included in the model were age, sex, smoking sex, systolic blood pressure, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin and phosphorus. The median predicted 3-year risk without treatment was 6.0% for ESRD and 28.0% for CVD and mortality. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] predicted 3-year ARR was 1.2 (0.4-3.1)% for ESRD and 2.2 (1.8-2.6)% for CVD and mortality, resulting in a combined ARR of 3.4 (2.4-5.5)%. The remaining disease risk was 4.7 (IQR 1.7-12.8)% for ESRD and 25.8% (IQR 20.3-31.9)% for CVD and mortality.The combined effects of ARBs on ESRD and CVD and mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy vary considerably between patients.

For most drugs, the underlying mechanism of drug-induced myopathy remains unclear. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) mediate L-lactic acid transport, and inhibition of MCTs may potentially lead to perturbation of L-lactic acid accumulation and muscular disorders. Therefore, we hypothesized that L-lactic acid transport may be involved in the development of drug-induced myopathy. The aim of this study was to assess the inhibitory potential of 24 acidic drugs on L-lactic acid transport using breast cancer cell lines Hs578T and MDA-MB-231, which selectively express MCT1 and MCT4, respectively.The influx transport of L-lactic acid was minimally inhibited by all drugs tested. The efflux transport was next examined: loratadine (IC50: 10 and 61 µM) and atorvastatin (IC50: 78 and 41 µM) demonstrated the greatest potency for inhibition of L-lactic acid efflux by MCT1 and MCT4, respectively. Acidic drugs including fluvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin acid, lovastatin acid,  and losartan exhibited weak inhibitory potency on L-lactic acid efflux.Our results suggest that some acidic drugs, such as loratadine and atorvastatin, can inhibit the efflux transport of L-lactic acid.This inhibition may cause an accumulation of intracellular L-lactic acid leading to acidification and muscular disorders.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25901452>Production of β -cyclodextrin from pH and thermo stable Cyclodextrin Glycosyl Transferase, obtained from Arthrobacter mysorens and its evaluation as a drug carrier for .</a></h2><p>Cyclodextrins (CDs) are carrier molecules produced by cyclization of α-1,4-glucans by Cyclodextrin Glycosyl Transferase (CGTase).

In this work, degradation of selected emerging pollutants in the aqueous and solid phases of sewage sludge has been investigated after anaerobic digestion using two different digesters: mesophilic and thermophilic. Initially, sludge samples were screened by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) for identification of emerging contaminants in the samples. In a second step, a target quantitative method based on LC coupled to tandem MS was applied for selected pollutants identified in the previous screening. The behaviour of the compounds under anaerobic conditions was studied estimating the degradation efficiency and distribution of compounds between both sludge phases.  and benzoylecgonine seemed to be notably degraded in both phases of the sludge. Venlafaxine showed a significant concentration decrease in the aqueous phase in parallel to an increase in the solid phase. The majority of the compounds showed an increase of their concentrations in both phases after the digestion. Concentrations in the solid phase were commonly higher than in the aqueous for most contaminants, indicating that they were preferentially adsorbed onto the solid particles.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet RAS blockers have only limited beneficial effects on progression of DR in clinical trials. The natriuretic peptide system offsets RAS, so that enhancing the activity of this system on top of RAS blockade might be beneficial. Neprilysin has an important role in the degradation of natriuretic peptides. Therefore, we hypothesize that dual angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition (ARNI) may outperform angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in protection against DR. We tested this hypothesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic transgenic (mRen2)27 rats.Adult male diabetic (mRen2)27 rats were followed for 5 or 12 weeks. Treatment with vehicle,  (ARB), or ARB combined with the neprilysin inhibitor thiorphan (+thiorphan [ARNI]) occurred during the final 3 weeks. Retinal cell death, gliosis, and capillary loss were evaluated. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were performed to quantify the retinal level of inflammatory cell markers.Both ARB- and ARNI-treated groups showed similarly reduced retinal apoptotic cell death, gliosis, and capillary loss compared to the vehicle-treated group in the 5-week study. Treatment with ARNI reduced the expression of inflammatory markers more than ARB treatment in the 5-week study. In the 12-week study, ARNI treatment showed significantly more reduction in apoptotic cell death (51% vs. 25% reduction), and capillary loss (68% vs. 43% reduction) than ARB treatment.Treatment with ARNI provides better protection against DR in diabetic (mRen2)27 transgenic rats, compared to ARB alone.

All parent compounds as well as several TPs were found in some of the selected EWW and SW samples. Additionally, valsartan and 3 TPs were also detected by searching for common fragments in these waters. It is important to highlight that some TPs, such as O-desmethyl-venlafaxine and an oxidized gemfibrozil TP, were more frequently found than their corresponding parent compounds. On the basis of these results, it would be recommendable to include these TPs (at least those found in EWW and SW samples analyzed) in monitoring programs in order to gain a more realistic understanding of the impact of pharmaceuticals on water quality.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia), an increased number of circulating bone marrow-derived vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) progenitor cells (a pro-arteriosclerotic factor), and cardiac up-regulation of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α (a chemotactic factor of the progenitor cells) were noted in the 2/3NX triple NOSs(-/-) mice and were associated with significant increases in plasma angiotensin II levels (a marker of renin-angiotensin system activation) and urinary 8-isoprostane levels (a marker of oxidative stress). Importantly, combined treatment with a clinical dosage of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, , and a calcium channel antagonist, amlodipine, markedly prevented coronary arteriosclerotic lesion formation and the incidence of AMI and improved the prognosis of those mice, along with ameliorating all those pro-arteriosclerotic parameters. The 2/3NX triple NOSs(-/-) mouse is a new experimentally useful model of AMI. Renin-angiotensin system activation, oxidative stress, cardiovascular risk factors, and SDF-1α-induced recruitment of bone marrow-derived VSMC progenitor cells appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of AMI in this model.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, clinical parameters, urine protein : creatinine ratio (UPC), and urinary markers (liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, α1-microglobulin, and β2-microglobulin) were measured at the baseline and at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. We examined changes in the clinical parameters, UPC, and urinary markers from the baseline.A tendency toward hypotension was observed in all groups (group newly administered Irb, group switched to Irb, and group without changes to Irb), but the difference was not statistically significant. Urinary L-FABP concentration (μg/g x Cr) decreased from 13.2 --> 8.9 and13.2 --> 10.2 at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, after administration (p < 0.01) in the group newly administered Irb, from 19.5 --> 10.1 at 48 weeks after administration (p < 0.01) in the switched group, and from 9.6 --> 8.3, 8.1, and 6.2 (p < 0.01) in the group without changes to Irb. Changes in the Irb-administered groups were readily apparent. UPC decreased in the Irb-administered groups (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in the other urinary markers. Changes in urinary L-FABP and UPC were positively correlated in all cases of the Irb-administered groups (r = 0.25-0.57, p < 0.05), but were not positively correlated in the group without changes to Irb administration. The change in UPC was positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all cases (r = 0.23-0.57, p < 0.05).It was concluded that the urinary L-FABP level, blood pressure, and UPC of hypertensive patients should be managed in daily practice using an ARB, including Irb.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27022066>Response to angiotensin blockade with  in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>A patient suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment-related toxicity and resistance to standard chemotherapy and radiation was assessed as part of a personalized oncogenomics initiative to derive potential alternative therapeutic strategies.Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing was used to interrogate a metastatic tumor refractory to standard treatments of a patient with mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.Integrative genomic analysis indicated overexpression of the AP-1 transcriptional complex suggesting experimental therapeutic rationales, including blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.

However, the effect of  on heart failure complicated by renal failure has not yet been elucidated. Thus the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of  on the pathophysiology of cardiorenal syndrome in a rat model. Subtotal nephrectomy (NTX) was performed in rats was using a two-step surgical procedure. Twenty-eight days after NTX, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The animals were orally administered vehicle or  (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) after NTX. The hearts were harvested 28 days after MI. MI with NTX model rats showed an impaired post-MI survival rate and enhanced cardiac inflammation in comparison to MI without NTX rats. Although  treatment did not improve the survival rate, it suppressed cardiac inflammation, left ventricular function decline, cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and renal fibrosis in MI with NTX rats. Moreover, increases in protein expression levels related to oxidative stress and inflammation (NADPH oxidase 4, phospho-nuclear factor-κB and phospho-c-Jun) observed in the hearts of non-treated MI with NTX rats were attenuated by  treatment. These effects of  treatment were independent of blood pressure.

Thus, it is crucial to decrease the plasma NT-proBNP levels at the early stage of disease. We aimed to assess the effects of short-term treatment of  and hydrochlorothiazide on plasma NT-proBNP levels and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in subjects with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).Eighty subjects with AECOPD and high plasma NT-proBNP levels, without any clinical evidence of cor pulmonale, were enrolled.

In addition, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in the upregulation of MCP-1. In order to clarify whether TLR4 is involved in the onset of cardiac dysfunction caused by Ang Ⅱ stimulation, we investigated the effects of TLR4 on oxidative stress, the MCP-1 expression and cardiac dysfunction in mice with Ang Ⅱ-induced hypertension.TLR4-deficient (Tlr4(lps-d)) and wild-type (WT) mice were randomized into groups treated with Ang Ⅱ, norepinephrine (NE) or a subdepressor dose of the Ang Ⅱreceptor blocker  (IRB) and Ang Ⅱ for two weeks.Ang Ⅱ and NE similarly increased systolic blood pressure in all drug-treated groups compared to that observed in the control group among both WT and Tlr4(lps-d) mice (p＜0.05). In the WT mice, Ang Ⅱ induced cardiac hypertrophy as well as vascular remodeling and perivascular fibrosis of the intramyocardial arteries and monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the heart (p＜0.05). Furthermore, Ang Ⅱ treatment decreased the left ventricular diastolic function and resulted in a greater left ventricular end-systolic dimension (p＜0.05) in addition to producing a five-fold increase in the NADPH oxidase activity, ROS content and MCP-1 expression (p＜0.05). In contrast, the Tlr4(lps-d) mice showed little effects of Ang Ⅱ on these indices. In the WT mice, IRB treatment reversed these changes compared to that seen in the mice treated with Ang Ⅱ alone. NE produced little effect on any of the indices in either the WT or Tlr4(lps-d) mice.TLR4 may be involved in the processes underlying the increased oxidative stress, selectively activated MCP-1 expression and cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction seen in cases of Ang Ⅱ- induced hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26896240>Does this patient have hypertensive encephalopathy?</a></h2><p>A 63-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for further investigation and management of brain metastases.

The procedure however remains to be optimized and its interaction with physiological systems remains to be further explored. The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a dual role in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The interaction between RAS and PPC induced cardiac protection is however not clearly understood. We have recently demonstrated that angiotensin (1-7) via Mas receptor played a significant role in PPC mediated cardiac protection against I/R injury.The objective of this study was to investigate the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-chymase-angiotensin II (Ang II)-angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) axes of RAS in PPC mediated cardiac protection.Isolated rat hearts were subjected to I/R (control) or PPC in the presence or absence of Ang II, chymostatin (inhibitor of locally produced Ang II), ACE blocker (captopril) or AT1 antagonist (). Hemodynamics data was computed digitally and infarct size was determined histologically using TTC staining and biochemically by measuring creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase levels.Cardiac hemodynamics were significantly (P<0.001) improved and infarct size and cardiac enzymes were significantly (P<0.001) reduced in hearts subjected to PPC relative to hearts subjected to I/R injury. Exogenous administration of Ang II did not affect I/R injury or PPC mediated protection. Nonetheless inhibition of endogenously synthesized Ang II protected against I/R induced cardiac damage yet did not block or augment the protective effects of PPC. The administration of AT1 antagonist did not alleviate I/R induced damage. Interestingly it abrogated PPC induced cardiac protection in isolated rat hearts. Finally, PPC induced protection and blockade of locally produced Ang II involved enhanced activation of ERK1/2 and Akt components of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway.This study demonstrate a novel role of endogenously produced Ang II in mediating I/R injury and highlights the significance of AT1 signaling in PPC mediated cardiac protection in isolated rodents hearts ex vivo. The interaction between Ang II-AT1 and PPC appears to involve alterations in the activation state of ERK1/2 and Akt components of the RISK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378474>Serum metabolites predict response to angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Individual patients show a large variability in albuminuria response to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Identifying novel biomarkers that predict ARB response may help tailor therapy. We aimed to discover and validate a serum metabolite classifier that predicts albuminuria response to ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus and micro- or macroalbuminuria.Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was performed on serum samples. Data from patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (n = 49) treated with  300 mg/day were used for discovery. LASSO and ridge regression were performed to develop the classifier. Improvement in albuminuria response prediction was assessed by calculating differences in R(2) between a reference model of clinical parameters and a model with clinical parameters and the classifier. The classifier was externally validated in patients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbuminuria (n = 50) treated with losartan 100 mg/day. Molecular process analysis was performed to link metabolites to molecular mechanisms contributing to ARB response.In discovery, median change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was -42 % [Q1-Q3: -69 to -8]. The classifier, consisting of 21 metabolites, was significantly associated with UAE response to  (p < 0.001) and improved prediction of UAE response on top of the clinical reference model (R(2) increase from 0.10 to 0.70; p < 0.001).

Levels of NPs higher than certain cutoffs are often used as inclusion criteria in clinical trials of HFpEF to increase the likelihood that patients have HF and to select patients at higher risk for events. Whether treatments have a differential effect on outcomes across the spectrum of NP levels is unclear.The TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) trial randomized patients with HFpEF and either prior hospitalization for HF or elevated natriuretic peptide levels (B-type NP [BNP] ≥100 pg/ml or N-terminal proBNP ≥360 pg/ml) to spironolactone or placebo. Baseline BNP (n = 430) or N-terminal proBNP (n = 257) levels were available in 687 patients enrolled from the Americas in the elevated-NP stratum of TOPCAT.Higher levels of NPs were independently associated with an increased risk for TOPCAT's primary endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF when analyzed either continuously or grouped by terciles, adjusting for region of enrollment, age, sex, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, renal function, body mass index, and heart rate. There was a significant interaction between the effect of spironolactone and baseline NP terciles for the primary outcome (p = 0.017), with greater benefit of the drug in the lower compared with higher NP terciles.Similar to the effects of  in the I-PRESERVE ( in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial, a greater benefit of spironolactone was observed in the group with lower levels of NPs and overall risk in TOPCAT. Elevated NPs in HFpEF identify patients at higher risk for events but who may be less responsive to treatment.

Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from AM, has been proved clinically effective in improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in CKD. However, the mechanisms of HKC are still not fully understood.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ dual agonists have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study evaluated the function of Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM), as a dual agonist for PPARα/γ and investigated its anti-DN effects in a DN rat model.ChIP and reporter gene assays were performed and the expression of PPARα/γ target genes was monitored to examine the ability of HKC to activate PPARα/γ. DN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HKC was administered to the diabetic nephropathy rats at three different doses: high dose HKC (300mg/kg/d); middle dose HKC (175mg/kg/d); and low dose HKC (75mg/kg/d).  (4mg/kg/d body weight) was used as a positive control. Following 12 weeks' treatment, we measured general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, and glomerular morphological changes. The expression of collagen IV, TGFβ, TNFα and IL-6 in renal tissue was evaluated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in renal tissue was also analyzed.HKC enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARα and PPARγ in cultured cells, livers and kidneys of DN rats, and it reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and fat in livers of DN rats. Furthermore, HKC reduced the expressions of inflammatory genes in kidneys of DN rats. Strikingly, HKC reduced ER stress and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation in the liver and kidney of DN rats and subsequently improved renal injury.Our results show that HKC improved lipid  disorders by activating PPARα/γ and attenuating ER stress. HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation and glomerular injury in DN rats. These results suggest that HKC has potential as an anti-DN agent for the treatment of DN in humans.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In human kidney HK-2 proximal tubular cells expressing the ETB receptor subtype, the effects of ET-1 with or without ET-1 antagonists were also investigated. The occurrence of renal fibrosis was associated with EMT in control TGRen2 rats, as evidenced by decreased E-cadherin and increased αSMA expression.  and the mixed ET-1 receptor antagonist bosentan prevented these changes in a blood pressure-independent fashion (P < 0.001 for both versus controls).

We used different complementary techniques to gain a clear picture of the involved protonation and complexation equilibria. The low solubility in water of the ligands and of the formed metal complexes prevented the use of water as solvent, so we had to perform the measurements in mixed methanol-water solvents. Further, we studied the related equilibria with Zn for evaluating a potential interference of this essential metal ion, largely present in biological fluids. Our study provided a strong evaluation of the formed complexes and of the relative stability constants. The binding of both metal ions takes place through the tetrazole moiety except for the Zn- system. In this last case, NMR measurements gave evidence of a tautomeric equilibrium involving the imidazole ring and the aliphatic chain. The estimated complexation model, and the related stability constants, allowed a speciation study in human plasma, based on a number of simplifying assumptions, which remarked that both drugs, Losartan and , could exert a chelating action, scavenging non-negligible amounts of Cu from the organism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The 24-hour urinary protein and biochemical indicators were determined, and renal pathological changes were observed. The mRNA and protein expression of nephrin, podocin, CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), and desmin in the kidney tissue were analyzed.The urinary protein excretion levels in the MP and  groups were lower than those in the model group (p<0.01). Electron microscopy showed that fusion of the glomerular foot processes of the rats in the  group was significantly reduced. The mRNA and protein expression levels of nephrin and podocin in the renal tissue in the MP and  groups were up-regulated compared with the model group (p<0.05), whereas the mRNA and protein expression levels of CD2AP and desmin were significantly down-regulated (p<0.01).For rats with adriamycin-induced nephropathy,  could significantly reduce proteinuria. As a possible mechanism,  may improve the slit diaphragm protein of the glomerular podocyte and stabilize the cytoskeleton of the podocyte.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30092004>Differential effects of angiotensin II type I receptor blockers on reducing intraocular pressure and TGFβ signaling in the mouse retina.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been investigated for their neuroprotective and intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effects in treating glaucoma, but the reports have been inconsistent possibly because different compounds and models have been used. Here we selected three ARBs for head-to-head comparisons of their effects on IOP and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling, which is believed to play an important role in glaucoma pathogenesis.Three ARBs (losartan,  or telmisartan) or vehicle controls were administered via chow to C57BL/6J mice for up to 7 days. Drug concentrations in the eye, brain, and plasma were evaluated by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Cohorts of mice were randomly assigned to different treatments. IOP and blood pressure were measured before and after ARB treatment. Effects of ARBs on TGFβ signaling in the retina were evaluated by phosphorylated Smad2 (pSmad2) immunohistochemistry.Physiologically relevant concentrations of losartan,  and telmisartan were detected in eye, brain and plasma after drug administration (n = 11 mice/treatment). Blood pressure was significantly reduced by all ARBs compared to vehicle-fed controls (all p-values < 0.001, n = 8-15 mice/treatment). Compared to vehicle control, IOP was significantly reduced by  (p = 0.030) and telmisartan (p = 0.019), but not by losartan (n = 14-17 mice/treatment). Constitutive pSmad2 fluorescence observed in retinal ganglion cells was significantly reduced by telmisartan (p = 0.034), but not by losartan or  (n = 3-4 mice/treatment).Administration via chow is an effective delivery method for ARBs, as evidenced by lowered blood pressure. ARBs vary in their abilities to lower IOP or reduce TGFβ signaling. Considering the significant roles of IOP and TGFβ in glaucoma pathogenesis, specific ARBs with dual effects, such as telmisartan, may be more effective than other ARBs for treating glaucoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25423498>Comparison of calycosin and  for their impact on renin angiotensin system in human umbilical vein endothelial cell.</a></h2><p>The aim of this paper was to compare the efficacy of in vitro calycosin and  for the treatment of angiotensin II (AngII)-induced renin angiotensin system (RAS) disorder in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).Cultured HUVECs were randomly divided into several groups: control, AngII 1×10-6 mol) alone, Ang II (1×10-6 mol) plus calycosin (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L) and Ang II (1×10-6 mol) plus  (10 μmol). Morphology of vascular endothelial cells was studied by using a light microscope with hematoxylin and eosin double staining. Changes in both protein and gene expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) were detected by immunohistochemistry analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques, respectively.In comparison to control, AngII significantly promoted both protein and gene expressions of ACE while inhibited those of ACE2 in HUVECs. Interestingly, Calycosin was able to inhibit the effect of AngII in a concentration dependent manner, and its effect at concentration of 35 μmol was equal to that of positive control  (10μmol).Calycosin from Radix Astragali from Gansu province could protect HUVECs from AngII induced RAS disorder by downregulation of ACE expression and increased ACE2 expression, which is similar to .

In the present study, all-female juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to environmentally-realistic concentrations of a mixture of nonsteroidal pharmaceuticals for 42 days, and the effects on plasma levels of sex-steroids and the expression of genes encoding key proteins involved in ovarian development were assessed. Paracetamol, carbamazepine, diclofenac,  and naproxen were selected, as these have been detected in the Meuse River in Belgium. Fish were exposed to three concentrations of the mixture including the environmental concentration, 10- and 100-times the environmental concentration. Plasma levels of sex-steroid hormones, particularly 11-ketotestosterone, increased in a concentration-dependent way in exposed females. In addition, some key genes involved in ovarian steroidogenesis were significantly overexpressed after 7 days of exposure, such as key genes involved in the maintenance of the ovary. The steady-state mRNA level of genes implicated in germ cell fate were especially affected, such as that of foxl3 which increased by 5 fold at the highest concentration of the mixture. In conclusion, this study highlights that combined occurrence of common pharmaceutical drugs at concentrations present in surface water environments may act as endocrine-disrupting compounds in rainbow trout.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our previous studies demonstrated that administration of a subpressor dose of angiotensin (Ang) II sensitizes subsequent Ang II-elicited hypertension. The present study tested whether high-fat diet (HFD) feeding also sensitizes the Ang II-elicited hypertensive response and whether HFD-induced sensitization is mediated by an increase in renin-angiotensin system activity and inflammatory mechanisms in the brain. HFD did not increase baseline blood pressure, but enhanced the hypertensive response to Ang II compared with a normal-fat diet. The sensitization produced by the HFD was abolished by concomitant central infusions of either a tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor, pentoxifylline, an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker, , or an inhibitor of microglial activation, minocycline. Furthermore, central pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor-α mimicked the sensitizing action of a central subpressor dose of Ang II, whereas central pentoxifylline or minocycline abolished this Ang II-induced sensitization. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of lamina terminalis tissue indicated that HFD feeding, central tumor necrosis factor-α, or a central subpressor dose of Ang II upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines, whereas inhibition of Ang II type 1 receptor and of inflammation reversed these changes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of Ang II-elicited hypertension is mediated by upregulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system and of central proinflammatory cytokines.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268636>Efficacy and safety of two single-pill fixed-dose combinations of angiotensin II receptor blockers/calcium channel blockers in hypertensive patients (EXAMINER study).</a></h2><p>There is some controversy regarding which single-pill fixed-dose combinations of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are effective at reducing blood pressure (BP).Sixty hypertensive patients who received a single-pill fixed-dose combination of valsartan 80 mg/day and amlodipine 5 mg/day were enrolled (UMIN Registration 000013460).

Herein, we have investigated the potential protective effect of  (IRB) against chronic nephrotoxicity induced by DOX, and the implication of different mechanistic  underlying these effects. Rats were treated with either DOX (2.5 mg/kg i.p., 3 times/week) for 2 weeks, and (or) IRB (40 mg/kg, daily) for 3 weeks. IRB prohibited nephrotoxicity induced by DOX, which was evident by the increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and histopathological changes. IRB improved DOX-induced alterations in oxidative status by diminishing lipid peroxidation and upregulating the antioxidant enzymes. Also, upon DOX treatment, the renal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and caspase-3 were significantly increased; IRB diminished DOX-induced alterations in these parameters. Moreover, DOX significantly decreased the expression level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, DOX induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  that cross talked with AMPK. On the contrary, IRB successfully counterbalanced all these effects.

Previous studies suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of ARB vs. placebo on plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers in HD patients.Adult HD patients were randomized for double-blind treatment with the ARB  150-300 mg/day or placebo. At baseline, 1 week, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were measured using Luminex and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology.Eighty-two patients were randomized (placebo/ARB: 41/41). The groups did not differ in initial levels of any of the inflammatory markers (placebo/ARB median(range)): hsCRP 3.3(0.2-23.4)/2.7(0.2-29.6) μg/mL; IL-1β 1.1(0.0-45.9)/1.1(0.0-7.2) pg/mL; IL-6 10(1-90)/12(1-84) pg/mL; IL-8 31(9-134)/34(5-192) pg/mL; IL-18 364(188-1343)/377(213-832) pg/mL; TGF-β 3.2(0.8-13.9)/3.6(1.3-3.8) ng/mL. Overall, there was no significant difference in hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-β between placebo and ARB-treated patients during the study period, and hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-β were relatively stable during the study period (P ≥ 0.18 in all tests for parallel curves, equal levels, and constant levels). The IL-1β level was slightly different in the two groups over time, but not significantly (P = 0.09 in test for parallel curves) and it was also relatively stable during the study period (P ≥ 0.49 in tests for equal levels and constant level). IL-18 was the only inflammatory marker which was not constant during the study period (P = 0.001 in test for constant level), but there was no significant difference between placebo and ARB-treated (P ≥ 0.51 in tests for parallel curves and equal levels).Inflammatory biomarkers were neither acutely, nor in the long-term significantly affected by the ARB .

Mechanochemical synthesis of a new solid form of IRB with coformers having antioxidant properties (syringic acid, nicotinic acid, and ascorbic acid) resulted into three eutectic mixtures (EMs). Formation of eutectic was ascertained by differential scanning calorimetry whereas exact stoichiometry (50/50% w/w) was established by phase diagram and Tamman's triangle. The strong homomeric interaction between individual components and steric hindrances is responsible for the eutectic formation. EMs exhibited superior apparent solubility (five- to nine fold) and significant enhancement in intrinsic dissolution rate (two- to three fold) as compared to the plain drug. In vivo pharmacokinetic and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies revealed a significant improvement in the biopharmaceutical performance of EMs. Marked protection against oxidative stress was observed in EMs over plain drug by controlling the level/activity of plasma HO and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in the kidney matrix of dexamethasone (Dexa)-induced hypertensive rats.

A previous study revealed that rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have an enhanced hypertensive response to subsequent angiotensin II administration that is mediated at least, in part, by increased activity of brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines. This study tested whether leptin mediates this HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension by interacting with brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokine mechanisms. Rats fed an HFD for 3 weeks had significant increases in white adipose tissue mass, plasma leptin levels, and mRNA expression of leptin and its receptors in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Central infusion of a leptin receptor antagonist during HFD feeding abolished HFD sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension. Furthermore, central infusion of leptin mimicked the sensitizing action of HFD. Concomitant central infusions of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist , the tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor pentoxifylline, or the inhibitor of microglial activation minocycline prevented the sensitization produced by central infusion of leptin. RT-PCR analysis indicated that either HFD or leptin administration upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines in the lamina terminalis and paraventricular nucleus. The leptin antagonist and the inhibitors of angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis, and microglial activation all reversed the expression of these genes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension is mediated by leptin through upregulation of central renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753370>Effects of Different Doses of  Combined With Spironolactone on Urinary Albumin Excretion Rate in Elderly Patients With Early Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>There is a lack of research on the effect of low dose of angiotensin receptor blockers combined with spironolactone, and the effect of high dose of angiotensin receptor blockers alone on the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) in elderly patients with early type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN).We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled study that included 244 elderly patients with early DN and mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups: low-dose  (group A), high-dose  (group B), low-dose  combined with spironolactone (group C) and high-dose  combined with spironolactone (group D). Changes in UAER, serum potassium and blood pressure were compared.There were no statistical differences in the baseline characteristics among groups. Furthermore, no significant difference in blood pressure before and after treatment was found among different groups. After 72-week treatment, UAER in group D was lower compared to group A and B (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, compared with group B, UAER in group C decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Additionally, significantly higher serum potassium was found in group D compared to other groups (P < 0.05). Also, group D had the highest count of patients who withdrew from the study due to hyperkalemia compared to other groups (P < 0.05).Our results indicate high-dose  combined with spironolactone may be more efficient in reducing UAER in elderly patients with early DN, but this treatment could cause hyperkalemia. Low-dose  combined with spironolactone was shown to be safer and more effective in decreasing UAER compared to high-dose .Copyright © 2018 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

HFpEF is diagnosed using the following criteria: symptoms, preserved ejection fraction (greater than 50%), and evidence of abnormal left ventricular filling or relaxation, or diastolic distensibility or stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) ( and candesartan), thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and ARB (valsartan) named LCZ696 (entresto) for possible treatment of HFrEF.In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients with HFpEF.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742464>Blood Pressure and Cholesterol-lowering Efficacy of a Fixed-dose Combination With  and Atorvastatin in Patients With Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia: A Randomized, Double-blind, Factorial, Multicenter Phase III Study.</a></h2><p>A fixed-dose combination of a stain and an antihypertensive drug may be useful for the treatment of patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It may also improve patient drug compliance to help control risk factors of cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to evaluate the blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering effect of a fixed-dose combination of -atorvastatin compared with monotherapy by either agent over an 8-week treatment period.Patients with comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this randomized, double-blind, Phase III study. Eligible study patients were randomly assigned to test groups receiving a combination of  300 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg (IRB300 + ATO40 and IRB300 + ATO80). Comparator groups comprised monotherapy groups with  300 mg (IRB300) or atorvastatin 40 mg (ATO40) or atorvastatin 80 mg (ATO80), or placebo. Patients who were eligible at screening were subjected to a 4- to 6-week washout period before commencing 8 weeks of therapy per their assigned group. The primary efficacy end points were percent change in LDL-C and sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels from baseline to end of therapy. Tolerability profiles of combination therapy were compared with other groups.A total of 733 patients with comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this study; 230 eligible patients were randomized to treatment. The mean age of patients was 58.9 (8.5) years, and their mean body mass index was 25.8 (3.2) kg/m. More than two thirds (70.9%) of the study patients were male. Mean LDL-C and sitting DBP levels at baseline were 149.54 (29.19) mg/dL and 92.32 (6.03) mm Hg, respectively. Percent reductions in LDL-C after 8 weeks were 46.74% (2.06%) in the IRB300 + ATO40 group and 48.98% (2.12%) in the IRB300 + ATO80 group; these values were 47.13% (3.21%) and 48.30% (2.98%) in the ATO40 and ATO80 comparator groups. Similarly, a reduction in sitting DBP after 8 weeks was -8.50 (1.06) mm Hg in the IRB300 + ATO40 group and 10.66 (1.08) mm Hg in the IRB300 + ATO80 group compared with 8.40 (1.65) mm Hg in the IRB300 group. The incidence rate for treatment-emergent adverse events was 22.27% and was similar between the monotherapy and combination groups.A once-daily combination product of  and atorvastatin provided an effective, safe, and more compliable treatment for patients with coexisting hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Because both are assumed to reflect changes in the filtration capacity of the kidney, drug effects, if present, are attributed to kidney protection. However, decisions to start RRT are not only on the basis of filtration capacity of the kidney, but also on other factors. We therefore compared the time to RRT with the time to a fixed eGFR threshold and assessed the effect of the renoprotective drug  on both components. analysis of two clinical trials, the  Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and Reduction of End points in Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan Trial, in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. The time to a predefined eGFR level of 11 ml/min per 1.73 m (eGFR), calculated by within-patient linear regression, was compared with the time to RRT or sustained serum creatinine ≥6 mg/dl.A large difference was observed in the median time to RRT (779 days) compared with eGFR (678 days; =0.01). We also observed a large variation in the difference between the time to RRT and eGFR. In IDNT, the hazard ratio for the effect of  on the serum creatinine ≥6.0 mg/dl end point was 0.60 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.91; =0.02), whereas it was smaller for the RRT end point (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 1.07; =0.12).This study shows a difference in the time to RRT and a fixed eGFR threshold, and shows that the effect of an angiotensin receptor blocker on a filtration-based end point versus RRT varies. This implies that evaluating renoprotective effects of drugs with a combined RRT and doubling of serum creatinine end point may result in evaluating other effects beyond renoprotection alone. Future trials should consider registering all parameters that lead to RRT decisions.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931880>[The mechanism of  against diabetes induced myocardial fibrosis in rat model].</a></h2><p>To observe the protective effect of  on myocardial fibrosis in diabetic rats, and analyze the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in this protection.Thirty two male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups:normal control group (CON, =10), experimental group (=22).

An analytical method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MSMS) was developed and validated for use in routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The method includes 21 antihypertensive drugs or active metabolites from the groups beta blockers (n=5), calcium antagonists (n=5), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (n=4), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (n=3) and diuretics (n = 3), in addition to one α1-selective alpha blocker.A 200 µL serum sample was handled automatically using a pipetting robot. Protein precipitation was performed with 600 µL of 1% formic acid in acetonitrile (v:v) and phospholipid removal was carried out using a Waters OSTRO™ 96-well plate. After evaporation and reconstitution the eluent was injected thrice with different inlet and mass spectrometric methods to cover the different physico-chemical properties of the drugs and the variations in therapeutic concentration ranges between drugs. Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (2.1x50mm, 1.7 µm) column equipped with a corresponding pre-column was used for chromatographic separation. For every analyte an isotopically labelled analogue served as internal standard, except for lisinopril where enalaprilat-d5 was used.Accuracies were in the range of -13.7 to 13.2% and intra-day and inter-day precisions in the range of 1.1 to 10.5%. The linearity within the calibration ranges expressed as coefficient of determination was higher than 0.995 for all compounds. Matrix effects and recovery efficiencies were within acceptable limits. The limits of quantitation varied from 0.02 to 10.7 µg/L. The stability of the drugs in serum at different conditions was tested. Diltiazem was not stable at 4-8 °C with up to 23.5 % loss after six days. Degradation of atenolol, , bendroflumethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide and diltiazem was observed when stored at 30 °C. The suitability of the method was demonstrated in a routine TDM setting, analysing samples from 127 patients undergoing antihypertensive drug treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While its inhibitor requirements have been recently characterized, its substrate requirements have not. The objectives of this study were (a) to elucidate NTCP substrate requirements using native bile acids and bile acid analogs, (b) to develop the first pharmacophore for NTCP substrates and compare it with the inhibitor pharmacophores, and (c) to identify additional NTCP novel substrates. Thus, 18 native bile acids and two bile acid conjugates were initially assessed for NTCP inhibition and/or uptake, which suggested a role of hydroxyl pattern and steric interaction in NTCP binding and translocation. A common feature pharmacophore for NTCP substrate uptake was developed, using 14 native bile acids and bile acid conjugates, yielding a model which featured three hydrophobes, one hydrogen bond donor, one negative ionizable feature and three excluded volumes. This model was used to search a database of FDA approved drugs and retrieved the majority of the known NTCP substrates. Among the retrieved drugs,  and losartan were identified as novel NTCP substrates, suggesting a potential role of NTCP in drug disposition.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The measured sorption isotherms were described by Freundlich equations, and the sorption coefficients, K (for the fixed n exponent for each compound), were related to the soil properties to derive relationships for estimating the sorption coefficients from the soil properties (i.e., pedotransfer rules). The largest sorption was obtained for citalopram (average K value for n = 1 was 1838 cm g) followed by fexofenadine (K = 35.1 cm μg g, n = 1.19) and  (K = 3.96 cm μg g, n = 1.10). The behavior of citalopram (CIT) in soils was different than the behaviors of  (IRB) and fexofenadine (FEX).

Hypertensive patients with concomitant diabetes must take both antihypertensive and hypoglycaemic medications, for which there is a lack of experimental and clinical guidelines. This study aimed to examine the interaction between these two types of medication on the endothelial cell function.The effect of antihypertensive (nifedipine and ) and anti-diabetic (metformin and glibenclamide/glimepiride) drugs on human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) function was examined using a modified Boyden chamber assay. The intracellular NO and O2- levels of HUVECs were detected through flow cytometry.Our findings showed that nifedipine/sulphonylurea monotherapy significantly attenuated high glucose-induced (33 mM) HUVECs migration incapacity, while combination therapy of nifedipine and glibenclamide/glimepiride showed no protective effect. Both nifedipine/metformin monotherapy and combined therapy significantly mitigated the migration incapacity induced by high glucose in HUVECs. Combined with either metformin or sulphonylureas,  therapy was able to attenuate the high glucose-induced migration incapacity of HUVECs. Nifedipine monotherapy decreased the O2- levels and increased the NO levels in in vitro-cultured HUVECs treated with high glucose. However, the combination therapy of nifedipine and glibenclamide increased the O2- levels and decreased the NO levels compared to the nifedipine monotherapeutic group.The nifedipine and glibenclamide/glimepiride combination exerted a mutual antagonistic effect on the protection from high glucose-induced impairment in endothelial cells, which might be partially attributed to the increased O2- level and decreased NO level.

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II receptor blocker has exhibited their renal protective benefits in diabetic nephropathy. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of adding atorvastatin to  in early diabetic nephropathy. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang database until March 25, 2019. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of adding atorvastatin to  in early diabetic nephropathy were eligible. Primary endpoint was urinary albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. Serum level of total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, interleukin-6,and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as blood pressure were secondary endpoints. Seventeen trials involving 1,390 patients were identified. Compared with  alone, co-administration of atorvastatin and  significantly reduced urinary albumin excretion rate (weighted mean differences [WMD] -21.22 μg/min; 95% confidence interval [CI] -26.95 to -15.50), serum creatinine (WMD -6.46 μmol/L; 95%CI -8.52 to 4.39),BUN (WMD -0.46 mmol/L; 95%CI -0.64 to -0.27), total cholesterol (WMD -1.79 mmol/L; 95%CI -2.34 to -1.23), triglyceride (WMD -0.93 mmol/L; 95%CI -1.20 to -0.67),and systolic blood pressure (WMD -2.27 mmHg; 95%CI -4.01 to -0.53), CRP (standard mean difference [SMD] 1.57; 95%CI -2.24 to -0.9), and Interleukin-6 (SMD 1.53; 95%CI -2.29 to -0.78). However, there was a significantly increased risk of nausea/vomiting (risk ratio 3.15; 95% CI 1.18-8.38) on the co-administration group. In conclusion, adding atorvastatin to  achieves additional renal protective benefits in early diabetic nephropathy patients. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to suboptimal methodological quality of the analyzed trials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of Ang II receptor blockade (ARB) ( 15 mg/kg body weight/day) on proteinuria and on the expression of the SD molecules were analyzed.mRNA expressions of nephrin, podocin and NEPH1 were decreased to an undetectable level at 1 h. The staining of these SD molecules shifted to a discontinuous pattern, and their intensity was reduced. NEPH1 staining was reduced to an undetectable level on day 10. ARB treatment ameliorated the peak value of proteinuria (237.6 ± 97.0 vs. 359.0 ± 63.3 mg/day, p < 0.05), and prevented the decrease in the mRNA expression of the SD molecules (nephrin 66.96 %, podocin 60.40 %, NEPH1 77.87 % of normal level). The immunofluorescence staining of NEPH1 was restored by ARB. ARB treatment enhanced the expression of NEPH1 of normal rats.Dysfunction of the SD molecules including NEPH1 is a crucial initiation event of PAN nephropathy. ARB treatment ameliorates proteinuria in PAN nephropathy by inhibiting the reduction of NEPH1 and nephrin. Ang II action regulates the expression of NEPH1 and nephrin in not only the pathological but also physiological state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25907932>[Effect of Tripterygium glycosides on expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α and endothelin-1 in kidney of diabetic rats].</a></h2><p>To observe the effect of Tripterygium glycosides (TG) on the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and endothelin-1 in the kidney of diabetic rats and explore the possible mechanism underlying the protective effect of TG against diabetic nephropathy.Sixty 8-week-old male SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group (n=10) and streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) model group (n=50). The diabetic model rats were then randomly divided into DM group, low-dose (8 mg/kg) and high-dose (16 mg/kg) TG treatment groups, and  (50 mg/kg) treatment group. After 8 weeks, the levels of blood glucose (BG), 24-h urine protein (24 h Upro), serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. The pathological changes in the renal tissues were examined by optical microscopy, and the mean glomerular area (MGA) and mean glomerular volume (MGV) were measured with pathological image analysis. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 protein in the renal tissue, and their mRNA expressions were detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR.HIF-1α and ET-1 expression increased in the kidney of diabetic rats. Compared with the diabetic model rats, the rats receiving TG and  treatment showed decreased levels of Scr, BUN, 24h Upro, MGA and MGV, improved renal histopathology, and reduced expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 mRNA and protein in the renal tissue. These changes were more obvious in high-dose TG treatment group. Correlation analysis showed that the expression of HIF-1α was positively correlated with that of ET-1, and they were both positively correlated with kidney weight index (KW/BW), 24 h Upro, MGA, and MGV.HIF-1α and ET-1 are overexpressed in the kidney of diabetic rats. TG can improve kidney damage in diabetic rats and delay the development of diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the HIF-1α and ET-1 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430750> F-Labeled Derivatives of  for Angiotensin II Receptor PET Imaging.</a></h2><p>The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormonal cascade involved in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance, and represents a common target for the treatment of various diseases including hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes.

Explants were treated either with  (10 µM), vehicle or angiotensin II (2 μM) for four days. Retinal ganglion cell density was estimated by βIII tubulin immunohistochemistry. Live imaging of superoxide formation with dihydroethidium (DHE) was performed. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting, and mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. (10 µM) almost doubled ganglion cell survival after four days. Angiotensin II (2 µM) reduced cell survival by 40%. Sholl analysis suggested that  improved ganglion cell dendritic arborisation compared to control and angiotensin II reduced it. Angiotensin-treated explants showed an intense DHE fluorescence not seen in -treated explants. Analysis of protein and mRNA expression determined that the angiotensin II receptor At1R was implicated in modulation of the NADPH-dependent pathway of superoxide generation.Angiotensin II blockers protect retinal ganglion cells in this model and may be worth further investigation as a neuroprotective treatment in models of eye disease.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25872610>The renal protective effect of angiotensin receptor blockers depends on intra-individual response variation in multiple risk markers.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are renoprotective and targeted to blood pressure. However, ARBs have multiple other (off-target) effects which may affect renal outcome. It is unknown whether on-target and off-target effects are congruent within individuals. If not, this variation in short term effects may have important implications for the prediction of individual long term renal outcomes. Our aim was to assess intra-individual variability in multiple parameters in response to ARBs in type 2 diabetes.Changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), albuminuria, potassium, haemoglobin, cholesterol and uric acid after 6 months of losartan treatment were assessed in the RENAAL database. Improvement in predictive performance of renal outcomes (ESRD or doubling serum creatinine) for each individual using ARB-induced changes in all risk markers was assessed by the relative integrative discrimination index (RIDI).SBP response showed high variability (mean -5.7 mmHg, 5(th) to 95(th) percentile -36.5 to +24.0 mmHg) between individuals. Changes in off-target parameters also showed high variability between individuals. No congruency was observed between responses to losartan in multiple parameters within individuals. Using individual responses in all risk markers significantly improved renal risk prediction (RIDI 30.4%, P < 0.01) compared with using only SBP changes. Results were successfully replicated in two independent trials with , IDNT and IRMA-2.In this post hoc analysis we showed that ARBs have multiple off-target effects which vary between and within individuals. Combining all ARB-induced responses beyond SBP provides a more accurate prediction of who will benefit from ARB therapy.

Decreased serum sulfatide levels are suggested by our previous work to be related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension, known to be an important risk factor for CVD, may affect serum sulfatide levels. However, how hypertension affects serum sulfatides directly and mechanistically is unknown. To elucidate these possible mechanisms, we investigated changes in serum sulfatide levels and their  using an established experimental model of hypertension that uses continuous infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) into mice. Furthermore, we also examined the effects of four different antihypertensive drugs (losartan, , nifedipine, and hydralazine) on serum sulfatide . Serum levels of sulfatides were found to be decreased in groups in which only hypertension was induced (AngII only), whereas they were increased in groups with reduced blood pressure (antihypertensives only) and ameliorated to increasingly normal levels in groups with induced hypertension that were also treated (AngII+antihypertensives). Changes in serum sulfatides were strongly related to hepatic expression levels of cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST), which is a key enzyme involved in sulfatide synthesis. Furthermore, the current study suggests that the primary factors affecting CST expression are oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α activity and blood pressure itself. This study demonstrates that hypertension significantly decreases levels of serum sulfatides by reducing hepatic CST expression via various effects mediated by AngII. Antihypertensive treatments can ameliorate abnormalities in serum sulfatide levels and may partially prevent hypertension related CVD by positively affecting sulfatide .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030651>Short and Long-Term Effects of the Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker  on Intradialytic Central Hemodynamics: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled One-Year Intervention Trial (the SAFIR Study).</a></h2><p>Little is known about the tolerability of antihypertensive drugs during hemodialysis treatment.

AngII has also been shown to increase antioxidant enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD). However, the roles of TLR4 in Ang II-induced ROS production, vascular remodeling and hypertension remain unknown. Mice lacking TLR4 function showed significant inhibition of vascular remodeling in response to chronic AngII infusion, with no impact on blood pressure. The increases in ROS level and NADPH oxidase activity in response to AngII infusion were markedly blunted in TLR4-deficient mice. Similar effects were observed in wild-type (WT) mice treated with a sub-depressor dose of the AT1 receptor antagonist , which had no effects on TLR4-deficient mice. Intriguingly, the AngII infusion-induced increases in ecSOD activity and expression were rather enhanced in TLR4-deficient mice compared with WT mice, whereas the expression of the proinflammatory chemokine MCP-1 was decreased. Importantly, AngII-induced vascular remodeling was positively correlated with NADPH oxidase activity, ROS levels and MCP-1 expression levels. Notably, chronic norepinephrine infusion, which elevates blood pressure without increasing ROS production, did not induce significant vascular remodeling in WT mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that ROS elevation is required for accelerating vascular remodeling but not for hypertensive effects in this model. We demonstrated that TLR4 plays a pivotal role in regulating AngII-induced vascular ROS levels by inhibiting the expression and activity of the antioxidant enzyme ecSOD, as well as by activating NADPH oxidase, which enhances inflammation to facilitate the progression of vascular remodeling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27405250>Interaction between , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ), and adiponectin in the regulation of blood pressure and renal function in spontaneously hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin exerts vasodilatory effects. , an angiotensin receptor blocker, possesses partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist activity and increases circulating adiponectin.

Serum bicarbonate levels were studied as a continuous variable and stratified in quartiles. Follow-up was 2.8±1.0 (SD) years.Cox regression analyses showed that serum bicarbonate level had inverse associations with incident ESRD (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93; P<0.001) and incidence of the combined end point of ESRD or serum creatinine doubling (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96; P<0.001). These associations were independent of age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors, but disappeared after adjustment for baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (all P>0.05). Analysis of bicarbonate quartiles showed similar results for the quartile with the lowest bicarbonate (≤21 mEq/L) versus the quartile with normal bicarbonate levels (24-26 mEq/L). There was no association of bicarbonate level with cardiovascular events and heart failure.Post hoc analysis and single measurement of serum bicarbonate.In this cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, serum bicarbonate level associations with kidney disease end points were not retained after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is in contrast to results of earlier studies in nondiabetic populations.Copyright © 2015 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Primary objective of this study is to explore the prevalence of RAAS blockers usage among type II diabetic patients, secondary objectives are to compare the prescribing pattern of RAAS blocker between primary and tertiary care center and to explore if the dose of RAAS blocker prescribed was at optimal dose as suggested by trials.This is a retrospective study conducted at one public tertiary referral hospital and one public health clinic in Sungai Petani, Kedah, Malaysia.RAAS blockers in T2DM patients was found to be 65%. In primary care, 14.3% of the RAAS blockers prescribed was ARB. Tertiary care had higher utilization of ARB, which was 42.9%. In primary care setting, the most commonly used ACEI were perindopril (92.4%) followed by enalapril (7.6%), meanwhile perindopril was the only ACEI being prescribed in tertiary care. The most prescribed ARB was  (63.6%) and telmisartan (54.2%) respectively in primary and tertiary care. Overall, 64.9% of RAAS blockers prescribed by both levels of care were found to be achieving the target dose as recommended in landmark trials. Crude odd ratio of prescribing RAAS blocker in primary care versus tertiary care was reported as 2.70 (95% CI: 1.49 to 4.91).RAAS blockers usage among T2DM patients was higher in primary care versus tertiary care settings. Majority of the patients did not receive optimal dose of RAAS blockers.Copyright © 2017 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental evidence allowed the implementation of structural and vibrational studies by theoretical calculations made in the light of the density functional theory (DFT). This compound was designed to induce structural modifications on the ligand. No antioxidant effects were displayed by both compounds, though CuIrb behaved as a weak 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH(·)) scavenger (IC50 = 425 μM). The measurements of the contractile capacity on human mesangial cell lines showed that CuIrb improved the antihypertensive effects of the parent medication. In vitro cell growth inhibition against prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DU 145) was measured for CuIrb,  and copper(II). These cell lines have been selected since the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor (that was blocked by the angiotensin receptor blockers, ARB) has been identified in them. The complex exerted anticancer behavior (at 100 μM) improving the activity of the ligand. Flow cytometry determinations were used to determine late apoptotic mechanisms of cell death. Experimental and DFT characterization of an  copper(II) complex has been performed. The complex exhibits low scavenging activity against DPPH(·) and significant growth inhibition of LNCaP and DU 145 prostate cancer cell lines.

Evidence have shown that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a key mediator in the development of DN. However, treatment of DN by blocking the TGF-β1/Smad7 pathway remains limited. Xiaokeping mixture (XKP), a traditional Chinese herbal compound, has been used for treatment in patients with DN for many years.In the present study, TGF-β1/Smad7 pathway analysis was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of XKP on DN rats induced by streptozotocin and to address the underlying molecular mechanism. Male rats were divided into four groups: normal control, untreated control group (fed with high fat), -treated DN, and XKP-treated DN, respectively. Levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein of 24 hours, and triacylglycerol were detected. Pathological changes of renal tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expressions of TGF-β1 and Smad7.The results demonstrated that XKP can effectively reduce the levels of glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine protein of 24 hours, and triacylglycerol. Further studies indicated that inhibition of DN in XKP-treated DN rats was associated with inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad7 signaling as demonstrated by downregulation of TGF-β1 but upregulation of Smad7.The data obtained from the present study indicate that XKP may be a therapeutic agent for DN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27474928>Design, synthesis and evaluation of novel potent angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists.</a></h2><p>A series of new angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor 1 antagonists were designed, synthesized and evaluated.

The T1/2 values of the three groups were similar, about 9-10 h. Compound 2b was distributed into tissues rapidly and extensively after oral administration. The level of it was the highest in the liver, followed by in spleen, kidney, and the lowest in brain. The acute toxicity assays of 2b proved its low acute toxicity with an LD50 value of 1551.71 mg/kg, and no toxicity reaction appeared at dose of 1200.00 mg/kg.

Kidney podocytes have an essential role as a filtration barrier against proteinuria. Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) is expressed in podocytes and decreased in glomerular diseases leading to methylation of the nephrin promoter, decreased nephrin expression and proteinuria. Treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) reduced methylation of the nephrin promoter in murine glomeruli of an adriamycin nephropathy model with recovery of KLF4 expression and a decrease in albuminuria. In podocyte-specific KLF4 knockout mice, the effect of ARB on albuminuria and the nephrin promoter methylation was attenuated. In cultured human podocytes, angiotensin II reduced KLF4 expression and caused methylation of the nephrin promoter with decreased nephrin expression. In patients, nephrin promoter methylation was increased in proteinuric kidney diseases with decreased KLF4 and nephrin expression. KLF4 expression in ARB-treated patients was higher in patients with than without ARB treatment. Thus, angiotensin II can modulate epigenetic regulation in podocytes and ARB inhibits these actions in part via KLF4 in proteinuric kidney diseases. This study provides a new concept that renin-angiotensin system blockade can exert therapeutic effects through epigenetic modulation of the kidney gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283089>A gender-specific association of the polymorphism Ile197Met in the kininogen 1 gene with plasma  concentrations in Chinese patients with essential hypertension.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to explore interactions in the association of the kininogen (KNG1) Ile197Met polymorphism and gender with plasma concentrations of  in Chinese patients with essential hypertension. A total of 1100 subjects with essential hypertension received a daily oral dose of 150 mg  for twenty-eight consecutive days. High-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence (HPLC) was used to detect plasma  concentrations on day 28. The KNG1 Ile197Met gene polymorphism was determined using high-throughput TaqMan technology. The frequency distribution of KNG1 Ile197Met genotype conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. After 28 days of treatment, patients with the GG genotype had significantly lower  concentrations (P = 0.033) compared to homozygous TT genotype carriers. After stratifying by gender, male G allele carriers had significantly lower  concentrations (GG, P = 0.015; TG, P = 0.015, respectively) relative to TT genotype after adjusting for age, region, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol consumption. However, there was no significant difference in female subjects. A further test for a multiplicative interaction between the KNG1 Ile197Met polymorphism and gender in association with ln-plasma  concentrations in a multiple linear regression model was also significant (P for interaction = 0.033). This is the first study to suggest that gender may influence the association of the Ile197Met variant of KNG1 with ln-plasma  concentration. This finding may indicate that the interaction of gender and the KNG1 Ile197Met gene polymorphism can influence plasma trough  concentrations, which may contribute to a better development of personalized hypertensive treatment in Chinese patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26327754>Management of hepatitis delta: Need for novel therapeutic options.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is the smallest single stranded RNA virus infecting humans. The hepatitis B surface antigen envelope protein protects the HDV nucleocapsid antigen and provides a means for the virus to enter and exit the hepatocyte. Hepatitis B and D viruses exploit the human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), a receptor, for their entry into hepatocytes. Prenylation of the large delta antigen is a critical determinant of HDV particle assembly. Treatment with pegylated interferon results in sustained virological response six months post-treatment in one fourth of the patients. Nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) have been widely tested in hepatitis delta, but they appear to be ineffective. Combination treatment of NAs with interferon also proved to be disappointing so there is a need for novel therapeutic options. The receptor function of NTCP is blocked by Myrcludex B, a synthetic N-acylated preS1 lipopeptide that competes with infectious virions for receptor binding. There are already some approved drugs available, including , ezetimibe, and ritonavir and cyclosporin A, with documented inhibitory effects on NTCP's  function. These drugs may have a role in HDV treatment. Interference with host-mediated post-translational changes of proteins that are crucial to the HDV life cycle, such as prenylation may become an important tool to control HDV infection and prevent replication. Lonafarnib, a prenylation inhibitor significantly reduces virus levels in hepatitis delta patients. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides which are complementary to genomic HDV ribozyme self-cleavage site and stem I regions can inhibit genomic HDV ribozyme activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30549068>Determination of olanzapine for therapeutic drug monitoring in schizophrenia patients by LC/MS method.</a></h2><p>Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug from the thienobenzodiazepine family which displays efficacy in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses.

BP was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by applanation tonometry and left ventricular mass (LVM) by echocardiography. Low medication adherence was assessed through plasma  concentration below 20 ng/ml; urinary N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline/creatinine ratio below 4  nmol/mmol; last medication intake before visit greater than 24 h and pill counting below 80% of theoretical intake. Medication adherence score (sum of items, max = 4) is defined as low (medication adherence score <2) or acceptable (medication adherence score ≥2).Among 164 patients, 134 (81.7%) had acceptable medication adherence and 30 (18.3%) low medication adherence, with similar proportions in the SNB and SRASB arms. After 12 weeks, in patients with acceptable medication adherence, BP was more frequently controlled in those treated with SNB (64%), than SRASB (18%; P < 0.001). The difference in daytime SBP was -11.5  mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -15.4 to -7.5, P < 0.0001] in patients with acceptable medication adherence. In contrast, in patients with low medication adherence, the difference between groups was smaller and not significant (-9.4  mmHg, 95% CI -20.4 to 1.7, P = 0.09).

The association in HF and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF) is unknown. We examined the association between change in level of NT-proBNP and prognosis in patients with HF-PEF.We examined the association between change in NT-proBNP from baseline to 6 months and cardiovascular (CV) death or HF hospitalization in 2612 participants in the  in Patients with Heart Failure and Preserved Systolic Function Study (I-Preserve). Change in NT-proBNP was modelled as a restricted cubic spline in a Cox model after adjusting for baseline NT-proBNP and known prognostic variables. Median change in NT-proBNP from baseline was -7 pg/mL (interquartile range -143 to +108). After adjustment, a 1000 pg/mL decrease in NT-proBNP from baseline was associated with a reduction in the risk of CV death or HF hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.02]; a 1000 pg/mL increase was associated with an increase in risk (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.50-2.69). Beyond a 1000 pg/mL rise or fall, there was little additional change in risk. Addition of change in NT-proBNP at 6 months to a model with only baseline NT-proBNP improved the C-statistic from 0.752 to 0.769 (P = 0.013).In HF-PEF, a rise in NT-proBNP was associated with an increase in risk of CV death or HF hospitalization and a fall was associated with a trend towards a decrease in risk.

The outcomes examined were the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (and its components) and all-cause mortality. Of the 4128 patients enrolled in I-PRESERVE, 3754 were included in the present analyses. A total of 606 patients had a QRS duration ≥120 ms, 302 had LBBB and 742 had RBBB/IVCD. Patients with an abnormal QRS had evidence of more severe heart failure [lower left ventricular ejection fraction, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)] and worse clinical status (higher New York Heart Association functional class and greater use of diuretics). Both abnormalities of QRS duration and QRS morphology were associated with worse outcomes. The rates of the composite outcome were: 6.0 and 9.3 per 100 patient years in the <120 ms and ≥120 ms groups, respectively [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.57; P = 0.002) and 6.0, 7.7 and 8.7 per 100 patient years in the normal, non-LBBB and LBBB groups, respectively (adjusted HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00-1.42, P = 0.046; and HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.66, P = 0.026, respectively, compared with normal). The heightened risk related to QRS abnormalities persisted after adjustment for other prognostic variables, including NT-proBNP.We found that both prolongation of QRS duration and abnormal QRS morphology were associated with a high risk of fatal and non-fatal adverse outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.© 2016 The Authors.

However, the differences among them are still unclear. We designed this study to examine and compare the effects of several ARBs widely used in clinics, including Olmesartan, Candesartan, Telmisartan, Losartan, Valsartan and , on the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis during the development of cardiac remodeling after pressure overload. Although all of the six ARBs, attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 2 or 4weeks in the wild-type mice evaluated by echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements, the degree of attenuation by Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan tended to be larger than that of the other three drugs tested. Additionally, the degree of downregulation of the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis and upregulation of the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis was higher in response to Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan administration in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, in angiotensinogen-knockdown mice, TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure were inhibited by Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan but not by Telmisartan, Valsartan and  administration. Furthermore, only Olmesartan and Candesartan could downregulate the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis and upregulate the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis in vitro. Our data suggest that Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan could effectively inhibit pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling even when with knockdown of Ang II, possibly through upregulation of the expression of the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis and downregulation of the expression of the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis. In contrast, Telmisartan, Valsartan and  only played a role in the presence of AngII, and Losartan had no effect in the presence of AngII in vitro.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Renal denervation (RD) has been shown to improve cardiac function in HF, but the protective mechanisms remain unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that RD ameliorates isoproterenol- (ISO-) induced HF through regulation of brain RAS and PICs. Chronic ISO infusion resulted in remarked decrease in blood pressure (BP) and increase in heart rate and cardiac dysfunction, which was accompanied by increased BP variability and decreased baroreflex sensitivity and HR variability. Most of these adverse effects of ISO on cardiac and autonomic function were reversed by RD. Furthermore, ISO upregulated mRNA and protein expressions of several components of the RAS and PICs in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, two forebrain nuclei involved in cardiovascular regulations. RD significantly inhibited the upregulation of these genes. Either intracerebroventricular AT1-R antagonist, , or TNF- inhibitor, etanercept, mimicked the beneficial actions of RD in the ISO-induced HF. The results suggest that the RD restores autonomic balance and ameliorates ISO-induced HF and that the downregulated RAS and PICs in the brain contribute to these beneficial effects of RD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797786>Suppressive effects of type I angiotensin receptor antagonists, candesartan and  on allergic asthma.</a></h2><p>The effects of candesartan and , antagonists of the type I angiotensin II receptor, were investigated on allergic asthma.

Uric acid was increased in Group-2A after 3 months, but not at 6 months.Although both regimens were effective for reducing BP, increasing amlodipine to 10 mg daily controlled hypertension without elevation of serum uric acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26632190>Effects of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers on  of Arachidonic Acid via CYP2C8.</a></h2><p>Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) via cytochrome enzymes such as CYP 2C9, 2C8 and 2J2. EETs play a role in cardioprotection and regulation of blood pressure. Recently, adverse reactions such as sudden heart attack and fatal myocardial infarction were reported among patients taking angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). As some ARBs have affinity for these CYP enzymes,  inhibition of AA by ARBs is a possible cause for the increase in cardiovascular events. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the inhibitory effects of ARBs on the formation of EETs and further metabolites, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), from AA via CYP2C8. In incubations with recombinant CYP2C8 in vitro, the inhibitory effects were compared by measuring EETs and DHETs by HPLC-MS/MS. Inhibition of AA  by ARBs was detected in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of losartan (42.7 µM), telmisartan (49.5 µM),  (55.6 µM), olmesartan (66.2 µM), candesartan (108 µM), and valsartan (279 µM). Losartan, telmisartan and , which reportedly accumulate in the liver and kidneys, have stronger inhibitory effects than other ARBs. The lower concentration of EETs leads to less protective action on the cardiovascular system and a higher incidence of adverse effects such as sudden heart attack and myocardial infarction in patients taking ARBs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420356>Dose-Effect of  on Cyclooxygenase-2 and Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Expression in Rabbit Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p> has previously shown antiatherosclerotic effects on human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Our study aimed to assess the dose-effect of  on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in rabbit atherosclerotic aorta. New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control (NC), high cholesterol (HC), low-dose (10 mg·kg·day), medium-dose (20 mg·kg·d), and high-dose (30 mg·kg·d)  and celecoxib (20 mg·kg·d). Except for the NCs, rabbits were fed a HC diet for 14 weeks to induce atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerotic lesions and messenger RNA and protein expression of COX-2, MMP-9, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were subsequently measured. The surface area of aortic atherosclerotic lesions was visibly larger in the HC group than in NCs (P < 0.01), but showed considerable reduction with medium- and high-dosage  and celecoxib treatments (P < 0.01). In medium- and high-dosage  and celecoxib groups, COX-2 and MMP-9 expression and NF-κB activity were significantly lower than in the high-cholesterol group (P < 0.01). No significant differences in treatment effects were observed between the high-dosage  and celecoxib groups (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that medium and high doses of  and celecoxib have antiatherosclerotic effects in aortic plaques via inhibition of COX-2 and MMP-9 by suppressing NF-κB activation. High-dose  has effects similar to celecoxib.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29368174>Impact of Drug-Polymer Miscibility on Enthalpy Relaxation of  Amorphous Solid Dispersions.</a></h2><p>Drug-polymer miscibility has been proposed to play a critical role in physical stability of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs). The purpose of the current work was to investigate the role of drug-polymer miscibility on molecular mobility, measured as enthalpy relaxation (ER) of amorphous  (IBS) in ASDs.Two polymers, i.e. polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP K30) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), were used to generate ASDs with 10% w/w of the polymer. Drug-polymer miscibility was determined using melting point depression (MPD) method. Molecular mobility was assessed from ER studies at a common degree of undercooling (DOU) (T - 13.0°C ± 0.5°C).IBS exhibited higher miscibility in PVP K30 as compared to HPMCAS at temperature > 140°C. However, extrapolation of miscibility data to storage temperature (62°C) using Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory revealed a reversal of the trend. Miscibility of IBS was found to be higher in HPMCAS (2.6%) than PVP K30 (1.3%) at 62°C. Stretched relaxation time (τ) of 17.4365 h and 7.0886 h was obtained for IBS-HPMCAS and IBS-PVP K30 ASDs, respectively.Miscibility of drug-polymer at storage temperature explained the behavior of the molecular mobility, while miscibility near the melting point provided a reverse trend. Results suggest that drug-polymer miscibility determined at temperatures higher than the storage temperature should be viewed cautiously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634212>[Regulatory Effect of Chinese Drugs for Stasis Removing and Collaterals Dredging on the Expres- sions of podocin and CD2AP in Podocyte Slit Diaphragm of Diabetic Nephropathy Rats].</a></h2><p>To observe the regulatory effect of Chinese drugs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging (CDSRCD) on the expressions of podocin and CD2AP in podocyte slit diaphragm (SD) of diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats.DN rat model was duplicated in 40 male Sprague- Dawley rats by feeding high fat high glucose diet combined with intraperitoneally injecting 1 % streptozoto- cin (STZ, 35 mg/kg). Totally 36 successfully modeled rats were divided into the model group, the CD- SRCD group,- and the  group according to random digit table, 12 in each group. Besides, anoth- er 10 normal rats were recruited as a normal group. Rats in the CDSRCD group and the  group were intragastrically fed with CDSRCD and  respectively. Rats in the normal group and the mod- el group were fed with equal volume of distilled water at the same time. 24 h urine protein quantitation was detected using ELISA at various time points. Body weight (BW) , kidney weight ( KW), kidney index (KI) , fasting blood glucose (FBG) , serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid (UA) in each group were detected after 16 weeks of intervention. The pathomorphological changes of re- nal tissue were observed under light microscope and electron microscope respectively. The protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP were detected by Western blot and Real-time PCR respectively.(1) Compared with the normal group, 24 h urine protein quantitation significantly increased at week 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively (P <0. 01). BW was decreased; KI and levels of FBG, SCr, BUN, and UA all increased after modeling (P <0. 01). Compared with the model group, 24 h urine protein quan- titation significantly decreased in the CDSRCD group and the  group at week 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively (P <0. 01). Besides, it was more obviously reduced in the CDSRCD group than in the irbe- sartan group (P <0. 05, P <0.01). BUN level obviously decreased both in the CDSRCD group and the  group after modeling (P <0. 05, P <0. 01). (2) Results of renal pathology showed that disar- ranged renal structure, obviously thickened basement membrane, severely proliferated mesenteria, widely fused foot processes in the model group. All these pathological changes were attenuated in the CD- SRCD group and the  group to some degree. (3) Results of Western blot and Real-time PCR showed, compared with the normal group, protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP decreased in the model group (P <0. 01). Compared with the model group, protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP increased in the CDSRCD group and the  group (P <0. 01). Protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP increased more in the CDSRCD group than in the  group (P <0. 05).CDSRCD could protect renal function by lowering urinary protein in DN rats, improve renal pathological changes. Its mechanism might be related to up-regulating mRNA and protein expressions of podocin and CD2AP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29523851>A Novel Role of  in Gastroprotection against Indomethacin-Induced Gastric Injury in Rats: Targeting DDAH/ADMA and EGFR/ERK Signaling.</a></h2><p>The advent of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) as intriguing gastroprotective candidates and the superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics displayed by  compared to many other ARBs raised the interest to investigate its gastroprotective potential in a rat model of gastric injury.  (50 mg/Kg) was orally administered to male Wistar rats once daily for 14 days; thereafter gastric injury was induced by indomethacin (60 mg/Kg, p.o).  reduced gastric ulcer index, gastric acidity, and ameliorated indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal apoptotic and inflammatory aberrations, as demonstrated by hampering caspase-3, prostaglandin E and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression. This ARB increased mucosal dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) gene expression and decreased elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (pERK1/2). Histopathological evaluation corroborated biochemical findings. Overall efficacy of  was comparable to ranitidine, the widely used H receptor blocker. In conclusion,  exerts significant gastroprotection against indomethacin-induced mucosal damage via acid-inhibitory, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and extracellular matrix remodeling mechanisms that are probably mediated, at least partly, by down-regulating DDAH/ADMA and EGFR/ERK1/2 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746136>Relative Activity Factor (RAF)-Based Scaling of Uptake Clearance Mediated by Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 in Human Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>In vitro-in vivo extrapolation based on uptake clearance determined in human hepatocytes has been used to predict in vivo hepatic clearance of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) substrates. This study evaluated the relative activity factor (RAF) approach to extrapolate active uptake clearance in transporter-transfected cell systems (CL) to that in human hepatocyte suspensions (PS). RAF values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were determined in two batches of cryopreserved human hepatocytes using estrone-3-sulfate and cholecystokinin octapeptide as reference substrates, respectively. Fourteen OATP1B substrate drugs selected (atorvastatin, bosentan, cerivastatin, fexofenadine, fluvastatin, glibenclamide, , nateglinide, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, telmisartan, torasemide, and valsartan) showed temperature-dependent uptake in human hepatocytes. In transporter-transfected cells, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated uptake was observed in all compounds except for telmisartan. RAF-based net CL was mainly accounted for by OATP1B1 (72.3-99.7%) and fell within the 3-fold of PS observed in human hepatocytes in 11 out of 13 compounds (excluding telmisartan). This study demonstrated that the RAF approach provides a quantitative index of OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated PS in human hepatocytes, which will facilitate the optimization of the pharmacokinetic properties of OATP1B substrates at nonclinical stages of drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29436482>The angiotensin type 2 receptor in the human adrenocortical zona glomerulosa and in aldosterone-producing adenoma: low expression and no functional role.</a></h2><p>The angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptor (AT2R) and the angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) receptor (MasR) play a cardiovascular protective role by counter-regulating Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-mediated effects, but whether this involves blunting of adrenocortical hormone secretion is unknown. We investigated the presence of AT1R, AT2R, and MasR in aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), a condition featuring hyperaldosteronism, and in APA-adjacent tissue. The effect of Compound 21 (C21), an AT2R agonist, on CYP11B1 (cortisol synthase) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) gene expression in NCI-H295R and HAC15 cell lines, and in APA and APA-adjacent tissue, was also assessed using the AT1R antagonist  to ascertain the specificity of C21 effect. We found that the AT1R, AT2R, and MasR were expressed in APA and APA-adjacent tissue, albeit heterogeneously. The gene expression of AT1R and AT2R was lower, and that of the MasR higher in APAs than in APA-adjacent tissue. In steroid-producing NCI-H295R and HAC15 cell lines, and in APA and APA-adjacent tissue, C21 was ineffective at nanomolar concentrations, but increased CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 gene expression at micromolar concentrations through AT1R, as this effect was blunted by . The scant expression of the AT2R, along with the lack of any effect of C21 at low concentrations on CYP11B2, do not support the contention that the protective arm of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blunts aldosterone synthase in the normal adrenal cortex and primary aldosteronism.© 2018 The Author(s).
