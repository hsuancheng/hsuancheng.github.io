Colorectal  patients suffer from various forms of psychological stress reflected in elevated plasma catecholamines, and their  cells express adrenergic receptors. Our objective was to investigate whether adrenergic activation contributes to the chemoresistance of  cancers, and to explore the signal transduction pathway involved in the activation. The mRNA expression of the ABCB1 gene (previously MDR1) in human  carcinoma HT-29 cell line was measured after treatment with an adrenergic receptor agonist (adrenaline) and various antagonists (propranolol, prazosin, and yohimbine). The function of P-glycoprotein, the protein product of the ABCB1 gene, was assessed by rhodamine 123 (Rh123)-retention assay, and chemosensitivity was determined by evaluating the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the tumor cells. Increased ABCB1 mRNA expression and P-glycoprotein function levels in HT-29 cells by adrenaline was dose-dependent. This was accompanied by promotion of Rh123 efflux, and resistance to the growth-inhibiting effect of 5-FU in the tumor cells. The alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine completely abolished the induction of ABCB1 mRNA, the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on Rh123 efflux, and the growth-inhibiting effect of 5-FU. The alpha1-adrenergic receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists did not inhibit the induction of ABCB1. The stimulating effects were coupled with extracellular receptor kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, but were not associated with protein kinase A activity. We conclude that adrenaline induces multidrug resistance in  cells by upregulating ABCB1 gene expression via alpha2-adrenergic receptors, and such effects were associated with the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212885>Epinephrine promotes COX-2-dependent immune suppression in myeloid cells and  tissues.</a></h1><p>Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., due to stress) has been implicated in  progression and recurrence, but its -promoting effects have been variable between different studies. Here, we report that although catecholamines, mediators of systemic sympathetic activity, display only weak immunosuppressive impact on their own, their combination with inflammatory signals leads to the induction of COX-2 and multiple COX-2-dependent suppressive factors in human myeloid cells and  tissues. Human macrophages exposed to epinephrine and TNFα, or macrophages generated in 6day cultures in the presence of epinephrine, expressed high levels of COX-2, IDO and IL-10, and strongly suppressed both the proliferation and IFNγ production of CD8 T cells. These suppressive effects of epinephrine were counteracted by celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2 activity, which inhibited the induction of immunosuppressive factors (including the elevated expression of COX-2 itself) and the ability of epinephrine-exposed macrophages to suppress CD8 T cell responses. The activation of the COX-2/PGE system and COX-2-dependent suppressive events were also observed in ex vivo human breast and  explant cultures and were similarly counteracted by celecoxib. Our preliminary data also indicate elevated COX-2 expression in mammary tumors of chronic stress-exposed mice. The current demonstration of the interplay between inflammation and the induction of immunosuppressive factors by catecholamines suggest a contextual impact of stress, helping to explain variable results of epidemiologic studies of the link between sympathetic activity and  progression, and implicating COX-2 blockade as a potential means to mitigate stress-related immune suppression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This medium consists of a 1:1 mixture of an enriched Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (EMED) and a modified Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (FMED) supplemented with 0.9% methylcellulose, 1% bovine serum albumin, 80 micrograms/ml human transferrin, 3 micrograms/ml insulin, 2.8 micrograms/ml linoleic acid, 2.6 micrograms/ml cholesterol, 20 microM , and trace elements. Colony formation by WiDr cells is linear with the numbers of cells plated, having a plating efficiency (PE) of 34%, as compared to 26% in serum-containing medium. Two of the melanoma cell lines. MP6 and MeIuso, exhibit linear relationships between colony numbers and cell concentration with PEs of 21% and 70% respectively. Colony formation by the other two melanoma cell lines appears to be nonlinear.

The sympatholytic guanethidine (5 mg/kg) and the alfa-adrenoblocker butyroxan (2.5 mg/kg) did not influence the carcinogenesis in the intestine. The noradrenaline- and atropine-induced (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) increase in the adrenergic component of the vegetative nervous system led to the decrease in the number (by 2-3 times) and size of the tumor nodes in the intestine.

Despite operative advances and the widespread adoption of combined-modality treatment, the 5-year survival rarely exceeds 60%. Improving our understanding of the biological processes involved in CRC development and progression will help generate new diagnostic and prognostic approaches. Previous studies have identified altered metabolism as a common feature in carcinogenesis, and quantitative measurement of this altered activity (metabonomics/metabolomics) has the potential to generate novel metabolite-based biomarkers for CRC diagnosis, staging and prognostication. In the present study we applied high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy to analyze metabolites in intact tumor samples (n = 83) and samples of adjacent mucosa (n = 87) obtained from 26 patients undergoing surgical resection for CRC. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of metabolic profiles identified marked biochemical differences between  tissue and adjacent mucosa (R(2) = 0.72; Q(2) = 0.45; AUC = 0.91). Taurine, isoglutamine, choline, lactate, phenylalanine, tyrosine (increased concentrations in tumor tissue) together with lipids and triglycerides (decreased concentrations in tumor tissue) were the most discriminant metabolites between the two groups in the model. In addition, tumor tissue metabolic profiles were able to distinguish between tumors of different T- and N-stages according to TNM classification. Moreover, we found that tumor-adjacent mucosa (10 cm from the tumor margin) harbors unique metabolic field changes that distinguish tumors according to T- and N-stage with higher predictive capability than tumor tissue itself and are accurately predictive of 5-year survival (AUC = 0.88), offering a highly novel means of tumor classification and prognostication in CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1483263>Lack of therapeutic effects of platelet activating factor antagonists in WEHI-3B leukemia, human xenotransplanted colorectal and lung  and Lewis-lung tumor in vivo.</a></h1><p>Four new antagonists of platelet activating factor (PAF) from two different chemical classes (imidazoisoquinolines: SDZ 62-434, SDZ 63-135, SDZ 62-759; imidazopiperidines: SDZ 62-293) were tested for in vivo therapeutic activity in various tumor models including the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHl-3B, xenografts of human  (HTB 38) and lung (HTB 119)  cell lines and the murine Lewis-lung tumor. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 1 x 10(3), 5 x 10(3) and 1 x 10(4) WEHl-3B cells into Balb/c mice, the drugs were given per os (p.o.) or i.p. over 6-14 days. Drug doses were pushed to exceed the lethal dose for 10% of the animals (LD10) and ranged from 1 to 100 mg/kg daily for p.o. treatment and from 1 to 75 mg/kg daily for i.p. treatment. In the xenotransplants and the Lewis-lung tumor experiments, PAF antagonists were given i.p. to nude Balb/c and C57 Black mice after intracutaneous (i.c.) tumor cell inoculation. None of the four compounds induced reproducible prolongation of life span, significant numbers of long term survivors, reduction of tumor size, or delay of tumor growth in any of the therapeutic models. Oral SDZ 62-759 had some activity in experiments in which there was slow WEHl-38 tumor growth in the controls.

Implications for intracellular trafficking in toxin action.</a></h1><p>Cholera toxin (CT) consists of a pentameric B subunit which binds to ganglioside GM1 on the cell surface and an A subunit which activates adenylylcyclase. The latter process involves the reduction of A to the A1 peptide which ADP-ribosylates the stimulatory G protein, Gs of adenylylcyclase. There is a distinct lag phase between toxin binding and activation of adenylylcyclase. Little is known about the events during this lag including where A1 is generated and how it gains access to Gs on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. We explored the effects of several inhibitors of intracellular trafficking on the response of human SK-N-MC neurotumor and Caco-2 intestinal tumor cells to CT. Whereas chloroquine or monensin had little or no effect on CT stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation, brefeldin A (BFA) totally inhibited the response to CT in a time- and dose-dependent and reversible manner. BFA was effective when added at the same time as CT and had an IC50 of 30 ng/ml. BFA did not alter cell surface GM1 as cells treated with BFA for 30 min bound as much 125I-CT as control cells. Furthermore, BFA inhibited CT stimulation of GM1-treated rat glioma C6 cells. BFA treatment did not affect beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation of cyclic AMP. In addition, adenylylcyclase was activated by A1 peptide and NAD+ to the same extent in membranes from control and BFA-treated cells, or when BFA was added directly to the assay. Whereas control cells generated small amounts of A1 from bound CT with time, no A1 was detected in BFA-treated cells. BFA treatment did not prevent the internalization of CT but did inhibit its degradation. BFA is known to disrupt the organization of the Golgi complex, resulting in inhibition of protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and redistribution of Golgi enzymes to the endoplasmic reticulum. BFA also prevents the formation of non-clathrin-coated vesicles from Golgi membranes and thus vesicular transport between Golgi cisternae. We confirmed that BFA caused the morphological disruption of the Golgi apparatus in Caco-2 cells. The data support a role for a functional Golgi apparatus with its associated vesicular routing in CT action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16381019>The norepinephrine-driven metastasis development of PC-3 human prostate  cells in BALB/c nude mice is inhibited by beta-blockers.</a></h1><p>The development of metastases is a decisive step in the course of a  disease. The detection of metastases in  patients is correlated with a poor prognosis, and over 90% of all deaths from  are not due to the primary tumor, which often can be successfully treated, but are due to the metastases. Tumor cell migration, a prerequisite for metastasis development, is not merely genetically determined, but is distinctly regulated by signal substances of the environment including chemokines and neurotransmitters. We have shown previously that the migration of breast, prostate, and  carcinoma cells is enhanced by the stress-related neurotransmitter norepinephrine in vitro, and that this effect can be inhibited by the beta-blocker propranolol. We now provide for the first time evidence for the in vivo relevance of this neurotransmitter-driven regulation using PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells. The development of lumbar lymph node metastases in athymic BALB/c nude mice increased with the application of norepinephrine via microosmotic pumps, while propranolol inhibited this effect. However, the growth of the primary tumor was not affected by either treatment. Additionally, experiments using human tissue microarrays showed that 70-90 percent of breast, , and prostate carcinoma tissues express the relevant beta2-adrenoceptor. Thus, our work contributes to the understanding of the basic cellular mechanisms of metastasis development, and furthermore delivers a rationale for the chemopreventive use of clinically established beta-blockers for the inhibition of metastases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/407708>The influence of adrenoceptor activity on cell proliferation in  crypt ipithelium and in  adenocarcinomata.</a></h1><p>The effects of chemical sympathectomy and of the injection of amines or amine-receptor blocking drugs on cell proliferation in  crypts and in dimethylhydrazine-induced  carcinomata is examined in rats using a stathmokinetic technique. In animals which had been chemically sympathectomized by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine cell proliferation essentially ceased in the  crypts but continued at a normal rate in the tumours. Stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by metaraminol, a drug with properties similar to noradrenaline, caused acceleration of cell proliferation in  crypts but not in tumours. Conversely, blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors by phentolamine inhibited cell proliferation in crypts but not in tumours. Injection of adrenaline, predominantly a beta-adrenergic agonist, inhibited cell proliferation in the tumours but not in  crypts whereas blockade of beta-adrenoceptors by propranolol accelerated cell proliferation in tumours but not in  crypts. It is postulated that cell proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkühn in rat  resembles that in rat jejunum in being controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

A gold disk modified with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) was functionalised via covalent immobilization of monoclonal anti-ET-1 antibodies using EDC-NHS (1-(3-(dimethylamine)-propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxy succinimide) chemistry. This immunosensing platform (/anti-ET-1/11-MUA/Au) was characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle (CA) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic techniques. The fabricated SPR electrode was further used to detect ET-1 in the broad concentration range 2-100 pg mL, with a detection limit of 0.30 pg mL and remarkable sensitivity of 2.18 m pgmL. The adsorption mechanism was studied using monophasic model and the values of association (k) and dissociation (k) constants for anti-ET-1 and ET-1 binding were calculated to be 4.4 ± 0.4 × 10 M s and 2.04 ± 0.0003 × 10 s, respectively. The results obtained via analysis of serum samples of colorectal  patients were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique.

The electrochemical behaviour of human  adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells from a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, the hormone and neurotransmitter epinephrine, and nicotine, were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, using indium tin oxide (ITO), glassy carbon (GC) and screen printed carbon (SPC) electrodes. The oxidation of the HT-29 cells, previously grown onto ITO or SPC surfaces, followed an irreversible oxidation process that involved the formation of a main oxidation product that undergoes irreversible reduction, as in the epinephrine oxidation mechanism. The effect of nicotine stimulation of the HT-29 cells was also investigated. Nicotine, at different concentration levels 1, 2 and 15 mM, was introduced in the culture medium and an increase with incubation time, 0 to 3h and 30 min, of the HT-29 cells oxidation and reduction peaks was observed. The interaction of nicotine with the HT-29 cells stimulated the epinephrine secretion causing an increase in epinephrine release concentration, and enabling the conclusion that epinephrine and nicotine play an important role in the colorectal tumour growth.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Studies suggest that stress increases the incidence and promotes the development of cancers. Cigarette smoking and stress are closely associated, as people often smoke under stressful conditions and both of them can activate the adrenergic nervous system.To investigate the effects of cigarette smoking and restraint stress on  growth and the possible underlying mechanisms in these pathological processes.Nude mice bearing a HT-29 human  xenograft were either exposed to cigarette smoke and/or restraint stress.

Epinephrine or cyclic AMP (cAMP) stimulated single-channel activity in human airway cells during cell-attached recording. Similarly, prostaglandin E2 and cAMP stimulated single-channel activity in T84 cells. Ion substitution experiments with patches in the inside-out configuration indicated greater than 10:1 selectivity for Cl over Na in channels from both cell types, which confirms the identity of these events as Cl channel openings. The Ca ionophore A23187 stimulated these Cl channels to open in both cell types. Human airway cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) did not respond to epinephrine or cAMP, but A23187 treatment elicited Cl channel activity. Changes in bath Ca activity in the inside-out configuration demonstrated that increased Ca could activate cAMP-insensitive Cl channels in CF cells. This indicates that the primary defect in CF is in the regulation of Cl channel opening rather than in conduction of Cl through the channel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11306460>Norepinephrine-induced migration of SW 480  carcinoma cells is inhibited by beta-blockers.</a></h1><p>Beta-adrenoceptors are highly expressed on SW 480  carcinoma cells as was assessed by flow cytometry. We investigated the influence of norepinephrine on the migration of these cells using time-lapse videomicroscopy. Norepinephrine-treatment increased the locomotor activity within the population from 25% spontaneously locomoting cells to 65% locomoting cells. The beta1/2-blocker propranolol but not the beta1-blocker atenolol inhibited this increase. The intracellular signaling solely of norepinephrine-induced locomotion involved protein tyrosine kinase activity, whereas both spontaneous and norepinephrine-induced migration were reduced by inhibiting phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha activity.

It is suggested that 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, mediates the carcinogenic action of cigarette smoking by promoting  growth. In the present study, the proliferative response of a cultured  cell line HT-29 to NNK was determined. It was found that NNK dose-dependently stimulated HT-29 cell proliferation. In this regard, the stimulatory action of NNK was abolished by atenolol and ICI 118,551, a beta1- and beta2-selective antagonist, respectively. In addition, cell growth was stimulated by the nonselective adrenergic agonist, noradrenaline, and more effectively by the beta-selective agonist, isoproterenol. The second message cyclic AMP level for beta-adrenoceptor activation was elevated by isoproterenol and NNK treatment. These agents also up-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cytosolic phospholipase A2 expression, and prostaglandin E2 release. Beta2-adrenoceptor blockade with ICI 118,551, in contrast, significantly decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cytosolic phospholipase A2 expression and prostaglandin E2 release induced by NNK and isoproterenol. To conclude, it is proposed that NNK stimulates HT-29 cell proliferation through beta-adrenoceptors, preferentially beta2 receptors. Activation of the beta-adrenoceptors, and the consequent cyclic AMP elevation coupled with the downstream arachidonic acid pathway, is perhaps an important mechanistic cascade in the promotion of  growth.

Tryptic hexapeptide T12, terminating atypically with alanine, corresponded in sequence (Ser-Ile-Thr-Val-Ser-Ala) with the last six residues (637-642) of the third repeating domain in the mature CEA protein. Mass determination of the hexapeptide by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry suggested the presence of an additional  moiety. This finding and the absence of the subsequent 26 hydrophobic residues predicted by cDNA sequence is evidence that hexapeptide T12 is the COOH-terminal peptide of mature CEA. A synthetic peptide identical to hexapeptide T12 was prepared, and  was coupled to its COOH-terminal alanine; chromatographic properties of this synthetic -coupled peptide and peptide T12 were the same.

Basal and stimulated lymphocyte AC activity was studied in 51 healthy persons and 52  patients (14 with , 21 with rectal  and 17 with stomach ) aged 20-75 years. In 31 of 35 patients with colorectal  the AC activity was studied simultaneously in lymphocytes, tumor tissue and normal  mucosa. To evaluate basal and stimulated AC activity the measurement of c-AMP (Amersham kits) formed in the presence of ATP regenerating system was used. Basal and by VIP, pentagastrin and sodium fluoride stimulated AC activity in lymphocytes of gastrointestinal  patients was lower than in lymphocytes of healthy subjects of similar age. Stage dependence of the parameters under study was not found. There was a tendency for higher basal and stimulated lymphocyte AC activity in  patients as compared to stomach and rectal  patients. In colorectal  patients the peculiarities of lymphocyte AC reactions to stimulation were closer to those in tumor tissue but not to those in normal  mucosa. The reaction of lymphocyte AC to VIP and glucagon coincided more frequently with tumor AC reactions to the same hormones in case of hormone nonsensitive tumors. Thus, basal and stimulated lymphocyte AC activity in colorectal  patients was modified to some degree by tumor factors. Lymphocyte AC reactions to VIP and glucagon may be considered as indirect markers of hormone sensitivity of  tumors. Moreover, the probability of discovery of hormone nonsensitive tumors by this way is more reliable than hormone sensitive ones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1980322>The treatment of pheochromocytoma associated with pseudo-obstruction and perforation of the , hepatic failure, and DIC.</a></h1><p>The case of a 59-year-old man with paralytic ileus (pseudo-obstruction) associated with pheochromocytoma is reviewed.

Furthermore, we explored the possible correlation between choline uptake and cell proliferation. Choline uptake was saturable and mediated by a single transport system. Interestingly, removal of Na(+) from the uptake buffer strongly enhanced choline uptake. This increase in component of choline uptake under Na(+)-free conditions was inhibited by a Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) inhibitor. Collapse of the plasma-membrane H(+) electrochemical gradient by a protonophore inhibited choline uptake. Choline uptake was inhibited by the choline analogue hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) and various organic cations, and was significantly decreased by acidification of the extracellular medium and by intracellular alkalinization. Real-time PCR revealed that choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1), CTL2, CTL4 and NHE1 mRNA are mainly expressed in HT-29 cells. Western blot and immunocytochemical analysis indicated that CTL1 protein was expressed in plasma membrane. The biochemical and pharmacological data indicated that CTL1 is functionally expressed in HT-29 cells and is responsible for choline uptake in these cells. We conclude that choline transporters, especially CTL1, use a directed H(+) gradient as a driving force, and its transport functions in co-operation with NHE1. Finally, cell proliferation was inhibited by HC-3 and tetrahexylammonium chloride (THA), which strongly inhibits choline uptake. Identification of this novel CTL1-mediated choline uptake system provides a potential new target for therapeutic intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6618274>A pathophysiological study of the intestinal manifestations of a vasoactive intestinal peptide, calcitonin, and catecholamine-secreting tumour.</a></h1><p>A three year old girl with severe watery diarrhoea and a vasoactive intestinal peptide, calcitonin, and catecholamine-secreting supra-renal ganglioneuroblastoma is reported.

These data indicate that nylon net filters coated with  groups are able to trap Colo201 cells at a higher specificity than unmodified nylon net filters, effectively isolating and removing them from the blood, and suggest the potential benefits of the prevention of metastasis,  assessment and examination technologies as essential pre-treatment strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11206844>Interaction of tumor cells with vascular endothelia: role of platelet-activating factor.</a></h1><p>We investigated whether tumor cell/endothelia interaction can be influenced by platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), a lipid mediator that promotes adhesiveness and extravasation of leukocytes in the inflammatory reaction. We found that the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 prevents adhesion of melanoma Hs294T and  carcinoma LS180 lines to IL-1-stimulated endothelial cells. Moreover, PAF stimulated the adhesiveness of Hs294T and LS180 cells to VCAM-1 and E- selectin, respectively, in an artificial model consisting of recombinant adhesive proteins bound to protein A-coated substrata. Thus, tumoral and not endothelial cell surface seems to be involved in the PAF-mediated enhancement of tumor cell adhesiveness to IL-1-activated endothelia. This observation is supported by the finding that Hs294T and LS180 cells express high affinity and functionally active receptors for PAF. By using specific inhibitors, we found that PAF-induced enhancement of cell adhesiveness was mediated by G-protein activation and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in Hs294T and LS180 cells stimulated by PAF. In conclusion, we demonstrated that PAF-mediated activation of tumor cells enhances their adhesiveness to IL-1-stimulated vascular endothelia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235095>Evaluation of deuterated 18F- and 11C-labeled choline analogs for  detection by positron emission tomography.</a></h1><p>(11)C-Choline-positron emission tomography (PET) has been exploited to detect the aberrant choline metabolism in tumors. Radiolabeled choline uptake within the imaging time is primarily a function of transport, phosphorylation, and oxidation. Rapid choline oxidation, however, complicates interpretation of PET data. In this study, we investigated the biologic basis of the oxidation of deuterated choline analogs and assessed their specificity in human tumor xenografts.(11)C-Choline, (11)C-methyl-[1,2-(2)H(4)]-choline ((11)C-D4-choline), and (18)F-D4-choline were synthesized to permit comparison. Biodistribution, metabolism, small-animal PET studies, and kinetic analysis of tracer uptake were carried out in human  HCT116 xenograft-bearing mice.Oxidation of choline analogs to betaine was highest with (11)C-choline, with reduced oxidation observed with (11)C-D4-choline and substantially reduced with (18)F-D4-choline, suggesting that both fluorination and deuteration were important for tracer metabolism. Although all tracers were converted intracellularly to labeled phosphocholine (specific signal), the higher rate constants for intracellular retention (K(i) and k(3)) of (11)C-choline and (11)C-D4-choline, compared with (18)F-D4-choline, were explained by the rapid conversion of the nonfluorinated tracers to betaine within HCT116 tumors. Imaging studies showed that the uptake of (18)F-D4-choline in three tumors with similar radiotracer delivery (K(1)) and choline kinase α expression-HCT116, A375, and PC3-M-were the same, suggesting that (18)F-D4-choline has utility for  detection irrespective of histologic type.We have shown here that both deuteration and fluorination combine to provide protection against choline oxidation in vivo. (18)F-D4-choline showed the highest selectivity for phosphorylation and warrants clinical evaluation.©2012 AACR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/278431>Angiography with vasoactive drugs in diagnosis of diverticular disease and carcinoma of the sigmoid .</a></h1><p>39 patients with sigmoid lesions have been examined with angiografphy, using epinephrine and propranolol. 11 had carcinoma, all were diagnosed angiographically.

The enzyme may protect the intestinal mucosa from inflammation and tumorigenesis. PAF (platelet-activating factor) is a pro-inflammatory phospholipid involved in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. We examined whether alk-SMase can hydrolyse and inactivate PAF. [3H]Octadecyl-labelled PAF was incubated with purified rat intestinal alk-SMase or recombinant human alk-SMase expressed in COS-7 cells. The hydrolytic products were assayed with TLC and MS. We found that alkSMase cleaved the phosphocholine head group from PAF and generated 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Differing from the activity against SM, the activity against PAF was optimal at pH 7.5, inhibited by EDTA and stimulated by 0.1-0.25 mM Zn2+. The activity was abolished by site mutation of the predicted metal-binding sites that are conserved in all NPP members. Similar to the activity against SM, the activity against PAF was dependent on bile salt, particularly taurocholate and taurochenodeoxycholate. The V(max) for PAF hydrolysis was 374 mumol x h(-1) x (mg of protein)(-1). The hydrolysis of PAF and SM could be inhibited by the presence of SM and PAF respectively, the inhibition of PAF hydrolysis by SM being stronger. The PAF-induced MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activation and IL-8 (interleukin 8) release in HT-29 cells, and chemotaxis in leucocytes were abolished by alk-SMase treatment. In conclusion, alk-SMase hydrolyses and inactivates PAF by a phospholipase C activity. The finding reveals a novel function, by which alk-SMase may counteract the development of intestinal inflammation and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15108107>Prophylactic submucosal saline-adrenaline injection in colonoscopic polypectomy: prospective randomized study.</a></h1><p>Endoscopic polypectomy is a standard method of treatment of gastrointestinal polyps, but is associated with substantial risk of complications. The most common is hemorrhage, the rate of which varied between 0.3%, and 6%. Various prophylactic techniques have been used to reduce this incidence. The aim of this study was to establish whether the prophylactic injection of adrenaline-saline solution reduces the risk of postpolypectomy bleeding in colonoscopic polypectomy.Between May 2000 and June 2002, patients with colorectal polyps of size > or =1 cm were randomized to receive submucosal epinephrine injection (group A) or no injection (group B). The polypectomies were carried out using the conventional method. In group A, epinephrine (1/10,000) was injected into the stalk or base of the polyp. The patients were observed for complications.A total of 69 patients with 100 polyps were enrolled in this study: n = 50 in group A, and n = 50 in group B, according to randomization. There were a total of nine episodes of postpolypectomy hemorrhage, one in the epinephrine group and eight in the control group (1/50 vs 8/50, p < 0.05). The bleeding correlated with the size of the polyps and the diameter of the stalks.Epinephrine injection prior to colonoscopic polypectomy is effective in preventing bleeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3203325>Active production and membrane anchoring of carcinoembryonic antigen observed in normal  mucosa.</a></h1><p>Normal  mucosa was found to produce carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) quite actively as cancerous tissues do when maintained in an organ culture, although the fresh normal mucosae contained a very small quantity of CEA unlike cancerous tissues.

Nicotine is a major alkaloid in cigarette smoke. In the present study, we showed that nicotine stimulated HT-29 cell proliferation and adrenaline production in a dose-dependent manner. The stimulatory action of nicotine was reversed by atenolol and ICI 118,551, a beta(1)- and beta(2)-selective antagonist, respectively, suggesting the role of beta-adrenoceptors in mediating the action. Nicotine also significantly upregulated the expression of the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes [tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase]. Inhibitor of TH, a rate-limiting enzyme in the catecholamine-biosynthesis pathway, reduced the actions of nicotine on cell proliferation and adrenaline production. Expression of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7-nAChR) was demonstrated in HT-29 cells. Methyllycaconitine, an alpha7-nAChR antagonist, reversed the stimulatory actions of nicotine on cell proliferation, TH and DbetaH expression as well as adrenaline production. Taken together, through the action on alpha7-nAChR nicotine stimulates HT-29 cell proliferation via the upregulation of the catecholamine-synthesis pathway and ultimately adrenaline production and beta-adrenergic activation. These data reveal the contributory role alpha7-nAChR and beta-adrenoceptors in the tumorigenesis of  cells and partly elucidate the carcinogenic action of cigarette smoke on .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1280536>Lack of evidence for a high-affinity sarcosinamide carrier or a catecholamine carrier in Calu-1 lung- cells, HT-29  cells, and DHF fibroblasts.</a></h1><p>We have previously demonstrated that uptake of the amino acid amide sarcosinamide by the glioma cell line SK-MG-1 occurs via the catecholamine carrier that accommodates epinephrine (Km = 0.284 mM; Vmax = 0.154 nmol/10(6) cells/min). Sarcosinamide chloroethylnitrosourea (SarCNU), a new anticancer agent that exerts increased in vitro antitumor activity against gliomas as compared with BCNU (bis-chloroethylnitrosourea), the standard agent of choice, competitively inhibits sarcosinamide uptake by SK-MG-1 cells [inhibition constant (Ki) = 3.26 mM]. Using radiolabeled N-[3H]-sarcosinamide, we determined the transport of sarcosinamide in HT-29  cells, in Calu-1 lung- cells, and in normal foreskin DHF fibroblasts. Sarcosinamide transport was linear for up to 1 min at 22 degrees C. In HT-29 cells and DHF fibroblasts, the uptake of sarcosinamide followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics of carrier-mediated transport. In HT-29 cells the Michaelis constant (Km) was 2.76 +/- 0.1 mM and the maximal velocity (Vmax) was 2.03 +/- 0.1 nmol/10(6) cells/min, whereas in DHF fibroblasts the respective values were 6.58 +/- 3.90 mM and 12.08 +/- 8.20 nmol/10(6) cells/min. In these two cell lines, neither epinephrine nor leucine significantly reduced sarcosinamide transport. In Calu-1 cells there was no evidence of carrier-mediated transport of either sarcosinamide or epinephrine. These nonglial cell lines lack a high-affinity catecholamine carrier. The increased cytotoxicity of SarCNU in gliomas may correlate with the presence of a high-affinity catecholamine carrier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9552223>Mucin secretion in inflammatory bowel disease: comparison of a macrophage-derived mucin secretagogue (MMS-68) to conventional secretagogues.</a></h1><p>We have described a novel macrophage-derived mucin secretagogue (MMS-68) that mediates mucin secretion in  cell lines and explants of normal and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mucosa. We compared MMS-68 induced mucin release with other known intestinal mucin secretagogues in normal  explants and in the HT-29  cell line, and to study the effects of MMS-68 on mucin release from inflamed and uninflamed ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) mucosa. In normal  explants and HT-29 cells, each of the secretagogues including, MMS-68-induced mucin release two- to fivefold more than culture medium alone. In HT-29 cells, MMS-68 plus leukotriene C4 (LTC4) induced a 50% increase in mucin release over either secretagogue alone, and MMS-68 plus platelet-activating factor (PAF) markedly enhanced mucin release by eightfold over either secretagogue. In  explants from patients with UC and CD, the mucin release in response to MMS-68 was similar to that of normal  explants. Likewise, in isolated epithelial cells from CD and UC (whether involved or uninvolved), MMS-68-induced release was similar to that of epithelial cells isolated from normal  mucosa. The number of MMS-68-producing macrophages was lower in uninflamed UC mucosa compared with inflamed UC mucosa and CD mucosa. The mucin secretagogue activity of MMS-68 is comparable to that of other known secretagogues, and PAF can have a synergistic effect on this activity. Whole tissue explants and isolated  epithelial cells from patients with IBD respond at least as well as their normal counterparts to MMS-68.

Pre-clinical studies have indicated the absence of "standard" side effects such as myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. The present phase I trial was carried out in nine patients at doses ranging up to 133 mg/m2. The major toxicities up to that dose were mild, reversible hypotension, tachycardia and tremor. No haematological or biochemical toxicity was observed. Murine pharmacokinetics were assessed at a dose level that was effective in experimental tumours and compared with human pharmacokinetic parameters derived from this study. The results indicated the clinical possibility of reaching peak drug levels associated with experimental activity. However, no responses were seen at the doses used. This study was terminated prior to its completion due to an unexplained loss of activity against murine tumours since September 1987. No significant loss of the in vitro anti-mitotic activity originally reported by Boder et al. [3] was observed. Possible reasons for the apparent loss of in vivo activity have been intensively investigated, but no cause has been determined.

Studies have suggested that chemoradiotherapy adversely affects anorectal function. However, the functional implication and the underlying neuromyogenic changes involved in radiation-induced damage are poorly understood.This study evaluated the functional changes following chemoradiotherapy on the internal anal sphincter.This article describes an in vitro study on the internal anal sphincter collected from patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection or proctectomy. Five patients were treated by surgery alone (control group), and 6 received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (treatment group). Sphincter strips were mounted in organ bath, and the responses to electrical field stimulation and drugs were monitored.The study was performed at the University of Oxford.The end points of this study were to investigate whether chemoradiotherapy has any significant effects on internal anal sphincter function and, subsequently, to establish the type of injury induced.Chemoradiotherapy strips developed similar tone, but significantly lower spontaneous activity (p = 0.001) than controls. Electrical field stimulation induced relaxation, followed by contraction. At 50 Hz, electrical field stimulation produced 25.6 ± 4.9% (mean ± SE) of maximum relaxation followed by a contraction of 5.5 ± 0.9% of basal tone in chemoradiotherapy strips i9n comparison with 47.0 ± 6.2% (p = 0.009) and 17.7 ± 4.0% (p = 0.007) in controls. Relaxation was significantly attenuated by N-nitro-L-arginine. Significant differences were found in responses to carbachol (p = 0.018) and phenylephrine (p = 0.022), but not to sodium nitroprusside.This work was limited by the relatively small number of patients enrolled, because of the difficulty of finding human tissue for laboratory studies, and the lack of long-term results.Chemoradiotherapy significantly impairs internal anal sphincter function and intrinsic nerves seem more susceptible than smooth muscle.

Spectrofluorimetric and preliminary spatio-temporal analysis using confocal laser scanning fluorescence imaging microscopy.</a></h1><p>We examined the ability of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and its lyso derivative (lyso-PAF) to elicit increases in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in HT29 human  carcinoma cells. Using spectrofluorimetric analysis with indo-1 as the [Ca2+]i reporter molecule, we found that 1-10 microM concentrations of both lipids stimulated substantial, reversible, monophasic [Ca2+]i elevations. Evidence was obtained that the two lipids may act via specific receptors to release Ca2+ from internal stores. Homologous desensitization was observed in both cases and PAF and lyso-PAF were also able to desensitize cells reciprocally (heterologous desensitization). The potent PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 (3-[4-(chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f][1,2, 4]triazolo-[4,3-a][1,4]-diazepin-2-yl]-1-(4-morpholinyl)-1-propano ne) successfully blocked PAF-induced [Ca2+]i elevations, but did not affect rises in response to lyso-PAF, suggesting that lyso-PAF may act through a different cellular receptor or mechanism. Higher concentrations (> 10 microM) of PAF resulted in non-reversible [Ca2+]i elevations which were caused by Ca2+ influx following membrane lysis. However, the WEB 2086 insensitivity of these effects and the resultant cellular toxicity clearly showed that such events were mechanistically distinct from the reversible [Ca2+]i elevations apparently operating via WEB 2086-sensitive receptors. Preliminary spatio-temporal observations, using confocal microscopy and fluo-3 as the [Ca2+]i reporter molecule, suggested that PAF can also induce [Ca2+]i elevations in the absence of cell lysis in monolayer HT29 cells. Visual impressions were obtained of cellular and subcellular heterogeneity and of [Ca2+]i oscillations in responding cells. However, these need to be interpreted with caution because of the intrinsic limitations of the methodology, particularly using non-ratiometric dyes. The significance of a receptor-mediated, reversible elevation of [Ca2+]i by sub-toxic concentrations of PAF in HT29  cells remains to be elucidated, but it is tempting to speculate that PAF might function as a locally acting signalling mediator in these and possibly other tumour cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/937051>Pharmacoangiography in experimental tumours.

Choline and its oxidation product betaine are involved in this metabolism and can serve as alternative methyl group donors when folate status is low.We conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into  and Nutrition (EPIC), to investigate plasma concentrations of the methyl donors methionine, choline, betaine (trimethylglycine), and dimethylglycine (DMG) in relation to colorectal  (CRC) risk. Our study included 1367 incident CRC cases (965  and 402 rectum) and 2323 controls matched by gender, age group, and study center. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CRC risk were estimated by conditional logistic regression, comparing the fifth to the first quintile of plasma concentrations.Overall, methionine (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.63-0.99, P-trend = 0.05), choline (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99, P-trend = 0.07), and betaine (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.09, P-trend = 0.06) concentrations were inversely associated with CRC risk of borderline significance. In participants with folate concentration below the median of 11.3 nmol/l, high betaine concentration was associated with reduced CRC risk (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-1.00, P-trend = 0.02), which was not observed for those having a higher folate status. Among women, but not men, high choline concentration was associated with decreased CRC risk (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.88, P-trend = 0.01).

Seven human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines in culture were investigated (HT-29, HRT-18, SW-480, Caco-2, CO-115, CO-125, and HCT-8R). These cell-lines had a cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate production system which was very sensitive to VIP but less so to prostaglandin E1 and/or isoproterenol. Nonintestinal human malignant epithelial cells, such as HeLa (cervix) and Caki-1 and Caki-2 (kidney), by contrast, did not respond to VIP. The dose-response relationships of malignant colorectal cells were compared to those obtained with epithelial cells of normal human  and showed that: (a) maximal responses were observed with 0.1 micro M VIP in both malignant and normal cells; (b) half-maximal responses were elicited by VIP concentrations in the 0.3 to 2 nM range in malignant cells (1.2 nM in normal cells), thus indicating the high apparent affinity of the cells to VIP; and (c) the magnitudes of the responses (stimulated:basal ratios) were highly variable in malignant cells, ranging from 225 in HT-29 cells to 3.5 in Caco-2 cells, but were more constant, in the order of 25, in normal cells. Secretin, a VIP agonist in intestinal tissue, stimulated cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate accumulation in all colorectal cells, but with a 1000- to 5000-fold lower potency than did VIP.

Moreover, the epidemiologic observations support the concept of a synergistic effect between these two factors. Such a relation is biologically plausible because ethanol impedes the bioavailability of dietary folate and is known to inhibit select folate-dependent biochemical reactions. For example, alcohol ingestion in animals is known to inhibit folate-mediated methionine synthesis and thereby may interrupt critical methylation processes that are mediated by the activated form of methionine that provides substrate for biologic methylation, S-adenosylmethionine. Consistent with this observed inhibition of methionine synthesis is the observation that chronic alcohol ingestion in laboratory animals is known to produce hypomethylation of DNA in the  mucosa, a constant feature of early colorectal neoplasia. Inhibition of methionine synthase also creates a "methylfolate trap," analogous to what occurs in vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, some evidence indicates that alcohol may redirect the utilization of folate toward serine synthesis and thereby may interfere with a critical function of methylenetetrahydrofolate, thymidine synthesis. Although a mechanistic link between alcohol and impaired folate metabolism in the genesis of  is still not definitively established, such a link should be pursued in future studies because of the intimate metabolic relation between alcohol and folate metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15585648>Natural killer cells activity and neuroimmunological treatment of .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7274946>[Flush, nausea, bronchospasm, cardiac arrest].</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1728601>Enhanced induction of  carcinogenesis by azoxymethane in Wistar rats fed a low-protein diet.</a></h1><p>The effects of ad libitum feeding of synthetic, low-protein diets on the incidence, number and histology of  tumors induced by azoxymethane (AOM), on the norepinephrine concentration in the  wall tissue and on the labelling index of  mucosa were investigated in Wistar rats.

The low- and very-low-protein diets also resulted in significant increases in norepinephrine concentration in the proximal and distal portions of the  wall and in the labelling indices of both parts of the  mucosa. Our findings indicate that low- and very-low-protein diets enhance  carcinogenesis and that this may be related to their effects in increasing the norepinephrine level in the  wall and in stimulating proliferation of  epithelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077427>Serum Trimethylamine N-oxide, Carnitine, Choline, and Betaine in Relation to Colorectal  Risk in the Alpha Tocopherol, Beta Carotene  Prevention Study.</a></h1><p> Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a choline-derived metabolite produced by gut microbiota, and its biomarker precursors have not been adequately evaluated in relation to colorectal  risk. We investigated the relationship between serum concentrations of TMAO and its biomarker precursors (choline, carnitine, and betaine) and incident colorectal  risk in a nested case-control study of male smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene  Prevention (ATBC) Study. We measured biomarker concentrations in baseline fasting serum samples from 644 incident colorectal  cases and 644 controls using LC/MS-MS. Logistic regression models estimated the ORs and 95% confidence interval (CI) for colorectal  by quartile (Q) of serum TMAO, choline, carnitine, and betaine concentrations. Men with higher serum choline at ATBC baseline had approximately 3-fold greater risk of developing colorectal  over the ensuing (median ± IQR) 14 ± 10 years (in fully adjusted models, Q4 vs. Q1, OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.24-4.61;  < 0.0001). The prognostic value of serum choline for prediction of incident colorectal  was similarly robust for proximal, distal, and rectal  cancers (all  < 0.0001). The association between serum TMAO, carnitine, or betaine and colorectal  risk was not statistically significant ( = 0.25, 0.71, and 0.61, respectively). Higher serum choline concentration (but not TMAO, carnitine, or betaine) was associated with increased risk of colorectal . Serum choline levels showed strong prognostic value for prediction of incident colorectal  risk across all anatomical subsites, suggesting a role of altered choline metabolism in colorectal  pathogenesis. .©2017 American Association for  Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8380931>Mechanism of lipid mobilization associated with  cachexia: interaction between the polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and inhibitory guanine nucleotide-regulatory protein.</a></h1><p>During a study of the mechanism of  cachexia, a debilitating condition in which catabolism of host muscle and adipose tissue occurs, it has been observed that the process can be effectively reversed in vivo by the polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but not by other PUFA of either the n-3 or n-6 series. In vitro studies showed that EPA blocked the action of a tumour-produced catabolic factor at the level of the adipocyte, and that the effect of EPA also extended to beta-adrenergic stimuli and polypeptide hormones. Again the effect was specific to EPA and appeared to arise from an inhibition of the elevation of cyclic AMP levels in adipocytes in response to varied stimuli. Using isoprenaline stimulated lipolysis as a model system we have shown that EPA has a direct inhibitory effect on isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase in isolated plasma membrane fractions with half maximal inhibition at a concentration of 165 microM. The inhibitory effect was specific for EPA and was not shown by docosahexaenoic or arachidonic acids. The inhibitory effect of EPA on adenylate cyclase showed properties similar to hormonal inhibition of the enzyme in that it was (i) GTP-dependent, (ii) non-competitive with isoprenaline, (iii) eliminated following treatment of either adipocytes or plasma membrane fractions with pertussis toxin, which is known to ADP-ribosylate the alpha-subunit of an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-regulatory protein (Gi), thus leading to its inactivation. This suggests that inhibition of cyclic AMP formation by EPA was due, at least in part, to a Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2566497>Alpha 2-adrenoceptor in HT29 human  adenocarcinoma cell-line: study of [3H](-)-adrenaline binding.</a></h1><p>The HT29 human adenocarcinoma cell-line was used to investigate the binding of [3H](-)-adrenaline at alpha 2-adrenoceptors. All aspects of the study indicated that alpha 2-adrenoceptors were specifically labeled. [3H](-)-adrenaline bound with high affinity (KD = 2.28 +/- 0.41 nM) to a single population of non-interacting sites. The rank order of adrenoceptor antagonists (yohimbine greater than phentolamine much greater than prazosin) and agonists (UK-14,304 greater than clonidine greater than (-)-adrenaline greater than (-)-noradrenaline greater than (+)-adrenaline greater than (+)-noradrenaline greater than amidephrine) to compete with [3H](-)-adrenaline binding showed that the labeled sites were alpha 2-selective and stereospecific. Comparison of the binding parameters of [3H](-)-adrenaline with those of [3H]clonidine (partial-agonist) and [3H]yohimbine (antagonist) indicated that [3H](-)-adrenaline and [3H]clonidine labeled a similar number of sites (156 +/- 13 versus 175 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein) and that [3H]yohimbine (Bmax = 246 +/- 22 fmol/mg protein) labeled more sites than the 3H-agonists. Data on the inhibition of [3H]yohimbine binding by (-)-adrenaline was better fitted to a two-site model and revealed (1) that the KiL/KiH ratio was higher for (-)-adrenaline than for clonidine (2) that both agonists recognized the same percentage of high-affinity receptors. The results from a kinetic study of [3H](-)-adrenaline binding were apparently inconsistent with the equilibrium data. Both the association and dissociation were bi-exponential, suggesting a relative heterogeneity of the labeled sites. The tritiated physiological full-agonist was moreover able to induce tight-binding. The practical consequences of this property are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7529238>Effects of mutations in cAMP-dependent protein kinase on chloride efflux in Caco-2 human  carcinoma cells.</a></h1><p>In order to evaluate the importance of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMPdPK) in the regulation of chloride efflux via the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, Caco-2, human  carcinoma cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding a mutant form of regulatory subunit of cAMPdPK under control of the mouse metallothionein 1 promoter. Four stable transformants were isolated that expressed the mutant subunit in a Zn(2+)-inducible manner and exhibited Zn(2+)-inducible inhibition of cAMPdPK activity. The parental and transformed Caco-2 cells were examined for their abilities to regulate chloride efflux in response to various secretagogues using a radioactive iodide-efflux assay. In the transformants, induction of the protein kinase mutation with ZnSO4 markedly decreased chloride efflux in response to forskolin, the 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) analog of cAMP, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, prostaglandin E2 and isoproterenol, whereas Zn(2+)-treated parental cells remained responsive to these secretagogues. Treatment with carbachol, calcium ionophores or phorbol ester did not acutely affect chloride efflux. Together, these studies indicate that cAMP and cAMPdPK are essential components of secretagogue-regulated chloride channel activity in the Caco-2 cell line. In whole cell patch clamp recordings, induction of the cAMPdPK mutation inhibited anionic conductances indicative of the CFTR chloride channel, whereas purified catalytic subunit of cAMPdPK, added intracellularly, reversed the inhibition. These latter results demonstrate that the CFTR chloride channels in the protein kinase-defective transformants are normal and that the protein kinase mutation specifically affects their regulation, presumably by direct phosphorylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2299618>Antitumor properties of tetrahydrobenz[a]anthraquinone derivatives.</a></h1><p>The compound 8,11-bis[[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]- 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7,12-benz[a]-anthraquinone (7) was synthesized from 3,6-dimethoxyphthalic anhydride and 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene by a Friedel-Crafts reaction, cyclization to form a dihydroxyanthraquinone, and conversion into the amino-substituted derivative by reaction with 2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethylamine.

Elevated levels of choline and up-regulated choline kinase activity have been detected in various cancers. Thus, the intracellular accumulation of choline through choline transporters is the rate-limiting step in phospholipid metabolism and a prerequisite for  cell proliferation. Previous studies have demonstrated abnormalities in choline uptake and choline phospholipid metabolism in  cells using the imaging of  with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The aberrant choline metabolism in  cells is strongly correlated with their malignant progression. Using quantitative real-time PCR, the mRNA expression of choline transporters was measured, and it was found that choline transporter-like proteins CTLs/SLC44 family are highly expressed in various  cell lines. Choline uptake through CTLs is associated with cell viability, and the functional inhibition of CTLs could promote apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, non-neuronal cholinergic systems that include CTLs-mediated choline transport are associated with cell proliferation and their inhibition promotes apoptotic cell death in , small cell lung  and human leukemic T-cells. The identification of this new CTLs-mediated choline transport system provides a potential new target for  therapy.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2113770>Regulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity in LoVo cells.</a></h1><p>The role of Na+ and Na(+)-H+ exchange in the stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity has been investigated in a human  adenocarcinoma cell line, LoVo. Asparagine (Asn; 10 mM) or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) increased ODC activity from undetectable levels to greater than 500 pmol CO2.mg protein-1.h-1 in 4 h. This increase could be reduced 50% by concentrations of Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitors that did not reduce protein synthesis. (approximately 0.2 mM for amiloride and 0.05 mM for hexamethyleneamiloride). Asn was able to double the uptake of 22Na+, whether an ionic (choline chloride) or nonionic (D-mannitol) substance was substituted for Na+, and the substitution of these compounds as well as N-methyl-glucamine for Na+ largely prevented the stimulation of ODC by Asn. Another factor influencing ODC activity was extracellular pH (pHo). When pHo was lowered, intracellular pH (pHi) also fell, and ODC activity was reduced. When pHo was raised, pHi also rose, and ODC activity increased. The well-known correlation between increased pHi and Na+ uptake with the stimulation of growth may be due to their influence on ODC activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15034673>Anandamide is an endogenous inhibitor for the migration of tumor cells and T lymphocytes.</a></h1><p>Cell migration is of paramount importance in physiological processes such as immune surveillance, but also in the pathological processes of tumor cell migration and metastasis development. The factors that regulate this tumor cell migration, most prominently neurotransmitters, have thus been the focus of intense investigation. While the majority of neurotransmitters have a stimulatory effect on cell migration, we herein report the inhibitory effect of the endogenous substance anandamide on both tumor cell and lymphocyte migration. Using a collagen-based three-dimensional migration assay and time-lapse videomicroscopy, we have observed that the anandamide-mediated signals for CD8+ T lymphocytes and SW 480  carcinoma cells are each mediated by distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB-Rs). Using the specific agonist docosatetraenoylethanolamide (DEA), we have observed that the norepinephrine-induced migration of  carcinoma cells is inhibited by the CB1-R. The SDF-1-induced migration of CD8+ T lymphocytes was, however, inhibited via the CB2-R, as shown by using the specific agonist JWH 133. Therefore, specific inhibition of tumor cell migration via CB1-R engagement might be a selective tool to prevent metastasis formation without depreciatory effects on the immune system of  patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24097002>A case of  incidentally detected by 18F-choline PET/CT.</a></h1><p>A 65-year-old man had restaging of prostate  with an 18F-choline PET/CT, which revealed focal uptake in a thickened posterior wall of sigmoid .

In neurons, the Na(+) -dependent, high affinity choline transporter (CHT1) is absolutely required for ACh synthesis. In contrast, some non-neuronal cells synthesize ACh in the absence of CHT1 indicating a fundamental difference in ACh synthesis compared to neurons. The aim of this study was to identify choline transporters, other than CHT1, that play a role in non-neuronal ACh synthesis. ACh synthesis was studied in lung and  cell lines focusing on the choline transporter-like proteins, a five gene family choline-transporter like protein (CTL)1-5. Supporting a role for CTLs in choline transport in lung  cells, choline transport was Na(+) -independent and CTL1-5 were expressed in all cells examined. CTL1, 2, and 5 were expressed at highest levels and knockdown of CTL1, 2, and 5 decreased choline transport in H82 lung  cells. Knockdowns of CTL1, 2, 3, and 5 had no effect on ACh synthesis in H82 cells. In contrast, knockdown of CTL4 significantly decreased ACh secretion by both lung and  cells. Conversely, increasing expression of CTL4 increased ACh secretion. These results indicate that CTL4 mediates ACh synthesis in non-neuronal cell lines and presents a mechanism to target non-neuronal ACh synthesis without affecting neuronal ACh synthesis.© 2013 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1114940>Outpatient anorectal surgery.</a></h1><p>Fulguration of polyps, rectal biopsy and the Barron method of removing hemorrhoids require no anesthesia.

Norepinephrine, secreted in chronic stress conditions, stimulates the motility of breast and  cells through β-adrenergic receptor. On these bases, we examined its possible role in metastasis formation and development in vitro and in vivo. Treatments with norepinephrine (β2-adrenoreceptor agonist) in mice xenografted with human DU145 prostate  cells increased the metastatic potential of these cells. Specifically, we showed that treatment of mice with norepinephrine induced a significant increase of the migratory activity of  cells in a concentration-dependent manner and that this process was blocked by propanolol (β-adrenergic antagonist). Mice treated with norepinephrine, displayed an increased number of metastatic foci of DU145 cells in inguinal lymph nodes and also showed an increased expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in tumor samples compared to controls. Moreover, we demonstrated that propanolol induced in norepinephrine treated DU145 cells a E-cadherin finger-like membrane protrusions driven by vimentin remodeling. Altogether these data suggest that β2-AR plays an important role in prostate  metastasis formation and that the treatment with antagonist propanolol, could represents an interesting tool to control this process in cells overexpressing β2AR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3244140>Bleeding stomal varices treated by sclerotherapy.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12636105>Effects of bile acids on 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-induced aberrant crypt foci and DNA adduct formation in the rat .</a></h1><p>The effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the rat  were examined.

Larger or sessile lesions should be removed by an experienced endoscopist, but complications such as hemorrhage and perforation still may occur.To render the removal of sessile lesions feasible by endoscopic polypectomy and to reduce the risk of complications, we attempted local submucosal injection of hypertonic saline-epinephrine solution [(HSE) a mixture of 4.7% sodium chloride and 0.005% epinephrine] before electrosurgical snare excision; 0.5-2 ml HSE were injected into the base and immediate vicinity of polyps to produce mucosal bulging.Between August 1990 and April 1992, 645 polyps in 403 patients were removed by this method; sessile lesions could be more readily removed. Of these, 17 (2.6%) revealed invasive carcinoma and 19 (3.0%) carcinoma in situ. The largest sessile polyp removed was 40 mm in diameter and 7 mm in height and contained a carcinoma in situ. Even a 6-mm depressed adenoma and two rectal carcinoid tumors could be excised completely.

Sponge implants in mice were used to host tumour cells while washout of 133Xe was employed to assess local blood flow in the implanted sponges. By 14 days after implantation the response of vessels in tumour-bearing implants to the various vasoconstrictors generally was decreased compared to that obtained in control sponge implants or adjacent normal skin. Thus at this time point the t1/2 for 133Xe washout from control sponges treated with adrenalin (0.5 micrograms) was 30 +/- 4 min whereas in tumour-bearing sponges it was 5 +/- 1 min. This decreased sensitivity in tumour vessels was probably not due to a complete lack of contractile elements since actin was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry around blood vessels in both types of implant. The results of the present study have shown that the pharmacological responses of blood vessels in a growing tumour,  26, differed from the responses of vessels of a similar age in non-neoplastic tissue. These results appear to suggest that the different angiogenic stimuli released from tumour tissue may markedly influence pharmacological reactivity of newly formed blood vessels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9935243>Therapy of a xenografted human  carcinoma using cisplatin or doxorubicin encapsulated in long-circulating pegylated stealth liposomes.</a></h1><p>We compared the therapeutic effects of low doses of cisplatin and doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated in long-circulating liposomes composed of cholesterol/hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine-polyethylene glycol-distearoyl-phosphatidyl-.

Nicotine, an active alkaloid in tobacco, has been implicated in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that oral nicotine administration (50 or 200 microg/ml) for 25 days stimulated growth of human  xenograft in nude mice. It also increased vascularization in the tumors and elevated cotinine and adrenaline plasma levels. beta-Adrenoceptors, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor tissues were also increased by nicotine. I.p. injection of beta(1)-selective antagonist (atenolol, 5 or 10 mg/kg) or beta(2)-selective antagonist (ICI 118,551, 5, or 10 mg/kg) blocked the nicotine-stimulated tumor growth dose dependently, in which beta(2)-selective antagonist produced a more prominent effect. beta-Adrenoceptors blockade also abrogated the stimulatory action of nicotine on microvessel densities as well as cell expression of COX-2, PGE(2), and VEGF, in which beta(2)-selective antagonist produced a significant effect. These findings provide a direct evidence that nicotine can enhance  tumor growth mediated partly by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors, preferentially the beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Activation of beta-adrenoceptors and the subsequent stimulation of COX-2, PGE(2), and VEGF expression is perhaps an important mechanism in the tumorigenic action of nicotine on  tumor growth.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which converts fully saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), has been suggested as a vulnerable target for selective elimination of  stem cells (CSCs). However, the clinical significance and physiological role of SCD1 in CSCs has not been well demonstrated. Here, we showed the clinical and biochemical relevance of blocking SCD1 to target CSCs by analyzing human  data from TCGA and through lipidomic profiling of CSCs with or without SCD1 inhibition using mass spectrometry. Positive associations between SCD1 expression and colorectal  patient clinical status and the expression of CSC-related genes (WNT and NOTCH signaling) were found based on TCGA data analysis. Lipidomic profiling of CSCs and bulk  cells (BCCs) using mass spectrometry revealed that  CSCs contained a distinctive lipid profile, with higher free MUFA and lower free SFA levels than in BCCs, suggesting that enhanced SCD1 activity generates MUFAs that may support WNT signaling in CSCs. In addition, all identified phosphatidyl--containing MUFAs were found at higher levels in CSCs. Interestingly, we observed lower phosphatidyl-serine (18:1/18:0), phosphatidyl-choline (PC; p-18:0/18:1)), and sphingomyelin (SM; d18:1/20:0 or d16:1/22:0) levels in CSCs than in BCCs. Of those, SCD1 inhibition, which efficiently diminished free MUFA levels, increased those specific PC and SM and MUFAs in CSCs promptly. These results suggest that these specific lipid composition is critical for CSC stem cell maintenance. In addition, not only free MUFAs, which are known to be required for WNT signaling, but also other phospholipids, such as SM, which are important for lipid raft formation, may mediate other cell signaling pathways that support CSC maintenance. Comparison of the lipidomic profiles of  cells with those of previously reported for glioma cells further demonstrated the tissue specific characteristics of lipid metabolism in CSCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cationic HL having a hydrodynamic diameter less than 150 nm were preserved for one month. Therapeutic effects were obtained in the hepatic metastasis mouse models of HCT116 cells after the intravenous injection of cationic HL. The histological analysis indicated the induction of apoptosis in the liver section of the hepatic metastasis mouse models treated with cationic HL in vivo. Therapeutic effects of cationic HL without any drugs on the hepatic metastasis were revealed for the first time on the basis of histological analyses in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2788491>Interleukin-2 enhances biopterins and catecholamines production during adoptive immunotherapy for various cancers.</a></h1><p>Biopterins production during three different protocols for adoptive immunotherapy for human  was investigated. Adoptive immunotherapy treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) was carried out for 13 patients with malignant melanoma; eight with metastatic renal cell carcinoma; and three with metastatic . The authors estimated total biopterins in plasma and lymphokine (IL-2)-activated killer cells (LAK) from these patients before and during various treatment phases to determine if increased biopterins production reflects leukocyte activation by IL-2 or antitumor activity. They noted an increased synthesis of total "biopterins," i.e., biopterin; 7,8-dehydrobiopterin; and L-neopterin in LAK cells and plasma which correlated with IL-2 exposure. Mean plasma biopterins were normal (1.2 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) before therapy; in contrast, biopterins increased significantly to 3.4 +/- 1.9 ng/ml and 3.9 +/- 1.9 ng/ml during IL-2 and IL-2 + LAK treatment each, respectively. Similar biopterin elevations were noted irrespective of the different adoptive immunotherapy protocols used. Elevated biopterins decreased to normal levels (1.2 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) when IL-2 treatment was omitted. Tumor regression with adoptive immunotherapy did not correlate with increased plasma biopterins. Increased biopterins production was also associated with increase in plasma catecholamine after IL-2 treatment during adoptive immunotherapy. Conceivably increased biopterins, induced by IL-2 activation of a leukocyte population, is a cell-mediated consequence not necessarily serving as a signal for the antitumor effect associated with adoptive immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11698351>A Western-style diet induces benign and malignant  in the  of normal C57Bl/6 mice.</a></h1><p>Decreased dietary intakes of calcium, vitamin D and folic acid have been suggested as risk factors for human . We previously fed a Western-style diet (WD) containing reduced calcium, vitamin D and increased fat content to normal C57/Bl6 mice: hyperproliferation, hyperplasia and whole crypt dysplasias developed in the  following WD administration. Utilizing the same diet, we now also decreased the levels of several nutrients that are required for biochemical reactions involving methyl group inadequacy, i.e. folic acid, methionine, choline and vitamin B(12). Dietary levels of these nutrients were reduced to nutrient-density levels approximating those consumed by large segments of human Western populations. This further modification of the WD resulted in adenoma and carcinoma development in normal mouse  (P < 0.04 compared with AIN-76A diet). The results indicate, for the first time, that a semi-purified rodent diet designed to mimic the human Western diet can induce  tumors in normal mice without carcinogen exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18972329>Effect of Gd-DTPA-BMA on choline signals of HT29 tumors detected by in vivo 1H MRS.</a></h1><p>To study the impact of Gd-DTPA-BMA on choline signals of HT29  carcinomas determined by localized 1H MRS in vivo at 4.7T.PRESS 1H MR spectra (2-second repetition time and echo times of 20-272 msec) were acquired from HT29 xenografts prior to and following intravenous administration of 0.1 or 0.2 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA-BMA. The magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data were analyzed by 1) normalizing choline and water peak areas to their precontrast values; and 2) estimating absolute choline concentration relative to tissue water.Changes in the T1 and T2 of choline and water were apparent following administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA. Administration of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA-BMA induced significant increases in the choline peak area, concomitant with enhancements of the water peak area, whereas 0.2 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA-BMA induced no enhancement of choline peak area but significant increases in water peak area at short echo times.The effect of Gd-DTPA-BMA on estimation of tumor choline concentration varied with the dose of contrast agent, the echo time, and the time after contrast agent administration. These data highlight the potential pitfalls associated with the modulation of choline and water signals post-Gd-DTPA-BMA and may account for the apparently contradictory results previously reported.Copyright (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7471069>Decreased norepinephrine concentration in normal tissue neighboring a malignant tumor.</a></h1><p>We observed in five adenocarcinomas that norepinephrine as well as nerve fibers were absent from tumor tissue. The number of nerve fibers in normal tissue neighboring the tumor was normal. In contrast, norepinephrine concentration was decreased in normal tissue immediately surrounding tumor and increased in a stepwise fashion with the distance from tumor. Since there is evidence that some catecholamines possess antitumor activity, we suggest that depletion of catecholamines and perhaps other neurotransmitters in normal tissue neighboring a tumor may be of importance for invasion and accelerated malignant growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7833176>Deuterium MR spectroscopy at 4.7 T. Quantification of tumour and subcutaneous tissue blood flow in animal models.</a></h1><p>Deuterium MR spectroscopy was used for the determination of tissue blood flow (TBF). The tracer D2O was injected into the tissue of interest, and tracer washout was followed using a 4.7 T spectroscopy/imaging unit. Normal subcutaneous tissue in rats was studied, as well as tissue influenced by vasoactive agents (papaverine and adrenaline). The vasoactive agents introduced changes of 40% in TBF, compared with normal tissue. Normal tissue measurements were repeated using various D2O injection volumes (5-400 microliters). The injection volume 5 microliters gave TBF 11.7 +/- 2.0 ml/100 g.min (mean +/- 1 SD). This value was 40% higher than corresponding values observed at larger injection volumes (200-400 microliters). This injection volume effect is probably partly due to a capillary dilution caused by tracer administration, and partly related to the non-physiological deuterium signal decrease observed in dead rats. Blood flow measurements in human  tumours implanted in nude mice showed a rather poor reproducibility, not improved by the use of a multiple site injection technique.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23767874>Biochemical and biological characterization of exosomes containing prominin-1/CD133.</a></h1><p>Exosomes can be viewed as complex "messages" packaged to survive trips to other cells in the local microenvironment and, through body fluids, to distant sites. A large body of evidence indicates a pro-metastatic role for certain types of  exosomes. We previously reported that prominin-1 had a pro-metastatic role in melanoma cells and that microvesicles released from metastatic melanoma cells expressed high levels of prominin-1. With the goal to explore the mechanisms that govern proteo-lipidic-microRNA sorting in  exosomes and their potential contribution(s) to the metastatic phenotype, we here employed prominin-1-based immunomagnetic separation in combination with filtration and ultracentrifugation to purify prominin-1-expressing exosomes (prom1-exo) from melanoma and  carcinoma cells. Prom1-exo contained 154 proteins, including all of the 14 proteins most frequently expressed in exosomes, and multiple pro-metastatic proteins, including CD44, MAPK4K, GTP-binding proteins, ADAM10 and Annexin A2. Their lipid composition resembled that of raft microdomains, with a great enrichment in lyso-phosphatidylcholine, lyso-phosphatidyl- and sphingomyelin. The abundance of tetraspanins and of tetraspanin-associated proteins, together with the high levels of sphingomyelin, suggests that proteolipidic assemblies, probably tetraspanin webs, might be the essential structural determinant in the release process of prominin-1 of stem and  stem cells. Micro-RNA profiling revealed 49 species of micro-RNA present at higher concentrations in prom1-exo than in parental cells, including 20 with -related function. Extensive accumulation of prom1-exo was observed 3 h after their addition to cultures of melanoma and bone marrow-derived stromal cells (MSC). Short-term co-culture of melanoma cells and MSC resulted in heterologous prominin-1 transfer. Exposure of MSC to prom1-exo increased their invasiveness. Our study supports the concept that specific populations of  exosomes contain multiple determinants of the metastatic potential of the cells from which they are derived.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8149347>Monoamine oxidase B inhibitor enhances experimental carcinogenesis in rat  induced by azoxymethane.</a></h1><p>The effects of prolonged administration of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibitor N-methyl-N-propargyl-3-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propylamine (clorgyline) and the MAO-B inhibitor N-methyl-N-2-propynyl-benzylamine (pargyline) on the incidence, number and histology of  tumors induced by azoxymethane (AOM), and on the norepinephrine (NE) concentration in the  wall and the labeling index of  mucosa were investigated in Wistar rats. Rats were treated s.c. with 7.4 mg/kg body weight of AOM once a week for 10 weeks, and also s.c. with 5 mg/kg body weight of clorgyline or 50 mg/kg body weight of pargyline in 0.9% NaCl until the end of the experiment. Treatment with pargyline significantly increased the incidence of  tumors in week 35. However, it did not influence the histological appearance of the  tumors or the histological types and depth of involvement of  adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, it significantly increased the NE concentration in the  wall and the labeling index of the  mucosa during and after AOM-treatment. In contrast, clorgyline had no influence on the development or histological appearance of  tumors. These findings indicate that the MAO-B inhibitor, but not the MAO-A inhibitor, enhanced  carcinogenesis, and that its effect may be related to its effect in increasing the NE concentration in the  wall and subsequently increasing the proliferation of  epithelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12438237>The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid is an inhibitory regulator for the migration of SW 480  carcinoma cells.</a></h1><p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, also playing a role in diseases like epilepsy.

GABA reduced the norepinephrine-induced migratory activity of these cells within a three-dimensional collagen matrix to spontaneous migration levels, as was analyzed by time-lapse videomicroscopy. This inhibitory effect of GABA was mediated by the serpentine receptor GABA(B) and was intracellularly transduced by a decrease of the cyclic AMP concentration.  cell migration is thus regulated by neurobiological signals, opening new possibilities for pharmacological agonists in  therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530130>Dietary Methyl Donor Depletion Suppresses Intestinal Adenoma Development.</a></h1><p>The role of folate one-carbon metabolism in colorectal  development is controversial, with nutritional intervention studies producing conflicting results. It has been reported that Apc mice maintained on a diet deficient in the methyl donors folic acid, methionine, choline, and vitamin B12, and supplemented with homocysteine, show a greater than 95% reduction in intestinal tumor development. The present study extends these findings and shows that tumor protection afforded by dietary methyl donor deficiency (MDD) is long-lasting. After 11 weeks of MDD, tumor protection persisted for at least an additional 7 weeks of methyl donor repletion (22.2 ± 3.5 vs. 70.2 ± 4.6 tumors per mouse; P < 0.01). Sustained tumor protection was associated with a reduction in intestinal crypt length (26%, P < 0.01), crypt cell division and crypt fission, and an increase in apoptosis of both normal crypts and tumors (4.9- and 3.2-fold, respectively, P < 0.01). MDD also caused a significant reduction in the number of Dclk1-positive cells in the intestine (62%, P < 0.01), a long-lived crypt cell with  stem cell potential. Several undesirable effects associated with methyl donor restriction (e.g., reduced body weight gain) were shown to be transient and readily reversible following methyl donor repletion. Taken together, these results indicate that even temporary dietary methyl donor restriction in adenoma-prone mice can induce persistent changes to the intestinal epithelium and provide long-lasting tumor protection. These data also suggest that transient reductions in dietary methyl donor consumption should be considered when studying the impact of folate on  risk in humans.

The best-studied AEs are the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), the anti-inflammatory compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the potent anorexigenic molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). AEs are biosynthesized in the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels may change in response to noxious stimuli, food deprivation or diet-induced obesity. The biological actions of AEs within the gut are not limited to the modulation of food intake and energy balance. For example, AEs exert potential beneficial effects in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, inflammation and cellular proliferation. Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA).

Among these breast cancers those that are estrogen-responsive respond well to existing therapeutic regimens while estrogen non-responsive cancers metastasize widely, demonstrate a high relapse rate, and respond poorly to therapy. Over-expression of the arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 and lypoxygenases is frequently observed in breast , particularly the non-estrogen-responsive type, suggesting a role of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade in the growth regulation of these malignancies. Adenocarcinomas of the lungs, pancreas and  also frequently over-express AA-metabolizing enzymes, and recent evidence suggests that the growth-regulating AA-cascade in these malignancies is under beta-adrenergic control. Our current experiments have therefore tested the hypothesis that in analogy to these findings adenocarcinomas of the breast are also regulated by beta-adrenergic receptors via stimulation of the AA-cascade. Analysis of DNA synthesis by [3H]-thymidine incorporation assays in three estrogen-responsive and three estrogen non-responsive cell lines derived from human breast cancers demonstrated a significant reduction in DNA synthesis by beta-blockers and inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenases in all cell lines. Analysis of AA-release in one of the most responsive cell lines demonstrated a time-dependent increase in AA-release in response to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Analysis by RT-PCR revealed expression of beta2-adrenergic receptors in all cell lines whereas beta1-adrenergic receptors were not found in two of the estrogen non-responsive cell lines. Our data suggest that a significant subset of human breast cancers is under control of beta-adrenergic receptors via stimulation of the AA-cascade. These findings open up novel avenues for the prevention and clinical management of breast , particularly the non-estrogen-responsive types. Moreover, our findings suggest that cardiovascular disease and adenocarcinomas in a variety of organ systems, including the breast may share common risk factors and benefit from similar preventive and treatment strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24368525>(18)F-choline PET/CT pitfalls in image interpretation: an update on 300 examined patients with prostate .</a></h1><p>F-choline PET/CT is an important diagnostic tool in the management of patients with prostate  (PC).

Whole-body PET/CT was acquired 40 minutes after the F-choline administration.We found abnormal uptake of the tracer, not related to PC, in 48/300 patients (16%).

Few studies describe the technique or outcomes of serrated polypectomy. We sought to present outcomes of a series of polypectomies of large serrated polyps in comparison to a series of endoscopic resections of large adenomas.This retrospective, comparative, single endoscopist study was performed in an outpatient colonoscopy department of a tertiary referral medical center. Patients had outpatient colonoscopy where a large (≥2 cm) serrated polyp or adenoma was removed. Outcomes were completeness of excision and complications of polypectomy. A database of endoscopic polypectomies was reviewed. Polypectomy of large serrated polyps was compared with polypectomy of large adenomas.There were 132 large serrated polyps in 112 patients and 563 adenomas in 428 patients. More serrated polyps were right sided (120 of 130, 92.3 %, vs. 379 of 563, 67 %) (p < 0.0001). The serrated polyps were smaller than the adenomas (mean 25.5 ± 7.9 mm standard deviation) versus 36.8 ± 16.9 mm standard deviation (p < 0.001). There were four complications of serrated polypectomy in four patients (4 % of polyps, 5 % of patients): three postpolypectomy bleeds and one postpolypectomy syndrome. There were 33 complications of adenoma removal (31 postpolypectomy bleeding and two postpolypectomy syndrome) (6.9 % of polyps, p = 0.376, 8.4 % of patients, p = 0.371). On follow-up, 36 of 51 patients (71 %) with serrated polyps had metachronous lesions compared to 133 of 298 patients (45 %) with adenomas (p < 0.0001). There were fewer residual polyps in the serrated group (4 of 47 vs. 64 of 298, p = 0.001).Removal of large serrated colorectal polyps is no more complicated than polypectomy of similarly sized adenomas. However, large serrated polyps have a higher rate of metachronous polyps than similarly sized adenomas and surveillance should be adapted to reflect these findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3030263>Hormonal control of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration in the HT29 human  adenocarcinoma cell line.

The maximum effect was a 41% decrease obtained with 10 nM-VIP, and half-maximum effect was obtained with 0.75 nM-VIP. The effect of 2.5 nM-VIP was almost totally counteracted (i.e. fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration was restored) by either adrenaline (1 microM) or the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist UK-14304 (1 microM); the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (1 microM) was less efficient, since the VIP effect was decreased by 72% only. The adrenaline effect was totally antagonized by 1 microM-yohimbine.

Liposomes were first optimized concerning the kind and amount of APL and the additional liposome components. Thus, an up to 270% increase in the transfer efficiency of the LacZ gene into HCT15 and HCT116 human  carcinoma cells could be obtained in vitro compared to lipofectin-mediated transfection by using a lipoplex consisting of tetradecylphosphocholine/dimethyldioctadecylamine/cholesterol/dioleylphosphoethanolamine-liposomes and the pSV40-betaGal-plasmid. The in vivo experiments revealed that alkylphospholipid-lipoplexes (APL-LPs) were similarly effective in the transfer of the LacZ gene into  carcinoma as formulations consisting of lipofectin. Using the CD-gene in combination with APL-LPs resulted in a significantly stronger inhibition of C26  carcinoma growth compared to lipofectin-mediated gene transfer following treatment of mice with the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine.

In colorectal  (CRC), phosphatidylcholine is the most prominent phospholipid. In the present study, we report that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1; NM_024830.3), the enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine into phosphatidylcholine, was highly overexpressed in colorectal adenocarcinomas when compared to normal mucosas. Our microarray transcription profiling study showed a significant (p < 10(-8)) transcript overexpression in 168 colorectal adenocarcinomas when compared to ten normal mucosas. Immunohistochemical analysis of  tumors with a polyclonal antibody to LPCAT1 confirmed the upregulation of the LPCAT1 protein. Overexpression of LPCAT1 in COS7 cells localized the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria and increased LPCAT1 specific activity 38-fold. In cultured cells, overexpressed LPCAT1 enhanced the incorporation of [(14)C]palmitate into phosphatidylcholine. COS7 cells transfected with LPCAT1 showed no growth rate alteration, in contrast to the  cell line SW480, which significantly (p < 10(-5)) increased its growth rate by 17%. We conclude that LPCAT1 may contribute to total choline metabolite accumulation via phosphatidylcholine remodeling, thereby altering the CRC lipid profile, a characteristic of malignancy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16638358>[Value of carbon-11 choline positron emission tomography in patients with pulmonary abnormalities].</a></h1><p>To assess the value of carbon-11 choline (CH) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with pulmonary nodules.From September 2002 to December 2004, 39 patients with pulmonary nodules were imaged with CH-PET.

When pulmonary nodules with abnormal CH uptake appeared in PET scans confirmed by visual method, their maximum and mean standard uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean) were measured using semiquantitative method. Diagnoses were confirmed by surgery or biopsy and follow-up survey.Twenty-four cancerous and 3 inflammatory nodules and 1 bronchogenic cyst were detected by CH-PET and were diagnosed malignant with visual method. Three bronchial alveolar carcinoma, 2 metastatic tumor from kidney and , 3 fibrous nodules, 1 cryptococcosis, 1 hamartoma and 1 sclerosing hemangioma showed nothing abnormal in PET scans. For identification of pulmonary nodules with CH-PET, the sensitivity was 89% (24/29), the specificity was 60% (6/10), and the accuracy was 77% (30/39).

Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase is a critical mediator of tumor invasion.</a></h1><p>This study was designed to characterize platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-R) expression and function in normal and cancerous human  epithelial cells. PAF-R gene transcripts were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot, using three sets of primers corresponding either to the coding region of the human PAF-R sequence (polymerase chain reaction product: 682 base pairs (bp)) or to the leukocyte- and tissue-type transcripts of 166 and 252 bp, respectively. An elongated splice variant was identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the tissue-type PAF-R transcript (334 bp) in  epithelial crypts and tumors. In human  PCmsrc cells transformed by c-src oncogene, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent invasiveness of collagen gels was abolished by 0.1 microM PAF and restored by the PAF-R antagonists WEB2086 and SR27417. PAF blocked HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase. The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3'-K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 totally blocked the HGF-induced invasion. Similar effects were observed in ts-srcMDCK kidney epithelial cells transformed by a v-Src temperature-sensitive mutant: (i) PAF and wortmannin exerted additive inhibitory effects on Src-induced invasion and (ii) activated and dominant negative forms of p110alpha PI3'-K, respectively, amplified and abrogated the Src- and HGF-dependent invasiveness of parental and ts-srcMDCK cells. We also provided the first evidence for the contribution of rapamycin-insensitive, pertussis toxin-dependent G-protein pathways to the integration of the signals emerging from activated Met and PAF receptors. These results indicate that PI3'-K is a critical transducer of invasiveness and strongly suggest that PAF exerts a negative control on invasion by inhibiting this signaling pathway. A possible beneficial role of PAF analogs on tumor invasion is therefore proposed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29137875>Contribution of C-Choline PET/CT in prostate carcinoma biochemical relapse with serum PSA level below 1 ng/ml.</a></h1><p>C-choline PET/CT has demonstrated good results in the restaging of prostate  (PCa) with high serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), but its use in patients with low serum PSA is controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the contribution of C-choline PET/CT in patients with PCa, biochemical relapse and PSA <1 ng/ml.Fifty consecutive patients (mean age: 65.9±5.6 years) with biochemical relapse of PCa and serum PSA <1ng/ml were evaluated retrospectively. PET/CT was performed 20min after intravenous administration of 555-740 MBq of C-choline. Minimum follow up time was 30 months.Twenty-one out of 50 patients (42%) had an abnormal C-choline PET/CT. In 7 out of 21 patients (14%) tumor was confirmed (4 in prostatic bed, 4 in pelvic lymph nodes, 2 in mediastinal lymph nodes and one synchronous sigmoid carcinoma), and in all cases the initial therapeutic planning was modified. In 2 patients (4%) subsequent tests diagnosed a benign disease (one sarcoidosis, one tuberculosis sequelae) and in 3 patients (6%) they ruled out pathology. The other 9 patients (18%) had no further assessment (7 mediastinal and 4 pelvic lymph nodes). Twenty-nine out of 50 patients (58%) had a normal PET/CT. At 30 months, follow up recurrence was confirmed only in 2 of these patients.C-choline PET/CT proved its usefulness in demonstrating tumor in 14% of patients with BR of PCa and serum PSA <1ng/ml, with therapeutic implications. In 4% of patients a benign condition was detected. A normal C-choline PET/CT was associated with a very low rate of recurrence at 30 months.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier España, S.L.U. y SEMNIM.

Rats received sub-cutaneous (s.c.) injections of AOM once a week for 10 weeks, and throughout 35 weeks were also given intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 6-OHDA. Prolonged administration of 6-OHDA was found to cause a significant reduction in the incidence and number of  tumors. However, it had no influence on the histological features or depths of involvement of  tumors and/or adenocarcinomas. Its administration also caused significant decreases in the NE concentration in the  wall and in the labelling index of the  mucosa. Our findings indicate that 6-OHDA has a protective effect against  carcinogenesis, and that the activity of the sympathetic nervous system may have an important influence on  carcinogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23123481>Anti-tumor effects of cationic hybrid liposomes against  carcinoma along with apoptosis in vitro.</a></h1><p>New-type three-component cationic hybrid liposomes (HLs) composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), polyoxyethylene(21)dodecyl ether (C(12)(EO)(21)) and O,O'-ditetradecanoyl-N-(α-trimethylammonioacetyl) diethanolamine chloride (2C(14)ECl) were produced.

Acetylcholine (ACh), a muscarinic receptor ligand traditionally regarded as a neurotransmitter, may be produced by nonneuronal cells. We hypothesized that ACh release by human  cells results in autocrine stimulation of proliferation. H508 human  cells, which have robust M3R expression, were used to examine effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and choline transport inhibitors on cell proliferation. A nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist (atropine), a selective M3R antagonist (p-fluorohexahydro-sila-difenidol hydrochloride), and a choline transport inhibitor (hemicholinum-3) all inhibited unstimulated H508  cell proliferation by approximately 40% (P<0.005). In contrast, two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eserine-hemisulfate and bis-9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine) increased proliferation by 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively (P<0.005). By using quantitative real-time PCR, expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a critical enzyme for ACh synthesis, was identified in H508, WiDr, and Caco-2  cells. By using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection, released ACh was detected in H508 and Caco-2 cell culture media. Immunohistochemistry in surgical specimens revealed weak or no cytoplasmic staining for ChAT in normal  enterocytes (n=25) whereas half of  specimens (n=24) exhibited moderate to strong staining (P<0.005). We conclude that ACh is an autocrine growth factor in .

Constructs were created using 80% of the amino-terminal portion of one alkaline phosphatase and the carboxyl-terminal portions of each of the isoforms. Both of the carboxyl-terminal peptides supported glycan phosphatidylinositol linkage as demonstrated by the following criteria: 1) plasma membrane targeting in transfected COS-1 cells, 2) release of transfected alkaline phosphatase by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, 3) appearance of the trypanosome variable glycoprotein cross-reacting determinant after phospholipase C treatment, 4)  incorporation into newly synthesized enzyme, 5) loss of phospholipase C release after mutation of the omega and omega + 2 positions in the putative linkage site, -NSA-, and 6) evidence of surface membrane localization by immunofluorescence using antibody against rat intestinal alkaline phosphatase. These data demonstrate that a predicted hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal sequence is not essential for glycan phosphatidylinositol linkage. Moreover, because both isomers are membrane-bound, the origin of soluble enzyme in the serum is likely to arise from the action of serum phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15122344>Induction of S-phase arrest and p21 overexpression by a small molecule 2[[3-(2,3-dichlorophenoxy)propyl] amino]ethanol in correlation with activation of ERK.</a></h1><p>We recently found that a small molecule 2[[3-(2,3-dichlorophenoxy)propyl]amino]ethanol (2,3-DCPE) could induce apoptosis and downregulate Bcl-XL expression in various  cells. Here, we found that 2,3-DCPE suppressed the proliferation of Bcl-XL-overexpressing  cells without inducing apoptosis. Subsequently, we found that 2,3-DCPE could induce S-phase arrest and upregulate p21 but not p27 at a time- and dose-dependent but p53-dispensable manner in DLD-1 human  cells. Activation of ERK was also detected after treatment with 2,3-DCPE. Moreover, p21 induction was dramatically attenuated by ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. Induction of p21 and S-phase arrest and corresponding activation of ERK were also observed in ATM-defective cells, suggesting that 2,3-DCPE-induced these events were ATM-dispensable. Furthermore, ERK inhibitors dramatically attenuated 2,3-DCPE-induced S-phase arrest. Together, our data indicate that ERK activation correlated with the 2,3-DCPE-mediated induction of p21 expression and S-phase arrest.

It was hypothesized that hydroxyethyl starch (HES), an inexpensive and easily available solution might be an ideal solution for prolonged elevation of submucosal cushion for an easy and safe EMR of giant colorectal lateral spreading tumors (LSTs).During a 6-year period, patients suffering from colorectal LSTs with a diameter of ≥ 30 mm were randomized to undergo EMR by using either HES+E (group A) or NS+E (group B) for submucosal fluid cushion. All patients who had undergone a colonoscopy set the diagnosis of LSTs. The LSTs were examined with standard white light and narrow-band imaging to accurately delinate their margins before resection. The initial volume of injected solution, the additional amount to maintain the submucosal cushion, the duration of submucosal elevation and post-EMR-related complications were recorded. After EMR, patients had a standard follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months and further if it was necessary using total colonoscopy.Forty-nine patients suffering from giant LSTs were included in the study. No difference between the 2 groups was observed in patients' characteristics, size of LSTs, and the initial volume of injected solution. However, the additional amount of solution to maintain submucosal elevation was lower in group A (median, 4 mL; range, 2 to 25) than in group B (median, 6 mL; range, 3 to 8; P=0.001). Moreover, submucosal elevation had a statistically longer duration in group A (median, 18.5 min; range, 14.5 to 28.4) than in group B (median, 20.15 min, range, 9.6 to 13.4; P<0.001), and there was a statistical difference on total procedure time in favor of group A [group A, 20.15 min (12 to 32.5) vs. group B, 22.8 min (18 to 34.5)]. One case of macroperforation, 2 cases of postpolypectomy syndrome, and 1 case of EMR-related bleeding were observed in the HES+E group, whereas 6 cases of EMR-related bleeding were observed in the NS+E group. During a median follow-up of 32 and 34 months, for HES+E and NS+E groups, respectively, 5 and 7 recurrences were observed, which were all treated endoscopically.HES+E injection produces a more prolonged submucosal elevation and lowers total procedure time than NS+E; however, the safety of EMR is not influenced.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12232764>Use of radiolabelled choline as a pharmacodynamic marker for the signal transduction inhibitor geldanamycin.</a></h1><p>There is an urgent need to develop non-invasive pharmacodynamic endpoints for the evaluation of new molecular therapeutics that inhibit signal transduction. We hypothesised that, when labelled appropriately, changes in choline kinetics could be used to assess geldanamycin pharmacodynamics, which involves inhibition of the HSP90 molecular chaperone-->Raf1-->Mitogenic Extracellular Kinase-->Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1 and 2 signal transduction pathway. Towards identifying a potential pharmacodynamic marker response, we have studied radiolabelled choline metabolism in HT29 human  carcinoma cells following treatment with geldanamycin. We studied the effects of geldanamycin, on net cellular accumulation of (methyl-(14)C)choline and (methyl-(14)C)phosphocholine production. In parallel experiments, the effects of geldanamycin on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 phosphorylation and cell viability were also assessed. Additional validation studies were carried out with the mitogenic extracellular kinase inhibitor U0126 as a positive control; a cyclin-dependent kinase-2 inhibitor roscovitine and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 as negative controls. Hemicholinium-3, an inhibitor of choline transport and choline kinase activity was included as an additional control. In exponentially growing HT29 cells, geldanamycin inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 phosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These changes were associated with a reduction in (methyl-(14)C)choline uptake, (methyl-(14)C) phosphocholine production and cell viability. Brief exposure to U0126, suppressed phosphocholine production to the same extent as Hemicholinium-3. In contrast to geldanamycin and U0126, which act upstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2, roscovitine and LY294002 failed to suppress phosphocholine production. Our results suggest that when labelled with carbon-11 isotope, (methyl-(11)C)choline may be a useful pharmacodynamic marker for the non-invasive evaluation of geldanamycin analogues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14562051>Tissue concentrations of platelet-activating factor in colorectal carcinoma: inverse relationships with Dukes' stage of patients.</a></h1><p>The lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) plays a role in .

Experiments using Patent Blue dye showed that fluids diffused poorly into tumor mass when injected inside or around s.c. rat tumors in rats. In the same way, Patent Blue dye distributed poorly from the peritoneal cavity into the tumor nodules of rats with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The potent vasoconstrictor, epinephrine (1 mg/kg of body weight) was shown to facilitate the penetration of Patent Blue dye into s.c. and peritoneal rat tumors. Platinum concentration evaluated by micro-PIXE in s.c. DHD/K12/ PROb  tumors or by atomic absorption spectrometry in DHD/K12/PROb peritoneal tumors was 4- to 12-fold higher when epinephrine was added to local cisplatin. Peri-tumoral or intra-tumoral injection of cisplatin (2 mg/kg) alone does not cure s.c. DHD/K12/PROb  tumors or GV1A1 glioma tumors in BD IX rats. By contrast, a complete and lasting cure of s.c. tumors was achieved regularly and without skin necrosis when epinephrine was added to intra-tumoral or peri-tumoral cisplatin. Rats with peritoneal-tumor nodules 1 to 2 mm in diameter, and insensitive to i.p. cisplatin alone, were cured when the anti- drug was combined with epinephrine.

Motor abnormalities of the intestinal wall have been frequently described but very little is known about their mechanisms. We investigated in vitro the neural response of  longitudinal muscle strips from patients undergoing surgery for complicated diverticular disease (diverticulitis).The neural contractile response to electrical field stimulation of longitudinal muscle strips from the  of patients undergoing surgery for   or diverticulitis was challenged by different receptor agonists and antagonists.Contractions of  strips from healthy controls and diverticulitis specimens were abolished by atropine. The beta adrenergic agonist (-) isoprenaline and the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist SR140333 had similar potency in reducing the electrical twitch response in controls and diseased tissues, while the cannabinoid receptor agonist (+)WIN 55,212-2 was 100 times more potent in inhibiting contractions in controls (IC50 42 nmol/l) than in diverticulitis strips. SR141716, a selective antagonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, had no intrinsic activity in control preparations but potentiated the neural twitch in diseased tissues by up to 196% in a concentration dependent manner. SR141716 inhibited (+)WIN 55,212-2 induced relaxation in control strips but had no efficacy on (+)WIN 55,212-2 responses in strips from diverticular disease patients.  levels of the endogenous ligand of cannabinoid and vanilloid TRPV1 receptors anandamide were more than twice those of control tissues (54 v 27 pmol/g tissue). The axonal conduction blocker tetrodotoxin had opposite effects in the two preparations, completely inhibiting the contractions of control strips but potentiating those in diverticular preparations, an effect selectively inhibited by SR140333.Neural control of  motility is profoundly altered in patients with diverticulitis. Their raised levels of anandamide, apparent desensitisation of the presynaptic neural cannabinoid CB1 receptor, and the SR141716 induced intrinsic response, suggest that endocannabinoids may be involved in the pathophysiology of complications of  diverticular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3667610>Phospholipid metabolism in  cells monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Addition of choline, , or hemicholinium-3 (a choline kinase inhibitor) to the perfusate of human breast  cells monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy resulted in significant changes to phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals. These results enable us to assign the PMEs to phosphcholine (PC) and phosphoethanolamine (PE), the PDEs to glycerophosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylethanolamine, and to define the pathways producing them. The PMEs are products of choline and  kinases, the first steps in phospholipid synthesis; and the PDEs are substrates of glycerophosphorylcholine phosphodiesterase, the last step in phospholipid catabolism. Furthermore, PC and PE peaks are twice as intense in cells at log phase versus confluency. We also observed these signals in vivo in human  and breast tumors grown in mice. Since PMEs are low in most nonproliferating tissues, they could form a basis for noninvasive diagnosis. Also, PE and PC are situated between the control enzymes of two major synthetic pathways and will allow noninvasive 31P NMR studies of these pathways in intact cells and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3042807>Release of carcinoembryonic antigen from human  cells by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.</a></h1><p>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is released from  cells into the circulation where it is monitored clinically as an indicator of the recurrence or progression of . We have studied the mechanism of CEA membrane attachment and release using the human  adenocarcinoma cell line LS-174T, specimens of human  cancers, and serum from  patients. CEA release by cells in vitro and in vivo is associated with the conversion of CEA from a membrane-bound, hydrophobic molecule to a soluble, hydrophilic form with no apparent decrease in molecular mass. When LS-174T cell membranes were incubated with various buffers, proteases, and phospholipases, the only agents that released CEA and converted it to the hydrophilic form were preparations of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Both [3H] and [3H]palmitate could be incorporated metabolically into CEA but only palmitate was released by treatment with PI-PLC, consistent with the presence of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. PI-PLC treatment also release significant quantities of CEA from living monolayers and from seven human  specimens. These experiments suggest that cellular CEA is anchored to membranes by a covalent linkage to a membrane phosphatidylinositol molecule, and that an endogenous phospholipase may be important for releasing CEA in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333818>Expression profiling of choline and  kinases in MCF7, HCT116 and HepG2 cells, and the transcriptional regulation by epigenetic modification.</a></h1><p>The function of choline kinase (CK) and  kinase (EK) is to catalyse the phosphorylation of choline and , respectively, in order to yield phosphocholine (PCho) and phosphoethanolamine (PEtn). A high expression level of PCho, due to elevated CK activity, has previously been associated with malignant transformation. In the present study, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the mRNA expression profiles of ck and ek mRNA variants in MCF7 breast, HCT116  and HepG2 liver  cells. The ck and ek mRNA expression profiles showed that total ckα was expressed most abundantly in the HepG2 cells. The HCT116 cells exhibited the highest ckβ and ek1 mRNA expression levels, whereas the highest ek2α mRNA expression levels were detected in the MCF7 cells. The ckβ variant had higher mRNA expression levels, as compared with total ckα, in both the MCF7 and HCT116 cells. Relatively low ek1 mRNA expression levels were detected, as compared with ek2α in the MCF7 cells; however, this was not observed in the HCT116 and HepG2 cells. Notably, the mRNA expression levels of ckα2 were markedly low, as compared with ckα1, in all three  cell lines. The effects of epigenetic modification on ck and ek mRNA expression, by treatment of the cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), were also investigated. The results of the present study showed that the mRNA expression levels of ckα, ckβ and ek2α were affected by TSA. An increase >8-fold was observed in ek2α mRNA expression upon treatment with TSA, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In conclusion, the levels of ck and ek transcript variants in the three  cell lines were varied. The effects of TSA treatment on the mRNA expression levels of ck and ek imply that ck and ek mRNA expression may be regulated by epigenetic modification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836914>Synthesis and Antibacterial Activity of Mefloquine-Based Analogs Against Sensitive and Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains.</a></h1><p>Background and Introduction: Mefloquine, a drug used to prevent and treat malaria is described possessing activity against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as well as against multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR) and other types of bacteria. Despite their importance, few compounds based on the Mefloquine nucleus have been synthesized and evaluated against TB.For the synthesis of all the compounds based on the Mefloquine nucleus we used a synthetic route which utilized the key derivative 4-methoxy-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 2 as starting material. The compounds 3 (a-c), 4 (a-b) were synthesized after one step by reaction of 2 with appropriate amines substituted. The chloro derivatives 5 and 6 were obtained from compounds 4b and 4a by treatment with SOCl2 in CH2Cl2 at reflux in 75 and 80% yield, respectively. The analogue 6 was converted to 7 after treatment with  under heating at 90oC in 64% yield and to the azido derivative 8 in 56% after reaction with sodium azide in MeOH at reflux for 2 h. The analogue 9 was obtained after reaction of 5 with  at 90oC for 1 h in 90% yield. All the new compounds were identified by detailed spectral data, including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectra. All the compound were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 27294, using the microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA). The more active compounds 3c, 7, and 9 were also evaluated against resistant strain SR 2571/0215 (resistant to Rifampicin and Isoniazid) by above method. All compounds were tested against three  cell lines: SF-295 (glioblastoma), HCT-116 () and PC-3 (prostate) using the MTT assay.All the planned ten compounds were synthetically obtained in good global yield, displaying activity against sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro, with exception of one, with MIC values between 37.2 and 154.8 µM. The compounds 3c (37.2 µM), 7 (68.1 µM) and 9 (65.6 µM) showed the highest activity in this series with MIC values similar when compare to the standard Mefloquine (30 - 60 µM), being 3c the most potent. The more active compounds 3c, 7, and 9 were also evaluated against resistant strain, displaying MIC of 37.2, 136.2 and 65.6 µM, respectively. All compounds were tested against three  cell lines and showed low cytotoxicity.All synthesized compounds, with the exception of 5, exhibited activity against the Mtb. Compound 3c was the most potent against resistant and sensitive Mtb in this series, with MIC value of 37.2 µM. All compounds showed low cytotoxicity. These findings could be considered a good model to develop possible lead compounds in the fight against TB based on Mefloquine nucleus.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709709>Tissue-selective alteration of  plasmalogen metabolism in dedifferentiated  mucosa.</a></h1><p>Human  lipid analysis by imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) demonstrates that the lipid fingerprint is highly sensitive to a cell's pathophysiological state. Along the  crypt axis, and concomitant to the differentiation process, certain lipid species tightly linked to signaling (phosphatidylinositols and arachidonic acid (AA)-containing diacylglycerophospholipids), change following a rather simple mathematical expression. We extend here our observations to  plasmalogens (PlsEtn), a unique type of glycerophospholipid presenting a vinyl ether linkage at sn-1 position. PlsEtn distribution was studied in healthy, adenomatous, and carcinomatous  mucosa sections by IMS. In epithelium, 75% of PlsEtn changed in a highly regular manner along the crypt axis, in clear contrast with diacyl species (67% of which remained constant). Consistently, AA-containing PlsEtn species were more abundant at the base, where stem cells reside, and decreased while ascending the crypt. In turn, mono-/diunsaturated species experienced the opposite change. These gradients were accompanied by a gradual expression of ether lipid synthesis enzymes. In lamina propria, 90% of stromal PlsEtn remained unchanged despite the high content of AA and the gradient in AA-containing diacylglycerophospholipids. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were severely affected in polyps and carcinoma. These results link PlsEtn species regulation to cell differentiation for the first time and confirm that diacyl and ether species are differently regulated. Furthermore, they reaffirm the observations on cell lipid fingerprint image sensitivity to predict cell pathophysiological status, reinforcing the translational impact both lipidome and IMS might have in clinical research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Mass and protein content of the small intestine was reduced by 31% and 39%, respectively, after 7 d of TPN in tumor-bearing (TB) rats. Coinfusing peptide YY (PYY; 1 nmol.kg-1.h-1) and treating the rats with the anabolic beta-adrenergic agonist, clenbuterol (CLE; 2 mg.kg-1.d-1), resulted in significant savings in small intestine weight (26% increase) and protein (42% increase). Although the  also exhibited a significant decrease in mass (31%), none of the treatment combinations were effective in this region of the gut. Histologic analysis of ileum suggested that the additive effects of PYY and CLE were due to differential effects of these compounds on mucosal and muscular tissues, respectively. This combination of treatments also resulted in significant savings (30% increase) in gastrocnemius protein, suggesting a reduction in the cachectic response. These results suggest that TPN-induced gut hypoplasia and  cachexia may be reduced by the proper combination of nutritional, hormonal, and pharmacologic treatments.

However, complications may occur following polypectomy. The aim of this study was to assess whether submucosal epinephrine injection before polypectomy could reduce the incidence of bleeding and perforation.Between June 1997 and November 1999, patients with sessile polyps of the gastrointestinal tract found in our endoscopic unit were randomized to receive submucosal epinephrine injection (epinephrine group) or no injection (control group) before polypectomy. In the epinephrine group, epinephrine (1:10,000) was injected surrounding the stalk of the polyp until the mucosa was blanched and bulged. The patients were observed for complications in the following month.A total of 120 patients with 151 sessile polyps were enrolled in this study. In the epinephrine group, 75 polyps (n = 68) were randomized to receive epinephrine injection before polypectomy. In the control group, 76 polyps (n = 61) underwent polypectomy without epinephrine injection. In both groups, there was no significant difference in clinical features including the sizes of the polyps and their stalks, the location of polyps and the pathological diagnosis. There were a total of nine episodes of post-polypectomy hemorrhage, two in the epinephrine group and seven in the control group (2/75 vs. 7/76) (P = 0.07). One case in the epinephrine group experienced delayed bleeding (4 days later). Immediate hemorrhage occurred less in the epinephrine group than that in the control group (1/75 vs. 7/76, P = 0.03). There was one case of perforation in each group.Epinephrine injection prior to polypectomy is effective in preventing immediate bleeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30179713>Evaluation of the influence of green extraction solvents on the cytotoxic activities of Crinum (Amaryllidaeae) alkaloid extracts using in-vitro-in-silico approach.</a></h1><p>The traditional use of Amaryllidaceae plants to treat many disease have been known for a very long period of time. The chemical analysis of these plants has yielded a diversity of alkaloids with analgesic, anticholinergic, antitumor and antiviral activities. Crinum bulbispermum (Burm.f.) Milne-Redh. & Schweick in particular has been used by Zulu, Sotho and Tswana people to treat tumors as a form of chemotherapy, while in Madagascar, Crinum powellii Baker Handb. was used in the treatment of abscesses and tumors. Many of the alkaloids spawned by genus Crinum will surely take part in the production of anticancer drugs but their further clinical development is restricted by their limited commercial availability. An emerging area of research is the establishment of green extraction techniques of different targeted compounds.Our comparative study has investigated the possibility of getting improved biological responses by changing extraction solvent to a better and greener one. This study aimed to assess the cytotoxic activity of Crinum powellii and Crinum bulbispermum bulbs, when extracted by different green solvents.The green solvents Genapol X-80 (a surfactant-aided extraction), DES-3 (Choline chloride: fructose 5:2) mixture (a natural deep eutectic solvent) and purified distilled water were used for extraction of the bulbs. Extracts were tested against two cell lines HEPG-2 and HCT 116, with doxorubicin as a positive reference. Molecular docking studies were carried out to illustrate binding orientations of the alkaloids in the active site of several molecular targets for treatment of hepatic and colorectal .DES aided extraction showed highest cytotoxicity against the two cell lines, followed by surfactant aided extracts and finally aqueous extracts. There is an obvious relationship between alkaloidal content and antiproliferative potency of extracts. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed to aid the prediction of the alkaloids responsible for the activity. The alkaloid crinine showed high correlation coefficient value against HCT  cell line in the orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) model, suggesting that it could operate with a selective mode of action on this cell line. In addition, the alkaloid lycorine had almost no correlation to anti-proliferative activity against HCT  cells. Molecular docking studies confirmed the same conclusions.Herein, it was demonstrated that natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) components and surfactant solutions could be chosen to enhance biological activity of extracts prepared.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that: (1) Epinephrine in the 10(-7)-10(-3) M concentration range (ED50 = 11.10(-6) M) inhibits VIP-induced cyclic AMP rise in isolated  epithelial cells; the maximal inhibition reaches 30% of VIP effect; epinephrine alters the efficacy of the peptide and does not modify its potency; epinephrine also reduces the basal cyclic AMP level. (2) The inhibition is found with other alpha adrenergic agonists with the order of potencies epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine. Clonidine has a poor intrinsic activity but antagonizes the action of epinephrine. (3) The inhibition of VIP action by epinephrine is reversed by the alpha antagonists dihydroergotamine, phentolamine and the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine, while unaffected by the beta antagonist propranolol and the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin, (4) Epinephrine inhibits VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in preparations of  plasma membranes. Thus catecholamines exert through an alpha 2 adrenoreceptor a negative control on basal and VIP-stimulated cyclic AMP formation in human . We suggest that  cyclic AMP metabolism undergoes a dual control: VIPergic, activator and adrenergic, inhibitor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8388233>In vitro antitumour activity of the novel imidazoisoquinoline SDZ 62-434.</a></h1><p>The novel imidazoisoquinoline SDZ 62-434, originally identified as a platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, has antiproliferative activity in a range of cell lines from human solid and haematological malignancies. Using an MTT cytotoxicity assay, IC50 values of 5 microM - 111 microM were observed following a 24 h exposure. Similar results were obtained using a clonogenic assay. The HT29  adenocarcinoma was particularly sensitive while the MCF-7 breast carcinoma was the most resistant in our panel. Only a 2-3 fold cross-resistance was seen in the doxorubicin and cisplatin resistant variants of the A2780 ovarian carcinoma; the drug did not modulate sensitivity to doxorubicin in either parent or resistant lines. No cross-resistance to SDZ 62-434 was seen in a doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 variant. Cytotoxicity was not due to non-specific membrane lysis. The potent PAF antagonist WEB 2086 did not modulate SDZ 62-434 cytotoxicity, indicating no role for PAF receptors. Precursor incorporation studies in A2780 cells showed that DNA synthesis was inhibited more effectively than protein synthesis while RNA synthesis was unaffected. SDZ 62-434 inhibited both bombesin and platelet-derived growth factor-induced DNA synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. This suggests a possible role for SDZ 62-434 as an inhibitor of signal transduction in  cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14690494>Demonstration of functional receptors for noradrenaline and adenosine-5'-triphosphate, but not for prostaglandin E2, in HT-29 human  cell line.</a></h1><p>1. The aim of the current study was to investigate in HT-29 human  cell line, the existence of functional receptors for the signalling molecules, noradrenaline (NA), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). 2. We utilized microphysiometry, which monitors on-line extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of cellular metabolic activity, and how this variable is altered by signalling molecules. 3. Challenge with NA (5.9 microM) resulted in an increase in ECAR by approximately 24% of basal. 4. PGE2 (0.0284, 0.284 and 2.84 microM) hardly affected ECAR. 5. ATP (100 microM) elicited a biphasic effect on ECAR (increase and decrease in ECAR by about 58 and 10% of basal, respectively). 6. HT-29 cells were shown to express COX-2 by immunocytochemistry. 7. These data suggest the presence of functional receptors for NA and ATP, but not for PGE2 in HT-29 human  cell line.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2881298>Alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated sensitization of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production.</a></h1><p>Preincubation of HT29 human  adenocarcinoma cells with alpha 2-adrenergic agonists resulted in a 10- to 20-fold increase in forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production as compared to cells preincubated without agonist. Similar results were obtained using either a [3H]adenine prelabeling assay or a cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay to measure cyclic AMP levels. This phenomenon, which is termed sensitization, is alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated and rapid in onset and reversal. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-selective antagonist, blocked norepinephrine-induced sensitization, whereas prazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic) and sotalol (beta-adrenergic) did not. The time for half-maximal sensitization was 5 min and the half-time for reversal was 10 min. Only a 2-fold sensitization of cyclic AMP production stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide was observed, indicating that sensitization is relatively selective for forskolin. Sensitization reflects an increased production of cyclic AMP and not a decreased degradation of cyclic AMP, since incubation with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and forskolin did not mimic sensitization. Increasing the levels of cyclic AMP during the preincubation (using a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) had no effect on sensitization, indicating that sensitization is not caused by decreased cyclic AMP levels during the preincubation. This rapid and dramatic sensitization of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production is a previously unreported effect that can be added to the growing list of alpha 2-adrenergic responses that are not mediated by a decrease in cyclic AMP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18309354>Targeted gene therapy of LS174 T human  carcinoma by anti-TAG-72 immunoliposomes.</a></h1><p>Anti-tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG)-72 PEG-immunoliposomes (PILs) were prepared by conjugation of Fab' fragments of recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, HuCC49, to sterically stabilize unilamellar liposomes (90-110 nm in diameter) to target TAG-72-overexpressing  cells. The liposomes consisted of 1-palmitonyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 92 mol percent, O,O'-dymyrisyl-N-lysyl aspartate (DMKD cationic lipid), 4 mol percent, distearoyl-phosphatidyl--polyethylene glycol 2000 (DSPE-PEG(2000)), 3 mol percent and DSPE-maleimide (DSPE-PEG(2000)-Mal), 1 mol percent. These anti-TAG-72 PILs were able to adhere to the surface of TAG-72-overexpressing LS174 T human  cells more effectively than conventional liposomes. Also, in vitro gene transfection of the LS174 T cells by the anti-TAG-72 PILs in the presence of a high concentration of fetal bovine serum (up to 60%) was greater than that by conventional cationic lipoplexes. Intravenously administered anti-TAG-72 PILs efficiently localized in the LS174 T tumor tissues, while the non-targeted conventional liposomes did not. Intravenous administration of the anti-TAG-72 PILs containing plasmids encoding antiangiogenic proteins, such as angiostatin K1/3, endostatin and saxatilin, significantly inhibited in vivo growth of LS174 T tumors and angiogenesis in the tumor tissues. These results demonstrated the potential of TAG-72-mediated targeting of immunoliposomes as a modality for systemic gene delivery to human  cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12397730>Regulation of the enteric nervous system in the  of patients with slow transit constipation.</a></h1><p>The cause of impaired motility in patients with slow transit constipation is unknown. To clarify the physiological significance of cholinergic, adrenergic, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves in the  of patients with slow transit constipation, we investigated the enteric nerve responses on lesional and normal bowel segments derived from patients with slow transit constipation and patients who underwent  resection for  cancers.Twenty preparations were taken from the lesional  of 6 patients with slow transit constipation (2 men and 4 women, aged 23 to 68 years, with a mean age of 44.0 years). Thirty-six preparations were taken from the normal  of 12 patients with   (6 men and 6 women, aged 40 to 60 years, with a mean age of 52.2 years). A mechanographic technique was used to evaluate in vitro muscle responses to acetylcholine, adrenalin, electrical field stimulation of adrenergic and cholinergic nerves before and after treatment with various autonomic nerve blockers.The contraction reaction to acetylcholine in the  with slow transit constipation was significantly weaker than in the normal  (P < 0.01). The relaxation reaction to adrenalin in the  with slow transit constipation was stronger than in the normal . The  with slow transit constipation was more strongly innervated by non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves than the normal , significantly (P < 0.05).These findings suggest that a decrease of cholinergic nerve and an increase of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory nerve play an important role in the impaired motility observed in the  of patients with slow transit constipation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7640206>Growth arrest vs direct cytotoxicity and the importance of molecular structure for the in vitro anti-tumour activity of ether lipids.</a></h1><p>A panel of 25 different lipid agents was evaluated for in vitro activity against HT29 human  carcinoma and HL60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The structure-activity relationships seen with this series, including those for four sets of positional or stereoisomers, indicate that specific receptor proteins are unlikely as targets for anti-tumour lipid (ATL) action. Additional data confirm the lack of involvement of the platelet-activating factor receptor in particular and suggest that metabolic stability is a most important determinant of ATL activity. More detailed studies, with 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET18-OCH3) and (+/-)-2-(Hydroxy[tetrahydro-2-(octadecyloxy)methylfuran-2- yl]methoxyphosphinyloxy)-N,N,N,-trimethylethaniminium hydroxide (SRI 62-834), suggest three different modes of activity, depending on drug concentration and exposure time. Low doses of up to 5 microM in standard serum-containing medium cause population growth arrest after prolonged exposure. Growth arrest was associated with a leaky G2/M block as determined by flow cytometry. These effects are reversible. Intermediate concentrations (5-40 microM) were cytotoxic, causing a net reduction in cell numbers after 2-3 days. At even higher concentrations, all lipids caused rapid, direct membrane lysis. When the clonogenic assay was used to assess the effects of ATLs, most agents reduced colony formation at concentrations above 5 microM. However, some compounds proved stimulatory at nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that they might possess mitogenic properties. These results, particularly those concerning the concentration and time dependence, may be relevant to current clinical trials with ether lipids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10757549>Incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into CT-26, a transplantable murine  adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that marine oils, with high levels of eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, 22:6n-3), inhibit the growth of CT-26, a murine  carcinoma cell line, when implanted into the colons of male BALB/c mice. An in vitro model was developed to study the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into CT-26 cells in culture. PUFA-induced changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition and the affinity with which different fatty acids enter the various phospholipid species and subspecies were examined. We found that supplementation of cultured CT-26 cells with either 50 microM linoleic acid (LIN, 18:2n-6), arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6), EPA, or DHA significantly alters the fatty acid composition of CT-26 cells. Incorporation of these fatty acids resulted in decreased levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, while EPA and DHA also resulted in lower levels of AA. While significant elongation of both AA and EPA occurred, LIN remained relatively unmodified. Incorporation of radiolabeled fatty acids into different phospholipid species varied significantly. LIN was incorporated predominantly into phosphatidylcholine and had a much lower affinity for the  phospholipids. DHA had a higher affinity for plasmenylethanolamine (1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) than the other fatty acids, while EPA had the highest affinity for phosphatidylethanol-amine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine). These results demonstrate that, in vitro, significant differences are seen between the various PUFA in CT-26 cells with respect to metabolism and distribution, and these may help to explain differences observed with respect to their effects on tumor growth and metastasis in the transplantable model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14871845>Induction of apoptosis and down-regulation of Bcl-XL in  cells by a novel small molecule, 2[[3-(2,3-dichlorophenoxy)propyl]amino]ethanol.</a></h1><p>In a search for new anticancer agents, we identified that 2[[3-(2,3-dichlorophenoxy) propyl]amino]ethanol (2,3-DCPE) induced apoptosis more effectively in various  cells than in normal human fibroblasts. We further evaluated the cell-killing effects of this compound in vitro in several human  cell lines and normal human fibroblasts. A cell viability assay showed that IC(50)s for human  cell lines LoVo and DLD-1, for human lung  cell lines H1299 and A549, and for normal human fibroblasts were 0.89, 1.95, 2.24, 2.69, and 12.6 micro M, respectively. Subsequent studies revealed that 2,3-DCPE could cause cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and release of cytochrome c in  cells but not in normal human fibroblasts. Our data also showed that 2,3-DCPE attenuated the protein level of Bcl-XL and that apoptosis induction by 2,3-DCPE could be blocked by enforced overexpression of Bcl-XL.

The present study describes a murine orthotopic  tumour which metastasises to the liver. Morphology and vascular pattern of caecal tumours is similar to s.c. tumours. Vascular occlusion caused by intravenous (i.v.) noradrenaline (NA) (160 micrograms kg-1) and hydralazine (HDZ) (10 mgkg-1) was 32% and 59% respectively for the caecal tumours compared with 35% and 78% for s.c. tumours. Significant morphological differences were seen between liver metastases and systemic deposits produced by i.v. inoculation of tumour cells. Liver metastases following orthotopic transplantation contained functional vasculature but no significant occlusion was seen with NA or HDZ. The vascular development and morphological appearance of secondary disease resulting from orthotopic implantation suggests that this would be a useful model for the study of agents that act either by vascular or anti-angiogenic mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16616818>Polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (PEG-PE)-based mixed micelles: some properties, loading with paclitaxel, and modulation of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux.</a></h1><p>Mixed micelles prepared of poly(ethylene glycol)2000-phosphatidyl  conjugate (PEG(2000)-PE) and d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) in 1:1 molar ratio have been investigated. Micelle formation was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. CMC of the micelles was found to be 1.5 x 10(-5)M. Poorly soluble anti- drug paclitaxel (PCL) was efficiently solubilized in 15 nm non-toxic PEG-PE/TPGS micelles. PCL entrapment was quite stable with only about 20% of the incorporated drug released from micelles after 48 h at 37 degrees C. In addition, PCL-containing PEG(2000)-PE/TPGS micelles were stable in vitro under various conditions modeling the physiological ones, in particular, at low pH values and in the presence of bile acids, which is especially important for their possible oral administration. Fluorescently labeled micelles demonstrated time-dependent internalization by human  adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2. The internalization of PEG(2000)-PE/TPGS micelles loaded with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, rhodamine-123 (RH-123), opposite to the internalization of the free RH-123, was not influenced by the inhibition of the P-gp pump with verapamil hydrochloride, which assumes a P-gp-independent micelle internalization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058692>Early-Stage Supraglottic "In Situ" Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx Incidentally Detected by 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT.</a></h1><p>F-fluorocholine (F-FCH) PET/CT is widely used to study patients affected by prostate .

The review is restricted to occupations involving substantial dermal and inhalational exposure and for which an epidemiologic literature exists: metal machining, print press operating, and cotton and jute spinning. Mineral oils are complex mixtures of aliphatic hydrocarbons, naphthenics, and aromatics, the relative distribution of which depends on the source of the oil and the method of refinement. End-use products contain a variety of additives, and contamination by other agents generally occurs during use. Suspect agents include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (particularly benz[a]pyrene), nitrosamines, chlorinated paraffins, long-chain aliphatics, sulfur, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, and formaldehyde. The heterogeneity of this exposure makes epidemiologic study difficult and meta-analysis inappropriate. Nonetheless, several associations emerge from the literature with varying degrees of support. There is clear evidence that early formulations of mineral oils used in cotton and jute spinning and in metal machining were carcinogenic to the skin. Associations of mineral oil exposure with laryngeal and rectal  have received some support in the literature, particularly with respect to straight oils. Evidence is suggestive that grinding operations (which can entail either mineral oil-based or -based fluids) are associated with excess risk of  of the esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. A number of bladder  case-control studies have noted an association with work as a machinist. There is limited evidence of an association with  of the , prostate, and sinonasal region. Several studies of printers have yielded positive findings for lung , whereas studies in metal machinists have been generally negative. The PAH and nitrosamine content of current formulations is lower than in the past and the implications of these changes in composition to the carcinogenicity of the formulations are not yet known.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21565206>Effects of adrenaline in human  adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells.</a></h1><p>Stress has been implicated in the development of cancers. Adrenaline levels are increased in response to stress. The effects of adrenaline on  are largely unknown. The aims of the study are to determine the effects of adrenaline in human  adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells and the possible underlying mechanisms involved.The effect of adrenaline on HT-29 cell proliferation was determined by [(3)H] thymidine incorporation assay. Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected by Western blot. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release were determined by zymography and enzyme immunoassay, respectively.Adrenaline stimulated HT-29 cell proliferation. This was accompanied by the enhanced expression of COX-2 and VEGF in HT-29 cells. Adrenaline also upregulated MMP-9 activity and PGE(2) release. Adrenaline stimulated HT-29 cell proliferation which was reversed by COX-2 inhibitor sc-236. COX-2 inhibitor also reverted the action of adrenaline on VEGF expression and MMP-9 activity. Further study was performed to determine the involvement of β-adrenoceptors. The stimulatory action of adrenaline on  growth was blocked by atenolol and ICI 118,551, a β(1)- and β(2)-selective antagonist, respectively. This signified the role of β-adrenoceptors in this process. In addition, both antagonists also abrogated the stimulating actions of adrenaline on COX-2, VEGF expression, MMP-9 activity and PGE(2) release in HT-29 cells.These results suggest that adrenaline stimulates cell proliferation of HT-29 cells via both β(1)- and β(2)-adrenoceptors by a COX-2 dependent pathway.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The development of a neuropathic syndrome impairs quality of life and potentially results in chemotherapy dose reductions and/or early discontinuation. In the complex pattern of molecular and morphological alterations induced by oxaliplatin in the nervous system, an important activation of glia has been preclinically evidenced. N-Palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) modulates glial cells and exerts antinociceptive effects in several animal models. In order to improve the therapeutic chances for chemotherapy-dependent neuropathy management, the role of PEA was investigated in a rat model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy (2.4 mg kg-1 daily, intraperitoneally). On day 21, a single administration of PEA (30 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to reduce oxaliplatin-dependent pain induced by mechanical and thermal stimuli. The repeated treatment with PEA (30 mg kg-1 daily i.p. for 21 days, from the first oxaliplatin injection) prevented lowering of pain threshold as well as increased pain on suprathreshold stimulation. Ex vivo histological and molecular analysis of dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves and spinal cord highlighted neuroprotective effects and glia-activation prevention induced by PEA repeated administration. The protective effect of PEA resulted in the normalization of the electrophysiological activity of the spinal nociceptive neurons. Finally, PEA did not alter the oxaliplatin-induced mortality of the human  cell line HT-29. The efficacy of PEA in neuropathic pain control and in preventing nervous tissue alteration candidates this endogenous compound as disease modifying agent. These characteristics, joined to the safety profile, suggest the usefulness of PEA in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22212815>Zwitterionic biphenyl quinone methides in photodehydration reactions of 3-hydroxybiphenyl derivatives: laser flash photolysis and antiproliferation study.</a></h1><p>In aqueous media, photochemical excitation to S(1) of 3-phenylphenols 4-8 leads to deprotonation of the phenol OH, coupled with protonation of the benzyl alcohol and overall dehydration that delivers zwitterions 17-21.

We aimed at evaluating its antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects in human  adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line. Caco-2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PEA (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 μM) in the presence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a (PPAR-α) or PPAR-γ antagonists. Cell proliferation was evaluated by performing a MTT assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release was estimated by ELISA, while the expression of VEGF receptor and the activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were evaluated by western blot analysis. PEA caused a significant and concentration-dependent decrease of Caco-2 cell proliferation at 48 h. PEA administration significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner VEGF secretion and VEGF receptor expression. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and a downstream decrease of phospho-mTOR and of p-p70S6K were observed as compared with untreated cells. PPAR-α, but not PPAR-γ antagonist, reverted all effects of PEA. PEA is able to decrease cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The antiangiogenic effect of PEA depends on the specific inhibition of the AkT/mTOR axis, through the activation of PPAR-α pathway. If supported by in vivo models, our data pave the way to PEA co-administration to the current chemotherapeutic regimens for  carcinoma.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/498037>Chromosome analysis of primary large bowel tumors: a new method for improving the yield of analyzable metaphases.</a></h1><p> tumors were processed immediately after surgical resection.

TMAO is formed from trimethylamine (TMA)-precursors such as choline via the combined action of the gut microbiota and liver. We conducted a Mediterranean diet intervention that increased intakes of fiber and changed intakes of many other foods containing fat to increase the relative amount of mono-unsaturated fats in the diet. The Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases and might counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of increased TMAO formation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the Mediterranean diet would reduce TMAO concentrations. Fasting TMAO concentrations were measured before and after six-months of dietary intervention in 115 healthy people at increased risk for . No significant changes in plasma TMAO or in the ratios of TMAO to precursor compounds were found in either the Mediterranean group or the comparison group that followed a Healthy Eating diet. TMAO concentrations exhibited positive correlations with age and markers of metabolic health. TMAO concentrations were not associated with circulating cytokines, but the relative abundance of Akkermansia mucinophilia in  biopsies was modestly and inversely correlated with baseline TMAO, choline, and betaine serum concentrations. These results suggest that broad dietary pattern intervention over six months may not be sufficient for reducing TMAO concentrations in an otherwise healthy population. Disruption of the conversion of dietary TMA to TMAO should be the focus of future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4001469>[Malacoplakia of the  and rectum].</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849110>The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the migration of ES-2 ovarian carcinoma cells involves a Rap1-dependent pathway.</a></h1><p>Our previous studies have shown that norepinephrine induces the migratory activity of human PC-3 prostate, SW 480  and MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells. In contrast to these results, we show here that human ES-2 ovarian carcinoma cells have a reduced migratory activity after norepinephrine treatment. This inhibitory effect is possibly mediated by a cAMP-dependent activation of the small GTPase Rap1 via Epac. Furthermore, a key signalling event of the promigratory effect of norepinephrine in the above mentioned carcinoma cells is the activation of phospholipase C enzymes.

Significant differences between cell lines, in particular in their phospholipid metabolite levels, were observed. The largest differences between metabolite profiles in vivo and in culture were observed for cell lines which exhibit low phosphoethanolamine levels in culture. One of these lines, the  carcinoma CX-1, was studied in more detail in both incubated and perfused DMEM cultures with variation of the concentrations of glucose, choline and . Highly significant alterations of phospholipid metabolite concentrations and UDP-hexoses (primarily UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc) were observed as a function of the precursor concentrations, culture time or perfusion time. A strong interaction between phospholipid metabolic pathways and UDP-hexose pathways could be demonstrated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20551061>The phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor PI-103 downregulates choline kinase alpha leading to phosphocholine and total choline decrease detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a major target for  drug development. PI-103 is an isoform-selective class I PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. The aims of this work were as follows: first, to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to identify and develop a robust pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for target inhibition and potentially tumor response following PI3K inhibition; second, to evaluate mechanisms underlying the MRS-detected changes. Treatment of human PTEN null PC3 prostate and PIK3CA mutant HCT116  carcinoma cells with PI-103 resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in phosphocholine (PC) and total choline (tCho) levels (P < 0.05) detected by phosphorus ((31)P)- and proton ((1)H)-MRS. In contrast, the cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor docetaxel increased glycerophosphocholine and tCho levels in PC3 cells. PI-103-induced MRS changes were associated with alterations in the protein expression levels of regulatory enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including choline kinase alpha (ChoK(alpha)), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and phosphorylated ATP-citrate lyase (pACL). However, a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.9, P = 0.009) was found only between PC concentrations and ChoK(alpha) expression but not with FAS or pACL. This study identified inhibition of ChoK(alpha) as a major cause of the observed change in PC levels following PI-103 treatment. We also showed the capacity of (1)H-MRS, a clinically well-established technique with higher sensitivity and wider applicability compared with (31)P-MRS, to assess response to PI-103. Our results show that monitoring the effects of PI3K inhibitors by MRS may provide a noninvasive PD biomarker for PI3K inhibition and potentially of tumor response during early-stage clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors.Copyright 2010 AACR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12034734>Luminal leptin enhances CD147/MCT-1-mediated uptake of butyrate in the human intestinal cell line Caco2-BBE.</a></h1><p>In the intestine, butyrate constitutes the major energy fuel for colonocytes. However, little is known about the transport of butyrate and its regulation in the intestine. In this study we demonstrate that the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT-1) is apically polarized in model human intestinal epithelia and is involved in butyrate uptake by Caco2-BBE cell monolayers. The butyrate uptake by Caco2-BBE cell monolayers displayed conventional Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was found to be pH-dependent, Na(+)-independent, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-insensitive, and inhibited by the monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and by an excess of unlabeled butyrate. We show that MCT-1 associates with CD147 at the apical plasma membrane in Caco2-BBE cell monolayers. Using antisense CD147, we demonstrate that the association of CD147 with MCT-1 is critical for the butyrate transport activity. Interestingly, we show for the first time hormonal regulation of CD147/MCT-1 mediated butyrate uptake. Specifically, luminal leptin significantly up-regulates MCT-1-mediated butyrate uptake by increasing its maximal velocity (V(max)) without any modification in the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)). Finally, we show that luminal leptin up-regulates butyrate uptake in Caco2-BBE monolayers by two distinct actions: (i) increase of the intracellular pool of MCT-1 protein without affecting CD147 expression and (ii) translocation of CD147/MCT-1 to the apical plasma membrane of Caco2-BBE cell monolayers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20156671>Targeted cytotoxic somatostatin analog AN-162 inhibits growth of human  carcinomas and increases sensitivity of doxorubicin resistant murine leukemia cells.</a></h1><p>The effect of the targeted cytotoxic somatostatin (SST) analog AN-162, consisting of doxorubicin (DOX) conjugated to SST carrier RC-121, was investigated on the growth of human colorectal  (CRC) cell lines HT-29, HCT-15, and HCT-116 and a DOX-resistant mouse leukemia cell line P388/R84. mRNA for SST-receptors and high affinity binding sites for SST were detected in all CRC cell lines and in P388/R84 cells. In contrast to DOX alone, AN-162 blocked HCT-116 cells and P388/R84 cells in S/G2 phase and increased the number of apoptotic cells. In vivo, AN-162 reduced the volume of CRC xenografts more effectively than its unconjugated components. Our results suggest that AN-162 inhibits growth of experimental CRC more effectively than DOX and increases sensitivity of DOX resistant human leukemia cells.Copyright (c)  2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Influence of pH on phospholipid metabolite levels and the detection of cytidine 5'-diphosphate choline.</a></h1><p>202 MHz 31P NMR (11.7 T) was used to study the effects of culture medium pH on the levels of phosphate metabolites in three human tumor cell lines (XP29MAmal, a malignant xeroderma pigmentosum; CX-1, a  carcinoma; KB, a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity). Cells were cultured in Roux flasks in HAM's F-12 medium, and the pH was varied with the final medium change. After harvesting, 1-5 x 10(8) cells were suspended in Ringer/HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 and 4 degrees C for 31P NMR studies. Cell adhesion and growth rate decreased with decreasing pH, but, down to ca pH 6.1, trypan blue exclusion and the observed levels of nucleoside di- and triphosphates (range: 22-37% of total phosphates detected), phosphocreatine (PCr, 2-5%) and Pi (5-11%) did not vary significantly with pH. For XP29MAmal cells in exponential growth phosphocholine levels decreased from 18-28% at pH 7.0 to ca 5% at pH 6.0, while phosphoethanolamine levels increased from 2-7% to 15%. Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) levels increased from ca 7% at pH 7.2 to 13% at pH 6.3. At pH less than 6.3 cytidine 5'-diphosphate (CDP) choline became detectable (8-16%, delta p:P alpha = -8.13 ppm, P beta = 8.93 ppm, for PCr = 0 ppm). However, confluent cells did not accumulate CDP-choline when the pH was lowered.

In contrast, HT29 cells overexpressing miR-155 inhibitor displayed decreased cell proliferation and sensitivity to cisplatin induced cell death.

We describe a novel radiotracer, [(18)F]fluoromethyl-[1,2-(2)H(4)]-choline (D4-FCH), that employs deuterium isotope effect to improve metabolic stability. D4-FCH proved more resistant to oxidation than its nondeuterated analogue, [(18)F]fluoromethylcholine, in plasma, kidneys, liver, and tumor, while retaining phosphorylation potential. Tumor radiotracer levels, a determinant of sensitivity in imaging studies, were improved by deuterium substitution; tumor uptake values expressed as percent injected dose per voxel at 60 min were 7.43 +/- 0.47 and 5.50 +/- 0.49 for D4-FCH and [(18)F]fluoromethylcholine, respectively (P = 0.04). D4-FCH was also found to be a useful response biomarker. Treatment with the mitogenic extracellular kinase inhibitor PD0325901 resulted in a reduction in tumor radiotracer uptake that occurred in parallel with reductions in choline kinase A expression. In conclusion, D4-FCH is a very promising metabolically stable radiotracer for imaging choline metabolism in tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12020812>The role of the cell cycle on the efficiency of photochemical gene transfection.</a></h1><p>The efficiency of gene transfection mediated by nonviral vectors is limited because of nonoptimal intracellular trafficking of transfecting DNA. Most nonviral vectors deliver transfecting DNA into a cell through endocytosis. However, poor escape from endocytic vesicles and inefficient transport of DNA into the nucleus often limits a success of gene transfection. Photochemical transfection is a new method, based on light-induced permeabilisation of endocytic vesicles, liberating transfecting DNA into the cytosol, concurrently increasing the chances for DNA to enter the nucleus. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the cell cycle for the efficiency of photochemical transfection. It was demonstrated that in asynchronous human  carcinoma HCT 116 cells photochemical treatment increased the transfection mediated by the nonviral vectors, the cationic polypeptide polylysine and the cationic lipid N-(2-aminoethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2,3-bis(tetradecyloxy)-1-propanaminium bromide/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (beta AE-DMRIE/DOPE), by 30- and 2.5-fold, respectively. In aphidicolin-synchronised cells, photochemical transfection mediated by polylysine was dependent on the cell cycle: transfection level was 4-fold higher when illumination, inducing photochemical reactions, was performed during the G2/M phase as compared to the G1/early-S phase. The cell cycle influence on photochemical transfection mediated by beta AE-DMRIE/DOPE was very low: only 20% difference between G2/M and the G1/S phase was observed. We suggest that transgenes, photochemically liberated close/during mitosis, perhaps have the highest opportunity to enter the nucleus and be expressed. However, the dependence of photochemical transfection on the cell cycle might be partially disguised by various factors induced by photochemical treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014005>Non-proteolytic release of carcinoembryonic antigen from normal human  epithelial cells cultured in collagen gel.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have shown that, even with a minimal content of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), normal human  epithelial cells express substantial amounts of CEA mRNA and  mucosal fragments cultured in vitro produce CEA quite actively, indicating that CEA should no longer be considered to be of an oncofetal nature. To understand the basis of the usefulness of CEA as a tumor marker, we analyzed the release of CEA, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, from  epithelial cells, by culturing isolated  crypts in collagen gel. The crypts appeared to preserve their morphological and biochemical integrity in the gel for at least 16 hr, and released CEA spontaneously. Three forms of CEA--spontaneously released CEA, CEA liberated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and CEA in cell lysates--were indistinguishable on SDS-PAGE. This is in contrast to recombinant CEA spontaneously released from CHO transfectants, which showed a smaller molecular mass than that of PI-PLC-cleaved recombinant CEA. By phase separation using Triton X-114, CEA in the cell lysates of crypts was separated mostly into the detergent phase, while the spontaneously released and the PI-PLC-cleaved CEA were separated into the aqueous phase. When the cells were metabolically labeled with the precursors of the GPI-anchor, 3H- but not 3H-palmitic acid was found in the spontaneously released CEA. These findings suggest that, in contrast to the proteolysis-like release of the recombinant CEA from CHO cells, CEA in normal  epithelial cells is released by a non-proteolytic cleavage, which probably occurs through the action of some endogenous phospholipase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2305869>Vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulates active K+ transport and Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport in HT-29 cells.</a></h1><p>Regulation of active K+ influx and Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport activity in HT-29 cells by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was investigated. Both active K+ influx, defined as the ouabain-sensitive component, and Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport, defined as the ouabain-resistant bumetanide-sensitive component, of total K+ uptake were increased by VIP. VIP increased the maximum velocity (Vmax) values for both components with no change in apparent Michaelis constant (Km) values. Three lines of evidence support the role of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) as a mediator of the VIP effects. 1) The rank order potencies of VIP and peptide histidineisoleucineamide (PHI) in binding and cAMP production (J. T. Turner, S. B. Jones, and D. B. Bylund, Peptides Fayetteville 7: 849, 1986) and K+ uptake were consistent; 2) alpha 2-adrenergic agonists inhibited both VIP-stimulated cAMP production (J. T. Turner, C. Ray-Prenger, and D. B. Bylund, Mol. Pharmacol. 28: 422, 1985) and K+ uptake; and 3) forskolin, but not dideoxyforskolin, mimicked the effects of VIP on K+ uptake. Because amiloride blocked the VIP-stimulated active K+ component, the VIP effects on active K+ influx may be secondary to a Na(+)-H+ antiporter-mediated increase in cellular Na+ content. Additional experiments indicated that pretreatment of cells with a protein kinase C activator, previously shown to decrease basal Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport activity and the apparent number of cotransporters in HT-29 cells (C. C. Franklin, J. T. Turner, and H. D. Kim, J. Biol.

Maximal stimulation also requires a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Type I and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases from basal and stimulated cells have been characterized by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Further identidication of the kinase has been carried out by gel electrophoresis and assay of the enzymes in the gel slabs. Comparison of the radioautography patterns of high speed supernatant lysate from basal and stimulated cells shows: First, that one type I and two type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases plus one or two major and two minor cyclic AMP-independent protein kinases are present in HT 29 cells. Second, that all three holoenzymes are fully dissociated upon maximal stimulation, while the activity of the independent kinases appears unchanged.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4035078>Modulation of symmetrical 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced  carcinogenesis by isoproterenol (IPR).</a></h1><p>The modulatory effect of IPR on the initiation and promotion of DMH-induced  carcinogenesis was investigated using CF-1 young adult female mice.

Diet has a significant influence on  risk. Identifying chemopreventive agents, dietary constituents, practices and/or diet supplements that promote gut health and reduce the incidence of intestinal neoplasias and CRC could significantly impact public health. Sphingadienes (SDs) are dietary sphingolipids found in plant-based food products. SDs are cytotoxic to  cells and exhibit chemopreventive properties. The aim of the present study was to develop a sensitive and robust ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for quantifying SDs in food products and biological samples. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 80nM to 50μM and was sensitive to a detection limit of 3.3nM. Post-extraction stability was 100% at 24h. SD content in soy oils was approximately 10nM. SDs were detected transiently in the plasma of adult mice 10min after gavage delivery of a 25mg/kg bolus and declined to baseline by 1h. SD uptake in the gut was maximal in the duodenum and peaked 1h after gavage delivery. Disappearance of SDs in the lower gastrointestinal tract suggests either rapid metabolism to yet unidentified products or potentially luminal export.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to compare the complete resection rate of hot snare polypectomy (HSP) with that of EMR for small, sessile, or flat polyps.Patients with 5- to 9-mm non-pedunculated colorectal polyps were prospectively randomized to the HSP or EMR group. The presence of residual polyps was assessed by performing histologic assessment of 4-quadrant forceps biopsy specimens taken from the edges of the polypectomy site. The primary outcome was the complete resection rate after HSP or EMR; the secondary outcomes were the proportion of procedure-related adverse events and specimen-loss rate. Sample size was estimated using a superiority trial design. We assumed that the complete resection rate of the EMR group would be at least 8% higher than that of the HSP group.A total of 382 polyps in 269 patients were assessed and randomly assigned to each method using 4 × 4 block randomization. Of these, 353 polyps were finally analyzed based on the pathology results. The mean polyp size was 6.3 ± 1.3 mm. The complete resection rate did not differ between the HSP and EMR groups (88.4% [152/172] vs 92.8% [168/181], respectively; P = .2). The intraprocedural bleeding rate, immediately after polypectomy, was significantly higher in the HSP group than in the EMR group (5.2% vs 0.6%, respectively; P = .009). However, clinically significant bleeding and tissue retrieval failure rates did not differ between the groups. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, sessile serrated adenoma/polyps or hyperplastic polyps were almost 3 times (odds ratio, 2.824; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-7.75; P = .044) more likely to be incompletely resected compared with other conventional adenomatous polyps. Except for pathology, we found no significant independent predictors for incomplete resection.EMR for small non-pedunculated colorectal polyps is not superior to HSP in terms of complete resection or safety. Both methods can be performed according to the endoscopist's preference.

Furthermore, the lack of mechanistic interpretations has hindered understanding of how these agents affect the different physiological parameters involved in perfusion. Thus, there is a need to develop a unified framework for understanding the interrelated physiological effects of pharmacological and physical agents. The goals of this study were (1) to develop a mathematical model which helps determine the location and magnitude of changes in the vascular resistance of tumor and normal tissues and (2) to test the model with our experimental studies and by comparison with results from the literature. The systemic and interstitial pressures and relative tumor blood flow were measured before and after administration of angiotensin II, epinephrine, norepinephrine, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine in SCID mice bearing LS174T human  adenocarcinoma xenografts. A mathematical model was developed in analogy to electrical circuits which examined the pressure, flow, and resistance relationships for arterial and venous segments of the vasculature of a tumor and surrounding normal tissue. Vasoconstrictor-induced increases in the mean arterial blood pressure led to increases in tumor blood flow and interstitial pressure with the magnitude of change dependent on the agent (percentage change in blood flow: angiotensin > epinephrine > norepinephrine). The vasodilating agents induced decreases in tumor blood flow in parallel to the induced decreases in the systemic pressure, but only the long-acting arterial vasodilator hydralazine was capable of effecting a decrease in tumor interstitial pressure. The model was also found to be consistent with other data available in the literature on norepinephrine, pentoxifylline, nicotinamide, and hemodilution, and was useful in providing input as to the location and degree of the physiological effects of these agents. The results of the data and model show that the steal phenomenon is the dominant mechanism for redistribution of host blood flow to the tumor. However, some degree of arterial control was found to be present in the tumors. Moreover, the parallel increases in tumor interstitial pressure and blood flow contradict any hypothesis suggesting that elevated interstitial fluid pressure precipitates chronic vascular collapse, thus decreasing blood flow.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7693758>Taurodeoxycholate activates potassium and chloride conductances via an IP3-mediated release of calcium from intracellular stores in a  cell line (T84)</a></h1><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques and fluorescence measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, (Ca2+)i, were used to investigate the mechanism of taurodeoxycholate (TDC) stimulation of Cl- secretion in the T84  cell line. During perforated whole-cell recordings, the cell membrane voltage was alternately clamped to EK and ECl. Initially, TDC (0.75 mM) stimulated inward nonselective cation currents that were composed of discrete large conductance single-channel events. This initial response was followed by activation of K+ and Cl- currents with peak values of 385 +/- 41 pA and 98 +/- 28 pA, respectively (n = 12). The K+ and Cl- currents oscillated while TDC was present and returned to baseline levels upon its removal. The threshold for activation of the oscillatory currents was 0.1 mM TDC. Taurocholate, a bile acid that does not stimulate  Cl- secretion, induced no current response. The TDC-induced currents could be activated in Ca(2+)-free bathing solutions. Preincubation of cells with the Ca2+ chelator, bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, tetra(acetoxymethy)-ester (20 microM), (BAPTA-AM), eliminated the K+ and Cl- current responses, although the nonselective cation channel events were still present. Replacement of bath Na+ with NMDG+ inhibited the TDC-induced nonselective cation current but did not affect the K+ or Cl- currents. TDC induced a transient (Ca2+)i rise of 575 +/- 70 nM from a baseline of 71 +/- 5 nM (n = 15); thereafter, (Ca2+)i either plateaued or oscillated. TDC-induced (Ca2+)i oscillations were observed in the absence of bath Ca2+; however, removal of bath Ca2+ during the TDC response caused (Ca2+)i to return to near baseline values. Simultaneous K+ current and (Ca2+)i measurements confirmed that the initial nonselective cation current was independent of (Ca2+)i, while K+ current oscillations were in phase with the (Ca2+)i oscillations. TDC induced inositol monophosphate (IP) accumulation, reflecting production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) during TDC stimulation. The response to TDC during standard whole-cell patch-clamp was similar to that observed with perforated whole-cell recordings, except the nonselective cation current was prolonged. When heparin (1 mg/ml) was added to the pipette under these conditions, the Ca(2+)-activated currents were inhibited, but the nonselective cation currents were unaffected. These data suggest that TDC induces a Ca(2+)-independent nonselective cation conductance, perhaps by directly permeabilizing the plasma membrane. TDC stimulates Cl- secretion by activating K+ and Cl- conductances via an IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015691>Role of lipoxins, resolvins, and other bioactive lipids in  and pancreatic .</a></h1><p>Unresolved inflammation, due to insufficient production of proresolving anti-inflammatory lipid mediators, can lead to an increased risk of tumorigenesis and tumor cell invasiveness. Various bioactive lipids, particularly those formed by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, have been well established as therapeutic targets for many epithelial cancers. Emerging studies suggest that there is a role for anti-inflammatory bioactive lipids and their mediators during the resolution phase of inflammation. These proresolving bioactive lipids, including lipoxins (LXs) and resolvins (RVs), have potent anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties. The molecular signaling pathways controlling generation and degradation of the proresolving mediators LXs and RVs are now being elucidated, and the component molecules may serve as new targets for regulation of inflammation and inflammation-associated cancers like  and pancreatic cancers.

Aerobic glycolysis reduces pyruvate flux into mitochondria, preventing a complete oxidation of glucose and shunting glucose to anabolic pathways essential for cell proliferation. Here we tested a new strategy, mitochondrial uncoupling, for its potential of antagonizing the anabolic effect of aerobic glycolysis and for its potential anticancer activities. Mitochondrial uncoupling is a process that facilitates proton influx across the mitochondrial inner membrane without generating ATP, stimulating a futile cycle of acetyl- CoA oxidation. We tested two safe mitochondrial uncouplers, NEN (niclosamide ) and oxyclozanide, on their metabolic effects and anti- activities. We used metabolomic NMR to examine the effect of mitochondrial uncoupling on glucose metabolism in  MC38 cells. We further tested the anti- effect of NEN and oxyclozanide in cultured cell models, APC mouse model, and a metastatic  mouse model. Using a metabolomic NMR approach, we demonstrated that mitochondrial uncoupling promotes pyruvate influx to mitochondria and reduces various anabolic pathway activities. Moreover, mitochondrial uncoupling inhibits cell proliferation and reduces clonogenicity of cultured  cells. Furthermore, oral treatment with mitochondrial uncouplers reduces intestinal polyp formation in APC mice, and diminishes hepatic metastasis of  cells transplanted intrasplenically.

Colonoscopic polypectomy is performed frequently in primary, secondary and tertiary and medical centers in Korea. However, there are no evidence-based, procedural guidelines for the appropriate performance of this procedure, including the technical aspects. For the guideline presented here, Pubmed, Medline, and Cochrane Library literature searches were performed. When little or no data from well-designed prospective trials were available, an emphasis was placed on the results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Thus, these guidelines for colonoscopic polypectomy are based on a critical review of the available data as well as expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data become available. This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This guideline is not a rule and should not be construed as a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions for any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and the available courses of action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639786>Norepinephrine inhibits the migratory activity of pancreatic  cells.</a></h1><p>We have shown previously that norepinephrine induces migratory activity of tumour cells from breast,  and prostate tissue via activation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Consequently, this effect can be inhibited pharmacologically by clinically established beta-blockers. Tumour cell migration is a prerequisite for metastasis formation, and accordingly we and others have shown that breast  patients, which take beta-blockers due to hypertension, have reduced metastasis formation and increased survival probability as compared to patients without hypertension or using other anti-hypertensive medication. Unlike the aforementioned tumour cells, pancreatic  cells show a reduced migratory activity upon norepinephrine treatment. By means of our three-dimensional, collagen-based cell migration assay, we have investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in this phenomenon. We have found that this conflicting effect of norepinephrine on pancreatic  cells is due to an imbalanced activation of the two pathways that usually mediate a pro-migratory effect of norepinephrine in other tumour cell types. Firstly, the inhibitory effect results from activation of a pathway which causes a strong increase of the secondary cell signalling molecule, cAMP. In addition, activation of phospholipase C gamma and the downstream protein kinase C alpha were shown to be already activated in pancreatic  cells and cannot be further activated by norepinephrine. We hypothesize that this constitutive activation of the phospholipase C gamma pathway is due to a cross-talk with receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, and this might also deliver an explanation for the unusual high spontaneous migratory activity of pancreatic  cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Preincubation with somatostatin, another agonist negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, sensitized forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production to a lesser extent. alpha 2-Adrenergic agonist preincubation also resulted in desensitization as indicated by a shift to the right in the dose-response curve of a subsequent challenge by an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism for sensitization, we examined protein kinase C and the Na+/H+ antiporter. Whereas these components had marked effects on forskolin stimulation, there was no effect on sensitization. Changes in the concentration of extra-cellular Ca2+ or Mg2+ had no effect on either forskolin stimulation or sensitization. Pertussis toxin pretreatment caused a time-dependent decrease in sensitization, an attenuation of inhibition of cyclic AMP production, and a decrease in subsequent [32P]ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. The time course for these three events was similar, implicating the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in the mechanism for alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated sensitization of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production. In addition, pertussis toxin dramatically decreased forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production, although with a different time course. These results suggest that the mechanism of sensitization is via an as yet undefined sequence of biochemical events that includes the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, but does not include inhibition of adenylate cyclase nor activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9632821>Transcriptional regulation of the MDR1 gene by histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase is mediated by NF-Y.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have shown that the histone-modifying enzymes histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) are involved in transcriptional activation and repression, respectively. However, little is known about the endogenous genes that are regulated by these enzymes or how specificity is achieved. In the present report, we demonstrate that HAT and HDAC activities modulate transcription of the P-glycoprotein-encoding gene, MDR1. Incubation of human  carcinoma SW620 cells in 100-ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA), a specific HDAC inhibitor, increased the steady-state level of MDR1 mRNA 20-fold. Furthermore, TSA treatment of cells transfected with a wild-type MDR1 promoter/luciferase construct resulted in a 10- to 15-fold induction of promoter activity. Deletion and point mutation analysis determined that an inverted CCAAT box was essential for this activation. Consistent with this observation, overexpression of p300/CREB binding protein-associated factor (P/CAF), a transcriptional coactivator with intrinsic HAT activity, activated the wild-type MDR1 promoter but not a promoter containing a mutation in the CCAAT box; deletion of the P/CAF HAT domain abolished activation. Gel shift and supershift analyses identified NF-Y as the CCAAT-box binding protein in these cells, and cotransfection of a dominant negative NF-Y expression vector decreased the activation of the MDR1 promoter by TSA. Moreover, NF-YA and P/CAF were shown to interact in vitro. This is the first report of a natural promoter that is modulated by HAT and HDAC activities in which the transcription factor mediating this regulation has been identified.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15802048>Loss of p53 function in  cells results in increased phosphocholine and total choline.</a></h1><p>Mutations in the p53 gene are the most frequently observed genetic lesions in human cancers. Human cancers that contain a p53 mutation are more aggressive, more apt to metastasize, and more often fatal. p53 controls numerous downstream targets that can influence various outcomes such as apoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA repair. Based on previous observations using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we have identified choline phospholipid metabolite intensities typical of increased malignancy. Here we have used (1)H MRS to characterize the choline phospholipid metabolite levels of p53(+/ +) and p53(-/-) cells, and demonstrated that loss of p53 function results in increased phosphocholine and total choline. These data suggest that the increased malignancy of  cells resulting from loss of p53 may be mediated, in part, through the choline phospholipid pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3444388>Alkyl phosphocholines: toxicity and anticancer properties.</a></h1><p>The study reports on the investigation of acute and subacute toxicity and on antineoplastic activity of hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC), the first compound of a new class of antineoplastic chemotherapeutics. In rats, the LD50 of HPC was 606 mumol/kg; the maximum tolerable dose over four weeks was 39 mumol/kg. Symptoms of toxicity were enteritis, spider cell activation in the liver, hemosiderosis in the spleen and reversible transaminase increase. The best therapeutic effect was observed on methylnitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary carcinoma in the rat. Two transplantable mammary carcinomas in the rat and autochthonous benzo(a)pyrene-induced sarcomas exhibited low-grade sensitivity to HPC. The MXT mammary carcinoma of the mouse, the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma of the rat, and autochthonous acetoxymethylmethylnitrosamine-induced  tumors of the rat were not chemosensitive to HPC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28954820>Cannabidiol and palmitoylethanolamide are anti-inflammatory in the acutely inflamed human .</a></h1><p>We sought to quantify the anti-inflammatory effects of two cannabinoid drugs, cannabidiol (CBD) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in cultured cell lines and compared this effect with experimentally inflamed explant human  tissue. These effects were explored in acutely and chronically inflamed , using inflammatory bowel disease and appendicitis explants.Caco-2 cells and human  explants collected from elective bowel , inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or acute appendicitis resections, and were treated with the following drug treatments: vehicle, an inflammatory protocol of interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα; 10 ng/ml), inflammation and PEA (10 µM), inflammation and CBD (10 µM), and PEA or CBD alone, CBD or vehicle were added simultaneously with IFNγ. Nine intracellular signalling phosphoproteins were determined by multiplex. Inflammatory cytokine secretion was determined using ELISA. Receptor mechanisms were investigated using antagonists for CB, CB, PPARα, PPARγ, TRPV1 and GPR55.IFNγ and TNFα treatment increased phosphoprotein and cytokine levels in Caco-2 cultures and  explants. Phosphoprotein levels were significantly reduced by PEA or CBD in Caco-2 cultures and  explants. CBD and PEA prevented increases in cytokine production in explant , but not in Caco-2 cells. CBD effects were blocked by the CB antagonist AM630 and TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. PEA effects were blocked by the PPARα antagonist GW6471. PEA and CBD were anti-inflammatory in IBD and appendicitis explants.PEA and CBD are anti-inflammatory in the human . This effect is not seen in cultured epithelial cells. Appropriately sized clinical trials should assess their efficacy.© 2017 The Author(s).

Changes in density and distribution of beta-ARs as well as in post-receptor signalling components were studied in membranes of human liver with CRCHM, and for comparison, in membranes of nonadjacent, non-metastatic human liver (NA-NM) obtained from 13 patients, using binding and competition binding studies. Studies were also carried out using normal and cancerous human  tissues. In CRCHM, the density of beta-ARs (B(max)) was significantly reduced, compared to NA-NM liver tissues (40.09+/-2.83 vs. 23.09+/-3.24 fmol/mg protein; P<0.001). A similar decrease in the beta-AR density was observed in the  with primary colorectal  compared to healthy  (37.6+/-2.2 vs. 23.8+/-3.5 fmol/mg protein), whereas the affinity of ICYP binding to the receptor remained unaffected. Desensitized beta-ARs were uncoupled from stimulatory G-protein (G(S)), as total density of beta-adrenoceptors in the high affinity state was significantly reduced. Concomitantly, CRCHM elicited decrease in the catalytic adenylate cyclase (AC) activity (cAMP formation) in response to isoproterenol plus GTP or forskolin or NaF. In NA-NM and CRCHM liver, the inhibition-concentration curves of ICI 118.551 showed the presence of a homogeneous population of the beta2-AR subtypes. Neither the binding patterns nor the inhibition constant (K(i)) of ICI 118.551 were altered in CRCHM. In CRCHM, the hepatic beta-AR-G-protein(s)-AC signalling system was markedly impaired, thus, these changes may well influence beta-AR-mediated functions in both organs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25812650>Antiproliferative effects of β-blockers on human colorectal  cells.</a></h1><p> is the fourth and third most common , respectively in men and women worldwide and its incidence is on the increase. Stress response has been associated with the incidence and development of . The catecholamines (CA), adrenaline (AD) and noradrenaline (NA), are crucial mediators of stress response, exerting their effects through interaction with α- and β-adrenergic receptors (AR).  cells express β-AR, and their activation has been implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Interest concerning the efficacy of β-AR blockers as possible additions to  treatment has increased. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of several AR agonists and β-blockers following cell proliferation of HT-29 cells, a human  adenocarcinoma cell line. For this purpose, HT-29 cells were incubated in the absence (control) or in the presence of the AR-agonists, AD, NA and isoprenaline (ISO) (0.1-100 µM) for 12 or 24 h. The tested AR agonists revealed proliferative effects on HT-29 cells. In order to study the effect of several β-blockers following proliferation induced by AR activation, the cells were treated with propranolol (PRO; 50 µM), carvedilol (CAR; 5 µM), atenolol (ATE; 50 µM), or ICI 118,551 (ICI; 5 µM) for 45 min prior, and simultaneously, to incubation with each of the AR agonists, AD and ISO, both at 1 and 10 µM. The results suggested that adrenergic activation plays an important role in  cell proliferation, most probably through β-AR. The β-blockers under study were able to reverse the proliferation induced by AD and ISO, and some of these blockers significantly decreased the proliferation of HT-29 cells. The elucidation of the intracellular pathways involved in CA-induced proliferation of  cells, and in the reversion of this effect by β-blockers, may contribute to identifying promising strategies in  treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2341397>Sequence and glycosylation site identity of two distinct glycoforms of nonspecific cross-reacting antigen as demonstrated by sequence analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA) is a highly glycosylated membrane protein which is immunologically and structurally related to carcinoembryonic antigen, an important tumor-associated antigen. Two glycoforms of NCA were purified from a single liver metastasis of a  carcinoma and characterized with respect to their primary sequence and position of glycosylation sites. The two glycoforms (designated TEX (tumor-extracted antigen), Mr 75,000, and NCA, Mr 45,000) each showed a deglycosylated Mr of 35,000 and yielded identical peptide maps. The structural characterization of TEX and NCA and the assignment of glycosylation sites was performed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and microsequence analysis of the resulting peptides. This approach showed that TEX and NCA were identical with respect to primary sequence and provided direct evidence that 11 of the 12 predicted asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were glycosylated in both TEX and NCA. Indirect evidence was obtained for glycosylation at the other site. Both glycoforms also contain  linked to Gly-286, a finding consistent with the conclusion that these proteins are anchored to the plasma membrane through a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol tail. The large difference in the molecular weights of glycosylated TEX and NCA suggests significant variations in their oligosaccharide structures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2606571>Tissue norepinephrine depletion as a mechanism for cysteamine inhibition of  carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane in Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>The effects of cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride) on the incidence, number and histology of  tumors induced by azoxymethane (AOM), and on the norepinephrine concentration in the  wall tissue and the labelling indices of  mucosa and  cancers were investigated in Wistar rats. Rats received 10 weekly injections of 7.4 mg/kg body weight of AOM and alternate-day subcutaneous injections of 25 mg/kg of cysteamine in 0.9% NaCl solution until the end of the experiment. At week 40, prolonged administration of cysteamine significantly reduced the incidence and number of  tumors. Histologically, the adenocarcinomas that did develop in rats treated with cysteamine exhibited high mucin-producing activity. Administration of cysteamine caused significant decreases in the norepinephrine concentration in  tissue and in the labelling indices of  mucosa and cancers. Our findings indicate that cysteamine inhibits the development of  tumors. This action may be related to its effect in decreasing norepinephrine concentration in the  wall tissues and subsequently in decreasing proliferation of  cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807725>Sp1 and Sp3 Are the Transcription Activators of Human ek1 Promoter in TSA-Treated Human  Carcinoma Cells.</a></h1><p> kinase (EK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of , the first step in the CDP- pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Human EK exists as EK1, EK2α and EK2β isoforms, encoded by two separate genes, named ek1 and ek2. EK activity is stimulated by carcinogens and oncogenes, suggesting the involvement of EK in carcinogenesis. Currently, little is known about EK transcriptional regulation by endogenous or exogenous signals, and the ek gene promoter has never been studied.In this report, we mapped the important regulatory regions in the human ek1 promoter. 5' deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified a Sp site at position (-40/-31) that was essential for the basal transcription of this gene. Treatment of HCT116 cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, significantly upregulated the ek1 promoter activity through the Sp(-40/-31) site and increased the endogenous expression of ek1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that TSA increased the binding of Sp1, Sp3 and RNA polymerase II to the ek1 promoter in HCT116 cells. The effect of TSA on ek1 promoter activity was cell-line specific as TSA treatment did not affect ek1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells.In conclusion, we showed that Sp1 and Sp3 are not only essential for the basal transcription of the ek1 gene, their accessibility to the target site on the ek1 promoter is regulated by histone protein modification in a cell line dependent manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8403207>Enhancement by the tricyclic antidepressant, desipramine, of experimental carcinogenesis in rat  induced by azoxymethane.</a></h1><p>The effects of the tricyclic antidepressant drug desipramine on the incidence, number and histology of  tumors induced by azoxymethane (AOM), and on the serum norepinephrine (NE) concentration and the labeling index of  mucosa were investigated in Wistar rats. Rats were treated s.c. with 7.4 mg AOM/kg body wt once a week for 10 weeks, and also s.c. with 10 mg desipramine hydrochloride (desipramine)/kg body weight until the end of the experiment. Treatment with desipramine significantly increased the incidence, but not the number, of  tumors in week 35. However, it did not influence the location and the histological appearance of the  tumors or the histological types of  adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, it significantly increased the serum NE level and the labeling index of  mucosa during and after AOM treatment. These findings indicate that desipramine enhanced the development of  tumors and that its effect may be related to its effect in increasing proliferation of  epithelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2015144>Postoperative protein metabolism: effect of nursing elderly patients for 24 h after abdominal surgery in a thermoneutral environment.</a></h1><p>We have studied the effect of intraoperative body heat conservation and 24-h thermoneutrality on postoperative whole body protein turnover using stable isotope methodology in a group of elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. Two groups of eight patients were studied. One group (control, or cold) received routine intraoperative and postoperative care. All patients in the second group (warmed) were maintained at normothermia during anaesthesia and surgery; these patients were nursed after surgery in a warm room (ambient temperature 28-30 degrees C) for a period of 24 h. General anaesthesia, surgical care and nutritional support were similar in both groups. A constant nutritional intake, based on nitrogen 0.1 g kg-1 day-1 and energy 20 kcal kg-1 day-1, was provided orally for 7 days before surgery and i.v. after operation for 4 consecutive days. Whole body protein breakdown and synthesis, as assessed by stable isotope methodology, increased significantly 2 and 4 days after surgery in both groups (P less than 0.01), but the increase in protein breakdown in the warmed group on day 2 was significantly less than that in the cold group (P less than 0.05). The increase in leucine oxidation in the warmed group on the 2nd day after surgery was not significant, and was less than the increase observed in the cold group (P less than 0.05). However, by the 4th day, leucine oxidation was enhanced significantly in both groups (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25785727>Choline and betaine intake and colorectal  risk in Chinese population: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>Few studies have examined the association of choline and betaine intake with colorectal  risk, although they might play an important role in colorectal  development because of their role as methyl donors. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between consumption of choline and betaine and colorectal  risk in a Chinese population.A case-control study was conducted between July 2010 and December 2013 in Guangzhou, China. Eight hundred and ninety consecutively recruited colorectal  cases were frequency matched to 890 controls by age (5-year interval) and sex. Dietary information was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire by face-to-face interviews. The logistic regression model was used to estimate multivariate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Total choline intake was inversely associated with colorectal  risk after adjustment for various lifestyle and dietary factors. The multivariate-adjusted OR was 0.54 (95%CI = 0.37-0.80, Ptrend <0.01) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile. No significant associations were observed for betaine or total choline+betaine intakes. For choline-containing compounds, lower colorectal  risk was associated with higher intakes of choline from phosphatidylcholine, glycerophosphocholine and sphingomyelin but not for free choline and phosphocholine. The inverse association of total choline intake with colorectal  risk was observed in both men and women,  and rectal . These inverse associations were not modified by folate intake.These results indicate that high intake of total choline is associated with a lower risk of colorectal .</p></html>
