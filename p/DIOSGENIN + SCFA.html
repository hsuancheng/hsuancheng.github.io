Candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of  in fenugreek were identified. Detailed mechanism of  synthesis was proposed. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) is a valuable medicinal and crop plant. It belongs to Fabaceae family and has a unique potential to synthesize valuable steroidal saponins, e.g., . Elicitation (methyl jasmonate) and precursor feeding (cholesterol and squalene) were used to enhance the content of sterols and steroidal sapogenins in in vitro grown plants for representational difference analysis of cDNA (cDNA-RDA). To identify candidate genes involved in  biosynthesis, differential, factor-specific libraries were subject to the next-generation sequencing. Approximately 9.9 million reads were obtained, trimmed, and assembled into 31,491 unigenes with an average length of 291 bp. Then, functional annotation and gene ontogeny enrichment analysis was performed by aligning all-unigenes with public databases. Within the transcripts related to sterol and steroidal saponin biosynthesis, we discovered novel candidate genes of  biosynthesis and validated their expression using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Based on these findings, we supported the idea that  is biosynthesized from cycloartenol via cholesterol. This is the first report on the next-generation sequencing of cDNA-RDA products. Analysis of the transcriptomes enriched in low copy sequences contributed substantially to our understanding of the biochemical pathways of steroid synthesis in fenugreek.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29453912>HPTLC determination of  in fenugreek seeds.</a></h2><p>A new HPTLC-densitometric method for  determination in fenugreek seeds was established after optimization of the conditions for efficient saponin extraction and acid hydrolysis. Several procedures were tested, the best of which was a three-step Soxhlet extraction, followed by hydrolysis of the obtained methanolic extract with 2 mol L-1 H2SO4. Best  separation from other hydrolysis products was obtained on HPTLC Si60F254 plates u sing a mixture of n-heptane/ethyl acetate (7:3, V/V) and modified anisaldehyde as a spraying reagent. The method was preliminarily validated and the determined amounts of  in fenugreek seeds of Polish and African origin were found to be similar and ranged from 0.12-0.18 %.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26694357>Elicitation of  Production in Trigonella foenum-graecum (Fenugreek) Seedlings by Methyl Jasmonate.</a></h2><p>The effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor of plant defense mechanisms, on the biosynthesis of , a steroidal saponin, were investigated in six fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) varieties (Gujarat Methi-2, Kasuri-1, Kasuri-2, Pusa Early Branching, Rajasthan Methi and Maharashtra Methi-5). Treatment with 0.01% MeJA increased  levels, in 12 days old seedlings, from 0.5%-0.9% to 1.1%-1.8%. In addition, MeJA upregulated the expression of two pivotal genes of the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic route leading to : 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG) and sterol-3-β-glucosyl transferase (STRL). In particular, MeJA increased the expression of HMG and STRL genes by 3.2- and 22.2-fold, respectively, in the Gujarat Methi-2 variety, and by 25.4- and 28.4-fold, respectively, in the Kasuri-2 variety. Therefore, MeJA may be considered a promising elicitor for  production by fenugreek plants.</p></html>
