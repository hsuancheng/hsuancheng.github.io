Epidemiological studies show that chronic treatment with low levels of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) lowers the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) by as much as 50%. Unfortunately, inhibiting cyclooxygenases with NSAIDs blocks the synthesis of downstream neuroprotective and neurotoxic PGs, thus producing adverse side effects. We focus on prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) because it is highly neurotoxic compared to , D2, and E2. Unlike other PGs, PGJ2 and its metabolites have a cyclopentenone ring with reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that form covalent Michael adducts with key cysteines in proteins and GSH. Cysteine-binding electrophiles such as PGJ2 are considered to play an important role in determining whether neurons will live or die. We discuss in vitro and in vivo studies showing that PGJ2 induces pathological processes relevant to neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD. Further, we discuss our work showing that increasing intracellular cAMP with the lipophilic peptide PACAP27 counteracts some of the PGJ2-induced detrimental effects. New therapeutic strategies that neutralize the effects of specific neurotoxic PGs downstream from cyclooxygenases could have a significant impact on the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative disorders with fewer adverse side effects.© 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18034160>Anti-inflammatory lipid mediator 15d-PGJ2 inhibits translation through inactivation of eIF4A.</a></h2><p>The signaling lipid molecule 15-deoxy-delta 12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) has multiple cellular functions, including anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activities. Here, we report that 15d-PGJ2 blocks translation through inactivation of translational initiation factor eIF4A. Binding of 15d-PGJ2 to eIF4A blocks the interaction between eIF4A and eIF4G that is essential for translation of many mRNAs. Cysteine 264 in eIF4A is the target site of 15d-PGJ2. The antineoplastic activity of 15d-PGJ2 is likely attributed to inhibition of translation. Moreover, inhibition of translation by 15d-PGJ2 results in stress granule (SG) formation, into which TRAF2 is sequestered. The sequestration of TRAF2 contributes to the anti-inflammatory activity of 15d-PGJ2. These findings reveal a novel cross-talk between translation and inflammatory response, and offer new approaches to develop anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs that target translation factors including eIF4A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10491119>Induction of ferritin and heat shock proteins by  in human monocytes. Evidence for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins of the A type (PGA) exert a cytoprotective activity during hyperthermia and virus infection. This effect is associated with induction of heat shock proteins (HSP) in mammalian cells. We now report that, in human monocytes,  is able to induce the synthesis of the iron-binding, redox-regulated protein ferritin. L-chain ferritin induction is consequent to a substantial increase in the accumulation of L-chain ferritin transcripts in -treated cells, whereas H-chain ferritin is regulated post-transcriptionally, consequently to reduction of iron-regulatory protein binding to iron-responsive elements in ferritin mRNA. Ferritin induction is specific for cyclopentenone prostaglandins (, PGA2, PGJ2, Delta12-PGJ2), whereas other arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites have no effect. In human monocytes,  also induces heat shock gene transcription via heat shock factor activation, as well as the synthesis of the oxidative-stress protein heme oxygenase (HOS). Differently from HSP, the induction of ferritin by  is specific for monocytes. Monocytes/macrophages play a pivotal role in , controlling iron metabolism and releasing a variety of mediators, including proinflammatory reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines and AA metabolites. As ferritin, together with hsp70 and HO, plays a key role in protection from oxidant damage, these results suggest that  may have cytoprotective activity also during oxidative injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507934>Identification of aldo-keto reductase AKR1B10 as a selective target for modification and inhibition by prostaglandin A(1): implications for antitumoral activity.</a></h2><p>Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) are reactive eicosanoids that may display anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative actions, possibly offering therapeutic potential. Here we report the identification of members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family as selective targets of the cyPG prostaglandin A(1) (PGA(1)). AKR enzymes metabolize aldehydes and drugs containing carbonyl groups and are involved in  and tumorigenesis. Thus, these enzymes represent a class of targets to develop small molecule inhibitors with therapeutic activity. Molecular modeling studies pointed to the covalent binding of PGA(1) to Cys299, close to the active site of AKR, with His111 and Tyr49, which are highly conserved in the AKR family, playing a role in PGA(1) orientation. Among AKR enzymes, AKR1B10 is considered as a tumor marker and contributes to tumor development and chemoresistance. We validated the direct modification of AKR1B10 by biotinylated PGA(1) (PGA(1)-B) in cells, and confirmed that mutation of Cys299 abolishes PGA(1)-B incorporation, whereas substitution of His111 or Tyr49 reduced the interaction. Modification of AKR1B10 by PGA(1) correlated with loss of enzymatic activity and both effects were increased by depletion of cellular glutathione. Moreover, in lung cancer cells PGA(1) reduced tumorigenic potential and increased accumulation of the AKR substrate doxorubicin, potentiating cell-cycle arrest induced by this chemotherapeutic agent. Our findings define PGA(1) as a new AKR inhibitor and they offer a framework to develop compounds that could counteract cancer chemoresistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6205837>[Animal experiment studies on the role of  mediators in corneal neovascularization].</a></h2><p>Natural and synthetic inflammatory compounds were implanted in the corneas of rabbits to clarify the question whether corneal neovascularization is induced by stromal edema alone, or by neovascular mediators. It could be demonstrated that prostaglandin E1 and E2 have an angiogenetic capacity, whereas their precursor (arachidonic acid) as well as , A2, B2, I2 and Thromboxan A2 were inactive in this regard. Histology showed that corneal neovascularization is always accompanied by the invasion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Corneal edema in the beginning of vascularization can be explained by the activities of PGE (vasodilation, increase of vascular permeability, liberation of histamine). The implantation of lipoxygenase-dependent arachidonic acid compounds (5-HETE, Leukotriene B4) demonstrated that these mediators share in the process of neovascularization by inducing the chemotaxis. The above mentioned activities of prostaglandins and leukotrienes could also be demonstrated following penetrating keratoplasty and alkali burns of the anterior segment inducing extensive corneal neovascularization. An analysis of the prostaglandin- and leukotriene-dependent mechanisms could be achieved by selective PG- and LT-inhibitors. Radioimmunoassays showed a definite correlation between the concentrations of PGE and the amount of neovascularization following alkali burns. The results of our research lead to the following scheme of pathophysiology of corneal neovascularization: hypoxic, chemical, thermic and mechanical alterations of the cornea induce an activation of corneal cytomembranes, thus initiating the cyclooxygenase-dependent synthesis of prostaglandins with consecutive vasodilation and increase of vascular permeability as well as histamine liberation resulting in corneal edema; on the other hand, prostaglandins proved to have a minimal chemotactic activity; the lipoxygenase-dependent synthesis of leukotrienes inducing chemotaxis and diapedesis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the corneal stroma. These inflammatory cells are then the main source of newly synthesized leukotrienes maintaining the chemotaxis, and prostaglandins with angiogenetic activity. Cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-inhibitors can inhibit these activities at two different levels, leading to an approach of successful therapy of corneal diseases inducing neovascularization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16407234>Herpes simplex virus disrupts NF-kappaB regulation by blocking its recruitment on the IkappaBalpha promoter and directing the factor on viral genes.</a></h2><p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are able to hijack the host-cell IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway, which regulates critical cell functions from apoptosis to inflammatory responses; however, the molecular mechanisms involved and the outcome of the signaling dysregulation on the host-virus interaction are mostly unknown. Here we show that in human keratinocytes HSV-1 attains a sophisticated control of the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway, inducing two distinct temporally controlled waves of IKK activity and disrupting the NF-kappaB autoregulatory mechanism. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that dysregulation of the NF-kappaB-response is mediated by a virus-induced block of NF-kappaB recruitment to the promoter of the IkappaBalpha gene, encoding the main NF-kappaB-inhibitor. We also show that HSV-1 redirects NF-kappaB recruitment to the promoter of ICP0, an immediate-early viral gene with a key role in promoting virus replication. The results reveal a new level of control of cellular functions by invading viruses and suggest that persistent NF-kappaB activation in HSV-1-infected cells, rather than being a host response to the virus, may play a positive role in promoting efficient viral replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7228354>Suppression of human lymphocyte migration by PGE2.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin (PG) E2 markedly inhibits casein- and C5a-stimulated lymphocyte migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition is observed with as low as 10(-9) M PGE2 and requires that PGE2 be present during cell locomotion.

These studies indicate that PGE2 may play a role in the regulation of the immune response at the level of lymphocyte locomotion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790168>Prostaglandins as putative neurotoxins in Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammatory reactions in the brain appear to be one of the primary etiological factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is supported by the fact that the secretory products of inflammatory reactions, which include cytokines, complement proteins, adhesion molecules, and free radicals, are neurotoxic. We have recently reported that prostaglandins (PGs), which are also released during inflammatory reactions, cause rapid degenerative changes in differentiated murine neuroblastoma cells (NB) in culture.  is more effective than PGE1. Similar observations were made in a primary culture of fetal rat hippocampal cells. Epidemiological and clinical studies on AD also support the involvement of PGs in neuronal degeneration. Thus, we propose a hypothesis that PGs are one of the major extracellular signals that initiate neuronal degeneration, which is mediated by intracellular signals such as the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and ubiquitin, since the levels of these proteins are increased by PG treatment. We further suggest that adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is one of the factors that regulate the levels of both Abeta and ubiquitin in NB cells. Increases in the level of Abeta in NB cells following an elevation of intracellular cAMP levels appear to be due to an increase in the rate of processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) rather than an increase in the expression of APP. The mechanisms underlying Abeta-induced neuronal degeneration have been under intense investigation, and several mechanisms of action have been proposed. We postulate that PG-induced elevation of Abeta may lead to an increased binding of Abeta to the 20S proteasome, resulting in a reduction of 20S proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. This is predicted to lead to an increase in an accumulation of abnormal proteins, which ultimately contribute to neuronal degeneration and death. Based on our hypothesis and on studies published by others, we propose that a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit the synthesis of PGs, and antioxidant vitamins, which quench free radicals and both of which have been recently reported to be of some value in AD treatment when used-individually, may be much more effective in the prevention and treatment of AD than the individual agents alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11387335>Activation of I kappa b kinase by herpes simplex virus type 1. A novel target for anti-herpetic therapy.</a></h2><p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are ubiquitous pathogens causing a variety of diseases ranging from mild illness to severe life-threatening infections. HSV utilize cellular signaling pathways and transcription factors to promote their replication. Here we report that HSV type 1 (HSV-1) induces persistent activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B, a critical regulator of genes involved in , by activating the I kappa B kinase (IKK) in the early phase of infection. Activated NF-kappa B enhances HSV-1 gene expression. HSV-1-induced NF-kappa B activation is dependent on viral early protein synthesis and is not blocked by the anti-herpetic drug acyclovir. IKK inhibition by the anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandin A(1) blocks HSV-1 gene expression and reduces virus yield by more than 3000-fold. The results identify IKK as a potential target for anti-herpetic drugs and suggest that cyclopentenone prostaglandins or their derivatives could be used in the treatment of HSV infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9761780>Induction of the stress response with  increases I-kappaBalpha gene expression.</a></h2><p>I-kappaBalpha is an intracellular protein that functions as a primary inhibitor of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB. Induction of the stress response with heat shock was previously demonstrated to induce I-kappaBalpha gene expression. Because the stress response can also be induced by nonthermal stimuli, we determined whether induction of the stress response with  () would induce I-kappaBalpha gene expression. Treatment of human bronchial epithelium (BEAS-2B cells) with  induced nuclear translocation of heat shock factor 1, thus confirming that  induces the stress response in BEAS-2B cells. Induction of the stress response with  increased I-kappaBalpha mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner and increased I-kappaBalpha peptide expression. Transient transfection assays involving a human I-kappaBalpha promoter-luciferase reporter construct demonstrated that induction of the stress response with  activated the I-kappaBalpha promoter. Induction of the stress response with  and concomitant induction of I-kappaBalpha were associated with inhibition of TNF-alpha-mediated secretion of interleukin 8 and with inhibition of TNF-alpha-mediated nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kappaB. These data demonstrate that induction of the stress response, by a nonthermal stimulus, increases I-kappaBalpha gene expression by a mechanism involving activation of the I-kappaBalpha promoter. Coupled with previous data demonstrating heat shock-mediated induction of I-kappaBalpha gene expression, these data suggest that I-kappaBalpha may be considered to be one of the stress proteins. The functional consequences of stress response-mediated I-kappaBalpha gene expression may involve attenuation of cellular proinflammatory responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15351720>Proinflammatory effects of pancreatic elastase are mediated through TLR4 and NF-kappaB.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic elastase has been implicated in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis, characterized by systemic inflammatory response, distant organ failure, and high mortality. Here we show that pancreatic elastase activates transcription factors NF-kappaB, AP-1, and NFAT in human myeloid cells (U-937 and THP-1) in culture. Pancreatic elastase also induces TNF-alpha secretion and increased expression of CD11b in THP-1 cells which can be inhibited by neutralizing anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antibodies. NF-kappaB blocking agents (MG-132, ) prevented elastase-induced TNF-alpha secretion from THP-1 cells. Our results suggest that pancreatic elastase-induced proinflammatory effects are mediated by TLR4 and NF-kappaB in human myeloid cells.Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12424231>Electrophilic prostaglandins and lipid aldehydes repress redox-sensitive transcription factors p53 and hypoxia-inducible factor by impairing the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase.</a></h2><p>Tumor suppressor p53 exhibits an enigmatic phenotype in cells exposed to electrophilic, cyclopentenone prostaglandins of the A and J series. Namely, cells harboring a wild-type p53 gene accumulate p53 protein that is conformationally and functionally impaired. This occurs via an unknown molecular mechanism. We report that electrophilic cyclopentenone prostaglandins covalently modify and inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenoprotein that governs p53 and other redox-sensitive transcription factors. This mechanism accounts fully for the unusual p53 phenotype in cells exposed to electrophilic prostaglandins. Based on this mechanism we derived, tested, and affirmed several predictions regarding the kinetics of p53 inactivation; the protective effects of selenium; the structure-activity relationships for inhibition of thioredoxin reductase and impairment of p53 by electrophilic lipids; the susceptibility of hypoxia-inducible factor to inactivation by electrophilic lipids; and the equivalence of chemical inactivation of p53 to deletion of a p53 allele. Chemical precepts dictate that other electrophilic agents should also inhibit thioredoxin reductase and impair its governance of redox-sensitive proteins. Our results provide a novel framework to understand how endogenous and exogenous electrophiles might participate in carcinogenesis; how selenoproteins and selenium might confer protection against cancer; how certain tumors might acquire their paradoxical p53 phenotype; and how chronic  might heighten the risk for cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11129660>TAK1 regulates multiple protein kinase cascades activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide.</a></h2><p>During  the balance between cell activation and cell death is determined by the tight regulation of multiple intracellular enzyme cascades.

However, to date, development of clinically useful inhibitors has been largely unsuccessful. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPGs) are reactive lipid mediators that bind covalently to proteins and exert anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects in numerous settings. By pursuing targets for modification by cyPGs we have found that the cyPG  binds to and inactivates AKR1B1. A -AKR1B1 adduct was observed, both by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and by SDS-PAGE using biotinylated  (-B). Insight into the molecular interactions between AKR1B1 and  was advanced by molecular modeling. This anticipated the addition of  to active site Cys298 and the potential reversibility of the adduct, which was supported experimentally. Indeed, loss of biotin label from the AKR1B1--B adduct was favored by glutathione, indicating a retro-Michael reaction, which unveils new implications of cyPG-protein interaction.  elicited only marginal inhibition of aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), considered responsible for the severe adverse effects of many AKR1B1 inhibitors. Interestingly, other prostaglandins (PGs) inhibited the enzyme, including non-electrophilic PGE1 and PGE2, currently used in clinical practice. Moreover, both  and PGE1 reduced the formation of sorbitol in an ex-vivo model of diabetic cataract to an extent comparable to that attained by the known AKR inhibitor epalrestat. Taken together, these results highlight the role of PGs as AKR1B1 inhibitors and the interest in PG-related molecules as leads for the development of novel pharmacological tools.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14971050>Cyclopentenone prostaglandins induce endothelial cell apoptosis independent of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.</a></h2><p>Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (CP-PG), such as  () or 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), induce apoptosis in different cell types. PGJ2 is also a potent activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). We investigated whether PPARgamma regulates CP-PG-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells (EC). We show that CP-PG induce apoptosis in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC). Incubation with  or PGJ2 for 24 h reduced HUVEC number and viability, while the synthetic activators Wy14643 or rosiglitazone had no effect. Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis revealed externalized phosphatidylserine, caspase-3 activation, and an increased percentage of cells with a reduced DNA content by CP-PG treatment. EMSA demonstrated an activation of PPARgamma by PGJ2 and rosiglitazone. Immunohistochemistry of HUVEC and immunoblot analyses of protein extracts showed that PPARgamma was localized in the nuclei of HUVEC, and that CP-PG treatment decreased the amount of PPARgamma protein. This degradation was prevented by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Treatment of differentiated, endothelial-like PPARgamma-deficient stem cells, or of HUVEC transfected with dominant-negative PPARgamma with CP-PG, induced cell death and apoptosis.

Although the liver serves as the principal site for LTB4 clearance from the systemic circulation, the attributes of hepatic LTB4 metabolism are ill defined in humans. Thus, we examined metabolism of LTB4 to its omega-hydroxylated metabolite 20-hydroxyleukotriene B4 (20-OH LTB4) by human liver microsomes and also purified the hepatic P450 enzyme underlying this reaction. Liver microsomes from 10 different subjects converted LTB4 to 20-OH LTB4 at similar rates (1.06 +/- 0.3 nmol/min/nmol P450; 0.25 +/- 0.1 nmol/min/mg protein). Analysis of the microsomal LTB4 20-hydroxylation reaction revealed kinetic parameters (apparent Km of 74.8 microM with a VMAX of 2.42 nmol/min/nmol P450) consistent with catalysis by a single P450 enzyme. Conventional chromatography combined with immunochemical screening with rat CYP4A1 antibodies was then used to isolate a P450 enzyme from human liver microsomes with a molecular weight of 57,000 and an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence 94% homologous (12Trp --> 12Gly) over the first 17 residues with the human CYP4F2 cDNA-derived sequence. Upon reconstitution with P450 reductase and phospholipid, CYP4F2 converted LTB4 to 20-OH LTB4 at a turnover rate of 392 pmol/min/nmol P450, whereas the other human liver P450s tested, including CYP4A11, exhibited neglible LTB4 omega-hydroxylase activity. Polyclonal antibodies to CYP4F2 were found to markedly inhibit (91.9 +/- 5%; n = 5) LTB4 20-hydroxylation by human liver microsomes. Microsomal 20-OH LTB4 formation was also inhibited 30% by arachidonic acid, a known CYP4F2 substrate, and 50% by  but was unaffected by lauric acid, palmitic acid, and PGF2alpha. Finally, a strong correlation (r = 0.86; P < 0.002; n = 10) was observed between CYP4F2 content and LTB4 20-hydroxylase activity in the human liver samples. Our results indicate that CYP4F2 is the principle LTB4 omega-hydroxylating enzyme expressed in human liver and, as such, may play an important role in regulating circulating as well as hepatic levels of this powerful proinflammatory eicosanoid.Copyright 1998 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17489560>Modification and activation of Ras proteins by electrophilic prostanoids with different structure are site-selective.</a></h2><p>Cyclopentenone prostanoids (cyP) arise as important modulators of  and cell proliferation. Although their physiological significance has not been fully elucidated, their potent biological effects have spurred their study as leads for the development of therapeutic agents. A key determinant of cyP action is their ability to bind to thiol groups in proteins or in glutathione through Michael addition. Even though several protein targets for cyP addition have been identified, little is known about the structural determinants from the protein or the cyP that drive this modification. The results herein presented provide the first evidence that cyP with different structures target distinct thiol sites in a protein molecule, namely, H-Ras. Whereas 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and Delta12-PGJ2 preferentially target the C-terminal region containing cysteines 181 and 184,  and 8-iso- bind mainly to cysteine 118, located in the GTP-binding motif. The biological counterparts of this specificity are the site-selective modification and activation of H-Ras in cells and the differential interaction of cyP with H, N, and K-Ras proteins. Cysteine 184 is unique to H-Ras, whereas cysteine 118 is present in the three Ras homologues. Consistent with this,  binds to and activates H-, N-, and K-Ras, thus differing from the preferential interaction of 15d-PGJ2 with H-Ras.

Because NF-kappa B is critically involved in the activation of immunoregulatory and viral genes, inhibition of its activity could be a major component of the immunosuppressive and antiviral activity of PGs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16272277>Yin-yang: balancing act of prostaglandins with opposing functions to regulate .</a></h2><p>For many years, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a critical enzyme for PG production, has been the favorite target for anti-inflammatory drug development. However, recent revelations regarding the adverse effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors have stimulated intense debate. Interestingly, in the early phase of , COX-2 facilitates inflammatory PG production while in the late phase it has anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, although some PGs are proinflammatory, others have anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, it is likely that PGs with opposing effects maintain homeostasis, although the molecular mechanism(s) remains unclear. We report here that an inflammatory PG, PGD2, via its receptor, mediates the activation of NF-kappaB stimulating COX-2 gene expression. Most interestingly, an anti-inflammatory PG () suppresses NF-kappaB activation and inhibits COX-2 gene expression. We propose that while pro- and anti-inflammatory PGs counteract each other to maintain homeostasis, selective COX-2 inhibitors may disrupt this balance, thereby resulting in reported adverse effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194490>Delta12-Prostaglandin J2 inhibits the ubiquitin hydrolase UCH-L1 and elicits ubiquitin-protein aggregation without proteasome inhibition.</a></h2><p>To investigate molecular mechanisms linking  with neurodegeneration, we treated neuronal cultures with prostaglandins (PGs), which are mediators of . , D2, J2, and Delta12-PGJ2, but not PGE2, reduced the viability and raised the levels of ubiquitinated proteins in the neuronal cells. PGJ2 and its metabolite, Delta12-PGJ2, were the most potent of the four neurotoxic PGs tested in inducing both effects. To address the mechanism by which these agents lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, we tested their effects on neuronal ubiquitin hydrolases UCH-L1 and UCH-L3 as well as on proteasome activity. Notably, Delta12-PGJ2 inhibited the activities of UCH-L1 (K(i) approximately 3.5 microM) and UCH-L3 (K(i) approximately 8.1 microM) without affecting proteasome activity. Intracellular aggregates containing ubiquitinated proteins were detected in Delta12-PGJ2-treated cells, indicating that these aggregates can form independently of proteasome inhibition. In conclusion, impairment of ubiquitin hydrolase activity, such as triggered by Delta12-PGJ2, may be an important contributor to neurodegeneration associated with accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11994490>A proinflammatory role for the cyclopentenone prostaglandins at low micromolar concentrations: oxidative stress-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation without NF-kappa B inhibition.</a></h2><p>An anti-inflammatory role and therapeutic potential for cyclopentenone PGs (cyPGs) has been suggested, based on observations that levels of cyPGs in exudates increase during the resolution phase of , and that exogenous cyPGs may attenuate the inflammatory response in vivo and in vitro mainly through inhibition of NF-kappaB, a critical activator of inflammatory gene expression. However, exogenous cyPGs inhibit NF-kappaB only at concentrations substantially higher than those of endogenous cyPGs present in inflammatory fluids, thus challenging the hypothesis that cyPGs are naturally occurring inhibitors of  and suggesting that cyPGs at low concentrations might have previously unappreciated effects. In this study, using various cell types, we report that cyPGs, when used at concentrations substantially lower than required for NF-kappaB inhibition (viz, low micromolar concentrations), significantly potentiate the inflammatory response to TNF-alpha. At these concentrations, cyPGs induce production of reactive oxygen species, thereby synergizing with TNF-alpha to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, an activation which in turn potentiates proinflammatory cytokine expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Our study establishes a proinflammatory role for cyPGs at low micromolar concentrations, raises the possibility that cyPGs do not act as physiologic anti-inflammatory mediators, and questions the therapeutic potential of these compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28455813>Prostaglandin actions in established insect cell lines.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PGs) are oxygenated metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) and two other C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids that serve as biochemical signals mediating physiological functions. We reported that PGs influence protein expression in insect cell lines, which prompted the question: do PGs influence cell proliferation or viability in insect cell lines? Here, we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to address the question in cell lines from three insect orders: Hemiptera (squash bug, Anasa tristis, BCIRL-AtE-CLG15A), Coleoptera (red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, BCIRL-TcA-CLG1), and Lepidoptera (tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, BCIRL-HvAM1). Treating the insect cell lines with PGA, PGA, or PGD led to dose-dependent reductions in cell numbers. All three cell lines were sensitive to PGA and PGA (ICs = 9.9 to 26.9 μM) and were less sensitive to PGD (ICs = 31.6 to 104.7 μM). PG treatments also led to cell death at higher concentrations, as seen in mammalian cell lines. PGE, PGE, and PGF treatments did not influence AtE-CLG15A or HvAM1 cell numbers at lower concentrations, but led to dose-related reductions in TcA-CLG1 cells at higher concentrations. Similar treatments with pharmaceutical inhibitors of PG biosynthesis also led to reduced cell numbers: MAFP (inhibits phospholipase A), indomethacin (inhibits PG biosynthesis), and esculetin (inhibits lipoxygenase). Because these pharmaceuticals are used to relieve  and other medical issues in human medicine, they are not toxic to animal cells. We infer PGs are necessary in optimal quantities for ongoing homeostatic functions in established cell lines; in quantities outside the optimal concentrations, PGs are deleterious.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1007762>Effects of prostaglandins in canine endotoxin shock.</a></h2><p>Endotoxin shock was produced in healthy, adult mongrel dogs by the intravenous injection of 1.5 mg/kg of E. coli endotoxin.
