Although previous  and  studies demonstrated the therapeutic role of gintonin against Alzheimer's disease, the neuroprotective effects of gintonin in Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown. We investigated whether gintonin (50 and 100 mg/kg/day, p.o., daily for 12 days) had neuroprotective activities against neurotoxicity in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Pre-administration of 100 mg/kg gintonin displayed significantly ameliorating effects in neurological disorders (motor and welfare) as measuring using pole, rotarod, and nest building tests, and in the survival rate. These effects were associated to the reduction of the loss of  hydroxylase-positive neurons, microglial activation, activation of inflammatory mediators (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and cyclooxygenase-2), and alteration of blood-brain  (BBB)  in the substantia nigra pars compacta and/or striatum following MPTP injection. The benefits of gintonin treatment against MPTP also included the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways and the inhibition of phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. Interestingly, these neuroprotective effects of gintonin were blocked by LPAR1/3 antagonist, Ki16425. Overall, the present study shows that gintonin attenuates MPTP-induced neurotoxicity via multiple targets. Gintonin combats neuronal death, and acts as an anti-inflammatory and an anti-oxidant agent. It maintains BBB . LPA receptors play a key role in gintonin-mediated anti-PD mechanisms. Finally, gintonin is a key agent for prevention and/or treatment of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25972355>Increased endothelial cell permeability in endoglin-deficient cells.</a></h1><p>Endoglin (ENG) is a TGF-β superfamily coreceptor essential for vascular endothelium . ENG mutations lead to a vascular dysplasia associated with frequent hemorrhages in multiple organs, whereas ENG null mouse embryos die at midgestation with impaired heart development and leaky vasculature. ENG interacts with several proteins involved in cell adhesion, and we postulated that it regulates vascular permeability. The current study assessed the permeability of ENG homozygous null (Eng(-/-)), heterozygous (Eng(+/-)), and normal (Eng(+/+)) mouse embryonic endothelial cell (EC) lines. Permeability, measured by passage of fluorescent dextran through EC monolayers, was increased 2.9- and 1.7-fold for Eng(-/-) and Eng(+/-) ECs, respectively, compared to control ECs and was not increased by TGF-β1 or VEGF. Prolonged starvation increased Eng(-/-) EC permeability by 3.7-fold with no effect on control ECs; neutrophils transmigrated faster through Eng(-/-) than Eng(+/+) monolayers. Using a pull-down assay, we demonstrate that Ras homolog gene family (Rho) A is constitutively active in Eng(-/-) and Eng(+/-) ECs. We show that the endothelial  destabilizing factor thrombospondin-1 and its receptor-like protein  phosphatase are increased, whereas stabilizing factors VEGF receptor 2, vascular endothelial-cadherin, p21-activated kinase, and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 are decreased in Eng(-/-) cells. Our findings indicate that ENG deficiency leads to EC hyperpermeability through constitutive activation of RhoA and destabilization of endothelial  function.© FASEB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311902>Skin Tolerance of Three Types of Dead Sea Mud on Healthy Skin: A Short-Term Study.</a></h1><p>Dead Sea mud (DSM) is commonly used by patients with various skin conditions because of its contents of healing elements. No study was published to show whether DSM application weakens or strengthens skin  function. In this study, we investigated the impact of 30-minute single application of various types of DSM ("As Is" mud, mud with extra Dead Sea salt, and over-the-shelf mud) on the  function of normal skin. The influence of 30-minute application of various types of DSM was investigated noninvasively on skin  properties of healthy female adult volunteers ( = 75) on predetermined circular areas. Skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema and melanin levels, and skin pH were measured directly, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after mud removal. Thirty-minute single application of DSM was well tolerated with short-lived moisturizing effects, which was enhanced by the presence of humectant ingredients, and with no negative impact on  , pH, and erythema and melanin levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636621>O-(2-[18F]-Fluoroethyl)- (FET) in Neurooncology: A Review of Experimental Results.</a></h1><p>In recent years, PET using radiolabelled amino acids has gained considerable interest as an additional tool besides MRI to improve the diagnosis of cerebral gliomas and brain metastases. A very successful tracer in this field is O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)- (FET) which in recent years has replaced short-lived tracers such as [11C]-methyl-L-methionine in many neuro-oncological centers in Western Europe. FET can be produced with high efficiency and distributed in a satellite concept like 2- [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that FET PET provides important diagnostic information regarding the delineation of cerebral gliomas for therapy planning, an improved differentiation of tumor recurrence from treatment-related changes and sensitive treatment monitoring. In parallel, a considerable number of experimental studies have investigated the uptake mechanisms of FET on the cellular level and the behavior of the tracer in various benign lesions in order to clarify the specificity of FET uptake for tumor tissue. Further studies have explored the effects of treatment related tissue alterations on tracer uptake such as surgery, radiation and drug therapy. Finally, the role of blood-brain   for FET uptake which presents an important aspect for PET tracers targeting neoplastic lesions in the brain has been investigated in several studies. Based on a literature research regarding experimental FET studies and corresponding clinical applications this article summarizes the knowledge on the uptake behavior of FET, which has been collected in more than 30 experimental studies during the last two decades and discusses the role of these results in the clinical context.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29969688>Attenuation of murine acute lung injury by PF-573,228, an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase.</a></h1><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by endothelial  disruption resulting in increased vascular permeability. As focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor protein  kinase, is involved in endothelial cell (EC)  regulation, we hypothesized that FAK inhibition could attenuate agonist-induced EC  disruption relevant to ALI. Human lung EC were pretreated with one of three pharmacologic FAK inhibitors, PF-573,228 (PF-228, 10 μM), PF-562,271 (PF-271, 5 μM) or NVP-TAE226 (TAE226, 5 μM) for 30 min prior to treatment with thrombin (1 U/ml, 30 min). Western blotting confirmed attenuated thrombin-induced FAK phosphorylation associated with all three inhibitors. Subsequently, EC were pretreated with either PF-228 (10 μM), TAE226 (5 μM) or PF-271 (5 μM) for 30 min prior to thrombin stimulation (1 U/ml) followed by measurements of   by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER). Separately, EC grown in transwell inserts prior to thrombin (1 U/ml) with measurements of FITC-dextran flux after 30 min confirmed a significant attenuation of thrombin-induced EC  disruption by PF-228 alone. Finally, in a murine ALI model induced by LPS (1.25 mg/ml, IT), rescue treatment with PF-228 was associated with significantly reduced lung injury. Our findings PF-228, currently being studied in clinical trials, may serve as a novel and effective therapeutic agent for ALI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Previously we found elevated levels of Wnt5A in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Wnt5A is released by activated macrophages but knowledge of its effects in the vascular system remains scant. Here we investigate the response of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) to Wnt5A. We used a genome-wide differential expression approach to define novel targets regulated by Wnt5A. Gene ontology analysis of expression profiles revealed clusters of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling as the predominant targets of Wnt5A. Wnt5A targeted Rho-associated protein serine/threonine kinase (ROCK), leading to phosphorylation of LIM kinase-2 (LIMK2) and inactivation of the actin depolymerization factor cofilin-1 (CFL1). Functional experiments recording cytoskeletal rearrangements in living cells showed that Wnt5A enhanced stress fiber formation as a consequence of reduced actin depolymerization. The antagonist Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) that specifically interferes with the WIF domain of Ryk receptors prevented actin polymerization. Wnt5A disrupted β-catenin and VE-cadherin adherens junctions forming inter-endothelial gaps. Functional experiments targeting the endothelial monolayer  and live recording of trans-endothelial resistance revealed enhanced permeability of Wnt5A-treated HCAEC. Ryk silencing completely prevented Wnt5A-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Wnt5A decreased wound healing capacity of HCAEC monolayers; this was restored by the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Here we show that Wnt5A acts on the vascular endothelium causing enhanced permeability through Ryk interaction and downstream ROCK/LIMK2/CFL1 signaling. Wnt5A/Ryk signaling might provide novel therapeutic strategies to prevent capillary leakage in systemic inflammation and septic shock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28553934>Phenotypic screening identifies Axl kinase as a negative regulator of an alveolar epithelial cell phenotype.</a></h1><p>Loss of epithelial   is implicated in a number of human lung diseases. However, the molecular pathways underlying this process are poorly understood. In a phenotypic screen, we identified Axl kinase as a negative regulator of epithelial phenotype and function. Furthermore, suppression of Axl activity by a small molecule kinase inhibitor or downregulation of Axl expression by small interfering RNA led to: (1) the increase in epithelial surfactant protein expression; (2) a cell morphology transition from front-rear polarity to cuboidal shape; (3) the cytoskeletal re-organization resulting in decreased cell mobility; and (4) the acquisition of epithelial junctions. Loss of Axl activity reduced activation of the Axl canonical pathway members, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 and resulted in the loss of gene expression of a unique profile of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factors including SNAI2, HOXA5, TBX2 or TBX3. Finally, we observed that Axl was activated in hyperplasia of epithelial cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis where epithelial   was lost. These results suggest that the Axl kinase signaling pathway is associated with the loss  of alveolar epithelium in pathological remodeling of human lung diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27391073>Dasatinib-loaded albumin nanoparticles possess diminished endothelial cell  disruption and retain potent anti-leukemia cell activity.</a></h1><p>Dasatinib (DAS), a second-generation  kinase inhibitor, is highly effective in treating chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, its clinical use is limited due to serious adverse effects. DAS can disrupt endothelial   and increase endothelial permeability which may cause peripheral edema and pleural effusion. Albumin nanoparticles (NPs) as a drug carrier may serve as a useful tool for cell-selective drug delivery to reduce DAS-induced endothelial hyperpermeability and maintain endothelial  . In this study, we reported that DAS-loaded NPs exhibited potent anti-leukemia efficacy as DAS alone. Importantly, albumin NPs as a drug carrier markedly reduced DAS-induced endothelial hyperpermeability by restraining the inhibition of Lyn kinase signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Therefore, albumin NPs could be a potential tool to improve anti-leukemia efficacy of DAS through its cell-selective effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579831>KY-226 Protects Blood-brain  Function Through the Akt/FoxO1 Signaling Pathway in Brain Ischemia.</a></h1><p>KY-226 is a protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor that protects neurons from cerebral ischemic injury. KY-226 restores Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) reduction in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of KY-226 are unclear. To address this, the effects of KY-226 on blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction were examined in tMCAO mice. KY-226 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to ICR mice 30 min after 2 h of tMCAO. To assess Akt or ERK involvement, wortmannin (i.c.v.) or U0126 (i.v.), selective inhibitors of PI3K and ERK, respectively, were administered to mice 30 min before ischemia. BBB  was assessed by Evans blue leakage 24 h post-reperfusion. The levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, were measured by western blotting; ZO-1 mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR. Compared to vehicle, KY-226 treatment prevented BBB breakdown and reduction in TJ protein levels. KY-226 treatment restored ZO-1 mRNA levels post-reperfusion. Pre-administration of wortmannin or U0126 blocked the protective effects of KY-226 on ZO-1 protein and mRNA reduction in tMCAO mice. In bEnd.3 cells, lipopolysaccharide treatment reduced mRNA and protein levels of ZO-1, an effect rescued by KY-226 treatment. Further, KY-226 treatment restored phosphorylation of pAkt (T308) and its downstream target forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) (S256) in bEnd.3 cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that KY-226 protects BBB  by restoration of TJ proteins, an effect partly mediated by Akt/FoxO1 pathway activation. Thus, protection of BBB  likely underlies KY-226-induced neuroprotection in tMCAO mice.Copyright © 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Themis(I23N) homozygous mice show reduced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte numbers. ECM resistance in P. berghei ANKA-infected Themis(I23N) mice is associated with decreased cerebral cellular infiltration, retention of blood-brain  , and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production. THEMIS(I23N) protein expression is absent from mutant mice, concurrent with the decreased THEMIS(I23N) stability observed in vitro. Biochemical studies in vitro and functional complementation in vivo in Themis(I23N/+):Lck(-/+) doubly heterozygous mice demonstrate that functional coupling of THEMIS to LCK  kinase is required for ECM pathogenesis. Damping of proinflammatory responses in Themis(I23N) mice causes susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, THEMIS is required for the development and ultimately the function of proinflammatory T cells. Themis(I23N) mice can be used to study the newly discovered association of THEMIS (6p22.33) with inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

We investigated the contribution of protein  phosphatase Shp2 to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced renal injury. We report increased Shp2 expression in murine kidneys and cultured podocytes following an LPS challenge. To determine the role of podocyte Shp2 in vivo, we generated podocyte-specific Shp2 knockout (pod-Shp2 KO) mice. Following administration of LPS, pod-Shp2 KO mice exhibited lower proteinuria and blood urea nitrogen concentrations than controls indicative of preserved filter . In addition, renal mRNA and serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, INFγ and IL-12 p70 were significantly decreased in LPS-treated knockout mice compared with controls. Moreover, the protective effects of podocyte Shp2 deficiency were associated with decreased LPS-induced NF-κB and MAPK activation, nephrin phosphorylation and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress. These effects were recapitulated in differentiated E11 murine podocytes with lentiviral-mediated Shp2 knockdown. Furthermore, Shp2 deficient podocytes displayed reduced LPS-induced migration in a wound healing assay. These findings identify Shp2 in podocytes as a significant contributor to the signaling events following LPS challenge and suggest that inhibition of Shp2 in podocytes may present a potential therapeutic target for podocytopathies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28104888>Root diffusion  control by a vasculature-derived peptide binding to the SGN3 receptor.</a></h1><p>The root endodermis forms its extracellular diffusion  by developing ringlike impregnations called Casparian strips. A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes discontinuous Casparian strips. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian strip mutants. Yet, without ligand, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that schengen2 (sgn2) is defective in an enzyme sulfating peptide ligands. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed peptides (CASPARIAN STRIP  FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement sgn2 at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian strip mislocalization as well as overlignification-all of which depend on SGN3. Direct peptide binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these peptides as SGN3 ligands. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a  surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian strip network.Copyright © 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26749528>Platelet immunoreceptor -based activation motif (ITAM) and hemITAM signaling and vascular  in inflammation and development.</a></h1><p>Platelets are essential for maintaining hemostasis following mechanical injury to the vasculature. Besides this established function, novel roles of platelets are becoming increasingly recognized, which are critical in non-injury settings to maintain vascular  . For example, during embryogenesis platelets act to support the proper separation of blood and lymphatic vessels. This role continues beyond birth, where platelets prevent leakage of blood into the lymphatic vessel network. During the course of inflammation, platelets are necessary to prevent local hemorrhage due to neutrophil diapedesis and disruption of endothelial cell-cell junctions. Surprisingly, platelets also work to secure tumor-associated blood vessels, inhibiting excessive vessel permeability and intra-tumor hemorrhaging. Interestingly, many of these novel platelet functions depend on immunoreceptor -based activation motif (ITAM) signaling but not on signaling via G protein-coupled receptors, which plays a crucial role in platelet plug formation at sites of mechanical injury. Murine platelets express two ITAM-containing receptors: the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), which functionally associates with the collagen receptor GPVI, and the C-type lectin-like 2 (CLEC-2) receptor, a hemITAM receptor for the mucin-type glycoprotein podoplanin. Human platelets express an additional ITAM receptor, FcγRIIA. These receptors share common downstream effectors, including Syk, SLP-76 and PLCγ2. Here we will review the recent literature that highlights a critical role for platelet GPVI/FcRγ and CLEC-2 in vascular  during development and inflammation in mice and discuss the relevance to human disease.© 2016 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375482>Soft TCPTP Agonism-Novel Target to Rescue Airway Epithelial  by Exogenous Spermidine.</a></h1><p>A reparative approach of disrupted epithelium in obstructive airway diseases, namely asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may afford protection and long-lasting results compared to conventional therapies, e.g., corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs. Here, we propose the polyamine spermidine as a novel therapeutic agent in airways diseases, based on a recently identified mode of action: T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) agonism. It may include and surpass single-inhibitors of stress and secondary growth factor pathway signaling, i.e., the new medicinal chemistry in lung diseases. Enhanced polyamine biosynthesis has been charged with aggravating prognosis by competing for L-arginine at detriment of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with bronchoconstrictive effects. Although excess spermine, a higher polyamine, is harmful to airways physiology, spermidine can pivot the cell homeostasis during stress conditions by the activation of TCPTP. In fact, the dephosphorylating activity of TCPTP inhibits the signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in detachment and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increases the expression of adhesion and tight junction proteins, thereby enhancing the  functionality in inflammation-prone tissues. Moreover, a further beneficial effect of spermidine may derive from its ability to promote autophagy, possibly in a TCPTP-dependent way. Since doses of spermidine in the micromolar range are sufficient to activate TCPTP, low amounts of spermidine administered in sustained release modality may provide an optimal pharmacologic profile for the treatment of obstructive airway diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28008255>Rescuing cholinergic neurons from apoptotic degeneration by targeting of serotonin modulator-and apolipoprotein E-conjugated liposomes to the hippocampus.</a></h1><p>β-Amyloid (Aβ)-targeting liposomes (LIP) with surface serotonin modulator (SM) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) were utilized to facilitate the delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) across the blood-brain  (BBB) for neuroprotection in the hippocampus. The therapeutic efficacy of SM- and ApoE-grafted LIP carrying NGF (NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP) was assessed by an in vitro Alzheimer's disease (AD) model of degenerated SK-N-MC cells and an in vivo AD model of Aβ-insulted Wistar rats. The experimental evidences revealed that the modified SM and ApoE on the surface of LIP increased the permeation of NGF across the BBB without serious damage to structural  of tight junction. When compared with free NGF, NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP upregulated the expression of phosphorylated neurotrophic  kinase receptor type 1 on cholinergic neurons and significantly improved their survival. In addition, NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP could reduce the secretion of acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde and rescue hippocampal neurons from apoptosis in rat brains. The synergistic effect of SM and ApoE is promising in the induction of NGF to inhibit the neurotoxicity of Aβ and NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP can be a potent antiapoptotic pharmacotherapy for clinical care of patients with AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25884837>Pericytes contribute to the disruption of the cerebral endothelial  via increasing VEGF expression: implications for stroke.</a></h1><p>Disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB)  occurring during the early onset of stroke is not only a consequence of, but also contributes to the further progression of stroke. Although it has been well documented that brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes play a critical role in the maintenance of BBB , pericytes, sandwiched between endothelial cells and astrocytes, remain poorly studied in the pathogenesis of stroke. Our findings demonstrated that treatment of human brain microvascular pericytes with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and glucose deprivation resulted in increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via the activation of  kinase Src, with downstream activation of mitogen activated protein kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways and subsequent translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. Conditioned medium from NaCN-treated pericytes led to increased permeability of endothelial cells, and this effect was significantly inhibited by VEGF-neutralizing antibody. The in vivo relevance of these findings was further corroborated in the stroke model of mice wherein the mice, demonstrated disruption of the BBB  and concomitant increase in the expression of VEGF in the brain tissue as well as in the isolated microvessel. These findings thus suggest the role of pericyte-derived VEGF in modulating increased permeability of BBB during stroke. Understanding the regulation of VEGF expression could open new avenues for the development of potential therapeutic targets for stroke and other neurological disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26884340>Activation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Receptor 2 Mediates Endothelial Permeability Caused by Cyclic Stretch.</a></h1><p>High tidal volume mechanical ventilation and the resultant excessive mechanical forces experienced by lung vascular endothelium are known to lead to increased vascular endothelial leak, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. One reported mechanotransduction pathway of increased endothelial cell (EC) permeability caused by high magnitude cyclic stretch (18% CS) involves CS-induced activation of the focal adhesion associated signalosome, which triggers Rho GTPase signaling. This study identified an alternative pathway of CS-induced EC permeability. We show here that high magnitude cyclic stretch (18% CS) rapidly activates VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling by dissociating VEGFR2 from VE-cadherin at the cell junctions. This results in VEGFR2 activation, Src-dependent VE-cadherin  phosphorylation, and internalization leading to increased endothelial permeability. This process is also accompanied by CS-induced phosphorylation and internalization of PECAM1. Importantly, CS-induced endothelial  disruption was attenuated by VEGFR2 inhibition. 18% CS-induced EC permeability was linked to dissociation of cell junction scaffold afadin from the adherens junctions. Forced expression of recombinant afadin in pulmonary endothelium attenuated CS-induced VEGFR2 and VE-cadherin phosphorylation, preserved adherens junction  and VEGFR2·VE-cadherin complex, and suppressed CS-induced EC permeability. This study shows for the first time a mechanism whereby VEGFR2 activation mediates EC permeability induced by pathologically relevant cyclic stretch. In this mechanism, CS induces dissociation of the VE-cadherin·VEGFR2 complex localized at the adherens juctions, causing activation of VEGFR2, VEGFR2-mediated Src-dependent phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, disassembly of adherens junctions, and EC  failure.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382767>Early disruption of the alveolar-capillary  in a ricin-induced ARDS mouse model: neutrophil-dependent and -independent impairment of junction proteins.</a></h1><p>Irrespective of its diverse etiologies, acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary , which in turn promotes edema formation and respiratory failure. We investigated the mechanism of ALI/ARDS lung hyperpermeability triggered by pulmonary exposure of mice to the highly toxic plant-derived toxin ricin. One prominent hallmark of ricin-mediated pulmonary intoxication is the rapid and massive influx of neutrophils to the lungs, where they contribute to the developing inflammation yet may also cause tissue damage, thereby promoting ricin-mediated morbidity. Here we show that pulmonary exposure of mice to ricin results in the rapid diminution of the junction proteins VE-cadherin, claudin 5, and connexin 43, belonging, respectively, to the adherens, tight, and gap junction protein families. Depletion of neutrophils in ricin-intoxicated mice attenuated the damage caused to these junction proteins, alleviated pulmonary edema, and significantly postponed the time to death of the intoxicated mice. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity recapitulated the response to neutrophil depletion observed in ricin-intoxicated mice and was associated with decreased insult to the junction proteins and alveolar-capillary . However, neutrophil-mediated MMP activity was not the sole mechanism responsible for pulmonary hyperpermeability, as exemplified by the ricin-mediated disruption of claudin 18, via a neutrophil-independent mechanism involving  phosphorylation. This in-depth study of the early stage mechanisms governing pulmonary tissue  during ALI/ARDS is expected to facilitate the tailoring of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269821>Inhibition of Src phosphorylation reduces damage to the blood-brain  following transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats.</a></h1><p>The disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) caused by cerebral ischemia determines the extent of injury and patient prognosis. Inhibitors of Src can markedly minimize the infarct size and preserve neurological function. The Src protein  kinase (PTK) inhibitor, PP2, protects the rat brain against ischemic injury, possibly through the reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression and the upregulation of claudin-5 expression, which preserves the  of the BBB. In this study, the expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-Src, VEGFA and claudin-5 were determined to investigate the changes occurring in the levels of these proteins and to determine the benefits of PP2 treatment following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Our study included a sham-operated group, an I/R group, a vehicle-treated group (V) and a PP2-treated group (PP2). We found that the rats in the PP2 group exhibited greater preservation of neurological function and reduced VEGFA and p-Src protein expression compared with the rats in the I/R and V groups. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of claudin-5 were markedly higher in the PP2 group than in the I/R group or the V group after 3 days of reperfusion. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the co-localized immunostaining of fibrinogen and claudin-5 was reduced in the PP2 group, which suggests that the exudation of fibrinogen in this group was less than that in the I/R and V groups. Furthermore, the reduced co-localization of immunostaining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and claudin-5 indicated that the rats in the PP2 group had only a slight disruption of the BBB. These findings suggested that PP2 treatment attenuated the disruption of the BBB following ischemia and minimized the neurological deficit; these effects were associated with a decreased VEGFA expression and an increased claudin-5 expression. Members of the Src PTK family may be critical targets for the protection of the BBB following cerebral ischemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27079772>Endothelial PECAM-1 and its function in vascular physiology and atherogenic pathology.</a></h1><p>Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) is highly expressed in vascular cells such as endothelial cells (ECs) and blood-borne cells like platelets and leukocytes. In ECs, this molecule controls junctional and adhesive properties. In physiological conditions, PECAM-1 supports the endothelial  function. In inflammation that is observed in vessels affected by atherosclerosis, the function of PECAM-1 is impaired, an event that leads to increased adhesion of neutrophils and other leukocytes to ECs, decreased vascular , and higher leukocyte transmigration to the intima media. PECAM-1 has six extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains that support attraction and adhesion of leukocytes to ECs. The cytoplasmic tail of PECAM-1 contains two  residues (Tyr-663 and Tyr-686) that could be phosphorylated by Src family protein kinases is involved in the intracellular signaling. Actually, those tyrosines are the part of the immunoreceptor -based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) that inhibit inflammation. However, in atherosclerosis, the PECAM-1-dependent immune suppression is disturbed. This in turn facilitates recruitment of leukocytes and supports proatherogenic inflammation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Primary outcome was any adverse event; secondary outcomes were haemorrhagic transformation, cerebral oedema, neurological severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 7 days and at 3 months and functional outcomes on the modified Rankin scale (mRS).Four serious adverse events were reported, which resulted in three deaths (one in the control group and two in the 400-mg dose group; one patient in the latter group did not receive active treatment and the other received two doses). Nonserious adverse events were mostly mild, resulting in full recovery. Imatinib ameliorated neurological outcomes with an improvement of 0.6 NIHSS points per 100 mg imatinib (P = 0.02). For the 800-mg group, the mean unadjusted and adjusted NIHSS improvements were 4 (P = 0.037) and 5 points (P = 0.012), respectively, versus controls. Functional independence (mRS 0-2) increased by 18% versus controls (61 vs. 79; P = 0.296).This phase II study showed that imatinib is safe and tolerable and may reduce neurological disability in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis after ischaemic stroke. A confirmatory randomized trial is currently underway.© 2016 The Authors.

Leukocytes can change in response to environmental changes in anurans, making them an important biomarker of stressful situations. The initial  against UV in ectothermic animals is melanin-containing cells in skin and in their internal organs. Here, we tested the effects of UV exposure on immune cells and DNA integrity in pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles of Lithobates catesbeianus. We used an inflammation model with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli to test synergic effects of UV and LPS. We tested the following hypotheses: 1) DNA damage caused by UV will be more pronounced in non-pigmented than in pigmented animals; 2) LPS increases leukocytes in both pigmented and non-pigmented animals by systemic inflammation; 3) The combined LPS and UV exposure will decrease the number of leukocytes. We found that the frequency of immune cells differed between pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles. UV exposure increased mast cells and DNA damage in erythrocytes in both pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles, while leukocytes decreased after UV exposure. Non-pigmented tadpoles experienced DNA damage and a lower lymphocyte count earlier than pigmented tadpoles. UV altered immune cells likely as a consequence of local and systemic inflammation. These alterations were less severe in pigmented than in non-pigmented animals. UV and LPS increased internal melanin in pigmented tadpoles, which were correlated with DNA damage and leukocytes. Here, we described for the first time the effects of UV and LPS in immune cells of pigmented and non-pigmented tadpoles. In addition, we demonstrated that internal melanin in tadpoles help in these defenses, since leukocyte responses were faster in non-pigmented animals, supporting the hypothesis that melanin is involved in the initial innate immune response.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) is a context-dependent regulator of vascular leakage that signals via both endothelial TEK receptor  kinase (TIE2) and integrins. Here, we show that antibodies against β1-integrin decrease LPS-induced vascular leakage in murine endotoxemia, as either a preventative or an intervention therapy. β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies bound to the vascular endothelium in vivo improved the  of endothelial cell-cell junctions and protected mice from endotoxemia-associated cardiac failure, without affecting endothelial inflammation, serum proinflammatory cytokine levels, or TIE receptor signaling. Moreover, conditional deletion of a single allele of endothelial β1-integrin protected mice from LPS-induced vascular leakage. In endothelial monolayers, the inflammatory agents thrombin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IL-1β decreased junctional vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and induced actin stress fibers via β1- and α5-integrins and ANGPT2. Additionally, β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies prevented inflammation-induced endothelial cell contractility and monolayer permeability. Mechanistically, the inflammatory agents stimulated ANGPT2-dependent translocation of α5β1-integrin into tensin-1-positive fibrillar adhesions, which destabilized the endothelial monolayer. Thus, β1-integrin promotes endothelial  disruption during inflammation, and targeting β1-integrin signaling could serve as a novel means of blocking pathological vascular leak.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Symptoms of Parkinson's disease might not arise until more than 50% of the substantia nigra pars compacta is lost and the dopamine content in the basal ganglia is reduced by more than 80%. Greater diagnostic sensitivity and specificity would allow earlier detection of Parkinson's disease. Diffusion tensor imaging is a recently developed magnetic resonance imaging technique that measures mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, and responds to changes in brain microstructure. When the microscopic  (including cell membranes, microtubules and other structures that interfere with the free diffusion of water) is destroyed and extracellular fluid volume accumulates, the mean diffusivity value increases; when the  of the microstructure (such as myelin) is destroyed, fractional anisotropy value decreases. However, there is no consensus as to whether these changes can reflect the early pathological alterations in Parkinson's disease. Here, we established a rat model of Parkinson's disease by injecting rotenone (or sunflower oil in controls) into the right substantia nigra. Diffusion tensor imaging results revealed that in the stages of disease, at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after rotenone injection, fractional anisotropy value decreased, but mean diffusivity values increased in the right substantia nigra in the experimental group. Fractional anisotropy values were lower at 4 weeks than at 6 weeks in the right substantia nigra of rats from the experimental group. Mean diffusivity values were markedly greater at 1 week than at 6 weeks in the right corpus striatum of rats from the experimental group. These findings suggest that mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values in the brain of rat models of Parkinson's disease 4 weeks after model establishment can reflect early degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The change in fractional anisotropy values after destruction of myelin  is likely to be of greater early diagnostic significance than the change in mean diffusivity values.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27630207>Gas6 Promotes Oligodendrogenesis and Myelination in the Adult Central Nervous System and After Lysolecithin-Induced Demyelination.</a></h1><p>A key aim of therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) is to promote the regeneration of oligodendrocytes and remyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). The present study provides evidence that the vitamin K-dependent protein growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6) promotes such repair in in vitro cultures of mouse optic nerve and cerebellum. We first determined expression of Gas6 and TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptors in the mouse CNS, with all three TAM receptors increasing in expression through postnatal development, reaching maximal levels in the adult. Treatment of cultured mouse optic nerves with Gas6 resulted in significant increases in oligodendrocyte numbers as well as expression of myelin basic protein (MBP). Gas6 stimulation also resulted in activation of STAT3 in optic nerves as well as downregulation of multiple genes involved in MS development, including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), which may decrease the  of the blood-brain  and is found upregulated in MS lesions. The cytoprotective effects of Gas6 were examined in in vitro mouse cerebellar slice cultures, where lysolecithin was used to induce demyelination. Cotreatment of cerebellar slices with Gas6 significantly attenuated demyelination as determined by MBP immunostaining, and Gas6 activated Tyro3 receptor through its phosphorylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that Gas6/TAM signaling stimulates the generation of oligodendrocytes and increased myelin production via Tyro3 receptor in the adult CNS, including repair after demyelinating injury. Furthermore, the effects of Gas6 on STAT3 signaling and matrix MMP9 downregulation indicate potential glial cell repair and immunoregulatory roles for Gas6, indicating that Gas6-TAM signaling could be a potential therapeutic target in MS and other neuropathologies.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26403789>Factors controlling permeability of the blood-brain .</a></h1><p>As the primary protective  for neurons in the brain, the blood-brain  (BBB) exists between the blood microcirculation system and the brain parenchyma. The normal BBB  is essential in protecting the brain from systemic toxins and maintaining the necessary level of nutrients and ions for neuronal function. This  is mediated by structural BBB components, such as tight junction proteins, integrins, annexins, and agrin, of a multicellular system including endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, etc. BBB dysfunction is a significant contributor to the pathogeneses of a variety of brain disorders. Many signaling factors have been identified to be able to control BBB permeability through regulating the structural components. Among those signaling factors are inflammatory mediators, free radicals, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases, microRNAs, etc. In this review, we provide a summary of recent progress regarding these structural components and signaling factors, relating to their roles in various brain disorders. Attention is also devoted to recent research regarding impact of pharmacological agents such as isoflurane on BBB permeability and how iron ion passes across BBB. Hopefully, a better understanding of the factors controlling BBB permeability helps develop novel pharmacological interventions of BBB hyperpermeability under pathological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087588>ErbB4 Preserves Blood-Brain   via the YAP/PIK3CB Pathway After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats.</a></h1><p>Studies have suggested that blood-brain  (BBB) disruption contributes to the pathogenesis of early brain injury after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Activation of the receptor  kinase ErbB4 can cause intramembrane proteolysis and release a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that modulates transcription in the nucleus. This study was carried out to investigate the potential roles of ErbB4 in preserving BBB  after experimental SAH, as well as the underlying mechanisms of its protective effects. Endovascular perforation was used to prepare a rat SAH model. The SAH grade, neurological score, brain edema and BBB permeability were evaluated after surgery. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the localization of ErbB4 and yes-associated protein (YAP). ErbB4 activator Nrg1 isoform β1 (Nrg1β1), Specific ErbB4 siRNA, YAP siRNA and PIK3CB specific inhibitor TGX 221 were used to manipulate the proposed pathway. The expression levels of ErbB4 ICD and YAP were markly increased after SAH. Double immunohistochemistry labeling showed that ErbB4 and YAP were expressed in endothelial cells and neurons. Activation of ErbB4 by Nrg1β1 (dosage 150 ng/kg) treatment promoted the neurobehavioral deficit, alleviated the brain water content and reduced albumin leakage 24 and 72 h after SAH. ErbB4 activation significantly promoted YAP and PIK3CB activity and increased the expression of tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-5. Depletion of ErbB4 aggravated neurological impairment and BBB disruption after SAH. The beneficial effects of ErbB4 activation were abolished by YAP small-interfering RNA and specific PIK3CB inhibitor. Activation of ErbB4 improved neurological performance after SAH through the YAP/PIK3CB signaling pathway, this neuroprotective effects may associated with BBB maintenance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102569>Matrix stiffness regulates vascular  through focal adhesion kinase activity.</a></h1><p>Tumor vasculature is known to be more permeable than the vasculature found in healthy tissue, which in turn can lead to a more aggressive tumor phenotype and impair drug delivery into tumors. While the stiffening of the stroma surrounding solid tumors has been reported to increase vascular permeability, the mechanism of this process remains unclear. Here, we utilize an in vitro model of tumor stiffening, ex ovo culture, and a mouse model to investigate the molecular mechanism by which matrix stiffening alters endothelial  function. Our data indicate that the increased endothelial permeability caused by heightened matrix stiffness can be prevented by pharmaceutical inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) both in vitro and ex ovo. Matrix stiffness-mediated FAK activation determines Src localization to cell-cell junctions, which then induces increased vascular endothelial cadherin phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial cells in stiff tumors have more activated Src and higher levels of phosphorylated vascular endothelial cadherin at adherens junctions compared to endothelial cells in more compliant tumors. Altogether, our data indicate that matrix stiffness regulates endothelial   through FAK activity, providing one mechanism by which extracellular matrix stiffness regulates endothelial  function. Additionally, our work also provides further evidence that FAK is a promising potential target for cancer therapy because FAK plays a critical role in the regulation of endothelial  .-Wang, W., Lollis, E.

In the present study, we developed a biologic nanomedicine containing a cationic antimicrobial decapeptide KSLW (KKVVFWVKFK), self-associated with biocompatible and biodegradable PEGylated phospholipid micelles (PLM), and analyzed its efficacy for treating sepsis. KSLW was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-aldehyde or was conjugated with distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) -PEG-aldehyde. We compared the antibacterial and antiseptic effects of PEG-KSLW and PLM-KSLW with those of unmodified KSLW both  and . We found that the PLM-KSLW improved the survival rate of sepsis mouse models without undesired immune responses, and inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced severe vascular inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells compared with unmodified KSLW or PEG-KSLW. Furthermore, PLM-KSLW dramatically reduced the bacterial count and inhibited bacterial growth. We also found a new role of PLM-KSLW in tightening vascular  integrity by binding to the glycine/-rich domain of occludin (OCLN). Our results showed that PLM-KSLW had a more effective antiseptic effect than KSLW or PEG-KSLW, possibly because of its high affinity toward OCLN.

This study was carried out to investigate the potential roles of exogenous NTN-1 in preserving BBB  after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as well as the underlying mechanisms of its protective effects.A total of 309 male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an endovascular perforation model of SAH. Recombinant NTN-1 was administered intravenously 1 hour after SAH induction. NTN-1 small interfering RNA or Deleted in Colorectal Cancer small interfering RNA was administered intracerebroventricular at 48 hours before SAH. Focal adhesion kinase inhibitor was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 1 hour prior to SAH. Neurological scores, brain water content, BBB permeability, RhoA activity, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining were evaluated. The expression of endogenous NTN-1 and its receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer were increased after SAH. Administration of exogenous NTN-1 significantly reduced brain water content and BBB permeability and ameliorated neurological deficits at 24 and 72 hours after SAH. Exogenous NTN-1 treatment significantly promoted phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase activation and inhibited RhoA activity, as well as upregulated the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin. Conversely, depletion of endogenous NTN-1 aggravated BBB breakdown and neurological impairments at 24 hours after SAH. The protective effects of NTN-1 at 24 hours after SAH were also abolished by pretreatment with Deleted in Colorectal Cancer small interfering RNA and focal adhesion kinase inhibitor.NTN-1 treatment preserved BBB  and improved neurological functions through a Deleted in Colorectal Cancer/focal adhesion kinase/RhoA signaling pathway after SAH. Thus, NTN-1 may serve as a promising treatment to alleviate early brain injury following SAH.© 2017 The Authors.

This event leads to increased susceptibility of several encephalic structures to potential neurotoxicants present in the bloodstream. In this study, we investigated the effects of alternate intraperitoneal injections of LPS on BBB permeability, social recognition memory and biochemical parameters in the striatum 24 h and 60 days after treatments. In addition, we investigated whether the exposure to a moderate neurotoxic dose of the herbicide paraquat could potentiate LPS-induced neurotoxicity. LPS administration caused a transient disruption of BBB integrity, evidenced by increased levels of exogenously administered sodium fluorescein in the striatum. Also, LPS exposure caused delayed impairment in social recognition memory (evaluated at day 38 after treatments) and increase in the striatal levels of 3-nitrotyrosine. These events were observed in the absence of significant changes in motor coordination and in the levels of  hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum and substantia nigra. PQ exposure, which caused a long-lasting decrease of striatal mitochondrial complex I activity, did not modify LPS-induced behavioral and striatal biochemical changes. The results indicate that systemic administration of LPS causes delayed social recognition memory deficit and striatal nitrosative stress in adult mice and that the coexposure to a moderately toxic dose of PQ did not magnify these events. In addition, PQ-induced inhibition of striatal mitochondrial complex I was also not magnified by LPS exposure, indicating the absence of synergic neurotoxic effects of LPS and PQ in this experimental model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27125875>Endothelial lipid phosphate phosphatase-3 deficiency that disrupts the endothelial  function is a modifier of cardiovascular development.</a></h1><p>Lipid phosphate phosphatase-3 (LPP3) is expressed at high levels in endothelial cells (ECs). Although LPP3 is known to hydrolyse the phosphate group from lysolipids such as spingosine-1-phosphate and its structural homologues, the function of Lpp3 in ECs is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated how -protein kinase receptor (TEK or Tie2) promoter-dependent deletion of Lpp3 alters EC activities.Lpp3(fl/fl) mice were crossed with the tg.Tie2(Cre) transgenic line. Vasculogenesis occurred normally in embryos with Tie2(Cre)-mediated deletion of Lpp3 (called Lpp3(ECKO)), but embryonic lethality occurred in two waves, the first wave between E8.5 and E10.5, while the second between E11.5 and E13.5. Lethality in Lpp3(ECKO) embryos after E11.5 was accompanied by vascular leakage and haemorrhage, which likely resulted in insufficient cardiovascular development. Analyses of haematoxylin- and eosin-stained heart sections from E11.5 Lpp3(ECKO) embryos showed insufficient heart growth associated with decreased trabeculation, reduced growth of the compact wall, and absence of cardiac cushions. Staining followed by microscopic analyses of Lpp3(ECKO) embryos revealed the presence of apoptotic ECs. Furthermore, Lpp3-deficient ECs showed decreased gene expression and protein levels of Cyclin-D1, VE-cadherin, Fibronectin, Klf2, and Klf4. To determine the underlying mechanisms of vascular leakage and  disruption, we performed knockdown and rescue experiments in cultured ECs. LPP3 knockdown decreased transendothelial electrical resistance and increased permeability. Re-expression of β-catenin cDNA in LPP3-knockdown ECs partially restored the effect of the LPP3 loss, whereas re-expression of p120ctn cDNA did not.These findings demonstrate the essential roles of LPP3 in the maturation of EC   and normal cardiovascular development.© The Author 2016.

Vascular leak occurs in response to wide-spread inflammatory processes, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, because of the formation of gaps between endothelial cells. Although these disorders are leading causes of mortality in the intensive care unit, no medical therapies exist to restore endothelial cell  function. Recent evidence highlights a key role for the Abl family of nonreceptor  kinases in regulating vascular  . These kinases have well-described roles in cancer progression and neuronal morphogenesis, but their functions in the vasculature have remained enigmatic until recently. The Abl family kinases, c-Abl (Abl1) and Abl related gene (Arg, Abl2), phosphorylate several cytoskeletal effectors that mediate vascular permeability, including nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase, cortactin, vinculin, and β-catenin. They also regulate cell-cell and cell-matrix junction dynamics, and the formation of actin-based cellular protrusions in multiple cell types. In addition, both c-Abl and Arg are activated by hyperoxia and contribute to oxidant-induced endothelial cell injury. These numerous roles of Abl kinases in endothelial cells and the current clinical usage of imatinib and other Abl kinase inhibitors have spurred recent interest in repurposing these drugs for the treatment of vascular  dysfunction. This review will describe the structure and function of Abl kinases with an emphasis on their roles in mediating vascular  . We will also provide a critical evaluation of the potential for exploiting Abl kinase inhibition as a novel therapy for inflammatory vascular leak syndromes.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928160>Quantitative and Mechanistic Understanding of AZD1775 Penetration across Human Blood-Brain  in Glioblastoma Patients Using an IVIVE-PBPK Modeling Approach.</a></h1><p> AZD1775, a first-in-class, small-molecule inhibitor of the Wee1  kinase, is under evaluation as a potential chemo- and radiosensitizer for treating glioblastoma. This study was to prospectively, quantitatively, and mechanistically investigate the penetration of AZD1775 across the human blood-brain  (BBB). AZD1775 plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 20 patients with glioblastoma. The drug metabolism, transcellular passive permeability, and interactions with efflux and uptake transporters were determined using human derived  systems. A whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model integrated with a four-compartment permeability-limited brain model was developed for predicting the kinetics of AZD1775 BBB penetration and assessing the factors modulating this process. AZD1775 exhibited good tumor penetration in patients with glioblastoma, with the unbound tumor-to-plasma concentration ratio ranging from 1.3 to 24.4 (median, 3.2). It was a substrate for ABCB1, ABCG2, and OATP1A2, but not for OATP2B1 or OAT3. AZD1775 transcellular passive permeability and active efflux clearance across MDCKII-ABCB1 or MDCKII-ABCG2 cell monolayers were dependent on the basolateral pH. The PBPK model well predicted observed drug plasma and tumor concentrations in patients. The extent and rate of drug BBB penetration were influenced by BBB integrity, efflux and uptake active transporter activity, and drug binding to brain tissue. In the relatively acidic tumor microenvironment where ABCB1/ABCG2 transporter-mediated efflux clearance is reduced, OATP1A2-mediated active uptake becomes dominant, driving AZD1775 penetration into brain tumor. Variations in the brain tumor regional pH, transporter expression/activity, and BBB integrity collectively contribute to the heterogeneity of AZD1775 penetration into brain tumors. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28158602>Plakoglobin maintains the  of vascular endothelial cell junctions and regulates VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VE-cadherin.</a></h1><p>Plakoglobin, also known as γ-catenin, is a close homolog of β-catenin and interacts with shared protein partners. Functions of β-catenin in cell adhesion are well-documented in terms of maintaining endothelial  function by interacting with vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Plakoglobin also interacts with VE-cadherin, but its function in cell adhesion is not well understood. Here, we investigated plakoglobin function in vascular endothelial cell (ECs)-cell junction . Knock-down of plakoglobin expression in ECs did not prevent cell proliferation or cell migration, but induced destabilization of the membrane distribution of VE-cadherin and resulted in increased permeability. Plakoglobin contributes to VE-cadherin-dependent adhesion in the steady state, but on stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), it is essential for inducing sufficient VE-cadherin phosphorylation on VEGF signaling, thereby destabilizing cell-cell junctions. Furthermore, knock-down of plakoglobin expression increased vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase activity, an endothelial-specific membrane protein associating with VE-cadherin. These results indicate that plakoglobin plays multiple roles in regulation of cell-cell adhesion in a context dependent manner.© The Authors 2017.

However, CNS delivery of GDNF is restricted by the blood-brain  (BBB). Using total body irradiation as transplant preconditioning, we previously reported that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT)-based macrophage-mediated gene therapy could deliver GDNF to the brain to prevent degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons in an acute murine neurotoxicity model. Here, we validate this therapeutic approach in a chronic progressive PD model - the MitoPark mouse, with head shielding to avoid inducing neuroinflammation and compromising BBB . Bone marrow HSCs were transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector expressing macrophage promoter-driven GDNF and transplanted into MitoPark mice exhibiting well developed PD-like impairments. Transgene-expressing macrophages infiltrated the midbrains of MitoPark mice, but not normal littermates, and delivered GDNF locally. Macrophage GDNF delivery markedly improved both motor and non-motor symptoms, and dramatically mitigated the loss of both DA neurons in the substantia nigra and  hydroxylase-positive axonal terminals in the striatum. Our data support further development of this HSCT-based macrophage-mediated GDNF delivery approach in order to address the unmet need for a disease-modifying therapy for PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320600>Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 mediates trauma-induced intestinal injury and multi-organ failure.</a></h1><p>Dysregulated intestinal epithelial apoptosis initiates gut injury, alters the intestinal , and can facilitate bacterial translocation leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, have been linked to intestinal apoptosis. Similarly, intestinal hyperpermeability and gut failure occur in critically ill patients, putting the gut at the center of SIRS pathology. Regulation of apoptosis and immune-modulatory functions have been ascribed to Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 (TNK1), whose activity is regulated merely by expression. We investigated the effect of TNK1 on intestinal  and its role in MODS. TNK1 expression induced crypt-specific apoptosis, leading to bacterial translocation, subsequent septic shock, and early death. Mechanistically, TNK1 expression in vivo resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of p65, and release of IL-6 and TNF-α. A TNF-α neutralizing antibody partially blocked development of intestinal damage. Conversely, gut-specific deletion of TNK1 protected the intestinal mucosa from experimental colitis and prevented cytokine release in the gut. Finally, TNK1 was found to be deregulated in the gut in murine and porcine trauma models and human inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, TNK1 might be a target during MODS to prevent damage in several organs, notably the gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415078>COMP-Ang1 Stabilizes Hyperglycemic Disruption of Blood-Retinal  Phenotype in Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Current treatments for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have considerable limitations, underpinning the need for new therapeutic options. In this article, the ability of an engineered angiopoietin-1 variant (COMP-Ang1) to ameliorate the injurious effects of hyperglycemia on   in a human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMvEC) model is comprehensively investigated.Confluent HRMvECs were treated (0-72 hours) with d-glucose (5 or 30 mM) in the absence and presence of COMP-Ang1 (10-200 ng/mL). l-glucose (30 mM) was used as osmotic control. Posttreatment, intact cell monolayers were monitored for permeability to FITC-dextran 40 kDa. Cells were also harvested for analysis of interendothelial junction targets by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The impact of receptor  kinase Tie2 gene silencing on COMP-Ang1 efficacy was also evaluated.Treatment with 30 mM d-glucose (but not l-glucose) demonstrated a time-dependent elevation in the mean rate of FITC-dextran diffusion across intact HRMvEC monolayers, in parallel with significant reductions in mRNA/protein levels of occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1, and VE-Cadherin. These effects were all attenuated by COMP-Ang1 in a concentration-dependent fashion, with 200 ng/mL recovering  function by ∼88%, and recovering reduced interendothelial junction protein levels by more than 50%. Finally, Tie2 knockdown by small interfering RNA silencing blocked the ability of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate against hyperglycemia-induced permeabilization of HRMvECs and depletion of junctional expression levels.In summary, this article presents a reproducible in vitro cell study that quantifies the concentration-dependent efficacy of COMP-Ang1 to mitigate the injurious effects of hyperglycemic challenge on HRMvEC  properties via Tie2-mediated signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339838>Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-2 Protein Regulates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Vascular Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Acute lung injury and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome, are life-threatening respiratory disorders.

However, its role in endothelial inflammatory response is unclear. We investigated the role of PHD2 in ECs during endotoxin-induced lung inflammatory responses with EC-specific PHD2 inducible knockout mice. On lipopolysaccharide challenge, PHD2 depletion in ECs attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced increases of lung vascular permeability, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Moreover, EC-specific PHD2 inducible knockout mice exhibit improved adherens junction  and endothelial  function. Mechanistically, PHD2 knockdown induces vascular endothelial cadherin in mouse lung microvascular primary endothelial cells. Moreover, PHD2 knockdown can increase hypoxia-inducible factor/vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase signaling and reactive oxygen species-dependent p38 activation, leading to the induction of vascular endothelial cadherin. Data indicate that PHD2 depletion prevents the formation of leaky vessels and edema by regulating endothelial  function. It provides direct in vivo evidence to suggest that PHD2 plays a pivotal role in vascular inflammation. The inhibition of endothelial PHD2 activity may be a new therapeutic strategy for acute inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We previously demonstrated the potent -enhancing effects of related compounds sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the pharmaceutical agent FTY720, and its analog (S)-FTY720 phosphonate (Tys) in models of inflammatory lung injury. In this study, we characterize additional novel FTY720 analogs for their potential to reduce vascular leak as well as utilize them as tools to better understand the mechanisms by which this class of agents modulates permeability. Transendothelial resistance (TER) and labeled dextran studies demonstrate that (R)-methoxy-FTY720 ((R)-OMe-FTY), (R)/(S)-fluoro-FTY720 (FTY-F), and β-glucuronide-FTY720 (FTY-G) compounds display in vitro -enhancing properties comparable or superior to FTY720 and S1P. In contrast, the (S)-methoxy-FTY720 ((S)-OMe-FTY) analog disrupts lung endothelial cell (EC)   in TER studies in association with actin stress fiber formation and robust intracellular calcium release, but independent of myosin light chain or ERK phosphorylation. Additional mechanistic studies with (R)-OMe-FTY, FTY-F, and FTY-G suggest that lung EC  enhancement is mediated through lipid raft signaling, Gi-linked receptor coupling to downstream  phosphorylation events, and S1PR1-dependent receptor ligation. These results provide important mechanistic insights into modulation of pulmonary vascular  function by FTY720-related compounds and highlight common signaling events that may assist the development of novel therapeutic tools in the prevention or reversal of the pulmonary vascular leak that characterizes ARDS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we report that the microvessel integrity was dramatically compromised (59.41% of wild-type mice) in TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) transgenic mice stressed by hypoglycemia. Melatonin, a potent antioxidant, protects against hypoglycemic stress-induced brain endothelial tight junction injury in the dosage of 400 nmol/L in vitro. FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) imaging data of endothelial cells stressed by low glucose revealed that TIGAR couples with calmodulin to promote TIGAR  nitration. A  92 mutation interferes with the TIGAR-dependent NADPH generation (55.60% decreased) and abolishes its protective effect on tight junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. We further demonstrate that the low-glucose-induced disruption of occludin and Caludin5 as well as activation of autophagy was abrogated by melatonin-mediated blockade of nitrosative stress in vitro. Collectively, we provide information on the detailed molecular mechanisms for the protective actions of melatonin on brain endothelial tight junctions and suggest that this indole has translational potential for severe hypoglycemia-induced neurovascular damage.© 2017 The Authors.

They have extensively been studied for their beneficial value in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the multitarget effects of Korean Red Ginseng extract (KRGE) with various components are unclear.We investigated the multitarget activities of KRGE on neurological dysfunction and neurotoxicity in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. KRGE (37.5 mg/kg/day, 75 mg/kg/day, or 150 mg/kg/day, per os (p.o.)) was given daily before or after MPTP intoxication.Pretreatment with 150 mg/kg/day KRGE produced the greatest positive effect on motor dysfunction as assessed using rotarod, pole, and nesting tests, and on the survival rate. KRGE displayed a wide therapeutic time window. These effects were related to reductions in the loss of  hydroxylase-immunoreactive dopaminergic neurons, apoptosis, microglial activation, and activation of inflammatory factors in the substantia nigra pars compacta and/or striatum after MPTP intoxication. In addition, pretreatment with KRGE activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways and inhibited phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, as well as blocked the alteration of blood-brain  .These results suggest that KRGE may effectively reduce MPTP-induced neurotoxicity with a wide therapeutic time window through multitarget effects including antiapoptosis, antiinflammation, antioxidant, and maintenance of blood-brain  .

While all of these products have a specified size range of ∼ 40 nm and above, efforts are underway to produce smaller particles, down to ∼ 1 nm. Here, we show that after a 24-h exposure of SHSY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells to 10 μg/ml of 10 and 30 nm ferric oxide nanoparticles (Fe-NPs), cellular dopamine content was depleted by 68 and 52 %, respectively. Increases in activated  kinase c-Abl, a molecular switch induced by oxidative stress, and neuronal α-synuclein expression, a protein marker associated with neuronal injury, were also observed (55 and 38 % percent increases, respectively). Inhibition of cell-proliferation, significant reductions in the number of active mitochondria, and a dose-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in neuronal cells. Additionally, using a rat in vitro blood-brain  (BBB) model, a dose-dependent increase in ROS accompanied by increased fluorescein efflux demonstrated compromised BBB . To assess translational implications, in vivo Fe-NP-induced neurotoxicity was determined using in vivo MRI and post-mortem neurochemical and neuropathological correlates in adult male rats after exposure to 50 mg/kg of 10 nm Fe-NPs. Significant decrease in T 2 values was observed. Dynamic observations suggested transfer and retention of Fe-NPs from brain vasculature into brain ventricles. A significant decrease in striatal dopamine and its metabolites was also observed, and neuropathological correlates provided additional evidence of significant nerve cell body and dopaminergic terminal damage as well as damage to neuronal vasculature after exposure to 10 nm Fe-NPs. These data demonstrate a neurotoxic potential of very small size iron nanoparticles and suggest that use of these ferric oxide nanoparticles may result in neurotoxicity, thereby limiting their clinical application.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30415015>Physical blood-brain  disruption induced by focused ultrasound does not overcome the transporter-mediated efflux of erlotinib.</a></h1><p>Overcoming the efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters at the blood-brain  (BBB) remains a challenge for the delivery of small molecule  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib to the brain. Inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the mouse BBB improved the BBB permeation of erlotinib but could not be achieved in humans. BBB disruption induced by focused ultrasound (FUS) was investigated as a strategy to overcome the efflux transport of erlotinib in vivo. In rats, FUS combined with microbubbles allowed for a large and spatially controlled disruption of the BBB in the left hemisphere. ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibition was performed using elacridar (10 mg/kg i.v). The brain kinetics of erlotinib was studied using C-erlotinib Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging in 5 groups (n = 4-5 rats per group) including a baseline group, immediately after sonication (FUS), 48 h after FUS (FUS + 48 h), elacridar (ELA) and their combination (FUS + ELA). BBB  was assessed using the Evan's Blue (EB) extravasation test. Brain exposure to C-erlotinib was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) of the brain kinetics (% injected dose (%ID) versus time (min)) in volumes corresponding to the disrupted (left) and the intact (right) hemispheres, respectively. EB extravasation highlighted BBB disruption in the left hemisphere of animals of the FUS and FUS + ELA groups but not in the control and ELA groups. EB extravasation was not observed 48 h after FUS suggesting recovery of BBB . Compared with the control group (AUC = 1.4 ± 0.5%ID.min), physical BBB disruption did not impact the brain kinetics of C-erlotinib in the left hemisphere (p > .05) either immediately (AUC = 1.2 ± 0.1%ID.min) or 48 h after FUS (AUC = 1.1 ± 0.3%ID.min). Elacridar similarly increased C-erlotinib brain exposure to the left hemisphere in the absence (AUC = 2.2 ± 0.5%ID.min, p < .001) and in the presence of BBB disruption (AUC = 2.1 ± 0.5%ID.min, p < .001). AUC was never significantly different from AUC (p > .05), in any of the tested conditions. BBB  is not the rate limiting step for erlotinib delivery to the brain which is mainly governed by ABC-mediated efflux. Efflux transport of erlotinib persisted despite BBB disruption.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that blocking of platelet glycoprotein (GP) receptor Ib might represent a novel target in treating acute ischemic stroke. This research was conducted to explore the therapeutic efficacy and potential mechanisms of GPIbα inhibitor (anfibatide) in a model of brain ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Male mice underwent 90 min of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Anfibatide (1, 2, 4 ug/kg) or tirofiban were administered intravenously 1 h after reperfusion. The results showed that anfibatide could significantly reduce infarct volumes, increase the number of intact neuronal cells and improve neurobehavioral . Moreover, anfibatide could reduce post ischemic BBB damage by attenuating increased paracellular permeability in the ischemia hemisphere significantly. Stroke-induced increases in activity and protein expression of macrophage-1 antigen (MAC-1) and P-selectin were also reduced by anfibatide intervention. Finally, anfibatide exerted antithrombotic effects upon stroke by decreased the number of microthrombi formation. This is the first demonstration of anfibatide's efficacy in protecting the BBB integrity and decreasing neutrophil inflammation response mediated by MAC-1 besides microthrombus formation inhibition in the brain during reperfusion. Anfibatide, as a promising anti-thrombo-inflammation agent, could be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanisms governing the functional  of Sertoli cells have remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of Shp2 in Sertoli cells results in infertility in mice. In Shp2 knockout mice (SCSKO), a normal population of Sertoli cells was observed, but the blood-testis  (BTB) was not formed. Shp2 ablation initiated the untimely and excessive differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) by disturbing the expression of paracrine factors. As a consequence, the process of spermatogenesis was disrupted, and the germ cells were depleted. Furthermore, Shp2 deletion impaired the cell junctions of the primary Sertoli cells and failed to support the clonal formation of SSCs co-cultured with SCSKO Sertoli cells. As expected, Shp2 restoration largely restores the cell junctions of the primary Sertoli cells and the clonal formation of SSCs. To identify the underlying mechanism, we further demonstrated that the absence of Shp2 suppressed Erk phosphorylation, and thus, the expression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)- and testosterone-induced target genes. These results collectively suggest that Shp2 is a critical signaling protein that is required to maintain Sertoli cell function and could serve as a novel target for male infertility therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923728>Intestinal Microbial and Metabolic Profiling of Mice Fed with High-Glucose and High-Fructose Diets.</a></h1><p>Increased sugar intake is implicated in Type-2 diabetes and fatty liver disease; however, the mechanisms through which glucose and fructose promote these conditions are unclear. We hypothesize that alterations in intestinal metabolite and microbiota profiles specific to each monosaccharide are involved. Two groups of six adult C57BL/6 mice were fed for 10-weeks with diets with glucose (G) or fructose (F) as sole carbohydrates, and a third group was fed with a normal chow carbohydrate mixture (N). Fecal metabolites were profiled by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and microbial composition by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Although N, G and F mice exhibited similar weight gains (with slight slower gains for F) and glucose tolerance, multivariate analysis of NMR data indicated that F mice were separated from N and G, with decreased butyrate and glutamate and increased fructose, succinate, taurine, , and xylose. The different sugar diets also resulted in distinct intestinal microbiota profiles. That associated with fructose seemed to hold more potential to induce host metabolic disturbances compared to glucose, mainly by promoting bile acid deconjugation and taurine release and compromising intestinal  . This may reflect the noted nonquantitative intestinal fructose absorption hence increasing its availability for microbial metabolism, a subject for further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320242>Noncanonical PAR3 activation by factor Xa identifies a novel pathway for Tie2 activation and stabilization of vascular .</a></h1><p>Endothelial  protective effects of activated protein C (APC) require the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1, and PAR3. In contrast, PAR1 and PAR3 activation by thrombin results in  disruption. Noncanonical PAR1 and PAR3 activation by APC vs canonical activation by thrombin provides an explanation for the functional selectivity of these proteases. Here we found that factor Xa (FXa) activated PAR1 at canonical Arg41 similar to thrombin but cleaved PAR3 at noncanonical Arg41 similar to APC. This unique PAR1-PAR3 activation profile permitted the identification of noncanonical PAR3 activation as a novel activation pathway for  protective tunica intima endothelial receptor  kinase 2 (Tie2). APC, FXa, and the noncanonical PAR3 tethered-ligand peptide induced prolonged activation of Tie2, whereas thrombin and the canonical PAR3 tethered-ligand peptide did not. Tie2 activation by FXa required PAR3 and EPCR. FXa and the noncanonical PAR3 tethered-ligand peptide induced Tie2- and PAR3-dependent upregulation of tight-junction-associated protein zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), translocation of ZO-1 to cell-cell borders, and the formation of typical ZO-1 honeycomb patterns that are indicative of tight-junction stabilization. These data provide intriguing novel insights into the diversification of functional selectivity of protease signaling achievable by canonical and noncanonical PAR activation, such as the activation of vascular-protective Tie2 by noncanonical PAR3 activation.© 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29793583>Reduction of vascular leakage by imatinib is associated with preserved microcirculatory perfusion and reduced renal injury markers in a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass.</a></h1><p>Cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery leads to impaired microcirculatory perfusion. We hypothesized that vascular leakage is an important contributor to microcirculatory dysfunction. Imatinib, a  kinase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce vascular leakage in septic mice. We investigated whether prevention of vascular leakage using imatinib preserves microcirculatory perfusion and reduces organ injury markers in a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass.Male Wistar rats underwent cardiopulmonary bypass after treatment with imatinib or vehicle (n=8 per group). Cremaster muscle microcirculatory perfusion and quadriceps microvascular oxygen saturation were measured using intravital microscopy and reflectance spectroscopy. Evans Blue extravasation was determined in separate experiments. Organ injury markers were determined in plasma, intestine, kidney, and lungs.The onset of cardiopulmonary bypass decreased the number of perfused microvessels by 40% in the control group [9.4 (8.6-10.6) to 5.7 (4.8-6.2) per microscope field; P<0.001 vs baseline], whereas this reduction was not seen in the imatinib group. In the control group, the number of perfused capillaries remained low throughout the experiment, whilst perfusion remained normal after imatinib administration. Microvascular oxygen saturation was less impaired after imatinib treatment compared with controls. Imatinib reduced vascular leakage and decreased fluid resuscitation compared with control [3 (3-6) vs 12 ml (7-16); P=0.024]. Plasma neutrophil-gelatinase-associated-lipocalin concentrations were reduced by imatinib.Prevention of endothelial  dysfunction using imatinib preserved microcirculatory perfusion and oxygenation during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Moreover, imatinib-induced protection of endothelial   reduced fluid-resuscitation requirements and attenuated renal and pulmonary injury markers.Copyright © 2017 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

We show that mice lacking the Tec kinase ITK have impaired intestinal tissue , and a reduced ability to restore homeostasis after tissue damage. This defect is associated with a substantial loss of Type 2 ILC (ILC2) in the intestinal lamina propria. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow ILC2 precursors confirms a cell-intrinsic role for ITK. Intestinal ILC2 numbers in Itk mice are restored by the administration of IL-2 complexes, also leading to improved intestinal tissue damage repair. Reduced Bcl-2 expression in intestinal Itk ILC2 is also restored to WT levels after IL-2 complex treatment, indicating a tissue-specific role for ITK in ILC2 survival in the intestine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102570>SHP2 protects endothelial cell  through suppressing VE-cadherin internalization regulated by MET-ARF1.</a></h1><p>Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin junctional localization is known to play a central role in vascular development, endothelial  , and homeostasis. The sarcoma homology domain containing protein  phosphatase (SHP)2 has been shown to be involved in regulating endothelial  function; however, the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this work SHP2 knockdown in an HUVEC monolayer increased VE-cadherin internalization and endothelial  permeability. Loss of SHP2 specifically augmented the GTPase activity of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-1. ARF1 knockdown or inhibition of its guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) markedly attenuated VE-cadherin internalization and  hyperpermeability induced by SHP2 deficiency. SHP2 knockdown increased the total and phosphorylated levels of MET, whose activity was necessary for ARF1 activation and VE-cadherin internalization. Furthermore, constitutive endothelium-specific deletion of Shp2 in mice led to disrupted endothelial cell junctions, massive hemorrhage, and lethality in embryos. Induced and endothelium-specific deletion of Shp2 in adult mice resulted in lung hyperpermeability. Inhibitors for ARF1-GEF or MET used in pregnant mice prevented the vascular leakage in endothelial Shp2-deleted embryos.

Injury to pulmonary epithelium may include alterations in tight junction (TJ) , resulting in impaired epithelial  function and enhanced penetration of chemicals and biomolecules. Herein, we investigated mechanisms involved in the disruption of TJ  by Cd exposure using an in vitro human air-liquid-interface (ALI) airway tissue model derived from normal primary human bronchial epithelial cells.ALI cultures were exposed to noncytotoxic doses of CdCl2 basolaterally and TJ  was measured by Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) and immunofluorescence staining with TJ markers. PCR array analysis was used to identify genes involved with TJ collapse. To explore the involvement of kinase signaling pathways, cultures were treated with CdCl2 in the presence of kinase inhibitors specific for cellular Src or Protein Kinase C (PKC).Noncytotoxic doses of CdCl2 resulted in the collapse of  function, as demonstrated by TEER measurements and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin staining. CdCl2 exposure altered the expression of several groups of genes encoding proteins involved in TJ homeostasis. In particular, down-regulation of select junction-interacting proteins suggested that a possible mechanism for Cd toxicity involves disruption of the peripheral junctional complexes implicated in connecting membrane-bound TJ components to the actin cytoskeleton. Inhibition of kinase signaling using inhibitors specific for cellular Src or PKC preserved the  of TJs, possibly by preventing occludin  hyperphosphorylation, rather than reversing the down-regulation of the junction-interacting proteins.Our findings indicate that acute doses of Cd likely disrupt TJ  in human ALI airway cultures both through occludin hyperphosphorylation via kinase activation and by direct disruption of the junction-interacting complex.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25556764>12/15-Lipoxygenase-dependent ROS production is required for diet-induced endothelial  dysfunction.</a></h1><p>To understand the mechanisms of 15(S)-HETE-induced endothelial cell (EC)  dysfunction, we examined the role of xanthine oxidase (XO). 15(S)-HETE induced junction adhesion molecule A (JamA) phosphorylation on Y164, Y218, and Y280 involving XO-mediated reactive oxygen species production and Src and Pyk2 activation, resulting in its dissociation from occludin, thereby causing tight junction (TJ) disruption, increased vascular permeability, and enhanced leukocyte and monocyte transmigration in vitro using EC monolayer and ex vivo using arteries as models. The phosphorylation of JamA on Y164, Y218, and Y280 appears to be critical for its role in 15(S)-HETE-induced EC  dysfunction, as mutation of any one of these amino acid residues prevented its dissociation from occludin and restored TJ  and  function. In response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, WT, but not 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO)(-/-), mice showed enhanced XO expression and its activity in the artery, which was correlated with increased aortic TJ disruption and  permeability with enhanced leukocyte adhesion and these responses were inhibited by allopurinol.

Maintenance of nephrin within this unique cell junction has been proposed to require dynamic phosphorylation events and endocytic recycling, although the molecular mechanisms that control this interplay are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the possibility that the phosphotyrosine adaptor protein ShcA regulates nephrin turnover. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis confirmed that ShcA is expressed in podocytes. In immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays, ShcA,  its SH2 domain, was associated with several phosphorylated  residues on nephrin. Overexpression of ShcA promoted nephrin  phosphorylation and reduced nephrin signaling and cell surface expression  In a rat model of reversible podocyte injury and proteinuria, phosphorylated nephrin temporally colocalized with endocytic structures coincident with upregulation of ShcA expression.  biotinylation assays confirmed that nephrin expression decreased at the cell surface and correspondingly increased in the cytosol during the injury time course. Finally, immunostaining in kidney biopsy specimens demonstrated overexpression of ShcA in several human proteinuric kidney diseases compared with normal conditions. Our results suggest that increases in ShcA perturb nephrin phosphosignaling dynamics, leading to aberrant nephrin turnover and slit diaphragm disassembly.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25315770>Novel peptide for attenuation of hyperoxia-induced disruption of lung endothelial  and pulmonary edema via modulating peroxynitrite formation.</a></h1><p>Pulmonary damages of oxygen toxicity include vascular leakage and pulmonary edema. We have previously reported that hyperoxia increases the formation of NO and peroxynitrite in lung endothelial cells via increased interaction of endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) with β-actin. A peptide (P326TAT) with amino acid sequence corresponding to the actin binding region of eNOS residues 326-333 has been shown to reduce the hyperoxia-induced formation of NO and peroxynitrite in lung endothelial cells. In the present study, we found that exposure of pulmonary artery endothelial cells to hyperoxia (95% oxygen and 5% CO2) for 48 h resulted in disruption of monolayer   in two phases, and apoptosis occurred in the second phase. NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester attenuated the endothelial  disruption in both phases. Peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid did not affect the first phase but ameliorated the second phase of endothelial  disruption and apoptosis. P326TAT inhibited hyperoxia-induced disruption of monolayer   in two phases and apoptosis in the second phase. More importantly, injection of P326TAT attenuated vascular leakage, pulmonary edema, and endothelial apoptosis in the lungs of mice exposed to hyperoxia. P326TAT also significantly reduced the increase in eNOS-β-actin association and protein  nitration. Together, these results indicate that peptide P326TAT ameliorates  dysfunction of hyperoxic lung endothelial monolayer and attenuates eNOS-β-actin association, peroxynitrite formation, endothelial apoptosis, and pulmonary edema in lungs of hyperoxic mice. P326TAT can be a novel therapeutic agent to treat or prevent acute lung injury in oxygen toxicity.© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326721>Defenders and Challengers of Endothelial  .</a></h1><p>Regulated vascular permeability is an essential feature of normal  and its dysfunction is associated with major human diseases ranging from cancer to inflammation and ischemic heart diseases. Integrity of endothelial cells also play a prominent role in the outcome of surgical procedures and organ transplant. Endothelial   and integrity are regulated by a plethora of highly specialized transmembrane receptors, including claudin family proteins, occludin, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and the newly identified immunoglobulin (Ig) and proline-rich receptor-1 (IGPR-1) through various distinct mechanisms and signaling. On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its  kinase receptor, VEGF receptor-2, play a central role in the destabilization of endothelial  .

Therefore, EphA2 receptor may be a potential therapeutic target for modulating ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). To support this hypothesis, here, we analyzed EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling in the process of VILI and determined the role of EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling in the protective mechanism of prone positioning in a VILI model. Wild-type mice were ventilated with high (24 ml/kg; positive end-expiratory pressure, 0 cm; 5 h) tidal volume in a supine or prone position. Anti-EphA2 receptor antibody or IgG was administered to the supine position group. Injury was assessed by analyzing the BAL fluid, lung injury scoring, and transmission electron microscopy. Lung lysates were evaluated using cytokine/chemokine ELISA and Western blotting of EphA2, ephrinA1, PI3Kγ, Akt, NF-κB, and P70S6 kinase. EphA2/ephrinA1 expression was higher in the supine high tidal volume group than in the control group, but it did not increase upon prone positioning or anti-EphA2 receptor antibody treatment. EphA2 antagonism reduced the extent of VILI and downregulated the expression of PI3Kγ, Akt, NF-κB, and P70S6 kinase. These findings demonstrate that EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling is involved in the molecular mechanism of VILI and that modulation of EphA2/ehprinA1 signaling by prone position or EphA2 antagonism may be associated with the lung-protective effect. Our data provide evidence for EphA2/ehprinA1 as a promising therapeutic target for modulating VILI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099453>Dysregulation of focal adhesion kinase upon Toxoplasma gondii infection facilitates parasite translocation across polarised primary brain endothelial cell monolayers.</a></h1><p>The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii invades tissues and traverses non-permissive biological barriers in infected humans and other vertebrates. Following ingestion, the parasite penetrates the intestinal wall and disseminates to immune-privileged sites such as the brain parenchyma, after crossing the blood-brain . In the present study, we have established a protocol for high-purification of primary mouse brain endothelial cells to generate stably polarised monolayers that allowed assessment of cellular  traversal by T. gondii. We report that T. gondii tachyzoites translocate across polarised monolayers of mouse brain endothelial cells and human intestinal Caco2 cells without significantly perturbing  impermeability and with minimal change in transcellular electrical resistance. In contrast, challenge with parasite lysate or LPS increased  permeability by destabilising intercellular tight junctions (TJs) and accentuated transmigration of T. gondii. Conversely, reduced phosphorylation of the TJ-regulator focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was observed dose-dependently upon challenge of monolayers with live T. gondii but not with parasite lysate or LPS. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK phosphorylation reversibly altered   and facilitated T. gondii translocation. Finally, gene silencing of FAK by shRNA facilitated transmigration of T. gondii across epithelial and endothelial monolayers. Jointly, the data demonstrate that T. gondii infection transiently alters the TJ stability through FAK dysregulation to facilitate transmigration. This work identifies the implication of the TJ regulator FAK in the transmigration of T. gondii across polarised cellular monolayers and provides novel insights in how microbes overcome the restrictiveness of biological barriers.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529643>Mechanical Stress and Single Nucleotide Variants Regulate Alternative Splicing of the MYLK Gene.</a></h1><p>The nonmuscle (nm) myosin light-chain kinase isoform (MLCK), encoded by the MYLK gene, is a vital participant in regulating vascular  responses to mechanical and inflammatory stimuli. We determined that MYLK is alternatively spliced, yielding functionally distinct nmMLCK splice variants including nmMLCK2, a splice variant highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells (EC) and associated with reduced EC  . We demonstrated previously that the nmMLCK2 variant lacks exon 11, which encodes a key regulatory region containing two differentially phosphorylated  residues (Y and Y) that influence vascular  function during inflammation. In this study, we used minigene constructs and RT-PCR to interrogate biophysical factors (mechanical stress) and genetic variants (MYLK single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) that are potentially involved in regulating MYLK alternative splicing and nmMLCK2 generation. Human lung EC exposed to pathologic mechanical stress (18% cyclic stretch) produced increased nmMLCK2 expression relative to levels of nmMLCK1 with alternative splicing significantly influenced by MYLK SNPs rs77323602 and rs147245669. In silico analyses predicted that these variants would alter exon 11 donor and acceptor sites for alternative splicing, computational predictions that were confirmed by minigene studies. The introduction of rs77323602 favored wild-type nmMLCK expression, whereas rs147245669 favored alternative splicing and deletion of exon 11, yielding increased nmMLCK2 expression. Finally, lymphoblastoid cell lines selectively harboring these MYLK SNPs (rs77323602 and rs147245669) directly validated SNP-specific effects on MYLK alternative splicing and nmMLCK2 generation. Together, these studies demonstrate that mechanical stress and MYLK SNPs regulate MYLK alternative splicing and generation of a splice variant, nmMLCK2, that contributes to the severity of inflammatory injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348461>AM966, an Antagonist of Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 1, Increases Lung Microvascular Endothelial Permeability through Activation of Rho Signaling Pathway and Phosphorylation of VE-Cadherin.</a></h1><p>Maintenance of pulmonary endothelial   is important for reducing severity of lung injury. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) regulates cell motility, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell growth. Knockdown of LPA receptor 1 (LPA1) has been shown to mitigate lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. AM966, an LPA1 antagonist exhibiting an antifibrotic property, has been considered to be a future antifibrotic medicine. Here, we report an unexpected effect of AM966, which increases lung endothelial  permeability. An electric cell-substrate sensing (ECIS) system was used to measure permeability in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). AM966 decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value immediately in a dose-dependent manner. VE-cadherin and f-actin double immunostaining reveals that AM966 increases stress fibers and gap formation between endothelial cells. AM966 induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) through activation of RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. Unlike LPA treatment, AM966 had no effect on phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk). Further, in LPA1 silencing cells, we observed that AM966-increased lung endothelial permeability as well as phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were attenuated. This study reveals that AM966 induces lung endothelial  dysfunction, which is regulated by LPA1-mediated activation of RhoA/MLC and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28075016>Modulation of long-term endothelial-  is conditional to the cross-talk between Akt and Src signaling.</a></h1><p>Although numerous studies have implicated Akt and Src kinases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)-induced endothelial- regulation, a link between these two pathways has never been demonstrated. We determined the long-term effects of Akt inhibition on Src activity and vice versa, and in turn, on the human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC)   at the basal level, and in response to growth factors. Our data showed that Akt1 gene knockdown increases gap formation in HMEC monolayer at the basal level. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt, but not Src resulted in exacerbated VEGF-induced vascular leakage and impaired Ang-1-induced HMEC- protection in vitro at 24 hr. Whereas inhibition of Akt had no effect on VEGF-induced HMEC gap formation in the short term, inhibition of Src blunted this process. In contrast, inhibition of Akt disrupted the VEGF and Ang-1 stabilized   in the long-term while inhibition of Src did not. Interestingly, both long-term Akt inhibition and Akt1 gene knockdown in HMECs resulted in increased Tyr416 phosphorylation of Src. Treatment of HMECs with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) that inhibited Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in the long-term, activated Src through increased Tyr416 phosphorylation and decreased HMEC- resistance. The effect of TGFβ1 on endothelial- breakdown was blunted in Akt1 deficient HMEC monolayers, where endothelial- resistance was already impaired compared to the control. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a direct cross-talk between Akt and Src in endothelial- regulation.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678325>Kaempferol Attenuates LPS-Induced Striatum Injury in Mice Involving Anti-Neuroinflammation, Maintaining BBB , and Down-Regulating the HMGB1/TLR4 Pathway.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation has been demonstrated to be linked with Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebral ischemia. Our previous investigation had identified that kaempferol (KAE) exerted protective effects on cortex neuron injured by LPS. In this study, the effects and possible mechanism of KAE on striatal dopaminergic neurons induced by LPS in mice were further investigated. The results showed that KAE improved striatal neuron injury, and increased the levels of  hydroxylase (TH) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in the striatum of mice. In addition, KAE inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), reduced the level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the striatum tissues. Furthermore, KAE protected blood-brain  (BBB)  and suppressed the activation of the HMGB1/TLR4 inflammatory pathway induced by LPS in striatum tissues of mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that KAE may have neuroprotective effects against striatum injury that is induced by LPS and the possible mechanisms are involved in anti-neuroinflammation, maintaining BBB , and down-regulating the HMGB1/TLR4 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26600084>Cigarette Smoke Induces Human Epidermal Receptor 2-Dependent Changes in Epithelial Permeability.</a></h1><p>The airway epithelium constitutes a protective  against inhaled insults, such as viruses, bacteria, and toxic fumes, including cigarette smoke (CS). Maintenance of bronchial epithelial  is central for airway health, and defective epithelial  function contributes to the pathogenesis of CS-mediated diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although CS has been shown to increase epithelial permeability, current understanding of the mechanisms involved in CS-induced epithelial  disruption remains incomplete. We have previously identified that the receptor  kinase human epidermal receptor (HER) 2 growth factor is activated by the ligand neuregulin-1 and increases epithelial permeability in models of inflammatory acute lung injury. We hypothesized that CS activates HER2 and that CS-mediated changes in  function would be HER2 dependent in airway epithelial cells. We determined that HER2 was activated in whole lung, as well as isolated epithelial cells, from smokers, and that acute CS exposure resulted in HER2 activation in cultured bronchial epithelial cells. Mechanistic studies determined that CS-mediated HER2 activation is independent of neuregulin-1 but required upstream activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. HER2 was required for CS-induced epithelial permeability as knockdown of HER2 blocked increases in permeability after CS. CS caused an increase in IL-6 production by epithelial cells that was dependent on HER2-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) activation. Finally, blockade of IL-6 attenuated CS-induced epithelial permeability. Our data indicate that CS activates pulmonary epithelial HER2 and that HER2 is a central mediator of CS-induced epithelial  dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28005151>Activated protein C binds directly to Tie2: possible beneficial effects on endothelial  function.</a></h1><p>Activated protein C (APC) is a natural anticoagulant with strong anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and  stabilizing properties. These cytoprotective properties of APC are thought to be exerted through its pathway involving the binding of APC to endothelial protein C receptor and cleavage of protease-activated receptors. In this study, we found that APC enhanced endothelial   via a novel pathway, by binding directly to and activating Tie2, a transmembrane endothelial  kinase receptor. Binding assays demonstrated that APC competed with the only known ligands of Tie2, the angiopoietins (Angs). APC bound directly to Tie2 (Kd ~3 nM), with markedly stronger binding affinity than Ang2. After binding, APC rapidly activated Tie2 to enhance endothelial  function as shown by Evan's blue dye transfer across confluent cell monolayers and in vivo studies. Blocking Tie2 restricted endothelial  . This study highlights a novel mechanism by which APC binds directly to Tie2 to enhance endothelial  , which helps to explain APC's protective effects in vascular leakage-related pathologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504252>Endothelial microvesicles carrying Src-rich cargo impair adherens junction  and cytoskeleton homeostasis.</a></h1><p>Microvesicles (MVs) conduct intercellular communication and impact diverse biological processes by transferring bioactive cargos to other cells. We investigated whether and how endothelial production of MVs contribute to vascular dysfunction during inflammation.We measured the levels and molecular properties of endothelial-derived MVs (EC-MVs) from mouse plasma following a septic injury elicited by cecal ligation and puncture, as well as those from supernatants of cultured endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory agents including cytokines, thrombin, and complement 5a. The mouse studies showed that sepsis caused a significant increase in total plasma vesicles and VE-cadherin+ EC-MVs compared to sham control. In cultured ECs, different inflammatory agents caused diverse patterns of EC-MV production and cargo contents. When topically applied to endothelial cells, EC-MVs induced a cytoskeleton-junction response characterized by myosin light chain phosphorylation, contractile fiber reorganization, VE-cadherin phosphorylation and adherens junction dissociation, functionally measured as increased albumin transendothelial flux and decreased  resistance. The endothelial response was coupled with protein  phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo containing c-Src kinase, whereas MVs produced from c-Src deficient cells did not exert -disrupting effects. Additionally, EC-MVs contribute to endothelial inflammatory injury by promoting neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and release of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase, a response unaltered by c-Src knockdown.Endothelial-derived microparticles cause endothelial  dysfunction by impairing adherens junctions and activating neutrophils. The signaling mechanisms underlying the endothelial cytoskeleton-junction response to EC-MVs involve protein phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo carrying c-Src. However, EC-MV induced neutrophil activation was not dependent on c-Src.Circulating microvesicles derived from blood/vascular cells not only serve as serological markers of disease, but also play a pathogenic role in vascular inflammation. In this study, we characterized the production and molecular signature of microparticles produced by endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions. We discovered that these vesicles carry Src-bearing cargo which interact with endothelial cells inducing cytoskeleton contractile stress and impaired VE-cadherin junction . Additionally, endothelial-derived MVs are capable of stimulating neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and production of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase. These novel findings have the potential to be translated into the development of diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to treat inflammatory disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

String vessel formation contributes to vascular degeneration in Alzheimer disease. By comparing to age-matched control cases we have recently reported endothelial degeneration in brain capillaries of human Parkinson disease (PD).Current study evaluated changes of basement membrane of capillaries, string vessel formation and their association with astrocytes, blood-brain-  and neuronal degeneration in PD.Brain tissue from human cases of PD and age-matched controls was used. Immunohistochemical staining for collagen IV, GFAP, NeuN,  hydroxylase, fibrinogen and Factor VIII was evaluated by image analysis in the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus and middle frontal gyrus.While the basement-membrane-associated vessel density was similar between the two groups, the density of string vessels was significantly increased in the PD cases, particularly in the substantia nigra. Neuronal degeneration was found in all brain regions. Astrocytes and fibrinogen were increased in the caudate nuclei of PD cases compared with control cases.Endothelial degeneration and preservation of basement membrane result in an increase of string vessel formation in PD. The data may suggest a possible role for cerebral hypoperfusion in the neuronal degeneration characteristic of PD, which needs further investigation. Elevated astrocytosis in the caudate nucleus of PD cases could be associated with disruption of the blood-brain  in this brain region.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25686613>Primary familial brain calcification: update on molecular genetics.</a></h1><p>Primary familial brain calcification is a neuropsychiatric disorder with calcium deposits in the brain, especially in basal ganglia, cerebellum and subcortical white matter. The disease is characterized by a clinical heterogeneity, with a various combination of symptoms that include movement disorders and psychiatric disturbances; asymptomatic patients have been also reported. To date, three causative genes have been found: SLC20A2, PDGFRB and PDGFB. SLC20A2 gene codes for the 'sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2' (PiT-2), a cell membrane transporters of inorganic phosphate, involved in Pi uptake by cells and maintenance of Pi body levels. Over 40 pathogenic variants of SLC20A2 have been reported, affecting the regulation of Pi homeostasis. It was hypothesized that SLC20A2 mutations cause brain calcification most likely through haploinsufficiency. PDGFRB encodes for the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ), a cell-surface -kinase (RTK) receptor that regulates cell proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation. PDGFB encodes for the 'platelet-derived growth factor beta' (PDGFβ), the ligand of PDGFRβ. The loss of function of PDGFRβ and PDGFβ could lead to the impairment of the pericytes function and blood brain  , causing vascular and perivascular calcium accumulation. SLC20A2 accounts for about 40 % of familial form and 14 % of sporadic cases, while PDGFRB and PDGFB mutations are likely rare. However, approximately 50 % of patients are not genetically defined and there should be at least another causative gene.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301675>Identification of inhibitors of the E. coli chaperone SurA using in silico and in vitro techniques.</a></h1><p>SurA is a gram-negative, periplasmic chaperone protein involved in the proper folding of outer membrane porins (OMPs), which protect bacteria against toxins in the extracellular environment by selectively regulating the passage of nutrients into the cell. Previous studies demonstrated that deletion of SurA renders bacteria more sensitive to toxins that compromise the  of the outer membrane. Inhibitors of SurA will perturb the folding of OMPs, leading to disruption of the outer membrane  and making the cell more vulnerable to toxic insults. The discovery of novel SurA inhibitors is therefore of great importance for developing alternative strategies to overcome antibiotic resistance. Our laboratory has screened over 10,000,000 compoundsin silicoby computationally docking these compounds onto the crystal structure of SurA. Through this screen and a screen of fragment compounds (molecular weight less than 250 g/mol), we found twelve commercially readily available candidate compounds that bind to the putative client binding site of SurA. We confirmed binding to SurA by developing and employing a competitive fluorescence anisotropy-based binding assay. Our results show that one of these compounds, Fmoc-β-(2-quinolyl)-d-alanine, binds the client binding site with high micromolar affinity. Using this compound as a lead, we also discovered that Fmoc-l-tryptophan and Fmoc-l-phenylalanine, but not Fmoc-, bind SurA with similar micromolar affinity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a competitive fluorescence anisotropy assay developed for the identification of inhibitors of the chaperone SurA, and the identification of three small molecules that bind SurA at its client binding site.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Exquisite temporospatial control of the GREM1-BMP interaction is required during development, and perturbation of this balance leads to abnormal limb formation and defective kidney development. In addition to inhibition of BMP signaling, several other noncanonical signaling modalities of GREM1 have been postulated. Some literature reports have suggested that GREM1 can bind to and activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells, human kidney epithelial cells, and others. These reports suggest that the GREM1àVEGFR2 signaling can drive angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report here that, despite exhaustive attempts, we did not observe GREM1 activation of VEGFR2 in any of the cell lines reported by the above-mentioned studies. Incubation of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant VEGF triggered a robust increase in VEGFR2  phosphorylation. In contrast, no VEGFR2 phosphorylation was detected when cells were incubated with recombinant GREM1 over a range of time points and concentrations. We also show that GREM1 does not interfere with VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 activation, suggesting that GREM1 does not bind with any great affinity to VEGFR2. Measurements of ECFC   revealed that VEGF induces  function disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay. We believe that these results provide an important clarification on the potential interaction between GREM1 and VEGFR2 in mammalian cells.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27603666>Src Family Kinases Modulate the Loss of Endothelial  Function in Response to TNF-α: Crosstalk with p38 Signaling.</a></h1><p>Activation of Src Family Kinase (SFK) signaling is required for the increase in endothelial permeability induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. However, we previously demonstrated that activation of endogenous SFKs by expression of dominant negative C-terminal Src Kinase (DN-Csk) is not sufficient to decrease endothelial adherens junction . Basal SFK activity has been observed in normal venular endothelia and was not associated with increased basal permeability. The basal SFK activity however was found to contribute to increased sensitivity of the venular endothelium to inflammatory mediator-induced leakage. How SFK activation achieves this is still not well understood. Here, we show that SFK activation renders human dermal microvascular endothelial cells susceptible to low doses of TNF-α. Treatment of DN-Csk-expressing cells with 50 pg/ml TNF-α induced a loss of TEER as well as drastic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion proteins. This synergistic effect was independent of ROCK or NF-κB activity. TNF-α-induced p38 signaling was required for the synergistic effect on  function, and activation of the p38 MAPK alone was also able to induce changes in permeability only in monolayers with active SFKs. These results suggest that the activation of endogenous levels of SFK renders the endothelial  more susceptible to low, physiologic doses of TNF-α through activation of p38 which leads to a loss of endothelial tight junctions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285073>Development of an UPLC-MS/MS method for quantification of Avitinib (AC0010) and its five metabolites in human cerebrospinal fluid: Application to a study of the blood-brain  penetration rate of non-small cell lung cancer patients.</a></h1><p>Avitinib (AC0010) is a mutant-selective epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), designed to be a targeted therapeutic agent for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR active and T790M resistant mutations. A rapid and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of Avitinib and its five metabolites (M1, M2, M4, M7, MII-6) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The samples were purified by protein precipitation and separated on a BEH C column (2.1×50mm, 1.7μm). Electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) were used to monitor the ion transitions at m/z 488/257, 474/403, 504/487, 434/377, 490/405, 476/391. The results indicated that the method had excellent sensitivity and specificity. The linear range covered from 0.05 to 50ng/mL for Avitinib, M1, M4, M7, and MII-6, and from 0.01 to 10ng/mL for M2. Intra-day and inter-day precisions (in terms of% RSD) were all <15% and the accuracies (in terms of% RE) were within the range of ±15%. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), matrix effect, extraction recovery, stability and dilution  were also validated and satisfied with the criteria of validation. Finally, the method was successfully applied to a blood-brain  (BBB) penetration rate research of NSCLC patients after an oral administration of Avitinib.Copyright © 2017.

Dysfunctions of IECs are thought to participate in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial , resulting in gastrointestinal diseases, such as colitis and colorectal cancer. Here we show that IEC-specific COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-deficient mice (Csk CKO mice) manifested the increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model of inflammatory bowel disease. DSS-treated Csk CKO mice also exhibited the significantly elevated intestinal permeability. Following DSS treatment, Csk CKO mice exhibited the higher proliferative activity of colonic epithelial cells and the increased number of apoptotic cells in the colon compared with that apparent for control mice. Moreover, the abundance of the tight junction protein occludin, which regulates cell-cell adhesion as well as epithelial permeability, was markedly reduced in the colon of DSS-treated Csk CKO mice. These results thus suggest that Csk in IECs plays important roles in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial  function and protection against colitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Alveolar hypoxia occurs in disorders ranging from altitude sickness to airway obstruction, apnea, and atelectasis. Here, we report that the phospholipid-binding protein, annexin A2 (ANXA2) functions to maintain vascular  in the face of alveolar hypoxia. We demonstrate that microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) from  mice display reduced  function and excessive Src-related  phosphorylation of the adherens junction protein vascular endothelial cadherin (VEC). Moreover, unlike  controls,  mice develop pulmonary edema and neutrophil infiltration in the lung parenchyma in response to subacute alveolar hypoxia. Mice deficient in the ANXA2-binding partner, S100A10, failed to demonstrate hypoxia-induced pulmonary edema under the same conditions. Further analyses reveal that ANXA2 forms a complex with VEC and its phosphatases, EC-specific protein  phosphatase (VE-PTP) and Src homology phosphatase 2 (SHP2), both of which are implicated in vascular . In the absence of ANXA2, VEC is hyperphosphorylated at  731 in response to vascular endothelial growth factor, which likely contributes to hypoxia-induced extravasation of fluid and leukocytes. We conclude that ANXA2 contributes to pulmonary microvascular  by enabling VEC-related phosphatase activity, thereby preventing vascular leak during alveolar hypoxia.© 2017 Luo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30517707>Transient Receptor Potential Ion Channels Mediate Adherens Junctions Dysfunction in a Toluene Diisocyanate-Induced Murine Asthma Model.</a></h1><p>Disruption of epithelial cell-cell junctions is essential for the initiation and perpetuation of airway inflammation in asthma. We've previously reported compromised epithelial   in a toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced occupational asthma model. This study is aimed to explore the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) in the dysfunction of adherens junctions in TDI-induced asthma. Mice were sensitized and challenged with TDI for a chemical-induced asthma model. Selective blockers of TRPV4 glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)2193874, 5 and 10 mg/kg) and TRPA1 (HC030031, 10 and 20 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally given to the mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed different expression pattern of TRPV4 and TRPA1 in lung. TDI exposure increased TRPV4 expression in the airway, which can be suppressed by GSK2193874, while treatment with neither TDI alone nor TDI together with HC030031 led to changes of TRPA1 expression in the lung. Blocking either TRPV4 or TRPA1 blunted TDI-induced airway hyperreactivity, airway neutrophilia and eosinophilia, as well as Th2 responses in a dose-dependent manner. At the same time, membrane levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin were significantly decreased after TDI inhalation, which were inhibited by GSK2193874 or HC030031. Moreover, GSK2193874 and HC030031 also suppressed serine phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β,  phosphorylation of β-catenin, as well as activation and nuclear transport of β-catenin in mice sensitized and challenged with TDI. Our study suggested that both TRPV4 and TRPA1 contribute critically to E-cadherin and β-catenin dysfunction in TDI-induced asthma, proposing novel therapeutic targets for asthma.© The Author(s) 2018.

Angiopoietins (Ang-1/Ang-2) act as antagonizing molecules to regulate angiogenesis, vascular stability, vascular permeability and lymphatic . However, the precise role of angiopoietin/Tie2 signaling at the BBB remains unclear. We investigated the influence of Ang-2 on BBB permeability in wild-type and gain-of-function (GOF) mice and demonstrated an increase in permeability by Ang-2, both in vitro and in vivo. Expression analysis of brain endothelial cells from Ang-2 GOF mice showed a downregulation of tight/adherens junction molecules and increased caveolin-1, a vesicular permeability-related molecule. Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced pericyte coverage in Ang-2 GOF mice that was supported by electron microscopy analyses, which demonstrated defective intra-endothelial junctions with increased vesicles and decreased/disrupted glycocalyx. These results demonstrate that Ang-2 mediates permeability via paracellular and transcellular routes. In patients suffering from stroke, a cerebrovascular disorder associated with BBB disruption, Ang-2 levels were upregulated. In mice, Ang-2 GOF resulted in increased infarct sizes and vessel permeability upon experimental stroke, implicating a role of Ang-2 in stroke pathophysiology. Increased permeability and stroke size were rescued by activation of Tie2 signaling using a vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase inhibitor and were independent of VE-cadherin phosphorylation. We thus identified Ang-2 as an endothelial cell-derived regulator of BBB permeability. We postulate that novel therapeutics targeting Tie2 signaling could be of potential use for opening the BBB for increased CNS drug delivery or tighten it in neurological disorders associated with cerebrovascular leakage and brain edema.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642851>Interfering with VE-PTP stabilizes endothelial junctions in vivo via Tie-2 in the absence of VE-cadherin.</a></h1><p>Vascular endothelial (VE)-protein  phosphatase (PTP) associates with VE-cadherin, thereby supporting its adhesive activity and endothelial junction . VE-PTP also associates with Tie-2, dampening the  kinase activity of this receptor that can support stabilization of endothelial junctions. Here, we have analyzed how interference with VE-PTP affects the stability of endothelial junctions in vivo. Blocking VE-PTP by antibodies, a specific pharmacological inhibitor (AKB-9778), and gene ablation counteracted vascular leak induction by inflammatory mediators. In addition, leukocyte transmigration through the endothelial  was attenuated. Interference with Tie-2 expression in vivo reversed junction-stabilizing effects of AKB-9778 into junction-destabilizing effects. Furthermore, lack of Tie-2 was sufficient to weaken the vessel . Mechanistically, inhibition of VE-PTP stabilized endothelial junctions via Tie-2, which triggered activation of Rap1, which then caused the dissolution of radial stress fibers via Rac1 and suppression of nonmuscle myosin II. Remarkably, VE-cadherin gene ablation did not abolish the junction-stabilizing effect of the VE-PTP inhibitor. Collectively, we conclude that inhibition of VE-PTP stabilizes challenged endothelial junctions in vivo via Tie-2 by a VE-cadherin-independent mechanism. In the absence of Tie-2, however, VE-PTP inhibition destabilizes endothelial   in agreement with the VE-cadherin-supportive effect of VE-PTP.© 2015 Frye et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25574837>HIF2α signaling inhibits adherens junctional disruption in acute lung injury.</a></h1><p>Vascular endothelial  dysfunction underlies diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by edema and inflammatory cell infiltration. The transcription factor HIF2α is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and may regulate endothelial  function. Here, we analyzed promoter sequences of genes encoding proteins that regulate adherens junction (AJ)  and determined that vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase (VE-PTP) is a HIF2α target. HIF2α-induced VE-PTP expression enhanced dephosphorylation of VE-cadherin, which reduced VE-cadherin endocytosis and thereby augmented AJ  and endothelial  function. Mice harboring an EC-specific deletion of Hif2a exhibited decreased VE-PTP expression and increased VE-cadherin phosphorylation, resulting in defective AJs. Mice lacking HIF2α in ECs had increased lung vascular permeability and water content, both of which were further exacerbated by endotoxin-mediated injury. Treatment of these mice with Fg4497, a prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) inhibitor, activated HIF2α-mediated transcription in a hypoxia-independent manner. HIF2α activation increased VE-PTP expression, decreased VE-cadherin phosphorylation, promoted AJ , and prevented the loss of endothelial  function. These findings demonstrate that HIF2α enhances endothelial  , in part through VE-PTP expression and the resultant VE-cadherin dephosphorylation-mediated assembly of AJs. Moreover, activation of HIF2α/VE-PTP signaling via PHD2 inhibition has the potential to prevent the formation of leaky vessels and edema in inflammatory diseases such as ARDS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27629102>Nucleoside diphosphate kinase B regulates angiogenic responses in the endothelium via caveolae formation and c-Src-mediated caveolin-1 phosphorylation.</a></h1><p>Nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPK-B) is an enzyme required for nucleoside triphosphate homeostasis, which has been shown to interact with caveolin-1 (Cav-1). In endothelial cells (ECs), NDPK-B contributes to the regulation of angiogenesis and adherens junction (AJ) . We therefore investigated whether an interaction of NDPK-B with Cav-1 in ECs is required for this regulation and the involvement of VEGF signaling herein. We report that simultaneous depletion of NDPK-B/Cav-1 in HUVECs synergistically impaired sprouting angiogenesis. NDPK-B depletion alone impaired caveolae formation, VEGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Src/Cav-1 but not of ERK1/2/AKT/eNOS. In vivo, Cav-1 mice showed impaired retinal vascularization at postnatal-day five, whereas NDPK-B mice did not. Primary mouse brain ECs (MBMECs) from NDPK-B mice showed no change in caveolae content and transendothelial-electrical resistance upon VEGF stimulation. Interestingly, NDPK-B MBMECs displayed an accumulation of intracellular vesicles and increased Cav-1 levels. Dextran tracer analysis showed increased vascular permeability in the brain of NDPK-B mice compared to wild type. In conclusion, our data indicate that NDPK-B is required for the correct localization of Cav-1 at the plasma membrane and the formation of caveolae. The genetic ablation of NDPK-B could partially be compensated by an increased Cav-1 content, which restored caveolae formation and some endothelial functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272033>Pulmonary endothelial cell  enhancement by novel FTY720 analogs: methoxy-FTY720, fluoro-FTY720, and β-glucuronide-FTY720.</a></h1><p>Effective therapeutic agents are lacking for the prevention and reversal of vascular leak, a frequent pathophysiologic result of inflammatory processes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. We previously demonstrated the potent -enhancing effects of related compounds sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the pharmaceutical agent FTY720, and its analog (S)-FTY720 phosphonate (Tys) in models of inflammatory lung injury. In this study, we characterize additional novel FTY720 analogs for their potential to reduce vascular leak as well as utilize them as tools to better understand the mechanisms by which this class of agents modulates permeability. Transendothelial resistance (TER) and labeled dextran studies demonstrate that (R)-methoxy-FTY720 ((R)-OMe-FTY), (R)/(S)-fluoro-FTY720 (FTY-F), and β-glucuronide-FTY720 (FTY-G) compounds display in vitro -enhancing properties comparable or superior to FTY720 and S1P. In contrast, the (S)-methoxy-FTY720 ((S)-OMe-FTY) analog disrupts lung endothelial cell (EC)   in TER studies in association with actin stress fiber formation and robust intracellular calcium release, but independent of myosin light chain or ERK phosphorylation. Additional mechanistic studies with (R)-OMe-FTY, FTY-F, and FTY-G suggest that lung EC  enhancement is mediated through lipid raft signaling, Gi-linked receptor coupling to downstream  phosphorylation events, and S1PR1-dependent receptor ligation. These results provide important mechanistic insights into modulation of pulmonary vascular  function by FTY720-related compounds and highlight common signaling events that may assist the development of novel therapeutic tools in the prevention or reversal of the pulmonary vascular leak that characterizes ARDS.Copyright © 2015.

S1P induces critical nmMLCK Y and Y phosphorylation resulting in translocation of nmMLCK to the periphery where spatially-directed increases in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and tension result in lamellipodia protrusion, increased cell-cell adhesion, and enhanced vascular  . MYLK, the gene encoding nmMLCK, is a known candidate gene in lung inflammatory diseases, with coding genetic variants (Pro21His, Ser147Pro, Val261Ala) that confer risk for inflammatory lung injury and influence disease severity. The functional mechanisms by which these MYLK coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect biologic processes to increase disease risk and severity remain elusive. In the current study, we utilized quantifiable cell immunofluorescence assays to determine the influence of MYLK coding SNPs on S1P-mediated nmMLCK phosphorylation and translocation to the human lung endothelial cell (EC) periphery . These disease-associated MYLK variants result in reduced levels of S1P-induced Y phosphorylation, a key site for nmMLCK enzymatic regulation and activation. Reduced Y phosphorylation resulted in attenuated nmMLCK protein translocation to the cell periphery. We further conducted EC kymographic assays which confirmed that lamellipodial protrusion in response to S1P challenge was retarded by expression of a MYLK transgene harboring the three MYLK coding SNPs. These data suggest that ARDS/severe asthma-associated MYLK SNPs functionally influence vascular -regulatory cytoskeletal responses via direct alterations in the levels of nmMLCK  phosphorylation, spatial localization, and lamellipodial protrusions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342992>IL-1β promotes transendothelial migration of PBMCs by upregulation of the FN/αβ signalling pathway in immortalised human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Neuroinflammation is often associated with pathological changes in the function of the blood-brain  (BBB) caused by disassembly of tight and adherens junctions that under physiological conditions are important for the maintenance of the BBB . Consequently, in inflammation the BBB becomes dysfunctional, facilitating leukocyte traversal of the  and accumulation of immune cells within the brain. The extracellular matrix (ECM) also contributes to BBB  but the significance of the main ECM receptors, the β integrins also expressed on endothelial cells, is less well understood. To evaluate whether β integrin function is affected during inflammation and impacts  function, we used a transformed human brain microvascular endothelial cell (THBMEC)-based Interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced inflammatory in vitro BBB model. We demonstrate that IL-1β increases cell-matrix adhesion and induces a redistribution of active β integrins to the basal surface. In particular, binding of αβ integrin to its ligand fibronectin is enhanced and αβ integrin-dependent signalling is upregulated. Additionally, localisation of the tight junction protein claudin-5 is altered. Blockade of the αβ integrin reduces the IL-1β-induced transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These data imply that IL-1β-induced inflammation not only destabilizes tight junctions but also increases αβ integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesion to fibronectin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In several cellular systems, ARF6 was shown to regulate actin dynamics in coordination with Rac1, a Rho small GTPase. We examined the  of ARF6 in the kidney podocyte because Rac1 was implicated in kidney diseases involving this cell. We found that ARF6 expression was enriched in human podocytes and that it modulated podocyte cytoskeletal dynamics through a functional interaction with nephrin, an intercellular junction protein necessary for podocyte injury-induced signaling requiring activation by  phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain. ARF6 was necessary for nephrin activation-induced ruffling and focal adhesion turnover, possibly by altering Rac1 activity. In podocyte-specific Arf6 (ARF6_PodKO) knockout mice, ARF6 deficiency did not result in a spontaneous kidney developmental phenotype or proteinuria after aging. However, ARF6_PodKO mice exhibited distinct phenotypes in two in vivo glomerular injury models. In the protamine sulfate perfusion model, which induced acute podocyte effacement, ARF6_PodKO mice were protected from podocyte effacement. In the nephrotoxic serum nephritis model, which induced immune-complex mediated injury, ARF6_PodKO mice exhibited aggravated proteinuria. Together, these observations suggest that while ARF6 is necessary for nephrin  phosphorylation-induced cytoskeletal dynamics in cultured podocytes, ARF6 has pleotropic podocyte roles in vivo, where glomerular injury-specific mechanisms might activate distinct signaling pathways that dictate whether ARF6 activity is beneficial or deleterious for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380151>Macrophage stimulating protein preserves blood brain   after intracerebral hemorrhage through recepteur d'origine nantais dependent GAB1/Src/β-catenin pathway activation in a mouse model.</a></h1><p>Blood brain  (BBB) disruption is an important contributor to brain edema and neurological deficits following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is a hepatocyte growth factor-like protein that mediates its functions via activating receptor  kinase recepteur d'origine nantais (RON). Grb2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) is a docking protein that mediates downstream receptor signal transduction pathways. This study aimed to evaluate the role of MSP and RON activated signaling pathway in preserving BBB  after collagenase-induced ICH. ICH mice received recombinant human MSP (rhMSP) or rhMSP combined with siRNA knockdown of RON or GAB1. rhMSP was administered by intranasal route 1 h after ICH. Brain edema, neurobehavior, BBB tight junction protein expression, and BBB permeability were evaluated. The expression of endogenous MSP and p-RON was decreased after ICH. Exogenous rhMSP administration reduced brain edema, neurological deficits, BBB permeability, and increased the expression of tight junction proteins in ICH mice. rhMSP administration increased the expression of p-RON, p-GAB1, p-Src, nuclear β-catenin, and tight junction proteins after ICH. These effects were reversed with RON and GAB1 siRNA. We conclude that MSP activation of RON preserved BBB  via GAB-1/Src/β-catenin pathway, thereby reducing brain edema and neurological deficits after ICH in mice.© 2018 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28615322>In vivo manipulation of the extracellular matrix induces vascular regression in a basal chordate.</a></h1><p>We investigated the physical role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in vascular homeostasis in the basal chordate , which has a large, transparent, extracorporeal vascular network encompassing an area >100 cm We found that the collagen cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase is expressed in all vascular cells and that in vivo inhibition using β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) caused a rapid, global regression of the entire network, with some vessels regressing >10 mm within 16 h. BAPN treatment changed the ultrastructure of collagen fibers in the vessel basement membrane, and the kinetics of regression were dose dependent. Pharmacological inhibition of both focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Raf also induced regression, and levels of phosphorylated FAK in vascular cells decreased during BAPN treatment and FAK inhibition but not Raf inhibition, suggesting that physical changes in the vessel ECM are detected via canonical integrin signaling pathways. Regression is driven by apoptosis and extrusion of cells through the basal lamina, which are then engulfed by blood-borne phagocytes. Extrusion and regression occurred in a coordinated manner that maintained vessel , with no loss of  function. This suggests the presence of regulatory mechanisms linking physical changes to a homeostatic, tissue-level response.© 2017 Rodriguez, Braden, et al.

To explore the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of resolvins, we have studied the effects of resolvin D1 (RvD1) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial  disruption as it is linked to propagation of inflammation. We found that LPS induces endothelial cell (EC)  disruption via xanthine oxidase (XO)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, protein  phosphatase SHP2 inactivation and Fyn-related kinase (Frk) activation leading to  phosphorylation of α-catenin and VE-cadherin and their dissociation from each other affecting adherens junction (AJ)  and thereby increasing endothelial  permeability. RvD1 attenuated LPS-induced AJ disassembly and endothelial  permeability by arresting  phosphorylation of α-catenin and VE-cadherin and their dislocation from AJ via blockade of XO-mediated ROS production and thereby suppression of SHP2 inhibition and Frk activation. We have also found that the protective effects of RvD1 on EC  function involve ALX/FPR2 and GPR32 as inhibition or neutralization of these receptors negates its protective effects. LPS also increased XO activity, SHP2 cysteine oxidation and its inactivation, Frk activation, α-catenin and VE-cadherin  phosphorylation and their dissociation from each other leading to AJ disruption with increased vascular permeability in mice arteries and RvD1 blocked all these effects. Thus, RvD1 protects endothelial AJ and its  function from disruption by inflammatory mediators such as LPS via a mechanism involving the suppression of XO-mediated ROS production and blocking SHP2 inactivation.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

In a form of apoptotic mimicry, many enveloped viruses display phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of their membranes, enabling TAM receptor activation and downregulation of antiviral responses. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a deficiency of TAM receptors would enhance antiviral responses and protect against viral infection. Unexpectedly, mice lacking Mertk and/or Axl, but not Tyro3, exhibited greater vulnerability to infection with neuroinvasive West Nile and La Crosse encephalitis viruses. This phenotype was associated with increased blood-brain  permeability, which enhanced virus entry into and infection of the brain. Activation of Mertk synergized with interferon-β to tighten cell junctions and prevent virus transit across brain microvascular endothelial cells. Because TAM receptors restrict pathogenesis of neuroinvasive viruses, these findings have implications for TAM antagonists that are currently in clinical development.</p></html>
