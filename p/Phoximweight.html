Vitamin E may protect the hepatocyte and increase the  of liver. The study was to investigate the effects of -induced hepatotoxicity on Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and the protection of vitamin E. SD rats received by gavage 180 mg kg (per body weight) of , 200 mg kg (per body weight) of vitamin E, and  + vitamin E. The results showed that exposure to  elevated liver coefficient; glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, total bile acid, and alanine aminotransferase in the serum; ROS in the liver; and the expression of p53, Bax, CYP2E1, ROS, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3, while  caused a reduction of total protein, albumin, and cholinesterase in the serum; acetylcholinesterase, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione in the liver; and the expression of Bcl-2. Vitamin E modified the -induced hepatotoxicity by reducing the GGT in the serum, malondialdehyde in the liver, and the expression of CYP2E1 significantly. There were no significant changes of globulin in the serum, the activity of catalase in the liver, as well as expression levels of Fas and Bad in the liver. Overall, subacute exposure to  induced hepatic injury, oxidative stress damage, and cell apoptosis. Vitamin E modified -induced hepatotoxicity slightly. And, vitamin E minimized oxidative stress damage and ultrastructural changes in rat hepatocytes notably.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660516>Molecular cloning and characterization of C tetrahydrofolate (C-THF) synthase in Bombyx mori, silkworm.</a></h1><p>Folate metabolism pathway is mainly associated with syntheses of nucleic acids and proteins as well as DNA methylation and repair. Cytoplasmic C tetrahydrofolate (C-THF) synthase is a central enzyme in folate metabolism and plays an important role in C-THF conversion. The full-length sequence of silkworm (Bombyx mori) cytoplasmic C-THF synthase (BmC-THF synthase) gene including an open reading frame (ORF) of 932 amino acid residues was cloned. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BmC-THF synthase shares 84% and 81% identity with C-THF synthase of Papilio Xuthus and Danaus plexippus, respectively. Conserved sequence analysis showed that the 330 to 710 amino acid residues of BmC-THF synthase were highly conserved among various organisms. Recombinant BmC-THF synthase protein with a molecular weight of about 105.5 kDa was expressed in E. coli cells and identified using SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. The expression of BmC-THF synthase gene in eight silkworm tissues revealed that BmC-THF synthase gene is widely expressed in various tissues of silkworm and highly expressed in the fat body. The expression characteristics of BmC-THF synthase gene in response to oxidative stress were conducted under  and high temperature (30 °C) exposure. The results showed that the transcriptional level of BmC-THF synthase gene was upregulated by 3.435-fold and 6.845-fold after  and high temperature (30 °C) exposure, respectively, indicating that BmC-THF synthase gene may play a significant role in response of silkworm to oxidative stresses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Nanoparticulate (NP) titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) has been shown to attenuate damages in B. mori caused by  exposure. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of midgut injury due to organophosphorus insecticide exposure and its repair by nano-TiO2 pretreatment. In this study,  exposure for 36 h led to significant decreases in body weight and survival and increased oxidative stress and midgut injury. Pretreatment with nano-TiO2 attenuated the -induced midgut injury, increased body weight and survival, and decreased oxidative stress in the midgut of B. mori. Digital gene-expression data showed that exposure to  results in significant changes in the expression of 254 genes in the -exposed midgut and 303 genes in  + nano-TiO2-exposed midgut. Specifically,  exposure led to upregulation of Tpx, α-amylase, trypsin, and glycoside hydrolase genes involved in digestion and absorption.  exposure also led to the downregulation of Cyp450 and Cyp4C1 genes involved in an antioxidant capacity. In contrast, a combination of both  and nano-TiO2 treatment significantly decreased the change in α-amylase, trypsin, and glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are involved in digestion and absorption. These results indicated that Tpx, α-amylase, trypsin, GHs, Cyp450, and Cyp4C1 may be potential biomarkers of midgut toxicity caused by  exposure and the attenuation of these toxic impacts by nano-TiO2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28210953>Combined toxicity of imidacloprid and three insecticides to the earthworm, Eisenia fetida (Annelida, Oligochaeta).</a></h1><p>Although the earthworm Eisenia fetida has been used in many ecotoxicological studies in recent years, most of these studies have only focused on assessing the effects of individual insecticides. In the present study, we aimed to compare the individual and combined toxic effects of imidacloprid and three insecticides (, chlorpyrifos, and lambda-cyhalothrin) on E. fetida. We showed that imidacloprid had the highest intrinsic toxicity to the worms in filter paper contact test, followed by  and lambda-cyhalothrin, while the least toxicity was found from chlorpyrifos. Moreover, 14-day soil toxicity test revealed that the highest toxicity was still detected for imidacloprid with an LC value of 2.82 (2.61∼3.17) mg a.i. kg dry weight (DW), followed by chlorpyrifos with an LC value of 384.9 (353.5∼440.3) mg a.i. kg DW. Meanwhile, a relatively less toxicity was found for lambda-cyhalothrin with an LC value of 560.3 (475.9∼718.5) mg a.i. kg DW, while the lowest toxicity to E. fetida was observed for  with an LC value of 901.5 (821.3∼1017) mg a.i. kg DW. In addition, significant synergistic responses were found from the ternary mixture of imidacloprid--lambda-cyhalothrin and quaternary mixture of imidacloprid--chlorpyrifos-lambda-cyhalothrin in both bioassay systems. Therefore, our findings highlighted that the simultaneous presence of several insecticides in the soil environment might lead to increased toxicity, resulting in serious damage to the nontarget organisms compared with individual insecticides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616058>Molecular mechanisms of silk gland damage caused by  exposure and protection of -induced damage by cerium chloride in Bombyx mori.</a></h1><p>It is known that exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OP) including  can produce oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, and greatly attenuate cocooning rate in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Cerium treatment has been demonstrated to relieve -induced toxicity in B. mori; however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of silk gland injury due to OP exposure and protection of gland damage due to cerium pretreatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate silk gland damage and its molecular mechanisms in -induced silkworm toxicity and the protective mechanisms of cerium following exposure to . The results showed that  exposure resulted in severe gland damage, reductions in protein synthesis and the cocooning rate of silkworms. Cerium (Ce) attenuated gland damage caused by , promoted protein synthesis, increased the antioxidant capacity of the gland and increased the cocooning rate of B. mori. Furthermore, digital gene expression data suggested that  exposure led to significant up-regulation of 714 genes and down-regulation of 120 genes. Of these genes, 122 were related to protein , specifically, the down-regulated Ser2, Ser3, Fib-L, P25, and CYP450. Ce pretreatment resulted in up-regulation of 162 genes, and down-regulation of 141 genes, importantly, Ser2, Ser3, Fib-L, P25, and CYP333B8 were up-regulated. Treatment with CeCl3 +  resulted in higher levels of Fib-L, P25, Ser2, Ser3, CAT, TPx, and CYP333B8 expression in the silk gland of silkworms. These findings indicated that Ce increased cocooning rate via the promotion of silk protein synthesis-related gene expression in the gland under -induced toxicity. These findings may expand the application of rare earths in sericulture.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
