Therefore, we perform in vitro experiments to investigate the effects of FGF-21 on macrophages in the progress of atherosclerosis. First, we use phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA), a phorbol ester, to induce THP-1 cells into macrophages as macrophages model. After that we use Ox-LDL to induce macrophages into foam cells and simultaneously administrate with FGF-21 or not to determine whether FGF-21 has effects on foam cells formation and related inflammatory response. Wound healing results show that FGF-21 can inhibit macrophage migration. Oil Red-O stain, immunofluorescence and flow cytometer results show that FGF-21 can repress cholesterol accumulation in macrophages thereby inhibit foam cells formation and these effects can be abolished by FGFR inhibitor. Moreover, real-time PCR results showed that FGF-21 significantly reduces expression of inflammatory factors including IL-1α, IL-6 and TNF-α and this effect can be abolished by FGFR inhibitor. Furthermore, to determine the mechanism of FGF-21 regulates inflammatory response in Ox-LDL-induced THP-1 macrophages, western blotting results show that after treatment of Ox-LDL in macrophages, NF-κB signaling pathway is activated but FGF-21 can significantly inhibit this pathway. In addition, FGF-21 also regulates some regulators of  after treatment of Ox-LDL in macrophages. Above all, our findings demonstrate that FGF-21 can regulate foam cells formation, macrophage migration, inflammatory response and  in Ox-LDL-induced THP-1 macrophages.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of progesterone resistance and to identify the key genes and pathways mediating progesterone resistance in endometrial cancer using bioinformatics analysis.We developed a stable MPA (medroxyprogesterone )-resistant endometrial cancer cell subline named IshikawaPR. Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from triplicate samples of Ishikawa and IshikawaPR cells. PANTHER, DAVID and Metascape were used to perform gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and cBioPortal for progesterone receptor (PGR) coexpression analysis. GEO microarray (GSE17025) was utilized for validation. The protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and modular analyses were performed using Metascape and Cytoscape. Further validation were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).In total, 821 DEGs were found and further analyzed by GO, KEGG pathway enrichment and PPI analyses. We found that , immune system and inflammation, extracellular environment-related processes and pathways accounted for a significant portion of the enriched terms. PGR coexpression analysis revealed 7 PGR coexpressed genes (ANO1, SOX17, CGNL1, DACH1, RUNDC3B, SH3YL1 and CRISPLD1) that were also dramatically changed in IshikawaPR cells. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics revealed clinical significance for 4 out of 7 target genes. Furthermore, 8 hub genes and 4 molecular complex detections (MCODEs) were identified.Using microarray and bioinformatics analyses, we identified DEGs and determined a comprehensive gene network of progesterone resistance. We offered several possible mechanisms of progesterone resistance and identified therapeutic and prognostic targets of progesterone resistance in endometrial cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30333234>Crystal structure of the bacterial  transporter SatP reveals that it forms a hexameric channel.</a></h2><p> is found ubiquitously in the natural environment and can be used as an exogenous carbon source by bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells.

Evidence from animal models of PCOS (prenatally androgenized sheep) has suggested that treatment with insulin sensitizers, but not antiandrogens, can reduce increases in ROS.In the present study, we investigated the effects of neonatal treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (leuprolide ) on prenatally androgenized sheep with testosterone propionate to determine its impact on oxidative stress molecules (ferric reducing antioxidant power [FRAP], advanced oxidation protein product [AOPP], nitric oxide [NOx], albumin) at 8, 12, and 18 months of age.Androgenized ewes (but not leuprolide-treated ewes) showed reduced total cholesterol levels associated with a decrease in the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous adiposity (adjusted to abdominal area) as determined by computed tomography. In androgenized ewes at 12 months of age, an increase in subcutaneous  and relative decrease in the visceral  compartment did not affect the expression of REDOX markers. At 18 months of age, however, the levels of NOx metabolites decreased in androgenized animals, but remained close to normal in ewes subjected to neonatal treatment with leuprolide . Other oxidative stress parameters (FRAP, AOPP, albumin) did not vary among groups.Our results demonstrate that the GnRH agonist leuprolide (as a single dose after birth) had weak effects on markers of the oxidative stress balance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29787808>Lipoxin A and its analog suppress hepatocarcinoma cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration and metastasis via regulating integrin-linked kinase axis.</a></h2><p>Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and migration play an important role in tumor progression, and lipoxin (LX), the 'stop signal' for inflammation, has been studied in basic research for its anti-inflammatory or inflammatory pro-resolving properties. Here, in the in vitro experiment, we showed that LXA could inhibit the EMT and migration in phorbol myristate  (PMA) or activated conditioned medium (ACM)-stimulated Hep3B cells by downregulation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a pseudokinase in cytoplasm and these effects were via inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β. Morover, LXA could not affect the EMT and migration of PMA-stimulated Hep3B cells by knockdown of ILK. In the in vivo experiment, BML-111 (the analog of LXA) could inhibit the EMT and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma cells. We also demonstrated that ILK siRNA inhibited phosphorylation of downstream signaling targets Akt and GSK3β, decreased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. These results showed that LXA could be a possible candidate for liver cancer therapy, and blocking ILK axis would be an effective drug target.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in  that liver is the main site of  synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and  synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed  accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730669>Corilagin Reduces the Frequency of Seizures and Improves Cognitive Function in a Rat Model of Chronic Epilepsy.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Worldwide, epilepsy is an important chronic neurological condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of corilagin, an ellagitannin extracted from medicinal plants, on the frequency of seizures and cognitive function in a rat model of chronic epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Chronic epilepsy was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) for 36 days. Corilagin, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, was injected IP into treated rats, 24 days before the start of PTZ treatment, until the end of the protocol. The effects of corilagin were assessed by the pattern of epileptic seizures; cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) navigation test. The mechanism of action of corilagin was investigated by measuring cytokine levels and oxidative stress parameters, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitory (CAI) activity. Histological analysis of fixed brain tissue sections included cresyl violet  staining (Nissl staining) for Nissl substance in the neuronal cytoplasm. RESULTS The corilagin-treated rats, compared with the control group, showed a significantly lower rate of epileptic events, improved cognitive function, reduced level of cytokines, reduced ROS production reduced CAI activity in the brain tissues (P<0.01). Histology of the rat brain tissues study showed that corilagin treatment maintained the neuronal cellular structure and number of surviving cells compared with the control group of rats. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study showed that corilagin reduced the frequency of seizures and improved the cognitive function in a rat model of chronic epilepsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937130>H NMR-based metabolomic study of metabolic profiling for pollinosis.</a></h2><p>Allergic rhinitis is the main symptom of pollinosis, relieved by non-specific treatment universally.

Supplementation of dietary SCFA can prevent and reverse high--diet (HFD)-induced obesity. However, it is not clear whether SCFA ameliorate abnormal expression of adiponectin and resistin in the obese state. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SCFA on adiponectin and resistin's expressions in diet-induced obese mice, as well as the potential mechanisms associated with DNA methylation. C57BL/6J male mice were fed for 16 weeks with five types of HFD (34·9 %  by wt., 60 % kJ) - a control HFD and four HFD with  (HFD-A), propionate (HFD-P), butyrate (HFD-B) and their admixture (HFD-SCFA). Meanwhile, a low- diet (4·3 %  by wt., 10 % kJ) was used as the control group. The reduced mRNA levels of adiponectin and resistin in the adipose tissue of the HFD-fed mice were significantly reversed by dietary supplementation of , propionate, butyrate or their admixture to the HFD. Moreover, the expressional changes of adiponectin and resistin induced by SCFA were associated with alterations in DNA methylation at their promoters, which was mediated by reducing the expressions of enzyme-catalysed DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1, 3a, 3b) and the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and suppressing the binding of these enzymes to the promoters of adiponectin and resistin. Our results indicate that SCFA may correct aberrant expressions of adiponectin and resistin in obesity by epigenetic regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788720>Effects of Vitamin E and Selenium on Growth Performance, Antioxidant Capacity, and Metabolic Parameters in Growing Furring Blue Foxes (Alopex lagopus).</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine whether different dietary vitamin E (VE) and selenium (Se) levels affect the nutrient digestibility, production performance, and antioxidant abilities of growing furring blue foxes. A 4 × 2 factorial arrangement that included 4 levels of VE (0, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg diet from α-tocopherol ) and 2 levels of Se (0 or 0.2 mg/kg diet from glycine selenium) was performed from mid-September to pelting. A  study was conducted for four days starting at the 30th day of the trial. Serum samples were collected at the last day of the study. The results showed that supplementation of growing furring blue fox diets with VE and Se significantly affected the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (F:G) (P < 0.05). Dietary Se supplementation enhanced protein and  digestibility of male blue foxes. There were significant effects of different VE and Se levels in diets on serum antioxidant parameters and metabolic parameters of blue foxes (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this research indicated that dietary supplementation with VE improved ADG and F:G of blue foxes. Addition of VE and Se to blue fox diets increased the antioxidant capacity of blue foxes. The diet with high VE and Se supplementation reduced glucose and triglycerides concentrations in serum. The present study found that growing furring blue foxes had increased growth performance and antioxidant abilities when fed diets with 200 mg VE/kg and nearly 0.1 mg Se/kg.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384448>Phytochemical and Biological Profile of  (L.) DC.: An Inhibitor of Pancreatic Lipase.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic lipase, a key enzyme for  absorption, is one of the most important targets for the treatment of obesity, while natural compounds have recently attracted much interest as potential inhibitors of this enzyme. Here, in an attempt to find new effective agents, the methanolic extract from  (L.) DC. and its sub-extracts were investigated for their potential inhibitory activity. The ability to inhibit pancreatic lipase was verified through the in vitro evaluation of the prevention of -nitrophenyl caprylate hydrolysis. The antioxidant activity was also verified by means of DPPH and β-carotene bleaching tests. Compositional profiling revealed that flavonoid glycosides were the main specialized metabolites present in the methanolic extract from the aerial parts of the plant with kaempferol and quercetin representing the two -glycosylated aglycones. Kaempferol-3--β-(2″--glucosyl)-rutinoside and kaempferol-3--arabinosyl-7--rhamnoside were the most abundant flavonols. The crude methanolic extract and the dichloromethane and ethyl  sub-extracts showed a strong lipase inhibitory activity, with IC values of 2.06 ± 0.02, 1.52 ± 0.02 and 1.31 ± 0.02 mg/mL, respectively. The best capacity to scavenge DPPH radical was detected for the ethyl  sub-extract (IC = 171.9 ± 1.0 µg/mL), which was also effective in protecting linoleic acid from peroxidation (IC = 35.69 ± 2.30 µg/mL).

How these freshly synthesized VLCPUFAs are channeled into TAG remains unknown. In this study, the glycerolipid profile of  at log and stationary growth stages was first analyzed by lipidomic tools, and then C- and C-glycerol were used to trace the flux of fatty acids and backbone in glycerolipids. Lipidomic analysis showed that VLCPUFAs were mostly allocated to phosphatidylcholine (PC) and TAG. PC possessed a relatively stable profile of VLCPUFAs, whereas TAG carrying VLCPUFAs were significantly increased at the stationary phase. C- labeled VLCPUFAs were predominately incorporated into PC initially but were mostly found in TAG at later time of labeling. Positional analysis showed that PC had either one VLCPUFA at its -2 position (PC1) or two VLCPUFAs (PC2), while TAG incorporated VLCPUFAs almost exclusively at the -2 position. Similarly, C-glycerol was more efficiently incorporated into PC1 than TAG initially but was mostly found in TAG at later time of labeling, and diacylglycerol and PC1 shared a similar incorporation pattern. These results indicate that VLCPUFAs in TAG are mainly channeled from PC likely through diacylglycerol as the intermediate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257410>Curative effect of arjunolic acid from Terminalia arjuna in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally. Terminalia arjuna W. & Arn. (Combretaceae) is an endemic tree found in India and Sri Lanka and used traditionally for its cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects. Arjunolic acid (AA) is an oleanane triterpenoid found mainly in the heartwood of T. arjuna. This study was aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of AA using cellular and rodent models of NAFLD. AA was isolated from the ethyl  extract of the heartwood of T. arjuna. The structure of AA was confirmed by physical and spectroscopic data. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells using palmitate-oleate mixture and the effects of AA on triglyceride accumulation and lipotoxicity were assessed. In vivo effect of AA on NAFLD was assessed using HFD fed rats. The treatment with AA did not affect the cell viability upto 100 μM and showed GI value of 379.9 μM in HepG2 cells. The treatment with AA significantly lowered the ORO concentration by 35.98% and triglyceride accumulation by 66.36% at 50 μM concentration (P < 0.005) compared to the vehicle treated group. The treatment with AA also reduced the leakage of ALT and AST by 61.11 and 48.29% in a significant manner (P < 0.005). The in vivo findings clearly demonstrated that the animals treated with AA at 25 and 50 mg/kg concentrations showed a significant decrease in the levels of transaminases, phosphatase and GGT (P < 0.005). In the liver, the expression of PPARα and FXRα expressions were upregulated, while PPARγ expression was downregulated by the treatment with AA. The liver histology of the animals showed reduction in steatosis and MNC infiltration. These preliminary evidences suggested that AA might be a promising lead to treat NAFLD. Future robust scientific studies on AA will lead to tailoring it for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Four lactating Holstein cows with ruminal cannulas were assigned to a 4 × 4 Latin square in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Diets were formulated to contain low forage [LF; 17% forage neutral detergent fiber (NDF)] or high forage (HF; 24.5% forage NDF) and DDGS at 0 or 18% (0DG or 18DG) of diet dry matter (DM). Intake of DM was not affected by the diets. Daily mean ruminal pH was affected by forage NDF × DDGS interactions, as the lowest ruminal pH was observed among cows fed LF18DG (6.02). Apparent total-tract digestibility for DM, organic matter, crude protein, NDF, acid detergent fiber, and starch was not affected by diets. Cows fed LF diets had a greater total volatile fatty acid concentration compared with cows fed HF (122 vs. 116 mM). Molar proportions of  were greater for HF compared with that of LF diets (62.6 vs. 57.5 mmol/100 mmol) and greater for 0DG diet compared with that of 18DG diets (61.3 vs. 58.7 mmol/100 mmol) diets. The molar proportion of propionate was affected by forage × DDGS interaction as the greatest propionate molar proportion was observed with cows fed LF18DG diet (27.7 mmol/100 mmol). Also, molar proportion of butyrate was affected by forage × DDGS interaction, as the greatest butyrate molar proportion was observed in cows fed HF18DG diet (13.5 mmol/100 mmol). Average fractional dilution rate for all diets was 11.9%/h and was not affected by diets. Fractional passage rate of the solid phase was greater for HF than for LF (4.40 vs. 3.76%/h).

As such, the rumen stimulation technique was used to evaluate the effects of substituting increasing concentrations of ground Moringa seeds (0, 100, 200 and 400 g/kg concentrate dry matter (DM)) in the diet on rumen fermentation and methane production. Two identical, Rusitec apparatuses, each with eight fermenters were used with the first 8 days used for adaptation and days 9 to 16 used for measurements. Fermenters were fed a total mixed ration with Urochloa brizantha as the forage. Disappearance of DM, CP, NDF and ADF linearly decreased (P&lt;0.01) with increasing concentrations of Moringa seeds in the diet. Total volatile fatty acid production and the  to propionate ratio were also linearly decreased (P&lt;0.01). However, only the 400 g/kg (concentrate DM basis) treatment differed (P&lt;0.01) from the control. Methane production (%), total microbial incorporation of 15N and total production of microbial N linearly decreased (P&lt;0.01) as the inclusion of Moringa seeds increased. Though the inclusion of Moringa seeds in the diet decreased CH4 production, this arose from an unfavourable decrease in diet digestibility and rumen fermentation parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519914>The enhanced  productivity of Chlorella minutissima and Chlorella pyrenoidosa by carbon coupling nitrogen manipulation for biodiesel production.</a></h2><p>Biodiesel production from microalgae has been researched extensively and attempted to commercialize on a large scale, but there are major hurdles in the production process like harvesting and low  content, which should be studied to enhance the process and make it economical. Present study aimed to improve the  productivity of Chlorella minutissima and Chlorella pyrenoidosa by modifying the carbon and nitrogen content of the medium. Both organisms were grown in BG11 medium for the first 6 days and thereafter grown in a modified BG11 medium completely deprived of nitrogen for 2 to 10 days. Nitrogen deprivation increased the  productivity of Chlorella minutissima to 20% and that of Chlorella pyrenoidosa to 17.6% by day 6. This was further coupled with carbon addition in the form of citric acid (5 g/L), sodium  (5 g/L), sodium carbonate (5 g/L), and sodium potassium tartarate (5 g/L), which increased the total  productivity of Chlorella minutissima up to 24% and that of Chlorella pyrenoidosa up to 23%. The highest  productivity of up to 24% for Chlorella minutissima and up to 23% for Chlorella pyrenoidosa was observed with nitrogen deprivation coupled with sodium . Acidic transesterification revealed the presence of fatty acid methyl esters, majority of which consisted of hexadecanoic acid methyl ester and octadecanoic acid methyl ester. Maximum of 3% fatty acid methyl esters for Chlorella minutissima and 4% for Chlorella pyrenoidosa were obtained under nitrogen deprivation and sodium  as a carbon source. Thus, nitrogen deprivation coupled with sodium  as an increased carbon source in BG11 medium helps to increase the  productivity of Chlorella minutissima and Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and produces long-chain fatty acid methyl esters of C17 and C19 along with C21, C25, and C29.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259170>Atmospheric pCO impacts leaf structural and physiological traits in Quercus petraea seedlings.</a></h2><p>Atmospheric p CO  impacts Quercus petraea biomass production and cell wall composition of the leaves in favor of cellulose at the expense of lignin, and enhances foliar non-structural carbohydrate levels and sucrose contents in a pCO  concentration-dependent manner. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.) was grown for ca. half a year from seeds at ambient control (525 ppm), 750, 900, and 1000 ppm atmospheric pCO under controlled conditions. Increasing pCO enhanced biomass production, modified the cell wall composition of the leaves in favor of cellulose at the expense of lignin, and enhanced the foliar non-structural carbohydrate level, in particular the sucrose content; as well as total N content of leaves by increased levels of all major N fractions, i.e., soluble proteins, total amino acids, and structural N. The enhanced total amino acid level was largely due to 2-ketoglutarate and oxalo -derived compounds. Increasing pCO alleviated oxidative stress in the leaves as indicated by reduced HO contents. High in vitro glutathione reductase activity at reduced HO contents suggests enhanced ROS scavenging, but increased  peroxidation may also have contributed, as indicated by a negative correlation between malone dialdehyde and HO contents. Almost all these effects were at least partially reversed, when pCO exceeded 750 or 900 ppm. Apparently, the interaction of atmospheric pCO with leaf structural and physiological traits of Q. petraea seedlings is characterized by a dynamic response depending on the pCO level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694691> and glucose  in hepatocyte cell lines and primary mouse hepatocytes: a comprehensive resource for in vitro studies of hepatic .</a></h2><p>The liver is a critical tissue for maintaining glucose, fatty acid, and cholesterol homeostasis. Primary hepatocytes represent the gold standard for studying the mechanisms controlling hepatic glucose, , and cholesterol  in vitro. However, access to primary hepatocytes can be limiting, and therefore, other immortalized hepatocyte models are commonly used. Here, we describe substrate  of cultured AML12, IHH, and PH5CH8 cells, hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HepG2s, and primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) to identify which of these cell lines most accurately phenocopy PMH basal and insulin-stimulated . Insulin-stimulated glucose  in PH5CH8 cells, and to a lesser extent AML12 cells, responded most similarly to PMH. Notably, glucose incorporation in HepG2 cells were 14-fold greater than PMH. The differences in glucose metabolic activity were not explained by differential protein expression of key regulators of these pathways, for example glycogen synthase and glycogen content. In contrast, fatty acid  in IHH cells was the closest to PMHs, yet insulin-responsive fatty acid  in AML12 and HepG2 cells was most similar to PMH. Finally, incorporation of  into intracellular-free cholesterol was comparable for all cells to PMH; however, insulin-stimulated glucose conversion into lipids and the incorporation of  into intracellular cholesterol esters were strikingly different between PMHs and all tested cell lines. In general, AML12 cells most closely phenocopied PMH in vitro energy . However, the cell line most representative of PMHs differed depending on the mode of  being investigated, and so careful consideration is needed in model selection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220598>Xiexin Tang ameliorates dyslipidemia in high-fat diet-induced obese rats via elevating gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids production and adjusting energy .</a></h2><p>Traditional herbal medicine has been taken as a new and effective approach to treat many chronic diseases. Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy  were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid  disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy  regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation. The study provided useful information for XXT in clinical application to treat obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Diet is a major factor driving the composition and  of the colonic microbiota. The aim of our study was to examine how a -rich and cholesterol-rich diet that, which leads to many metabolic disorders, affects the SCFA profile and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration. The experiment was carried out on 72 male, 8-weeks-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The study group (n = 30 rats) received high- and high cholesterol diet (HFHCh). The control group (n = 30) received standard food for laboratory rats. The rats from study and control groups were sacrificed after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after start of dietary exposure. The analysis of SFA in feces was performed using gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 1260 A GC). The exposure to high- and high-cholesterol diet was associated with significant changes in SCFA levels. Relative to the control, each of HFHCh subgroup revealed a statistically significant decrease in butyrate (12.5% ± 5.7% versus 32.8% ± 9.1%) and an increase in propionate level (45.4% ± 6.2% versus 19.14% ± 7.1%). The ratio of : propionate: butyrate was also changed (from 1.1: 0.6: 1 for control groups to 3 : 3,6 : 1 for HFHCh groups). The main SCFA in the HFHCh group was propionate instead of . The dietary exposure resulted in significant differences in LPS concentration. After 12 weeks of HFD exposure, LPS concentration was significantly higher compared to control groups (P < 0.05). Our study showed that HFHCh diet affected butyrate and propionate production associated with an increase in LPS secretion. The hypothesis that observed changes could result in intestinal imbalance secondary to gut barrier dysfunction requires further studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30695776>Osteoprotective Effect of Cimiracemate in Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis by Osteoprotegerin/Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κ B/Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-Β Ligand Signaling.</a></h2><p>Present investigation determines the protective effect of cimiracemate A against glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis rat.Osteoporosis was induced by injecting methylprednisolone  (21 mg/kg) for the period of 6 weeks, and the rats were treated with cimiracemate A 5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o. 60 min after the administration of methylprednisolone  (21 mg/kg) for the duration of 6 weeks. Effect of cimiracemate A was observed by estimating the microarchitecture of bone and histopathological changes by micro-CT scan and light microscope. Moreover,  profile, mediators of inflammation, and parameters that affect bone formation were determined in the serum and western blot assay, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was done for the estimation of protein expression in the bone tissues. Moreover, cytotoxic effect of cimiracemate A on bone marrow macrophages and bone marrow stromal cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.Result of the investigation suggests that treatment with cimiracemate A ameliorates the microarchitecture of bone and histopathological changes in the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis rat. Level of  and mediators of inflammation was significantly reduced in the serum of cimiracemate A-treated rats than the negative control group. However, the activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and the level of collagen type I fragments in the serum were found to be reduced, and osteocalcin level was enhanced in cimiracemate A-treated rats than the negative control group. Moreover, treatment with cimiracemate A attenuates the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) protein in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis rats.In conclusion, our study suggests that cimiracemate A protects the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis by regulating the RANKL/RANK/OPG signaling pathway.© 2019 S.

Herein, we questioned whether the NLRP3 inflammasome-activating cationic liposomes could promote antigen presentation and be applied as an immune adjuvant. In addition, we aimed to investigate the structure effect of lipid on triggering these immune responses.  A series of structurally similar lipids, consisting of arginine (Arg) head group and varied lengths of alkyl chains or spacers in between were used to prepare cationic liposomes. Lipopolysaccharide-primed human or murine macrophages or phorbol 12-myristate 13--primed THP-1 cells were treated with these liposomes, and interleukin (IL)-1β secretion was measured to quantify the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Lysosome rupture was examined in THP-1 cells by the fluorescence loss of acridine orange, a lysosome dye. Further, chicken ovalbumin (OVA) was loaded on the liposome surface and applied to murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), which activate OT-I and OT-II lymphocytes upon major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and class II-mediated antigen presentation, respectively. OT-I and OT-II cell division and IL-2 secretion were measured to evaluate the antigen presentation efficiency. The expressions of MHC molecules and co-stimulatory molecules ie, CD80, CD86, and CD40 on BMDCs were investigated by flow cytometry.  All the liposomes showed size distributions of 80-200 nm and zeta potentials of around 50 mV. A3C14 liposomes, consisting of Arg-C3-Glu2C14 lipids induced the most potent lysosome rupture and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. OVA-A3C14 also exhibited the most potent MHC class I- and class II-mediated antigen presentation in BMDCs without interfering MHC and co-stimulatory molecules.  The hydrophobic moieties of arginine-based liposomes are crucial in stimulating innate immune cells. A3C14 liposomes were non-immunogenic but strongly activated innate immune cells and promoted antigen presentation, and therefore can be applied as immune adjuvants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021671>Hepatic Vitamin A Concentrations in Vervets () Supplemented with Carotenoids Derived from Oil Palm.</a></h2><p>Commonly used in biomedical research, vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops) are omnivorous but primarily meet their vitamin A requirements from provitamin A carotenoids. Hypervitaminosis A has occurred in vervets that consume feed high in preformed vitamin A. We investigated the vitamin A status of vervets supplemented daily with various antioxidants derived from palm oil. Male vervets (n = 40) were placed for 23 wk on a high- diet (34.9% energy) containing 645 μ g retinol activity equivalents (RAE), with 515 μ g RAE from preformed vitamin A. Vervets were randomized to 5 treatments (duration, 20 mo): control; 100 mg d-α-tocopheryl ; 100 mg oil palm (Elaeis guineensis)-derived vitamin E; 50 mg oil palm-derived vitamin E + 50 mg carotenoid complex + unrestricted palm-derived water-soluble antioxidants; and 5) unrestricted water-soluble antioxidants. Livers (n = 38) were analyzed for vitamin A, α-retinol (α-vitamin A), and carotenoids. Median hepatic vitamin A and total carotenoid concentrations were 6.49 μ mol/g and 4.30 nmol/g, respectively. Compared with controls, vervets fed the carotenoid complex had higher hepatic vitamin A (11.9 ± 5.1 μ mol/g), α -vitamin A (1.3 ± 0.7 μ mol/g), α -carotene (11.5 ± 5.3 nmol/g), β-carotene (15.6 ± 8.6 nmol/g), and total carotenoids (28.1 ± 13.9 nmol/g) but lower lutein (0.66 ± 0.28 nmol/g) and zeaxanthin (0.24 ± 0.06 nmol). NHP may benefit from replacement of preformed vitamin A with carotenoids in feeds; however, bioconversion efficiency in these models should be investigated to determine optimal levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30878807>Nitrogen-dependent metabolic regulation of  production in microalga Scenedesmus vacuolatus.</a></h2><p>Microalga Scenedesmus vacuolatus exhibited maximum growth, protein and carbohydrate contents at 10.0 mM concentration of nitrate, 1.0 mM of glutamate nitrogen and at C/N ratio (12 mM +10 mM nitrate).

Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human  through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. , propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis,  oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile acid  and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30328404>Distribution of α-tocopherol stereoisomers in mink (Mustela vison) organs varies with the amount of all-rac-α-tocopheryl  in the diet.</a></h2><p>Synthetic α-tocopherol has eight isomeric configurations including four 2R (RSS, RRS, RSR, RRR) and four 2S (SRR, SSR, SRS, SSS). Only the RRR stereoisomer is naturally synthesised by plants. A ratio of 1·36:1 in biopotency of RRR-α-tocopheryl  to all-rac-α-tocopheryl  is generally accepted; however, studies indicate that neither biopotency of α-tocopherol stereoisomers nor bioavailability between them is constant, but depend on dose, time, animal species and organs. A total of forty growing young male mink were, after weaning, assigned one of the following treatments for 90 d: no α-tocopherol in diet (ALFA_0), 40 mg/kg RRR-α-tocopheryl  (NAT_40), 40 mg/kg all-rac-α-tocopheryl  (SYN_40) and 80 mg/kg feed all-rac-α-tocopheryl  (SYN_80). Mink were euthanised in CO2 and blood was collected by heart puncture. Mink were pelted and liver, heart, lungs, brain and abdominal  were collected for α-tocopherol stereoisomer analysis. The proportion of RRR-α-tocopherol decreased in all organs and plasma with increasing amount of synthetic α-tocopherol stereoisomers in the diet (P≤0·05), whereas the proportion of all synthetic α-tocopherol stereoisomers increased with increasing amount of synthetic α-tocopherol stereoisomers in the diet (P≤0·05). The proportion of α-tocopherol stereoisomers in plasma, brain, heart, lungs and abdominal  showed the following order: RRR>RRS, RSR, RSS>Σ2S, regardless of α-tocopherol supplement. The liver had the highest proportion of Σ2S stereoisomers, and lowest proportion of RRR-α-tocopherol. In conclusion, distribution of α-tocopherol stereoisomers differs with dose and form of α-tocopherol supplementation. The results did also reveal the liver's role as the major organ for accumulation of Σ2S α-tocopherol stereoisomers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341003> Droplets Mediate Salt Stress Tolerance in .</a></h2><p>Microalgae are known to respond to salinity stress via mechanisms that include accumulation of compatible solutes and synthesis of antioxidants. Here, we describe a salinity-tolerance mechanism mediated by  droplets (LDs). In the alga  grown under salt-stress conditions, we observed significant increases in cell size and LD content. LDs that were closely grouped along the plasma membrane shrank as the plasma membrane expanded, and some LDs were engulfed by vacuoles. Transcriptome analysis showed that genes encoding lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) and phospholipase A2 were significantly up-regulated following salt stress. Diacylglycerol kinase and LPLAT were identified in the proteome of salt-induced LDs, alongside vesicle trafficking and plastidial proteins and histone H2B. Analysis of fatty acid composition revealed an enrichment of C18:1 and C18:2 at the expense of C18:3 in response to salt stress. Pulse-chase experiments further suggested that variations of fatty acid composition were associated with LDs.  stimulation research further confirmed a positive role of LDs in cell growth under salt stress. These results suggest that LDs play important roles in salt-stress tolerance, through harboring proteins, participating in cytoplasmic component recycling, and providing materials and enzymes for membrane modification and expansion.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

However, little is known about their digestion. In this study, the digestive stability of resveratrol (RSV) esters with caprylic acid (RCAPs) in a model gastrointestinal digestion system was evaluated. The results demonstrated that RCAPs were relatively stable without hydrolysis in mouth and gastric phases. However, in the intestinal phase, pancreatic lipase rather than phospholipase A could hydrolyze monoester and diesters to free RSV. After 120 min of incubation at 37 °C, 53.68% of monoester and 11.36% of diesters were hydrolyzed. However, no hydrolysis of the triester was noticed. Obviously, the level of hydrolysis of RCAPs was negatively correlated with the degree of substitution. Therefore, it was speculated that RSV in fatty acid ester forms could partially be absorbed by intestinal lumen in the form of free RSV.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the potential neuroprotective role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) against lead  (PbAc)-induced neurotoxicity. Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups ( = 7) and treated as follows: the control group was injected with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl); the CoQ group was injected with CoQ (10 mg/kg); PbAc group was injected with PbAc (20 mg/kg); PbAc + CoQ group was injected first with PbAc, and after 1 h with CoQ. All groups were injected intraperitoneally for seven days. PbAc significantly increased cortical  peroxidation, nitrate/nitrite levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and decreased glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase activity and mRNA expression, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and homoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. PbAc also promoted the secretion of interleukin-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-α, inhibited interleukin-10 production, triggered the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and suppressed anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, PbAc increased the cortical levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate, and decreased the level of ATP. However, treatment with CoQ rescued cortical neurons from PbAc-induced neurotoxicity by restoring the balance between oxidants and antioxidants, activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suppressing inflammation, inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, and modulating cortical neurotransmission and energy . Altogether, our findings indicate that CoQ has beneficial effects against PbAc-induced neuronal damage through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30970255>Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Activity and Remodeling of Glycerophosphocholine Lipids Support Cytokine Induction in Response to Fungal Patterns.</a></h2><p>Increased glycolysis parallels immune cell activation, but the role of pyruvate remains largely unexplored. We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and  rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the  mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty acid remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic  during cytokine induction.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the specific interplay between KYDS and intestinal microbiota, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of You-gui pill (YGP) on KYDS' gut microbiota remains largely unknown so far.In the present study, fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were used to explore the mutual effect between KYDS and intestinal flora, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of YGP on KYDS's gut microbiota. Rats' feces from control (CON) group, KYDS group and YGP group were collected, and metabolomic analysis was performed using H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis to obtain differential metabolites. Simultaneously, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the stool samples and to screen for the significant altered microbiota at the genus level. After that, MetaboAnalyst database and PICRUSt software were apply to conduct metabolic pathway analysis and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota, respectively. What's more, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on these differential metabolites and gut microbiota.Using fecal metabonomics, KYDS was found to be associated with 21 differential metabolites and seven potential metabolic pathways. These metabolites and metabolic pathways were mainly involved in amino acid , energy , methylamine , bile acid  and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty acid . Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut microbiota were mostly involved in amino acid , energy , nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, , and carbohydrate . Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, , taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various metabolic disorders (amino acid , energy , especially methylamine , bile acid  and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid . nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, , and carbohydrate ). YGP, however, had the ability to mediate four kinds of microbes (i.e. Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-007, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, and uncultured_bacterium_f_Bacteroidales_S24-7_group) and ten related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, valine, isoleucine, alanine, citrulline, , DMA, TMA, phenylalanine and tryptophan) mediated amino acid , especially methylamine , bile acid  and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid , endocrine, immune and digestive system, and , thereby exerting a therapeutic effect on KYDS rats.Overall, our findings have preliminary confirmed that KYDS is closely related to metabolic and microbial dysbiosis, whereas YGP can improve the metabolic disorder of KYDS by acting on intestinal microbiota.

Understanding the physiological effects of these and other regimens is important.To evaluate the safety of abiraterone  with 4 glucocorticoid regimens.Open-label, randomized clinical trial (1:1:1:1) of 164 men with mCRPC from 22 hospitals in 5 countries who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention groups between June 2013 and October 2014. Analyses were conducted from August 2017 to June 2018.Abiraterone , 1000 mg, once daily with prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily (n = 41), 5 mg once daily (n = 41), 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 40), or dexamethasone, 0.5 mg, once daily (n = 42).Primary end point was no mineralocorticoid excess (grade ≥1 hypokalemia or grade ≥2 hypertension) through 24 weeks (6 cycles) from treatment.Of 164 men (median [range] age, 70 [50-90] years) randomized to receive abiraterone , 1000 mg, daily with prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily, once daily, or 2.5 mg twice daily, or dexamethasone, 0.5 mg, once daily, 24 (70.6%) of 34 patients (95% CI, 53.8%-83.2%), 14 (36.8%) of 38 patients (95% CI, 23.4%-52.7%), 21 (60.0%) of 35 patients (95% CI, 43.6%-74.4%), and 26 (70.3%) of 37 patients (95% CI, 54.2%-82.5%), respectively, had no mineralocorticoid excess. Plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone and urinary mineralocorticoid metabolites after 8 weeks were higher with prednisone, 2.5 mg, twice daily and 5 mg once daily than with 5 mg twice daily or dexamethasone, 0.5 mg, once daily. The level of urinary glucocorticoid metabolites appeared higher in patients who did not meet the primary end point, regardless of glucocorticoid regimen. Total lean body mass decreased in the prednisone groups and total body fat increased in the prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily and dexamethasone groups. In the dexamethasone group, there was an increase in serum insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, while total bone mineral density decreased. In the prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily, 5 mg once daily, 2.5 mg twice daily, and dexamethasone groups, median radiographic progression-free survival was 18.5, 15.3, 12.8, and 26.6 months, respectively.Abiraterone  with prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily or dexamethasone, 0.5 mg, once daily met the prespecified threshold for the primary end point (95% CI excluded 50% mineralocorticoid excess); abiraterone  with prednisone, 5 mg, once daily or 2.5 mg twice daily did not meet the threshold. Abiraterone  in combination with dexamethasone appeared to be particularly active but may be associated with adverse  consequences.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30136442>Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase gene ChAcs1 is essential for , carbon utilization and virulence of the hemibiotrophic fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum.</a></h2><p>Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a key molecule that participates in many biochemical reactions in amino acid, protein, carbohydrate and . Here, we genetically dissected the distinct roles of two acetyl-CoA synthetase genes, ChAcs1 and ChAcs2, in the regulation of fermentation,  and virulence of the hemibiotrophic fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum. ChAcs1 and ChAcs2 are both highly expressed during appressorial development and the formation of primary hyphae, and are constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm throughout development. We found that C. higginsianum strains without ChAcs1 were non-viable in the presence of most non-fermentable carbon sources, including , ethanol and acetaldehyde. Deletion of ChAcs1 also led to a decrease in  content of mycelia and delayed  mobilization in conidia to developing appressoria, which suggested that ChAcs1 contributes to  in C. higginsianum. Furthermore, a ChAcs1 deletion mutant was defective in the switch to invasive growth, which may have been directly responsible for its reduced virulence. Transcriptomic analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that ChAcs1 can affect the expression of genes involved in virulence and carbon , and that plant defence genes are up-regulated, all demonstrated during infection by a ChAcs1 deletion mutant. In contrast, deletion of ChAcs2 only conferred a slight delay in  mobilization, although it was highly expressed in infection stages.

Twenty-four Holstein cows [130.3 ± 15.4 d in milk, and 30.8 ± 0.543 kg/d of milk yield (mean ± standard error)] were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment to evaluate the following treatments: control diet, without addition of ALG; and increasing levels of ALG [2, 4, and 6 g/kg of dry matter (DM)]. The ALG decreased DM intake and increased total-tract DM apparent digestibility. A tendency was observed for a quadratic effect on total-tract NDF digestibility by ALG inclusion, with peak value of the quadratic response at 4.13 g/kg of DM dose. Moreover, ALG increased ruminal pH and decreased  and total volatile fatty acid concentrations. -corrected milk and energy-corrected milk were quadratically affected, and a tendency for a milk yield effect was observed when ALG levels increased, whereas maximal yields were observed with intermediate doses. Milk , protein, and lactose concentrations were diminished, whereas productive efficiency was improved by the increase of ALG levels. Saturated fatty acid proportions were decreased, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acid proportions were increased when ALG was fed. There was low DHA transfer into milk; however, ALG inclusion decreased C18:0, C18:1 cis-9, C18:2 cis-9,12, and C18:3 cis-9,12,15 proportions, and increased C18:2 cis-9,trans-11, C18:1 trans-9, and C18:1 trans-11 proportions. Gross energy intake was decreased, whereas no effect was observed on digestible, metabolizable, or net energy intake. The ALG inclusion quadratically affected the microbial protein synthesis, with maximal enhancement at 3.24 g/kg of DM dose, and also increased serum cholesterol concentration. Under the conditions of this experiment, the inclusion of ALG in diets for mid-lactating dairy cows decreased feed intake and increased nutrient digestibility, improving productive efficiency and modifying milk fatty acid profile. Estimated intermediate doses (1.22 to 2.90 g/kg of DM) of DHA-rich ALG may be beneficial to milk, -corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk yields, and is recommended for dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

A dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase, TAG accumulation regulator 1 (TAR1) has been shown to be required for -dependent TAG accumulation and the degradation of chlorophyll and photosynthesis-related proteins in photomixotrophic nitrogen (N)-deficient conditions (Kajikawa etï¿½al. 2015). However, this previous report only examined particular condition. Here, we report that in photoautotrophic N-deficient conditions, tar1-1 cells, with a mutation in the TAR1 gene, maintained higher levels of cell viability and lower levels of hydrogen peroxide generation and accumulated higher levels of TAG and starch compared with those of wild type (WT) cells with bubbling of air containing 5% carbon dioxide. Transcriptomic analyses suggested that genes involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species are not repressed in tar1-1 cells. In contrast, the mating efficiency and mRNA levels of key regulatory genes for gametogenesis, MID, MTD and FUS, were suppressed in tar1-1 cells. Among the TAR1-dependent phosphopeptides deduced by phosphoproteomic analysis, protein kinases and enzymes related to N assimilation and carbon (C)  are of particular interest. Characterization of these putative downstream factors may elucidate the molecular pathway whereby TAR1 mediates cellular propagation and C and N  in C/N-imbalanced stress conditions.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2019.

Our study aimed to evaluate OS and HSR in lymphocytes treated with S. lentiscifolius bark extracts. S. lentiscifolius barks were partitioned with solvents to obtain hexane (SL-HEX), ethyl  (SL-ACOET) and methanol (SL-MEOH) extracts, and the presence of bioactive compounds was evaluated by thin layer chromatography. Total phenols were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method and flavonoids were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS. Antioxidant capacity was verified by DPPH method, cell viability by Trypan Blue method,  peroxidation by TBARS and HSP70 by immunoblotting. The SL-ACOET extract presented higher content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in vitro. It was able to reduce  peroxidation levels in lymphocytes induced by H O and improved cell viability. The SL-ACOET extract inhibited HSR by a decrease in both intracellular content and release of 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) and also by decrease extra-to-intracellular HSP70 ratio in lymphocytes submitted to heat shock (2 h, 41 °C). S. lentiscifolius bark extract has antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect on HSR probably due to the presence of polyphenols as the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol.© 2019 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615062> Affects the Process of  in Rabbit Liver, Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (a microbial fermentation production in the rabbit gut) have an important role in many physiological processes, which may be related to the reduced body  of rabbits.

Sows were fed either a control diet (CON) consisting of a standard gestation diet (14.6% DF) until day 108 of gestation and a transition diet (16.8% DF) from day 109 of gestation until farrowing or a high DF treatment where part of the daily ration was replaced with a high DF supplement (FIB). The FIB sows received 19.3% and 21.7% DF in the last 2 wk prior to farrowing. Sows were surgically implanted with permanent indwelling catheters at day 75 ± 2 of gestation and blood samples were collected at 6 different time points in late gestation and at 11 different time points within 24 h after the onset of farrowing. Colostrum samples were collected at 0, 12, and 24 h after the onset of farrowing. Arterial concentration of  (P = 0.05) and colostral  content (P = 0.009) were greater in FIB sows compared with CON sows. Plasma IgG dropped from day -10 relative to farrowing (P < 0.001), suggesting an uptake by the mammary glands. Mammary plasma flow (P = 0.007) and net mammary uptake of glucose (P = 0.04) increased during farrowing while dietary treatment had no effect on net mammary uptake of other energy substrates during late gestation and farrowing. The net mammary uptake of carbon from glucogenic precursors did not equate to the sum of carbons secreted in colostral lactose and released as CO2, indicating that carbons from ketogenic precursors were likely used for colostral  and for oxidation. Mammary nonprotein carbon uptake matched the mammary output, indicating that the majority of colostral  and lactose were produced after the onset of farrowing. In conclusion, high DF included in the diet for late gestating sows increased colostral  content by 49% but this substantial dietary response could not be explained by the increased carbon uptake from short chain fatty acids during the colostral period. The nonprotein carbon balance of mammary glands during farrowing suggests that the majority of colostral  and lactose were produced after the onset of farrowing, whereas the drop in plasma IgG in late gestation suggests that the mammary glands take up this colostral component prior to farrowing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30053409>Hydroxytyrosol butyrate inhibits 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis through activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 axis in SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h2><p>Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a polyphenol contained in olives and exhibits antioxidant activity. We herein investigated the effects of HT and its derivatives, hydroxytyrosol  (HT-A) and hydroxytyrosol butyrate (HT-B), on the protection of neuronal cells against apoptosis induced by the Parkinson's disease-related neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with HT-B, but not HT or HT-A significantly reduced the 6-OHDA-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of caspase-3, and subsequent cell death. HT-B also induced the protein expression of the transcription factor, NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and its transcriptional activation, resulting in the up-regulated expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which conferred neuroprotection against 6-OHDA-induced oxidative damage. Furthermore, three cysteine residues, Cys151, Cys273, and Cys288 in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) were necessary for the HT-B-induced activation of Nrf2. Collectively, the present results demonstrated that HT-B, harboring higher  solubility than HT and HT-A, effectively elicited adaptive responses to oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 axis in neuronal cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, the shade dried leaves and stem were extracted in three different solvents such as ethyl , ethanol, and hydro-alcoholic. The antioxidant efficacy of these extracts was confirmed by using different in vitro assays: DPPH free radical scavenging, superoxide radical scavenging,  peroxidation, metal ion chelating capability and reducing power determination. Total phenol content was maximum in hydro alcoholic extract of leaf (540.37 mg per g of gallic acid equivalents) and stem (330.51 mg per g of gallic acid equivalents) while flavonoid content was maximum in ethanolic extract of leaf (305 mg per gram of rutin equivalents) and ethyl  extract of stem (170.6 mg per gram of rutin equivalents). The antioxidant activity of these extracts was positively correlated with their total phenol and flavonoid content.

Previous results offered no convincing support for these differences being related to relevant changes in the milk fatty acid (FA) profile, including potentially antilipogenic FA, or in the transcript abundance of candidate genes involved in mammary lipogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that alterations in the processes of rumen biohydrogenation and fermentation, as well as in the bacterial community structure, might account for individual variation in fish oil-induced MFD severity. To test this explanation, 15 ewes received a total mixed ration without  supplementation (control; n = 5) or supplemented with 20 g of fish oil/kg of dry matter [10 animals divided into those showing a strong (RESPON+; -25.4%; n = 5) or a mild (RESPON-; -7.7%; n = 5) decrease in milk  concentration] for 5 wk. Rumen fermentation parameters, biohydrogenation metabolites, and bacterial structure and diversity were analyzed in rumen samples collected before and after treatments. Although the fish oil supplementation increased the concentration of demonstrated or putative antilipogenic FA (e.g., cis-9 16:1, cis-11 18:1, or trans-10,cis-12 CLA), surprisingly, none of them differed significantly in relation to the extent of MFD (i.e., between RESPON- and RESPON+), and this was the case only for a few minor FA (e.g., cis-6+7 16:1 or 17:0 anteiso). Changes in total volatile FA, , and propionate concentrations were associated with MFD severity, with higher decreases in more susceptible animals. Individual responses were not related to shifts in rumen bacterial structure but some terminal restriction fragments compatible with Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Succiniclasticum showed greater abundances in RESPON-, whereas some others that may correspond to Prevotella, Mogibacterium, and Quinella-related spp. were more abundant in RESPON+. Overall, the results suggest that individual variation in MFD severity in dairy ewes fed fish oil cannot be fully explained by differences in the processes of rumen biohydrogenation and fermentation or in the bacterial community, and further research would be necessary to elucidate the large variability in the responsiveness to MFD-inducing marine lipids.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

In microalgae, this process is important for re-growth when conditions become favorable after cells have experienced stresses. Mobilization of TAG is initiated by actions of lipases causing the release of glycerol and free fatty acids, which can be further broken down for energy production or recycled to synthesize membrane lipids. Although key enzymes in the process, TAG lipases remain to be characterized in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Here, we describe the functional analysis of a putative TAG lipase, i.e. LIP4, which shares 44% amino acid identity with the major TAG lipase in Arabidopsis (SUGAR DEPENDENT1-SDP1). The LIP4 transcript level was downregulated during nitrogen deprivation when TAG accumulates, but was upregulated during nitrogen resupply (NR) when TAG was degraded. Both artificial microRNA and insertional mutants showed a delay in TAG mobilization during NR. The difference in TAG degradation was more pronounced when the cultures were incubated without  in the dark. Furthermore, the lip4 insertional mutants over-accumulated TAG during optimal growth conditions. Taken together, the results suggest to us that LIP4 likely acts as a TAG lipase and plays a role in TAG homeostasis in Chlamydomonas.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2019.

Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur as a consequence of this activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study of changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Sample preparation and spectral analysis protocols were optimised using neutrophils isolated by Ficoll-Paque, with decreased washing steps and inclusion of a heat-shock step to quench metabolite turnover. Cells were incubated ± PMA for 15 min in HEPES-free media and samples were analysed by NMR using a 700 MHz NMR Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to process spectra and identify metabolites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Metaboanalyst. Cell number and number of scans (NS) were optimised as >3.6 million cells and 512 NS. 327 spectral bins were defined in the neutrophil spectra, of which 287 (87.7%) were assigned to 110 metabolites that included: amino acids, peptides and analogues; carbohydrates, carbonyls and alcohols; nucleotides, nucleosides and analogues; lipids and -like molecules; benzenoids; and other organic compounds. 43 metabolites changed at least 1.5 fold (increase or decrease) after the addition of PMA for 5 or 15 min. Pathway analysis revealed that PMA affected nicotinate and nicotinamide , aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and glycolysis, suggesting a redirection of glucose  from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and production of NADPH for activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent respiratory burst. We have developed protocols for the study of human neutrophils by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, this methodology has sufficient sensitivity and reproducibility to detect changes in metabolite abundance from cell numbers typically collected from clinical samples or experiments with multiple assay conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071087>Improved glucose  by Eragrostis tef potentially through beige adipocyte formation and attenuating adipose tissue inflammation.</a></h2><p>Teff is a staple food in Ethiopia that is rich in dietary fiber.

The role of oat extract as prophylactic in treating acute liver injury is not thoroughly established. We, therefore, hypothesized that oat extract would exert protective effect against alcohol-induced acute liver injury in a mouse model. To test this hypothesis, male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with phenolic-enriched ethyl  (EA) fraction of oats (prepared by fractionating aqueous ethanolic extract with solvents of increasing polarity) at dosages of 125 and 250 mg kg d for 12 consecutive days. Acute liver injury was induced by administering 5 doses of 50% ethanol intragastrically (10 g/kg body weight) to mice at an interval of 12 hours. The alcohol-induced liver injury was evaluated by measuring serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, antioxidant parameters, mitochondrial function, and histology of liver tissue. Our results demonstrated that pretreatment with EA fraction at 250 mg kg d significantly (P < .001 for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive species and P < .01 for lactate dehydrogenase and nitrites) reduced the levels of liver injury markers and significantly (P < .001 for glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase; P < .01 for catalase, superoxide dismustase, and vitamin C; P < .05 for reduced glutathione and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) increased the levels of antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, EA-pretreated mice showed mechanistic inhibition of nuclear factor κB signaling pathway through decreased phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα.

Mechanistic studies also revealed that propionate-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation can be ascribed to Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the propionate receptor GPR43 prevented propionate-inducible activation of AMPK and abrogates the gluconeogenesis-inhibitory action. Thus, our data indicate that the binding of propionate to hepatic GPR43 elicits CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK through intracellular Ca increase, leading to suppression of gluconeogenesis. The present study suggests the potential efficacy of propionate in preventive and therapeutic management of diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-four Doper × Small Tail Han ewes (6-7 months of age; 29.07 ± 2.28 kg initial body weight) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for a 47 d feeding period. Treatments consisted of the sheep diet supplemented with 0% ABP-control, 10% ABP, or 15% ABP of the diet (dry matter basis). Blood samples were collected on days 0, 15, 30, and 45 of the feeding period. APB supplementation did not affect growth performance and apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, and acid detergent fibre ( > 0.05). However, ether extract digestibility was decreased in the 10% ABP group and increased in the 15% ABP group ( < 0.001), and both 10% ABP and 15% ABP decreased the neutral detergent fibre digestibility (=0.005). Feeding ABP increased rumen pH ( < 0.001) and ammonia N ( < 0.001) and decreased concentrations of  (=0.007) and propionate (=0.001) which resultantly increased the -to-propionate ratio ( < 0.001) in ruminal fluid. There were no interaction effects between treatment and sampling time for plasma metabolites and immunity ( > 0.05). However, inclusion of dietary 10% ABP decreased concentrations of plasma cholesterol (=0.043). Also, plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein decreased on days 30 and 45 (=0.017) of the feeding period. Metabolite concentrations of total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea N, glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and humoral immune indicators were not affected ( > 0.05) by dietary ABP supplementation. The results suggest that ABP could be reclaimed through dietary inclusion in animal feed since it had beneficial effects on rumen fermentation patterns and  and had no adverse effects on performance and humoral immunity in sheep.Copyright © 2019 Abedin Abdallah et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927246>Sodium Orthovanadate Changes Fatty Acid Composition and Increased Expression of Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Vanadium compounds are promising antidiabetic agents. In addition to regulating glucose , they also alter . Due to the clear association between diabetes and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty acid composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic acid and stearic acid, as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-oleic acid and palmitoleic acid. Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA. This was associated with a lack of influence on the expression of FADS1 and FADS2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30345946>Cereals level and source effects on rumen fermentation, colostrum and milk properties, and blood metabolites in periparturient ewes.</a></h2><p>Optimal type and dietary inclusion rates of cereal grains for periparturient sheep are unknown. The objective was to determine effects of feeding diets with high (H) v. low (L) levels of ground corn grain (CN) v. combined ground wheat and barley grains (WB) on intake, rumen fermentation, colostrum and milk properties, and blood metabolites of periparturient sheep. Twenty Afshari×Merino ewes were used in a completely randomized design study from 24 days prepartum through 21 days postpartum. Ewes were kept indoors in individual boxes and received once daily at 0900 h total mixed rations. Treatments were mixed rations containing either (1) H or (2) L concentrate based on either (1) 100% CN or (2) 50 : 50 ratio of ground wheat : ground barley grains in a 2×2 factorial arrangement. Each treatment group had five ewes including two twin-lamb ewes and three single-lamb ewes. Postpartal dry matter intake (DMI) increased by feeding high CN v. high and low WB, while high v. low CN improved postpartum DMI. The DMI during lambing tended to increase with the high v. low WB. Feeding CN v. WB, and feeding both CN and WB at L v. H level increased fecal pH. Postpartal rumen pH was lower with the high v. low WB (5.7 v. 6.2). Rumen concentrations of propionate were lower and of  were higher with L v. H grain levels. Increased dietary grain reduced urine pH for WB (7.24 v. 7.83) but not for CN (7.63 v. 7.52) prepartum. Colostrum properties, postpartal urine pH, lamb weight at birth and 21 days of age, and placental weight and expulsion time were unaffected. Milk yield increased and milk  yield tended to increase by H v. L grain diets. Plasma glucose was increased by feeding high v. low WB, whereas CN v. WB tended to reduce peripartal plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and increased insulin to NEFA ratio. In conclusion, more cereal grains can be included in periparturient sheep diets and CN instead of WB may be fed to periparturient sheep to improve energy status. Findings suggest opportunities to optimize periparturient ewe physiology and performance through feeding certain cereals and avoiding high levels of WB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30223427>The Effect of Long-Term Administration of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Inhibitor URB597 on Oxidative  in the Heart of Rats with Primary and Secondary Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor [3-(3-carbamoylphenyl)phenyl] -cyclohexylcarbamate (URB597) may influence redox balance and blood pressure through the modulation of endocannabinoids levels. Therefore, this study aimed to compare changes in oxidative  and apoptosis in the hearts of rats with spontaneous hypertension (SHR) and secondary hypertension (11-deoxycorticosterone ; DOCA-salt rats) treated by URB597 via intraperitoneal injection for 14 days. The results showed that URB597 decreased the activity of NADPH and xanthine oxidases in both groups of rats. Moreover, in the heart of SHR rats, URB597 led to an increase of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant activity and levels (catalase, vitamin C, glutathione/glutathione disulfide [GSH/GSSG]) and upregulation of the thioredoxin system; however, NRf2 expression was downregulated. The opposite effect in relation to Nrf2 activity and the thioredoxin system was observed in DOCA-salt rats after URB597 administration. Despite improvement in antioxidant parameters, URB597 enhanced oxidative modifications of phospholipids (4-hydroxynonenal and isoprostanes) and proteins (carbonyl groups) in SHR heart, whereas 4-hydroxynonenal and carbonyl groups levels decreased in the heart of DOCA-salt rats. Obtained results suggest that examined  mediators are involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-independent and PPAR-dependent modulation of cardiac inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase 3 and 9) was observed after URB597 administration in the heart of both groups of hypertensive rats, whereas expression of the antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2) increased in SHR rats. Long-term administration of URB597 altered cardiac redox status depending on the type of hypertension. URB597 enhanced oxidative  and reduced pro-apoptotic factors in the heart of SHR rats, increasing the probability of heart metabolic disorders occurrence or progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373210>Identification of Salt Stress Responding Genes Using Transcriptome Analysis in Green Alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</a></h2><p>Salinity is one of the most important abiotic stresses threatening plant growth and agricultural productivity worldwide. In green alga , physiological evidence indicates that saline stress increases intracellular peroxide levels and inhibits photosynthetic-electron flow.

PAF-R agonists have been shown to modulate tumorigenesis and/or tumor growth in various skin cancer models by suppressing either cutaneous inflammation and/or anti-tumoral adaptive immunity. We have previously shown that a chronic systemic PAF-R agonist administration of mice enhances the growth of subcutaneously implanted melanoma tumors. Conversely, chronic topical applications of a PAF-R agonist suppressed non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in a topical chemical carcinogenesis model (dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/phorbol 12-myristate 13- (DMBA/PMA)) in-part via anti-inflammatory effects. These results indicate that the context of PAF-R agonist exposure via either chronic cutaneous or systemic administration, result in seemingly disparate effects on tumor promotion. To further dissect the contextual role of PAF-R agonism on tumorigenesis, we chronically administered systemic PAF-R agonist, carbamoyl-PAF (CPAF) to mice under a cutaneous chemical carcinogenesis protocol, recently characterized to initiate both NMSC and melanocytic nevus formation that can progress to malignant melanoma.

Alisol B 23-, one of the abundant triterpenes in ZX, was used as the marker of quality control for ZX in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, while it could not reflect the -lowering effect because other triterpenes in ZX also had prominent medicinal efficacy. To identify the significantly bioactive triterpenes in ZX, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based characteristic chemical profile (CCP)-support vector machine (SVM) model was used to explore the relationship between triterpenes and -lowering effect of ZX. Firstly, the content of 87 targeted triterpenes was quantified by the MRM-based CCP using UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS. Secondly, the -lowering effect of 30 ZX samples was assessed by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Thirdly, 9 of the 87 triterpenes possessing high mean impact value were identified to have significant -lowering effect via the particle swarm-optimized SVM model. The new SVM model constructed by the 9 triterpenes showed good prediction performance and the overall prediction accuracy reached 81.94%. Finally, the real activity of these triterpenes was partly confirmed and was consistent with the prediction of SVM. These results showed that the method for discovery of triterpenes with prominent -lowering activity in ZX was reliable. The proposed method is expected to provide an efficient and rapid approach for screening of active component and drug discovery in traditional herbs.

It is commonly believed that nitrogen starvation triggers a metabolic shift that reroutes carbon flux from Krebs cycles to lipogenesis. In this study, we systematically surveyed and dynamically profiled the transcriptional activity of 22 lipogenic promoters aiming to delineate a picture how nitrogen starvation regulates lipogenesis in Y. lipolytica. These lipogenic promoters drive the expression of critical pathways that are responsible for the generation of reducing equivalents (NADPH), carbon backbones (acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, DHAP, etc.), synthesis and degradation of fatty acids. Specifically, our investigated promoters span across an array of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, Krebs cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, mannitol cycle, glutamine-GABA cycle, fatty acid and  synthesis, glyoxylate, β-oxidation, and POM (pyruvate-oxaloacetate-malate) cycle. Our work provides evidences that mannitol cycle, glutamine-GABA cycle and amino acid degradation, pyruvate oxidation, and  assimilation pathways are lipogenesis-related steps involved in generating cytosolic NADPH and acetyl-CoA precursors. This systematic investigation and dynamic profiling of lipogenic promoters may help us better understand lipogenesis, facilitate the formulation of structure-based kinetic models, as well as develop efficient cell factories for fuels and chemical production in oleaginous species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021760>Efficacy of two vitamin E formulations in patients with abetalipoproteinemia and chylomicron retention disease.</a></h2><p>Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) and chylomicron retention disease (CMRD) are extremely rare recessive forms of hypobetalipoproteinemia characterized by intestinal  malabsorption and severe vitamin E deficiency. Vitamin E is often supplemented in the form of -soluble vitamin E , but  malabsorption considerably limits correction of the deficiency. In this crossover study, we administered two different forms of vitamin E, tocofersolan (a water-soluble derivative of RRR-α-tocopherol) and α-tocopherol , to three patients with ABL and four patients with CMRD. The aims of this study were to evaluate the intestinal absorption characteristics of tocofersolan versus α-tocopherol  by measuring the plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol over time after a single oral load and to compare efficacy by evaluating the ability of each formulation to restore vitamin E storage after 4 months of treatment. In patients with ABL, tocofersolan and α-tocopherol  bioavailabilities were extremely low (2.8% and 3.1%, respectively). In contrast, bioavailabilities were higher in patients with CMRD (tocofersolan, 24.7%; α-tocopherol , 11.4%). Plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol at 4 months were not significantly different by formulation type in ABL or CMRD.

Initially, a batch fermentation in vitro study (experiment 1) was performed to investigate the effects of the 3 berry residues on basic ruminal fermentation parameters. Total volatile fatty acid concentrations, including , propionate, and butyrate, increased in the BC group compared with other treatments. Based on the preliminary in vitro results, 2 consecutive in vivo experiments were conducted using 4 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows fitted with rumen cannulas (experiment 2) and 30 lactating Polish Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (experiment 3) in a replicated 2 × 2 crossover design. Cows in both experiments received a partial mixed ration (PMR) in 2 variants: (1) a control diet of PMR + 2 kg of concentrate (control); (2) PMR + 2 kg of BC seed residues (BC). The BC diet did not mitigate ruminal methane production. Ruminal fermentation (experiment 2) was not affected by the BC diet; however, the concentrations of C18:1 trans-11 and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 increased significantly by 91 and 131%, respectively. Likewise, concentrations of total trans C18:1 and total monounsaturated FA in ruminal fluid were increased significantly by BC seed residues. In experiment 3, BC significantly increased milk  C18:1 trans-11, C18:2 cis-9,trans-11, n-3, n-6, and polyunsaturated FA concentrations without affecting milk production performance. In conclusion, the amount (2 kg/d) of BC used in this study did not adversely affect ruminal fermentation or milk production and composition. However, using BC increased proportions of unsaturated FA and conjugated linoleic acid in milk. Although dietary BC did not exert a strong methane inhibition effect, it could represent an inexpensive alternative concentrate to improve beneficial FA in milk without negative effects on rumen fermentation and production parameters in dairy cows. Incorporation of berry seed residues in diets would be profitable economically and nutritionally for dairy cattle production.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In previous study, we identified an intronic variant rs2256368:A>G, whose G allele promotes exon 20 skipping in up to 43% of ACSL5 transcripts but its functional relevance is unclear. Here, we compared the expression of splice (Spl) and nonsplice (NSpl) ACSL5 variants and the effect on cell viability under culture conditions that force cells to metabolize fatty acids. We found that lymphoblastoid cell lines from 1000 Genomes Project, bearing Spl genotypes, showed a reduced expression of total ACSL5 protein due to an inefficient translation of the Spl RNA. These cells impaired growth in cultures with phorbol myristate -ionomycin (PMA-Io) or medium deprived of glucose, while production of reactive oxygen species increased in PMA-Io.

Upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and increased cholesterol release to apoA-I and HDL (78 ± 17%, 40 ± 9%, respectively) were also observed in GDM versus control HPEC. The LXR antagonist GGPP reversed ABCA1 and ABCG1 upregulation and reduced the increased cholesterol efflux in GDM HPEC. Similar total cellular cholesterol levels were detected in control and GDM HPEC, while GDM enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis along with upregulated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that in GDM cellular cholesterol homeostasis in the fetoplacental endothelium is modulated via LXR activation and helps to maintain its proper functionality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

PCC 6803. Growth rate, intracellular pigment contents including chlorophyll a and carotenoids, and oxygen evolution rate of all overexpressing (OX) strains were normally similar as wild type. For fatty acid compositions, saturated fatty acid, in particular palmitic acid (16:0) was dominantly increased in OX strains whereas slight increases of unsaturated fatty acids were observed, specifically linoleic acid (18:2) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3). The plsC/plsX-overexpressing (OX + XC) strain produced high  content of about 24.3%w/dcw under normal condition and was further enhanced up to 39.1%w/dcw by  induction. This OX + XC engineered strain was capable of decreasing phaA transcript level which related to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis under  treatment. Moreover, the expression level of gene transcripts revealed that the plsX- and plsC/plsX-overexpression strains had also increased accA transcript amounts which involved in the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Altogether, these overexpressing strains significantly augmented higher  contents when compared to wild type by partly overcoming the limitation of  production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364232>Glucagon-like peptide-2 mobilizes lipids from the intestine by a systemic nitric oxide-independent mechanism.</a></h2><p>To test the hypothesis that gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) mobilizes intestinal triglyceride (TG) stores and stimulates chylomicron secretion by a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism in humans.In a randomized, single-blind, cross-over study, 10 healthy male volunteers ingested a high- formula followed, 7 hours later, by one of three treatments: NO synthase inhibitor L-N -monomethyl arginine  (L-NMMA) + GLP-2 analogue teduglutide, normal saline + teduglutide, or L-NMMA + placebo.

L-NMMA significantly attenuated teduglutide-induced enhancement of mesenteric blood flow but not TG mobilization and chylomicron secretion.GLP-2 mobilization of TG stores and stimulation of chylomicron secretion from the small intestine appears to be independent of systemic NO in humans.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849923>Hydroxytyrosol Ameliorates Endothelial Function under Inflammatory Conditions by Preventing Mitochondrial Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria are fundamental organelles producing energy and reactive oxygen species (ROS); their impaired functions play a key role in endothelial dysfunction. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a well-known olive oil antioxidant, exerts health benefits against vascular diseases by improving endothelial function. However, the HT role in mitochondrial oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction is not clear yet. To investigate the HT effects on mitochondrial ROS production in the inflamed endothelium, we used an  model of endothelial dysfunction represented by cultured endothelial cells, challenged with phorbol myristate  (PMA), an inflammatory, prooxidant, and proangiogenic agent. We found that the pretreatment of endothelial cells with HT (1-30 mol/L) suppressed inflammatory angiogenesis, a crucial aspect of endothelial dysfunction. The HT inhibitory effect is related to reduced mitochondrial superoxide production and  peroxidation and to increased superoxide dismutase activity. HT, in a concentration-dependent manner, improved endothelial mitochondrial function by reverting the PMA-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP synthesis, and ATP5 expression. In PMA-challenged endothelial cells, HT also promoted mitochondrial biogenesis through increased mitochondrial DNA content and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A. These results highlight that HT blunts endothelial dysfunction and pathological angiogenesis by ameliorating mitochondrial function, thus suggesting HT as a potential mitochondria-targeting antioxidant in the inflamed endothelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098126>The effects of dietary supplementation with inulin and inulin-propionate ester on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate, produced through fermentation of dietary fibre by the gut microbiota, has been shown to alter hepatic metabolic processes that reduce  storage. We aimed to investigate the impact of raising colonic propionate production on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Eighteen adults were randomized to receive 20 g/d of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to deliver propionate to the colon, or an inulin control for 42 days in a parallel design. The change in intrahepatocellular  (IHCL) following the supplementation period was not different between the groups (P = 0.082), however, IHCL significantly increased within the inulin-control group (20.9% ± 2.9% to 26.8% ± 3.9%; P = 0.012; n = 9), which was not observed within the IPE group (22.6% ± 6.9% to 23.5% ± 6.8%; P = 0.635; n = 9). The predominant SCFA from colonic fermentation of inulin is , which, in a background of NAFLD and a hepatic metabolic profile that promotes  accretion, may provide surplus lipogenic substrate to the liver.

Eight ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Dietary treatments were (1) a dairy ration [CON; 55% forage and 45% concentrate on a dry matter (DM) basis], (2) a positive control diet supplemented with monensin (MON; 16 mg/kg in dietary DM; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN], (3) a control diet supplemented with low LPL (0.05% of dietary DM; Lipidol Ultra, Easy Bio Inc., Seoul, South Korea), and (4) a control diet supplemented with high LPL (0.075% of dietary DM). Experimental periods were 21 d with 14-d diet adaptation and 7-d sample collection. Daily intake and milk yield were measured and rumen contents were collected for fermentation characteristics and bacterial population. Spot urine and fecal samples (8 samples/cow per period) were collected to determine nutrient digestibility and dietary N utilization. All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC; group and cow within group were random effects and treatments, time, and their interaction were fixed effects). Preplanned contrasts were made to determine effect of MON versus CON, effect of LPL versus MON, and linear effect of increasing LPL. In the current study, responses to MON generally agreed with effects of monensin observed in the literature (increased milk yield and feed efficiency but decreased milk  content). Supplementation of LPL to the diet did not alter DM intake but linearly increased milk yield, resulting in increases in feed efficiency (milk yield/DM intake) and milk protein and  yields. However, total-tract digestibility of DM and organic matter tended to be lower (60.9 vs. 62.2% and 61.8 vs. 63.1%, respectively) for LPL compared with CON. Linear increases in milk N secretion and decreases in urinary N excretion were observed with increasing LPL in the diet. A slight decrease in  proportion in the rumen for LPL was found. Relative to MON, very few bacteria in the rumen were affected with increasing LPL. In conclusion, LPL is a potential feed additive that can increase milk yield and components and dietary N utilization. However, more studies with large numbers of animals are needed to confirm the effect of LPL on production. Similar positive effects on production were observed between LPL and MON, but individual mechanisms were likely different according to ruminal fermentation characteristics. Further studies are needed to explore the mode of action of LPL in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, limited information is available regarding the effect of ground flaxseed on dry matter intake (DMI), ruminal fermentation, and nutrient utilization in grazing dairy cows. Twenty multiparous Jersey cows averaging (mean ± standard deviation) 111 ± 49 d in milk in the beginning of the study were used in a randomized complete block design to investigate the effects of supplementing herbage (i.e., grazed forage) with ground corn-soybean meal mix (control diet = CTRL) or ground flaxseed (flaxseed diet = FLX) on animal production, milk FA, ruminal , and nutrient digestibility. The study was conducted from June to September 2013, with data and sample collection taking place on wk 4, 8, 12, and 16. Cows were fed a diet formulated to yield a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate ratio consisting of (dry matter basis): 40% cool-season perennial herbage, 50% partial total mixed ration, and 10% of ground corn-soybean meal mix or 10% ground flaxseed. However, estimated herbage DMI averaged 5.59 kg/d or 34% of the total DMI. Significant treatment by week interactions were observed for milk and blood urea N, and several milk FA (e.g., trans-10 18:1). No significant differences between treatments were observed for herbage and total DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, concentrations and yields of milk components, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives. Total-tract digestibility of organic matter decreased, whereas that of neutral detergent fiber increased with feeding FLX versus CTRL. No treatment effects were observed for ruminal concentrations of total volatile FA and NH-N, and ruminal proportions of  and propionate. Ruminal butyrate tended to decrease, and the -to-propionate ratio decreased in the FLX diet. Most saturated and unsaturated FA in milk  were changed. Specifically, milk proportion of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3, Σn-3 FA, and Σ18C FA increased, whereas that of cis-9,cis-12 18:2, Σn-6 FA, Σ odd-chain FA, Σ<16C FA, and Σ16C FA decreased with feeding FLX versus the CTRL diet. In conclusion, feeding FLX did not change yields of milk and milk components, but increased milk n-3 FA. Therefore, costs and industry adoption of premiums for n-3-enriched milk will determine the adoption of ground flaxseed in pasture-based dairy farms.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, previous study mainly focussed on acid-treated barley, the effects of organic acid-treated corn is still unknown. The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether feeding ground corn steeped in citric acid (CA) would affect ruminal pH and fermentation patterns, milk production and innate immunity responses in dairy goats. Eight ruminally cannulated Saanen dairy goats were used in a crossover designed experiment. Each experimental period was 21 day long including 14 days for adaption to new diet and 7 days for sampling and data collection. The goats were fed high-grain diet contained 30% hay and 70% corn-based concentrate. The corn was steeped either in water (control) or in 0.5% (wt/vol) CA solution for 48 h. Goats fed CA diet showed improved ruminal pH status with greater mean and minimum ruminal pH, and shorter (P&lt;0.05) duration of ruminal pH&lt;5.6 and less area of ruminal pH&lt;5.6, 5.8 and 6.0. Concentration of total volatile fatty acid and molar proportion of propionate were less but the molar proportion of  was greater (P&lt;0.05) in goats fed the CA diet than the control diet. Concentration of ruminal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was lower (P&lt;0.05) and that of lactic acid also tended (P&lt;0.10) to be lower in goats fed CA than the control. Although dry matter intake, actual milk yield, yield and content of milk protein and lactose were not affected, the milk  content and 4% -corrected milk tended (P&lt;0.10) to be greater in goats fed CA diet. For the inflammatory responses, peripheral LPS did not differ, whereas the concentration of LPS binding protein and serum amyloid A tended (P&lt;0.10) to be less in goats fed CA diet. Similarly, goats fed CA diet had less (P&lt;0.05) concentration of haptoglobin and tumour necrosis factor. These results indicated that feeding ground corn treated with CA effectively improved ruminal pH status, thus alleviated the risk of ruminal acidosis, reduced inflammatory response, and tend to improve milk yield and milk  test.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29980882>The effects of ethoxyquin and Angelica sinensis extracts on  oxidation in fish feeds and growth, digestive and absorptive capacities and antioxidant status in juvenile red carp (Cyprinus carpio var. xingguonensis): a comparative study.</a></h2><p>Firstly, a linoleic and linolenic acid emulsion and fish feeds were incubated with graded levels of ethoxyquin (EQ) and petroleum ether extract, ethyl  extract (EAE), ethanol extract and aqueous extract of Angelica sinensis. The results showed that EQ and extracts of Angelica sinensis (EAs) inhibited  oxidation in material above. Of all of the examined EAs, EAE showed the strongest protective effects against the  oxidation. Moreover, EAE at high concentrations showed a stronger inhibitory effect on  oxidation than that of EQ. Next, 7 experimental diets that respectively supplemented 0.0, 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 g kg of EQ and EAE were fed to 280 juvenile red carp (Cyprinus carpio var. xingguonensis) with seven treatment groups for 30 days. The results indicated that dietary EAE improved growth performance in carp. Moreover, dietary EAE increased the activities of trypsin, lipase, alpha-amylase, alkaline phosphatase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and decreased plasma ammonia content in carp. Meanwhile, dietary EAE reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and raised the activities of anti-superoxide anion, anti-hydroxyl radical, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase and the content of reduced glutathione in the hepatopancreas and intestine of carp. However, with the exception of GPT, dietary EQ got the opposite results to dietary EAE in carp. These results revealed that dietary EAE improved the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish. However, dietary EQ inhibited the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish. So, EAE could be used as a natural antioxidant for replacing EQ in fish feeds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29990893>Investigation of the hepatoprotective effect of Corydalis saxicola Bunting on carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in rats by H-NMR-based metabonomics and network pharmacology approaches.</a></h2><p>Liver fibrosis is a common consequence of chronic liver diseases resulting from multiple etiologies. Furthermore, prolonged unresolved liver fibrosis may gradually progress to cirrhosis, and eventually evolve into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Corydalis saxicola Bunting (CS), a type of traditional Chinese folk medicine, has been reported to have hepatoprotective effects on the liver. However, the exact mechanism of how it cures liver fibrosis requires further elucidation. In this work, an integrated approach combining proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR)-based metabonomics and network pharmacology was adopted to elucidate the anti-fibrosis mechanism of CS. Metabonomic study of serum biochemical changes by carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced liver fibrosis in rats after CS treatment were performed using H-NMR analysis. Metabolic profiling by means of partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) indicated that the metabolic perturbation caused by CCl was reduced after CS treatment. As a result, lipids, leucine, alanine, , O-acetyl-glycoprotein and creatine were significantly restored after CS treatment, which regulated valine, leucine and isoleucine ; arginine and proline ;  and pyruvate . Additionally, 157 potential targets of CS and 265 targets of liver fibrosis were identified by means of network pharmacology. Subsequently, 5 target proteins, which are the intersection of potential CS targets and liver fibrosis targets, indicated that CS has potential anti-fibrosis effects through regulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and angiotensinogen. Chelerythrine and sanguinarine were the potential active compounds in CS for treating liver fibrosis through regulating ALT activity. This study is the first report to study the anti-fibrosis effects of CS on the basis of combining a metabonomics and network pharmacology approaches, and it may be a potentially powerful tool to study the efficacy and mechanisms of traditional Chinese folk medicines.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, it has been suggested that reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels might be an important morbidity indicator for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it has been argued that therapeutically raising HDL levels may reduce atherogenesis in patients with dyslipidemia. However, recent clinical trials to elevate serum HDL levels by pharmacologic approaches failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Thus, to investigate the functionality of HDL and to explore the possible clinical relevance as well as to define an effective indicator that can represent HDL function may provide another key and reference to disclose the clinical treatment of dyslipidemia. We analyzed the association between the data of dichlorofluorescein assay (assay the functionality of HDL), the effect of HDL on oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in vitro, levels of circulating EPCs, and ex vitro EPC colony forming units of each case, we defined the indicator (relative HDL index (RHDL index) = dichlorofluorescein assay result of each subject/dichlorofluorescein assay reading of our young healthy controls) that may represent functionality of HDL. HDL from healthy adults protected oxLDL-treated EPCs by modulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Rho activation and by promoting nitric oxide production. HDL from subject with RHDL index ≧2 also failed to restore the functionality of oxLDL-treated EPCs via cell-signaling pathways in vitro. The RHDL index significantly correlated with patients' circulating EPC number or EPC colony forming units ex vivo. In conclusions, we explored the RHDL index as a score to predict a patient's EPC functions in vivo and ex vitro.Copyright © 2018.

Recent gene silencing studies in mammary cells indicate that SREBP-1 has a central role in milk  synthesis. However, SREBP-1 knockdown studies in goat mammary cells have not been performed; hence, its direct role in controlling mRNA expression of  genes and triacylglycerol synthesis remains unknown. Inhibition of SREBP-1 in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) by small interference RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the content of cellular triacylglycerol (~50% decrease, P < 0.05) and was partly related to downregulation of AGPAT6, LPIN1, and DGAT2 (-23%, -28% and -19%, respectively. P < 0.05), which are key enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis, cellular triacylglycerol content and  droplet accumulation all decreased by SREBP-1 inhibition. The expression of  droplet formation and secretion genes was not altered in response to treatment. Although the lack of effect on expression of ACACA and FASN (rate-limiting enzymes for de novo fatty acid synthesis) with SREBP-1 knockdown was unexpected (P > 0.05), the downregulation of genes related to synthesis of acetyl-CoA and  activation (ACLY, ACSS2, and IDH1, P < 0.05) suggests that lipogenesis was inhibited. SREBP-1 knockdown also resulted in decreased expression of genes associated with fatty acid desaturation and elongation (SCD1 and ELOVL6, P < 0.05), long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) activation and transport (ACSL1, FABP3, and SLC27A6, P < 0.05). The results underscored the essential role of SREBP-1 not only in fatty acid synthesis but also in desaturation, elongation, and esterification in GMEC. Clearly, the lack of effect on ACACA and FASN, both of which are considered the key lipogenic enzymes, implies that there may be different regulatory mechanisms in goat compared with bovine mammary cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084084>Suppressing PKC-dependent membrane P2X3 receptor upregulation in dorsal root ganglia mediated electroacupuncture analgesia in rat painful diabetic neuropathy.</a></h2><p>Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common and troublesome diabetes complication. Protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) P2X3 receptor upregulation is one important mechanism underlying PDN. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) at low frequency could effectively attenuate neuropathic pain. Our previous study showed that 2-Hz EA could relieve pain well in PDN. The study aimed to investigate whether 2-Hz EA relieves pain in PDN through suppressing PKC-mediated DRG P2X3 receptor upregulation. A 7-week feeding of high- and high-sugar diet plus a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in a dose of 35 mg/kg after a 5-week feeding of the diet successfully induced type 2 PDN in rats as revealed by the elevated body weight, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance, and the reduced paw withdrawal threshold (PWT), as well as the destructive ultrastructural change of sciatic nerve. DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level and DRG PKC expression were elevated. Two-hertz EA failed to improve peripheral neuropathy; however, it reduced PWT, DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level, and DRG PKC expression in PDN rats. Intraperitoneal administration of P2X3 receptor agonist αβ-meATP or PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) blocked 2-Hz EA analgesia. Furthermore, PMA administration increased DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level in PDN rats subject to 2-Hz EA treatment. These findings together indicated that the analgesic effect of EA in PDN is mediated by suppressing PKC-dependent membrane P2X3 upregulation in DRG. EA at low frequency is a valuable approach for PDN control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061309>Adverse Effects in Skeletal Muscle Following the Medicinal Use of Nicotiana glauca.</a></h2><p>Nicotiana glauca is a cosmopolitan shrub, used in medicine to treat swellings, wounds, sores and cancer. However, its users lack of knowledge of the adverse effects. We seek to evaluate the effects of  extracts from N. glauca on myoblasts, identifying the compounds which cause undesirable effects. Myoblasts are important in muscle homeostasis, thus a high death rate of them cause myopathies. We performed an ethanolic extraction from leaves of N. glauca and the extract was successively partitioned with hexane, chloroform and ethyl . The effects of extracts in C2C12 cells were analysed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL), Mitotracker and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, Western blotting, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assays. Caspase activity was studied. The fraction with the highest apoptotic effects was analysed by chromatography, NMR and GC-MS spectrometry were used to identify the apoptotic agent, after which its biological activity was evaluated. The extracts from N. glauca induced apoptosis in C2C12 cells involving caspase-3/7. We found that the extracts trigger a defence response in muscle through Akt and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). We identified an apoptotic agent as palmitic acid. These data suggest that the use of N. glauca in hormone replacement therapy, or in other therapies affects skeletal muscle homeostasis, worsening the negative effects of the menopause. Thus, the relevance of this work lies in the fact that it is the first time that a report about the molecular mechanism responsible for the side effects of medicinal use of N. glauca, has been shown.

As previously reported for other bacteria, a relatively low number (5%) of the potential genome-encoded proteins of  were acetylated. Of these, the vast majority were involved in central  and cellular information processing (transcription, translation, etc.). Interestingly, these critical cell functions were targeted during both ML (mid-log) and S (stationary) phases of growth. However, acetylation of target proteins in ML phase was limited to single lysine residues while these same proteins were acetylated at multiple sites during S phase. To determine the acetyl donor in , we used mutants that targeted the sole  metabolic/anabolic pathway in  ( I synthesis).  strains B31-A3, B31-A3 Δ (acetyl-P and acetyl-CoA) and B31-A3 Δ (acetyl-P and acetyl-CoA) were grown to S phase and the acetylation profiles were analyzed. While only two proteins were acetylated in the Δ mutant, 140 proteins were acetylated in the Δ mutant suggesting that acetyl-P was the primary acetyl donor in . Using specific enzymatic assays, we were able to demonstrate that hyperacetylation of proteins in S phase appeared to play a role in decreasing the enzymatic activity of at least two glycolytic proteins. Currently, we hypothesize that acetylation is used to modulate enzyme activities during different stages of growth. This strategy would allow the bacteria to post-translationally stimulate the activity of key glycolytic enzymes by deacetylation rather than expending excessive energy synthesizing new proteins. This would be an appealing, low-energy strategy for a bacterium with limited metabolic capabilities. Future work focuses on identifying potential protein deacetylase(s) to complete our understanding of this important biological process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049862>Outdoor cultivation of the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris under stress conditions as a feedstock for biofuel.</a></h2><p>The present work investigated the potential of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris to produce high-quality biofuel under culture stress conditions. The cultivation was carried out in a 1000 l open plate tank system, which provides biomass yields comparable to open pond systems, but with less area needed. Algal biomass and  content were measured repeatedly. We compared the two solvent systems n-hexane and hexane/isopropanol (HIP) for extraction efficiency of lipids and applied three different extraction methods Soxhlet, soaking, and soaking followed by Soxhlet (soak-Sox). The combination of the HIP solvent and the soak-Sox provided the highest  yield (15.8 ± 0.174). Volumetric biomass and  productivity were 0.201 g l day and 31.71 mg l day, respectively, whereas areal biomass and  productivity were 25.73 g m day and 4.066 g m day, respectively. The fatty acid profile by means of gas chromatography resulted in seven fatty acids from C to C. The most abundant fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) were palmitic (C16:0), oleic (C18:1), and stearic (C18:0) acids.  synthesis enhanced by optimizing the Kuhl growth medium with replacing nitrate by urea (50% N compared to the original recipe) increased salt content (10 g/l NaCl), ferrous sulfate (0.5 g/l), and sodium  addition (1 g/l). With regard to density, kinematic viscosity, gravity, pour point, flash point, and cetane number, the Chlorella-biodiesel comply with ASTM and EN standards thus pointing at the high potential of lipids synthesized by Chlorella as a feedstock for biodiesel production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30167726>Endophytic fungus Paecilomyces formosus LHL10 produces sester-terpenoid YW3548 and cyclic peptide that inhibit urease and α-glucosidase enzyme activities.</a></h2><p>Endophytic fungi have been used to obtain novel bioactive secondary metabolites with potential applications in medical and agricultural sectors, which can also act as lead targets for pharmaceutical and medicinal potential. In the present study, the endophytic fungus Paecilomyces formosus LHL10 isolated from the root of cucumber plant was tested for its enzyme inhibitory potential. The ethyl  (EtOAc) extract of LHL10 was screened for its inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), α-glucosidase, urease, and anti- peroxidation. The findings suggest that the EtOAc extract from LHL10 possesses significant inhibitory potential against urease and α-glucosidase. The EtOAc extract was thus, subjected to advanced column chromatographic techniques for the isolation of pure compounds. The structure elucidation was carried out through spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data, and these compounds were confirmed as known a sester-terpenoid (1) and a known cyclic peptide (2). The enzyme inhibition bioassay indicated that Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited remarkable inhibitory rate against α-glucosidase and urease, with an IC value of 61.80 ± 5.7, 75.68 ± 6.2 and 74.25 ± 4.3, 190.5 ± 10.31 µg/g, respectively. Thus, the current study concludes the enzyme inhibitory potential of endophyte LHL10 and provides the basis for further investigations of bioactive compounds, which could be used as potent drugs for enzyme inhibition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644264>Quantification of dehydroepiandrosterone, 17β-estradiol, testosterone and their sulfates in mouse tissues by LC/MS/MS.</a></h2><p>We report a high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) assay to quantify without derivatizaton dehyroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and their sulfates in serum and tissues. This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous  buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10 and 5 fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white vs brown adipose. In addition, marginal decreases of T in all tissues and considerable increases in DHEA in male iWAT and eWAT in response to high- diet further strengthen the inference regarding role of steroid  in adipogenesis. This assay permits detailed studies of interactions between adiposity and sex steroids in serum and tissues, including adipose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883801>Glucose-derived  and ACSS2 as key players in cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer.</a></h2><p>Cisplatin is an important chemotherapeutic agent against metastatic bladder cancer, but resistance often limits its usage. With the recent recognition of  metabolic alterations in bladder cancers, we studied the metabolic implications of cisplatin resistance using cisplatin-sensitive (T24S) and resistant (T24R) bladder cancer cells. Real-time live metabolomics revealed that T24R cells consume more glucose, leading to higher production of glucose-derived  and fatty acids. Along with the activation of general metabolic regulators, enzymes involved in  usage (ACSS2) and fatty acid synthesis (ACC) and a precursor for fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA) were elevated in T24R cells. Consistently, metabolic analysis with C isotope revealed that T24R cells preferred glucose to  as the exogenous carbon source for the increased fatty acid synthesis, contrary to T24S cells. In addition, ACSS2, rather than the well-established ACLY, was the key enzyme that supplies acetyl-CoA in T24R cells through glucose-derived endogenous . The relevance of ACSS2 in cisplatin resistance was further confirmed by the abrogation of resistance by an ACSS2 inhibitor and, finally, by the higher expression of ACSS2 in the patient tissues with cisplatin resistance. Our results may help improve the treatment options for chemoresistant bladder cancer patients and provide possible vulnerability targets to overcome the resistance.Copyright © 2018.

The objective of the present work was to determine the antioxidant and protective effects of T. vulgaris extract against lead (Pb)-intoxicated rats. A thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley were randomly assigned into 4 equal groups and treated for six weeks as follows: group I (GP-I), served as negative control; GP-II, -III, and -IV received either Pb  in drinking water (500 mg/L), T. vulgaris extract (500 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage or Pb  with T. vulgaris extract, respectively. Blood samples were collected at the end of the study week 6 to measure the hepatic and renal biochemical markers, complete blood count alongside the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis (TNF)-α, and interferon (IFN)-γ. Additionally, liver and kidney tissue specimens were collected for histopathology as well as to measure the antioxidant-reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) alongside the lipid peroxidation marker, malonaldehyde (MDA). The results indicated that Pb toxicity increased the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, whereas IL-10 and IFN-γ were reduced. The results showed disturbed liver and renal functions; increased serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, total bilirubin, creatinine, and urea; and decreased total protein, albumin, and calcium. The GSH, Gpx, and CAT levels were significantly decreased in the Pb-administrated group, while MDA was increased. However, regarding the hepatorenal markers, those animals treated with T. vulgaris alone did not induce any significant changes. Moreover, the combined treatment with T. vulgaris extract together with Pb showed significant improvement in Pb-induced toxicity in all the tested parameters compared to the negative control group. We investigated the potential protective effects of the medicinal plant T. vulgaris in vivo, since there are no publications that address the potential protective effect of this leaf extract against Pb-induced hepatorenal toxicity. Our studies concluded that the T. vulgaris extract reduces Pb overload in hepatorenal tissues, and that this has a potential immunomodulatory role, antioxidant activity, and a protective effect against Pb toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827620>Controlled release of microencapsulated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by spray-drying processing.</a></h2><p>The omega-3-fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 22:6 n-3, is an important food component for the visual and brain development of infants. In this study two approaches have been explored for the encapsulation of DHA in the pH dependant polymer hydroxyl-propyl-methyl-cellulose--succinate (HPMCAS). In the first approach Direct Spray Drying (DSD) was implemented for the microencapsulation of DHA/HPMCAS organic solutions, whilst in the second approach solid  nanoparticle (SLN) dispersions of DHA, were first produced by high-pressure homogenization, prior to being spray dried in HPMCAS aqueous solutions. The DSD approach resulted in significantly higher quantities of DHA being encapsulated, at 2.09 g/100 g compared to 0.60 g/100 g in the spray-dried SLNs. The DHA stability increased with the direct spray-drying approach. Release studies of DHA in the direct sprayed dried samples revealed a lag time for 2 h in acidic media followed by rapid release in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the effects of whole-grain or refined cereals on fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin in people at high cardiovascular risk. According to a randomised controlled parallel group design, participants with metabolic syndrome were assigned to an isoenergetic diet based on either whole-grain cereal (WGC) or refined cereal (RC) products for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were taken. Compared to baseline, fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin levels increased after both RC and WGC. In the WGC and RC groups combined, adiponectin concentrations significantly increased after 12-week intervention, and are directly associated with plasma SCFAs and . Only increasing whole-grain cereals may not influence adiponectin levels, which could be modified by a fibre rich, low-, low-glycemic index diet, possibly through changes in gut microbiota, as suggested by the relation with SCFAs.

However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans. In this study, we tested the effects of RS in 19 volunteers with normal body weights. A randomized, double-blinded and crossover design clinical trial was conducted. The study subjects were given either 40 g high amylose RS2 or energy-matched control starch with three identical diets per day throughout the study. The effect of RS was evaluated by monitoring body , glucose , gut hormones, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and metabolites. The visceral and subcutaneous  areas were significantly reduced following RS intake.  and early-phase insulin, C-peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion were increased, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were decreased after the RS intervention. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, certain gut microbes were significantly decreased after RS supplementation, whereas the genus Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 showed an increase in abundance. Other potential signatures of the RS intervention included Akkermansia, Ruminococcus_2, Victivallis, and Comamonas. Moreover, the baseline abundance of the genera Streptococcus, Ruminococcus_torques_group, Eubacterium_hallii_group, and Eubacterium_eligens_group was significantly associated with the hormonal and metabolic effects of RS. These observations suggest that a daily intake of 40 g of RS is effective in modulating body , SCFAs, early-phase insulin and GLP-1 secretion and the gut microbiota in normal-weight subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30097818>Lipids modulate acetic acid and thiol final concentrations in wine during fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae × Saccharomyces kudriavzevii hybrids.</a></h2><p>Saccharomyces cerevisiae × Saccharomyces kudriavzevii hybrids are typically used for white wine fermentation because of their cryotolerance. One group of these hybrids presents a unique ability to release thiol varietal aroma products as well as excessive amounts of acetic acid under specific conditions, which is detrimental for wine organoleptic quality. The aim of this work is to better assess the effects of lipids, sugar concentrations and temperature on the production of acetic acid and thiols during wine fermentation. To this end, we used a Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface modeling on the production of acetic acid and thiols in S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids from the Eg8 family during fermentation of a synthetic must. We showed that these hybrids produced lower levels of acetic acid when the initial  concentration was increased, whereas they produced greater levels when the initial sugar concentration was high. Moreover, we found that lipids had a positive impact on the final concentrations of 4-methyl-4-mercaptopentan-2-one and 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH), giving box tree and citrus flavors, respectively. The increase of 3MH was concomitant with a decrease of 3-mercaptohexyl  (3MHA) characterized by a passion fruit aroma, indicating that  addition reduces the rate of 3MH acetylation into 3MHA. These results highlight the key role of  management in acetic acid  and thiol release by S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids and underline its technological interest in alcoholic fermentation to avoid the overproduction of volatile acidity while favoring the release of volatile thiols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29933128>Nitrate reduction in the fermentation process of salt reduced dry sausages: Impact on microbial and physicochemical parameters and aroma profile.</a></h2><p>Slow fermented sausages with reduced ingoing amounts of sodium nitrate were manufactured: control (250 ppm), 15% (212.5 ppm) and 25% (187.5 ppm) reduction. The effect of nitrate reduction on microbiology and chemical parameters, volatile compounds and aroma production was studied. Parameters like, pH, a and colour decreased during ripening, without being affected by nitrate reduction.  oxidation increased during ripening and it was higher in control sausages due to  content. Residual nitrite was below the detection limit during the whole process and residual nitrate decreased during ripening, with higher reduction in RN25 sausages. Lactic acid bacteria, total mesophilic bacteria and yeasts and moulds increased during ripening but Gram positive cocci decreased. Microbial counts from nitrate reduced sausages at the end of the manufacturing process were not statistically different from the control sausages with nitrate. Regarding volatile compounds formation, compounds derived from amino acid degradation were increased by nitrate reduction. Aroma compounds derived from amino acid degradation and responsible for strong odours, dimethyl disulphide (toasted, garlic) and methional (cooked potato) and, to a lesser extent, compounds derived from esterase activity producing fruity odours (ethyl , ethyl butanoate, ethyl‑2‑hydroxypropanoate, ethyl‑2‑methylbutanoate and ethyl‑3‑methylbutanoate) and several compounds from carbohydrate fermentation acetic acid (vinegar odour) and 2-butanone (fruity) were related to the high nitrate reduction (25%). Despite nitrate reduction up to 25% produced minor effect on microbial growth, their  is regulated by nitrate content and therefore by nitrite generation affecting the production of key aroma compounds that alter the sausage aroma profile.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

They are used in preparation of herbal decoction and teas, which have been used traditionally to reduce body weight and for its effect on metabolic syndrome.To investigate the anti adipogenic efficacy of major fraction from ethyl  extract of the Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower at 25 and 50 µg/mL (HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL) in 3T3-L1 cells and delineate its possible mechanism of action.Pre adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in the presence and absence of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL, their  accumulation was measured qualitatively by Oil red O staining and quantitatively by triglyceride estimation. Effect on adipolysis was determined, adipogenic and its regulatory gene and protein expression were studied and effect of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL on AMPK was confirmed in the presence of dorsomorphin.Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and was found to alleviate triglyceride accumulation significantly (p < 0.001) by 1.6 and 2.3 times respectively in pre adipocytes during differentiation. HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also nonsignificantly reduced lipolysis which releases free fatty acids, a major contributing factor for insulin resistance. Activation of AMPK by phosphorylation has led to reduced gene and protein expression of adipogenic factors Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), CCAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), Sterol regulatory element- binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and their targets Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Perilipin and enhanced Adiponectin expression. Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also resulted in inactivation of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by enhancing ACC phosphorylation, which reduced the levels of malonyl-CoA an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Enhanced CPT1 levels causes induction of fatty acid β- oxidation. Effects of HRF were nullified in the presence of AMPK antagonist dorsomorphin.In summary, HRF treatments reduced adipogenesis, enhanced factors regulating fatty acid oxidation and this is mediated by AMPK activation. The results conclusively showed anti-obesity potential of HRF and it might be helpful in treatment of associated complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using a metabolic model based on the oleaginous yeast , we found that introduction of this bypass to an oleaginous yeast should result in enhanced yield of triacylglycerol (TAG) on substrate.  (formerly ) is an oleaginous yeast which can produce TAGs from both glucose and xylose. Based on the sequenced genome, it lacks at least one of the enzymes needed to complete the PDH bypass, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD), and may also be deficient in pyruvate decarboxylase and acetyl-CoA synthetase under production conditions. We introduced these genes to  in various combinations and demonstrated that the yield of TAG on both glucose and xylose was improved, particularly at high C/N ratio. Expression of a phospholipid:diacyltransferase encoding gene in conjunction with the PDH bypass further enhanced  production. The yield of TAG on xylose (0.27 g/g) in the engineered strain approached the theoretical maximum yield of 0.289 g/g. Interestingly, TAG production was also enhanced compared to the control in some strains which were given only part of the bypass pathway, suggesting that these genes may contribute to alternative routes to cytoplasmic acetyl CoA. The metabolic model indicated that the improved yield of TAG on substrate in the PDH bypass was dependent on the production of NADPH by ALD. NADPH for  synthesis is otherwise primarily supplied by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This would contribute to the greater improvement of TAG production from xylose compared to that observed from glucose when the PDH bypass was introduced, since xylose enters  through the non-oxidative part of the PPP. Yield of TAG from xylose in the engineered strains (0.21-0.27 g/g) was comparable to that obtained from glucose and the highest so far reported for  or TAG production from xylose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30453040>The roles of sirtuins family in cell  during tumor development.</a></h2><p>Altering energy  to meet the uncontrolled proliferation and metastasis has emerged as one of the most significant hallmarks in tumors.

In this work, a crude hydroalcoholic extract (CHE) of  leaves and its resulting fractions in hexane (HF), chloroform (CF), ethyl  (EAF), and butanol (BF) were investigated for their antioxidant properties and anticholinesterase activities. The antioxidant properties were evaluated by free radical scavenging and electroanalytical assays, which were further correlated with the total phenolic content and LC-MS results. The acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities were examined using Ellman's colorimetric method. The LC-MS analysis of EAF revealed the presence of gallic acid and quercetin. CHE and its fractions, EAF and BF, showed anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities, suggesting the association of both effects with the phenolic content. In addition, behavioral tests performed with CHE (10, 100, and 300 mg/kg) showed that it prevented mice memory impairment which resulted from aluminium intake. Moreover, CHE inhibited brain  peroxidation and acetyl and butyryl-cholinesterase activities and the extract's neuroprotective effect was reflected at the microscopic level.

Chloroplast membranes are unique in their  makeup, which is dominated by the galactolipids mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG and DGDG). The most abundant galactolipid, MGDG, is assembled through both plastid and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways in Arabidopsis, resulting in distinguishable molecular  species. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is the first glycerolipid formed by the plastid galactolipid biosynthetic pathway. It is converted to substrate diacylglycerol (DAG) for MGDG Synthase (MGD1) which adds to it a galactose from UDP-Gal. The enzymatic reactions yielding these galactolipids have been well established. However, auxiliary or regulatory factors are largely unknown. We identified a predicted rhomboid-like protease 10 (RBL10), located in plastids of Arabidopsis thaliana, that affects galactolipid biosynthesis likely through intramembrane proteolysis. Plants with T-DNA disruptions in RBL10 have greatly decreased 16:3 (acyl carbons:double bonds) and increased 18:3 acyl chain abundance in MGDG of leaves. Additionally, rbl10-1 mutants show reduced [ C]- incorporation into MGDG during pulse-chase labeling, indicating a reduced flux through the plastid galactolipid biosynthesis pathway. While plastid MGDG biosynthesis is blocked in rbl10-1 mutants, they are capable of synthesizing PA, as well as producing normal amounts of MGDG by compensating with ER-derived  precursors. These findings link this predicted protease to the utilization of PA for plastid galactolipid biosynthesis potentially revealing a regulatory mechanism in chloroplasts.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280381>The potential growth and lipid accumulation in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea triggered by glucose combining with sodium .</a></h2><p>Carbon sources whether types or magnitudes were fateful in terms of stimulating growth and lipids accumulation in microalgae applied for biodiesel production. The set scenario of this work was to investigate the feasibilities of glucose (G) combining with sodium  (SA) carbon sources in enhancing biomass and lipid accumulation in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea. The results demonstrated that C. subellipsoidea subjected to the combination feeding of G (20 g/L) and SA (12 g/L) achieved the favorable biomass (5.22 g/L) and lipid content (52.16%). The resulting lipid productivity (388.96 mg/L/day) was 1.33- to 7.60-fold more than those of sole G or SA as well as other combinations of G and SA. Even though the total fatty acids of C. subellipsoidea cells treated with the optimal combination of G and SA showed no noticeable increment in comparison with sole G or SA, the proportion of monounsaturated C18:1 (over 48.69%) and the content of C18:3 (< 12%) were commendable in high-quality algal biodiesel production. Further, such fascinating lipid accumulation in C. subellipsoidea cells treated with G combining with SA might be attributed to that G promoted glycolysis as well as SA activated glyoxylate shunt and TCA cycle to synergistically provide sufficient acetyl-CoA precursors for lipid accumulation. These findings hinted the potential of the combination of carbon sources in enhancing the overall lipid productivity to offset alga-based biodiesel production cost and would guide other alga strains cultivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371044>Albiflorin inhibits the formation of THP-1-derived foam cells through the LOX-1/NF-κB pathway.</a></h2><p>Foam cells are characteristic pathologic cells of atherosclerosis (AS), they are -loaded macrophages present on atherosclerotic lesions. A large number of studies has shown that the pathogenesis of AS is the result of interactions between the  disorders and chronic inflammatory responses in the body. Albiflorin can inhibit the inflammatory response and it has shown a therapeutic effect on certain inflammatory diseases.In this study, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1)-derived foam cell model was established via oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to observe the effects of albiflorin on the AS-characteristic foam cells.Our results showed that, after the treatment with ox-LDL, macrophages induced by propylene glycol methyl ether  (PMA), presented large amounts of  deposition in their cytoplasm, indicating that the THP-1-derived foam cell model was successfully established. On the other hand, the same cells pretreated with albiflorin presented significantly reduced amounts of  deposition, and their contents of total cholesterol and triglyceride were also clearly lower. Besides, the expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were significantly decreased, and the expression levels of downstream factors interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were also obviously decreased in the cells treated with albiflorin but not in the negative control cells. Moreover, after treatment of macrophages with different concentrations of ox-LDL, the expression levels of LOX-1 and NF-κB were up-regulated in an ox-LDL concentration-dependent manner, and so were the expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-α. And, it was found after treatment with LOX-1 neutralizing antibody or NF-κB inhibitor (during the foam cell formation induction via ox-LDL) that the  deposition in the cytoplasm of the cells was reduced, as in the cells treated with albiflorin.Taken together, our findings suggest that albiflorin decreases  deposition in the cytoplasm and blocks the foaming process by regulating the LOX-1/NF-κB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30809711>Biochemical profiles of two thermostable and organic solvent-tolerant esterases derived from a compost metagenome.</a></h2><p>Owing to the functional versatility and potential applications in industry, interest in lipolytic enzymes tolerant to organic solvents is increasing. In this study, functional screening of a compost soil metagenome resulted in identification of two lipolytic genes, est1 and est2, encoding 270 and 389 amino acids, respectively. The two genes were heterologously expressed and characterized. Est1 and Est2 are thermostable enzymes with optimal enzyme activities at 80 and 70 °C, respectively. A second-order rotatable design, which allows establishing the relationship between multiple variables with the obtained responses, was used to explore the combined effects of temperature and pH on esterase stability. The response curve indicated that Est1, and particularly Est2, retained high stability within a broad range of temperature and pH values. Furthermore, the effects of organic solvents on Est1 and Est2 activities and stabilities were assessed. Notably, Est2 activity was significantly enhanced (two- to tenfold) in the presence of ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and 1-propanol over a concentration range between 6 and 30% (v/v). For the short-term stability (2 h of incubation), Est2 exhibited high tolerance against 60% (v/v) of ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, DMSO, and acetone, while Est1 activity resisted these solvents only at lower concentrations (below 30%, v/v). Est2 also displayed high stability towards some water-immiscible organic solvents, such as ethyl , diethyl ether, and toluene. With respect to long-term stability, Est2 retained most of its activity after 26 days of incubation in the presence of 30% (v/v) ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, DMSO, or acetone. All of these features indicate that Est1 and Est2 possess application potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30196707>Interactive effects of α-tocopheryl  and zinc supplementation on the antioxidant and immune systems of broilers.</a></h2><p>1. A total of 1440 one-day-old Ross 308 male broilers were allocated to 12 dietary treatments to evaluate dose-dependent effects of α-tocopheryl  (α-TOA) combined with zinc (Zn) supplementation on humoral and cellular immune responses, antioxidant enzymes, serum and hepatic contents of vitamins and minerals in broilers. 2. Three levels of supplemental α-TOA (0, 150 and 300 mg/kg) and 4 levels of Zn (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) were combined as a completely randomised design as a 3 × 4 factorial arrangement. 3. Concentrations of serum α-tocopherol and selenium were influenced by the interaction of α-TOA and Zn. The interaction of α-TOA and Zn affected malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in serum and liver ( < 0.05). Incremental amounts of supplemental Zn augmented the effects of α-TOA in reducing serum and hepatic MDA concentrations. 4. The interaction of α-TOA and Zn on antibody titres (< 0.05) was such that increasing level of Zn at each α-TOA level led to a linear enhancement in antibody titre. Moreover, dietary supplementation with α-TOA and Zn resulted in an increase in relative weight of lymphoid organs (thymus, bursa, spleen;  < 0.05) along with an increase in humoral and cellular immune responses ( < 0.05). 5. In conclusion, α-TOA with Zn showed interactive effects in improving oxidative stability and humoral immune responses, which could result from their impact on the concentrations of antioxidant vitamins and minerals in tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152450>Benzenedicarboxylic acid upregulates O48814 and Q9FJQ8 for improved nutritional contents of tomato and low risk of fungal attack.</a></h2><p>Tomato is an important food item and a cocktail of phytonutrients. In the current study, metabolites from a non-pathogenic fungal species Penicillium oxalicum have been exploited to obtain nutritionally augmented tomato fruits from the plants to better withstand against Alternaria alternata infection.Initially, bioactivity-guided assay and chromatographic analyses identified the bioactive metabolites of P. oxalicum [benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDA) and benzimidazole]. Then, ≥3 times elevated quantities of vitamins and other nutritional elements (protein, , fibers, and carbohydrates) were achieved by the foliar application of BDA. The maximum increase (625.81%) was recorded in riboflavin contents; however, thiamine showed the second highest enhancement (542.86%). Plant metabolites analysis revealed that jasmonic acid contents were boosted 121.53% to significantly enhance guaiacyl lignin defenses along with the reduction in coumarin contents. The protein profile analysis explored three most actively responding protein species toward BDA applications, (i) palmitoyltransferase protein Q9FLM3; (ii) serine/threonine-protein kinase O48814; and (iii) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Q9FJQ8. The O48814 improved plant defenses; whereas, Q9FJQ8 protein was negatively regulating cysteine-type endopeptidase activity and assisted plant to resist schedule alterations. Tomato cultivar with more active innate  was found to be more responsive toward BDA. Furthermore, the bioactive compounds were enriched by using the two-step extraction method of ethyl  and chloroform, respectively.Penicillium oxalicum a non-pathogenic fungal species, produced BDA, induced nutritional contents in tomato and protected it against Alternaria alternata.

However, ESL is structurally distinct from CBZ and OXC, resulting in differences in , pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Despite a lack of direct comparative data, evidence for potential differences in effectiveness and tolerability within the dibenzazepine family has emerged from studies in which patients being treated with one dibenzazepine agent have received adjunctive treatment with another (having achieved insufficient seizure control with the first) or have transitioned from one dibenzazepine agent to another because of lack of effectiveness or poor tolerability. Most of these studies have been conducted in the real-world clinical practice setting. ESL has been shown to be effective as adjunctive therapy in patients who have previously achieved inadequate seizure control with CBZ, indicating that the use of different dibenzazepine agents in combination can provide additive effectiveness benefits, which may reflect underlying differences in their mechanisms of action. Similarly, ESL monotherapy can be effective in patients who have switched from another dibenzazepine, such as CBZ or OXC, because of inadequate efficacy. There is also considerable evidence to demonstrate that patients transitioning from OXC or CBZ to ESL as a result of adverse events experience improvements in tolerability, which may also be associated with improvements in quality of life, alertness, and/or  profiles. Current evidence therefore demonstrates that ESL differs from other dibenzazepine agents in terms of effectiveness and tolerability.Funding: Eisai Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30243627>Effects of chitosan and whole raw soybeans on ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations, and milk fatty acid profile in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate whether providing chitosan (CHI) to cows fed diets supplemented with whole raw soybeans (WRS) would affect the nutrient intake and digestibility, ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations, microbial protein synthesis, N utilization, blood metabolites, and milk yield and composition of dairy cows. Twenty-four multiparous Holstein cows (141 ± 37.1 d in milk, 38.8 ± 6.42 kg/d of milk yield; mean ± SD) were enrolled to a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment with 23-d periods. Cows were blocked within Latin squares according to milk yield, days in milk, body weight, and rumen cannula (n = 8). A 2 × 2 factorial treatment arrangement was randomly assigned to cows within blocks. Treatments were composed of diets with 2 inclusion rates of WRS (0 or 14% diet dry matter) and 2 doses of CHI (0 or 4 g/kg of dry matter, Polymar Ciência e Nutrição, Fortaleza, Brazil). In general, CHI+WRS negatively affected nutrient intake and digestibility of cows, decreasing milk yield and solids production. The CHI increased ruminal pH and decreased  to propionate ratio, and WRS reduced NH-N concentration and  to propionate in the rumen. The CHI reduced the relative bacterial population of Butyrivibrio group, whereas WRS decreased the relative bacterial population of Butyrivibrio group, and Fibrobacter succinogenes, and increased the relative bacterial population of Streptococcus bovis. No interaction effects between CHI and WRS were observed on ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations. The CHI+WRS decreased N intake, microbial N synthesis, and N secreted in milk of cows. The WRS increased N excreted in feces and consequently decreased the N excreted in urine. The CHI had no effects on blood metabolites, but WRS decreased blood concentrations of glucose and increased blood cholesterol concentration. The CHI and WRS improved efficiency of milk yield of cows in terms of -corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and net energy of lactation. The CHI increased milk concentration [g/100 g of fatty acids (FA)] of 18:1 trans-11, 18:2 cis-9,cis-12, 18:3 cis-9,cis-12,cis-15, 18:1 cis-9,trans-11, total monounsaturated FA, and total polyunsaturated FA. The WRS increased total monounsaturated FA, polyunsaturated FA, and 18:0 to unsaturated FA ratio in milk of cows. Evidence indicates that supplementing diets with unsaturated  sources along with CHI negatively affects nutrient intake and digestibility of cows, resulting in less milk production. Diet supplementation with CHI or WRS can improve feed efficiency and increases unsaturated FA concentration in milk of dairy cows.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

It should be noted that acute adverse responses are not likely to occur due to low environmental presence of this drug. Nonetheless, water concentration levels of this compound may reach the µg/L range under influenza episodes. Bivalves are reliable sentinels of chemical exposure due to their low ; however, biotransformation of drugs does occur in these aquatic invertebrates. Two species of bivalves, namely mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and clams Ruditapes philippinarum, were exposed for 48 h to 100 µg/L OST. Hemolymph from control and treated bivalves was withdrawn and the presence of OST and its metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OST-C) determined by LC-MS/MS. Gills and digestive gland were excised from control and exposed bivalves and carboxylesterase (CE) activities measured using different substrates. In addition, antioxidant defences and  peroxidation levels were determined. Higher  of OST seemed to occur in mussels, since both OST and OST-C were found in hemolymph, whereas in clams only the parent compound was detected. In contrast, biomarker responses were more evident in exposed clams which indicate that this species may be considered as more sensitive to OST exposure. CE-related activities successfully reflected OST exposure, with substrates 1-naphthyl  (1NA) and 1-naphthyl butyrate (1NB) displaying the highest sensitivity in the two bivalve species. Data thus indicate the usefulness of CE-related activities as biomarkers for OST exposure in bivalves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30349136>Dietary fibers inhibit obesity in mice, but host responses in the cecum and liver appear unrelated to fiber-specific changes in cecal bacterial taxonomic composition.</a></h2><p>Dietary fibers (DF) can prevent obesity in rodents fed a high- diet (HFD). Their mode of action is not fully elucidated, but the gut microbiota have been implicated. This study aimed to identify the effects of seven dietary fibers (barley beta-glucan, apple pectin, inulin, inulin  ester, inulin propionate ester, inulin butyrate ester or a combination of inulin propionate ester and inulin butyrate ester) effective in preventing diet-induced obesity and links to differences in cecal bacteria and host gene expression. Mice (n = 12) were fed either a low- diet (LFD), HFD or a HFD supplemented with the DFs, barley beta-glucan, apple pectin, inulin, inulin  ester, inulin propionate ester, inulin butyrate ester or a combination of inulin propionate ester and inulin butyrate ester for 8 weeks. Cecal bacteria were determined by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Host responses, body composition, metabolic markers and gene transcription (cecum and liver) were assessed post intervention. HFD mice showed increased adiposity, while all of the DFs prevented weight gain. DF specific differences in cecal bacteria were observed. Results indicate that diverse DFs prevent weight gain on a HFD, despite giving rise to different cecal bacteria profiles. Conversely, common host responses to dietary fiber observed are predicted to be important in improving barrier function and genome stability in the gut, maintaining energy homeostasis and reducing HFD induced inflammatory responses in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30624663>Biodiscrimination of α-tocopherol stereoisomers in plasma and tissues of lambs fed different proportions of all-rac-α-tocopheryl  and RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate1,2.</a></h2><p>A ratio of 1.36:1 in relative bioactivity of RRR-α-tocopheryl  as a natural (Nat-α-T) source to all-rac-α-tocopheryl-, as a synthetic (Syn-α-T) source, is generally accepted. This factor also largely reflects the difference in bioavailability. However, studies indicate that neither bioavailability of α-tocopherol stereoisomers nor relative bioavailability between them are constant, but are dose-dependent and differ between organs. However, no information is available about how different ratios between synthetic and natural α-tocopherol affect bioavailability of α-tocopherol stereoisomers. Thirty lambs were randomly assigned to diets supplied with additives containing 5 different Syn-α-T to Nat-α-T ratios, including 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. The experiment lasted for 70 d after which the lambs were slaughtered. The amount of RRR-α-tocopherol generally increased in plasma and organs with increasing the proportion of Nat-α-T in the diet (P < 0.05). However, the relative bioavailability of RRR- and RRS-α-tocopherol in plasma, organs, and abdominal  generally decreased with increasing the proportion of Nat-α-T in the diet (P < 0.05), whereas the other stereoisomers only showed minor changes with the exception of liver. However, a linear response was maintained between the ratio of stereoisomers in the feed and the ratio in plasma and organs. In conclusion, regardless of Syn-α-T to Nat-α-T ratio in the diets, amounts of α-tocopherol stereoisomers in plasma, brain, heart, lungs, and abdominal  were in the following order: RRR > RRS, RSR, RSS > Σ2S.© The Author(s) 2019.

Tocopheryl-phosphate (TP) has been used successfully as a vitamin E source around 1940 but it was subsequently replaced by TAc as it was easier to manufacture. Recently, it has been proposed as an in vivo intermediate in vitamin E  with possibly gene-regulatory functions. TP may be more bioavailable than TAc as intestinal hydrolysis and emulsification are not required. The objective of this work was to compare the bioavailability of TAc and TP in swine. Piglets (18.6 ± 0.6 kg) fitted with jugular catheters received a single test meal (350 g) containing either deuterated (trimethyl-d9) TAc or TP (75 IU/kg body weight, n = 8 per treatment). Twelve serial blood samples were obtained starting premeal until 78 h postmeal for analysis of deuterated T and TP using LC MS/MS. Results were standardized by dividing them by the dose per kg body weight and were subsequently modeled with a multicompartment model. T from TAc had a slow appearance rate (0.040 ± 0.014 h-1) and rapid disappearance rate (0.438 ± 0.160 h-1) with a plateau value of 0.414 ± 0.129 µM/(µmol/kg BW). TP appeared faster in plasma (0.119 ± 0.058 h-1, P = 0.01) while the elimination rate was similar (0.396 ± 0.098 h-1, P = 0.51). The plateau value of TP was only numerically higher (0.758 ± 0.778 µM/(µmol/kg BW), P = 0.34). TP was quickly converted to T; its appearance rate was 0.026 ± 0.009 h-1, slower than the appearance rate of T from TAc (P = 0.01), whereas the elimination rate was 0.220 ± 0.062 h-1, slower than that of T from TAc (P = 0.00). The conversion of TP to T may have been incomplete, as its plateau value was only 0.315 ± 0.109 µM/(µmol/kg BW). The area under the curve, expressed relative to area under the curve for T from TAc, was 34.5% for TP and 107.3% for T from TP. These data confirm that TP is more quickly absorbed than T from TAc. TP is also converted to T and thus a functional precursor of T. Nevertheless, as a source of T, TP failed to offer a clear advantage over TAc in bioavailability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429767>Dapagliflozin improves left ventricular remodeling and aorta sympathetic tone in a pig model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.</a></h2><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a difficult disease with high morbidity and mortality rates and lacks an effective treatment. Here, we report the therapeutic effect of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), on hypertension + hyperlipidemia-induced HFpEF in a pig model.HFpEF pigs were established by infusing a combination of deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II), and Western diet (WD) feeding for 18 weeks. In the 9th week, half of the HFpEF pigs were randomly assigned to receive additional dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/day) by oral gavage daily for the next 9 weeks. Blood pressure,  levels, echocardiography and cardiac hemodynamics for cardiac structural and functional changes, as well as epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations in the plasma and tissues were measured. After sacrifice, cardiac fibrosis, the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activity in the cardiovascular system were also determined.Blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were markedly increased in HFpEF pigs, but only blood pressure was significantly decreased after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment. By echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment, dapagliflozin significantly attenuated heart concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs, but failed to improve diastolic function and compliance with the left ventricle (LV). In the dapagliflozin treatment group, TH expression and norepinephrine concentration in the aorta were strongly mitigated compared to that in the HFpEF group. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in aortic tissue were markedly elevated in HFpEF pigs and inhibited by dapagliflozin. Furthermore, the reduced expression of eNOS and the PKG-1 protein and the cGMP content in the aortas of HFpEF pigs were significantly restored after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment.9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment decreases hypertension and reverses LV concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs partly by restraining sympathetic tone in the aorta, leading to inhibition of the inflammatory response and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853637>Biomass and  production by Rhodococcus opacus PD630 in molasses-based media with and without osmotic-stress.</a></h2><p>Rhodococcus opacus PD630 was used to produce biomass and lipids in molasses-based media with and without osmotic stress. In a 7-day aerobic batch culture at 30 °C, the biomass and  concentrations were maximized using an initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L and ammonium  (nitrogen source) concentration of 2.14 g/L. At a fixed initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L, the concentration of the nitrogen source was further fine-tuned to 2.25 g/L, to maximize the  content of the biomass to around 30% by dry mass. This medium was used to test the effects of stressing salts (sodium , magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride) on production of lipids and biomass. A two-step bolus feeding with magnesium sulfate and sodium , enhanced the final biomass concentration to around 19 g/L (a 50% increase relative to control), but the  content in the biomass was reduced to around 16% w/w. A 33% enhancement in  concentration relative to control, was achieved by feeding magnesium sulfate and sodium . Sugarcane molasses could be effectively used to produce biomass and lipids instead of using the much more expensive pure carbon sources such as glucose and sucrose.Copyright © 2019.

The effects on the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key -modulating enzyme, were studied to investigate the molecular mechanism of -regulating activity of alisols. The effects of alisols on regulating blood lipids and the activities of LPL were determined using a reagent kit method. The structure of LPL was obtained by homology modeling and the interactive mechanism of alisol monomers and the mixture with LPL was investigated by molecular simulation. The alisol monomer and mixture were shown to regulate blood lipids, suggesting that alisols may decrease the level of triglyceride (TG) by improving the activity of LPL. The order of intensity was: mixture > alisol A > alisol B > 24A, indicating that alisols of alismatis rhizoma feature a synergistic effect on LPL. The N- and C-terminus of LPL both represented the catalytic active domains of this -regulating effect. Cys306, Gln129 and Ser166 were the key amino acid residues resulting in the -regulating effect of the alisol monomer while Ser166 and Arg18 were found to be responsible for the -regulating effect of the mixture. The C-terminus of LPL was indirectly involved in the enzymatic process. A folded side chain of alisols or the parent ring was found to bind somewhat weaker to LPL than an open side chain or parent ring. The hydroxyl groups on the C14-, C22-, C28-, C30- and C31-terminus in the side chain, the ring ether structure in C23-position, and the acetyl group in C29-position represented the key sites for the -regulating action of alisols.

Here, we found that high- diet promoted the  accumulation and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in mice, while oral melatonin supplementation alleviated the  accumulation and reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis, including the diversity of intestinal microbiota, relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes, and functional profiling of microbial communities, such as energy , , and carbohydrate . Interestingly, melatonin failed to alleviate the high--induced  accumulation in antibiotic-treated mice; however, microbiota transplantation from melatonin-treated mice alleviated high- diet-induced  metabolic disorders. Notably, short-chain fatty acids were decreased in high- diet-fed mice, while melatonin treatment improved the production of acetic acid. Correlation analysis found a marked correlation between production of acetic acid and relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes. Importantly, sodium  treatment also alleviated high- diet-induced  metabolic disorders. Taken together, our results suggest that melatonin improves  in high- diet-fed mice, and the potential mechanisms may be associated with reprogramming gut microbiota, especially, Bacteroides and Alistipes-mediated acetic acid production.

Sixteen pregnant ewes (108 d of gestation) were randomly blocked and assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control (CON, n = 8) and SFR (n = 8). Ewes were fed a common diet with a 60:40 forage to concentrate ratio for 7-d baseline period followed by a SFR challenge period. Ewes on the SFR treatment were restricted to 30% of the base for 15 d. At the end of the experimental period, all animals were slaughtered and then ruminal contents and ruminal epithelial tissue were collected. Results showed that ruminal pH was greater in SFR group (P = 0.040) compared with CON group, while SFR decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of ruminal , propionate, butyrate, and total volatile fatty acid. A plot of principal coordinate analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed that the composition of ruminal epithelial bacterial communities in the CON group was distinct from that of the ruminal epithelial microbiome in the SFR animals. At the genus level, SFR increased the abundance of unclassified Neisseriaceae, Comamonas, and Papillibacter, and decreased the proportion of Howardella, Desulfobulbus, and Suttonella (P < 0.05) compared with CON group. The metagenome of ruminal epithelium-associated microbiota predicted by PICRUSt revealed that the SFR significantly affected 14 metabolic pathways, and 9 were significantly enriched in the SFR group. In particular, SFR markedly increased relative abundances of dominant gene families involved in amino acid  (P = 0.003), cellular processes and signaling (P = 0.021), and  (P = 0.001). The real-time PCR results showed SFR decreased the mRNA expression of IL-10 (P = 0.003) and upregulated the mRNA expression of IL-6 (P = 0.003) and TLR4 (P = 0.021). The mRNA expression of Claudin-1 (P = 0.001) and ZO-1 (P = 0.009) were lower in the SFR group compared with the CON group. Generally, our data suggest that SFR decreased most ruminal fermentation parameters, altered the composition of rumen epithelium-associated microbiota, and compromised the barrier function of rumen epithelium. These findings are of great importance for understanding the alteration in the rumen function following SFR in pregnant ewes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619130> and Occurrence of Methanogenic and Sulfate-Reducing Syntrophic  Oxidizing Communities in Haloalkaline Environments.</a></h2><p>Anaerobic syntrophic  oxidation (SAO) is a thermodynamically unfavorable process involving a syntrophic  oxidizing bacterium (SAOB) that forms interspecies electron carriers (IECs). These IECs are consumed by syntrophic partners, typically hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea or sulfate reducing bacteria. In this work, the  and occurrence of SAOB at extremely haloalkaline conditions were investigated, using highly enriched methanogenic (M-SAO) and sulfate-reducing (S-SAO) cultures from south-western Siberian hypersaline soda lakes. Activity tests with the M-SAO and S-SAO cultures and thermodynamic calculations indicated that H and formate are important IECs in both SAO cultures. Metagenomic analysis of the M-SAO cultures showed that the dominant SAOB was ' Syntrophonatronum acetioxidans,' and a near-complete draft genome of this SAOB was reconstructed. ' S. acetioxidans' has all genes necessary for operating the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which is likely employed for  oxidation. It also encodes several genes essential to thrive at haloalkaline conditions; including a Na-dependent ATP synthase and marker genes for 'salt-out' strategies for osmotic homeostasis at high soda conditions. Membrane  analysis of the M-SAO culture showed the presence of unusual bacterial diether membrane lipids which are presumably beneficial at extreme haloalkaline conditions. To determine the importance of SAO in haloalkaline environments, previously obtained 16S rRNA gene sequencing data and metagenomic data of five different hypersaline soda lake sediment samples were investigated, including the soda lakes where the enrichment cultures originated from. The draft genome of  S. acetioxidans' showed highest identity with two metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of putative SAOBs that belonged to the highly abundant and diverse  family present in the soda lake sediments. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets of the soda lake sediments showed a high similarity of reads to ' S. acetioxidans' with abundance as high as 1.3% of all reads, whereas aceticlastic methanogens and  oxidizing sulfate-reducers were not abundant (≤0.1%) or could not be detected. These combined results indicate that SAO is the primary anaerobic  oxidizing pathway at extreme haloalkaline conditions performed by haloalkaliphilic syntrophic consortia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30231503>Phenolic Compounds in Organic and Aqueous Extracts from  Pods Analyzed by ULPS-ESI-Q-oa/TOF-MS.

In addition, we searched for eligible interventions that improved the  of glucose and lipids.We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases from inception to May 2018. Publication types that were categorized as randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The main outcome included the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total triglycerides. We performed both a pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis to evaluate the mean difference value and 95% credibility intervals, and we calculated the surface cumulative rank curve.There were a total of 12 kinds of interventions: metformin, 2 mg cyproterone  plus 0.05 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/CA), 0.15 mg desogestrel plus 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/DSG), and 3 mg drospirenone plus 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/DRSP), lifestyle, exercise, diet, metformin + lifestyle, metformin + diet, EE/CA + lifestyle, metformin + EE/CA, and EE/DRSP + lifestyle from the 20 eligible RCTs that were included in this study. Our meta-analysis results showed that metformin + lifestyle (MD = -2.04, 95% CrI = -3.64 to -0.41), EE/CA + lifestyle (MD = -2.23, 95% CrI = -4.11 to -0.35), and EE/DRSP + lifestyle (MD = -2.59, 95% CrI = -4.66 to -0.50) resulted in lower in the levels of total cholesterol. Women treated with metformin + lifestyle (MD = -1.82, 95% CrI = -2.88 to -0.79), EE/CA + lifestyle (MD = -2.25, 95% CrI = -3.58 to -1.08), or EE/DRSP + lifestyle (MD = -2.29, 95% CrI = -3.69 to -1.07) exhibited significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with the placebo group. There was no significant difference between any of the interventions compared with a placebo in the levels of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and total triglycerides. The surface cumulative rank curve revealed that metformin + lifestyle might be the best intervention with respect to the improvement of the homeostasis model of assessment insulin resistance and EE/DRSP + lifestyle appeared to be the best intervention for the reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, the metformin + diet intervention was more effective in reducing the level of total triglycerides.For overweight polycystic ovary syndrome patients, our evidence revealed that EE/CA and EE/SRSP combined with metformin or lifestyle changes can reduce the adverse effects on glucose and  of the use of oral contraceptive agents alone. Conventional PCOS treatments, such as metformin, EE/CA, and EE/DRSP, combined with lifestyle control can be particularly effective in improving the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544489>Faecal Short Chain Fatty Acids Profile is Changed in Polish Depressive Women.</a></h2><p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) being produced during fermentation of non-digestible polysaccharides are regulatory compounds with the potential to influence inflammatory, as well as emotional state and cognition through the gut⁻brain axis. We analyzed the association between stool concentration of SCFAs (acetic acid (C 2:0), propionic acid (C 3:0), isobutyric acid (C 4:0 ), butyric acid (C 4:0 ), isovaleric acid (C 5:0 ) valeric acid (C 5:0 ), isocaproic acid (C 6:0 ), caproic acid, and (C 6:0 ) heptanoic acid (C 7:0)) and depressive symptoms among women and looked for the potential confounders of microbiota byproduct synthesis. We enrolled 116 women aged 52.0 ± 4.7 years and recognized depression in 47 (40.52%). To analyze the emotional state, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) was used. We assessed SCFAs content by means of gas chromatography. Fiber intake was estimated using parts of food frequency questionnaire. The content of acetic acid was significantly lowered compared to non-depressed women (median {IQR}: 29.49 {20.81} vs. 34.99 {19.55},  = 0.04). A tendency toward decreased level of propionic acid was noticed (median {IQR}: 16.88 {9.73} vs. 21.64 {12.17},  = 0.07), while the concentration of isocaproic acid was significantly increased in (median {IQR}: 0.89 {1.15} vs. 0.56 {0.95},  < 0.01) comparison to matched healthy subjects. We found negative correlations between , propionate, and Beck's score (r = -0.2,  = 0.03; r = -0.21,  = 0.02, respectively). Statistically significant correlations between  and propionate and BDI somatic score (r = -0.21,  = 0.01; r = -0.17,  = 0.03), as well as correlations regarding isocaproic and both cognitive/affective (r = 0.37,  = 0.0001) and somatic (r = 9.37,  < 0.001) scores were found. Women who declared current usage of -lowering and thyroid drugs in the past, had higher content of C6:0-i (Users; median {IQR}: 1.91 {3.62} vs. non-users; 0.55 {0.67};  = 0.0048).and lower of C2:0 (Users; median {IQR}: 23.07 {12.80} vs. non users 33.73 {21.44};  = 0.041), respectively. No correlations regarding SCFAs concentration and fiber intake were found. We concluded that SCFAs may potentially contribute to depression phenotype, however, due to the small size of groups suffering from moderately heavy ( = 5) and severe ( = 7) depression, the conclusion should be treated with caution. Pharmacotherapy of hyperlipidemia and thyroid disease might affect SCFAs synthesis.

Dexamethasone (DXM) was used to create a CP mouse model. A 9.4‑Tesla (T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imager was used to measure an array of metabolites in the maternal serum, placental tissue, amniotic fluid and fetal palates. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed using SIMCA‑P 14.1 software. Following DXM treatment, variations were detected in multiple metabolites in the female mice and their fetuses based on 9.4T MRS. It was indicated that in the experimental group during CP formation, leucine, valine, creatine,  and citrate levels in the palatal tissue were lower, whereas lactate, alanine, proline/inositol and glutamate‑containing metabolite levels were higher, compared with the levels in the control group. In placental tissue and amniotic fluid, succinate and choline levels were lower in the experimental group. The relative concentrations of cholesterol and lipids in palatal tissues from mice treated with DXM were higher compared with the concentrations in tissues from mice in the control group, with the exception of (CH2)n lipids.

Laying hens that consume β-cryptoxanthin-biofortified maize deposit β-cryptoxanthin into egg yolk.We investigated whether β-cryptoxanthin-biofortified egg consumption would affect VA status of male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) compared with white-yolked eggs.β-Cryptoxanthin-biofortified egg yolk, produced in hens fed biofortified orange maize or tangerine-fortified maize feeds, was freeze-dried and fed to gerbils. White-yolked eggs were produced by feeding white maize to hens. Gerbils (n = 57) were fed VA-deficient feed for 28 d. After baseline (n = 7), treatments (n = 10/group) included oil control (VA-); 16.7% orange maize-biofortified, tangerine-fortified, or white-yolk egg feeds; or retinyl  as positive control (VA+) matched to daily preformed retinol intake from the eggs for 30 d. Preformed retinol did not differ between the egg yolks. Gerbil liver retinol, , fatty acids, and cholesterol were determined.Liver retinol concentration (0.13 ± 0.03 µmol/g) and total hepatic VA (0.52 ± 0.12 µmol) were higher in gerbils fed orange maize-biofortified eggs than in all other groups. The VA- group was severely VA deficient (0.018 ±0.010 µmol/g; P < 0.05). Liver retinol was similar among VA+, tangerine-egg-, and white-egg-fed gerbils, but retinol reserves were higher in tangerine-egg-fed gerbils (0.35 ± 0.11 μmol) than in VA+ or VA- gerbils or at baseline (P < 0.05). Liver  was 3.6 times (P < 0.0001) and cholesterol was 2.1 times (P < 0.004) higher in egg-fed groups that experienced hepatosteatosis. Liver fatty acid profiles reflected feed, but retinyl ester fatty acids did not.The preformed retinol in the eggs enhanced gerbil VA status, and the β-cryptoxanthin-biofortified eggs from hens fed orange maize prevented deficiency.

HET received either no treatment or were allowed access to 1% Bet supplemented water for 8 weeks. As we previously showed with choline (Cho), Bet improved hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis in HET. The protection from obesity associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and increased  breakdown in adipocytes was attributed to increased energy requirements for  and elimination of supplemented Bet and Cho. H-NMR-based profiling revealed metabolic changes caused by Bet and Cho supplementation. Cho increased the citric acid cycle intermediate succinic acid while reducing isoleucine, valine, threonine, and lysine. Bet increased α-ketoglutaric acid and did not stimulate catabolism of amino acids. Increased histidine and alanine are specific biomarkers for Bet treatment. Cho and Bet caused glycerol accumulation and reduced sarcosine, taurine, , and β-hydroxybutyrate levels. These data provide new insights on how Cho and Bet supplementation can aid in treatment of obesity related disorders due to their positive effects on lipolysis, the citric acid cycle, and mitochondrial oxidative demethylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29887845>Alternative Substrate  in .</a></h2><p>Recent advances in genetic engineering capabilities have enabled the development of oleochemical producing strains of .

Evidence now shows that autophagy plays key roles in the degradation of intracellular  droplets via autolysosome, and also in the release of intracellular lipids via cholesterol efflux. In this study, we identified that a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, Mito-Tempol, has protective effects against cholesteryl esters accumulation by activating autophagy. Mito-Tempol was shown to ameliorate the  burden for atherosclerosis, both in vitro and in vivo. In the established in vitro foam cell formation system using oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-loaded THP-1 macrophages, Mito-Tempol prevented intracellular oxidative stress and attenuated  accumulation. Mito-Tempol rescued ox-LDL-impaired autophagic flux, thereby facilitating autophagy-mediated  degradation in THP-1 macrophages. Meanwhile, Mito-Tempol also increased the efflux of cholesterol via autophagy-dependent ABCA1 and ABCG1 up-regulation. The classical autophagy pathway of mTOR may be one of the effector for the autophagy restoration of Mito-Tempol. Our findings give the first insight that cardiovascular system disease may benefits more from the treatment of Mito-Tempol for its impact of reversing atherosclerosis via autophagy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

(Solanaceae) is a plant native to South America where it is used in traditional medicine for different therapeutic indications. This study evaluated the chemical composition and the hepatoprotective and analgesic activities of S. paniculatum leaf extracts.The chemical profile of an ethyl  partition (SPOE) of a S. paniculatum leaf infusion (SPAE) was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESIMS). Liver protective effects of SPAE (600 and 1200 mg/kg bw, po), or SPOE (300 mg/kg bw, po) were evaluated in a C57BL/6 mouse model of acetaminophen (AP, 600 mg/kg bw, ip) hepatotoxicity by measuring alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotransferase activity in the serum, and reduced glutathione (GSH), and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARs) levels in the hepatic tissue.HPLC-ESIMS analysis of the SPOE fraction tentatively identified 35 flavonoids, esters of hydroxycinnamic acid and isomers of chlorogenic acid. SPAE (600 and 1200 mg/kg bw) and SPOE (300 mg/kg bw) antagonized the rise in ALT and AST, and the depletion of GSH, and elevation of TBARs levels in the liver caused by AP. The liver protective effects of SPOE (300 mg/kg bw) against AP-induced liver toxicity mimicked those of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC 300 or 600 mg/kg bw ip). The mouse writhing assay showed that SPOE (300 mg/kg bw po) has anti-nociceptive effects comparable to those of AP (180 mg/kg bw po).This study suggests that an extract of S. paniculatum leaves (SPOE), rich in phenolic compounds, is a promising herbal drug to prevent and treat AP poisoning and presents analgesic properties as well.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

One of the main limitations for photobioreactor productivity is light shielding, especially at high cell densities. The growth of the green microalga Chlorella sorokiniana, a robust industrial species, has been evaluated under different trophic conditions with traditional carbon sources, such as glucose and sucrose, and alternative low cost carbon sources, such as carob pod extract, industrial glycerol and -rich oxidized wine waste lees. The mixotrophic cultivation of this microalga with wine waste lees alleviated the problems of light shielding observed in photoautotrophic cultures, improving specific growth rate (0.052 h) compared with the other organic sources. The fed-batch mixotrophic culture of Chlorella sorokiniana in a 2 L stirred tank reactor, with optimized nutritional conditions, 100 mM of  coming from the oxidized wine waste lees and 30 mM of ammonium, produced an algal biomass concentration of 11 g L with a  content of 38 % (w/w).

There is evidence that leptin increases during obesity in dogs. Hyperleptinemia is associated with increased neutrophil oxidative  in obese humans and contributes to oxidative stress. However, in obese dogs, the probable relationship between this condition and the activation of the oxidative  of neutrophils has yet to be established. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that neutrophil activation and systemic oxidative stress occur in dogs with hyperleptinemia. A control group of 24 healthy dogs with a body condition score (BCS) of 4-5, an overweight group of 25 dogs with a BCS of 6-7, and 27 obese dogs with a BCS of 8-9, were composed. Two subgroups were formed composed of dogs with and without hyperleptinemia, grouped according to the 95% confidence interval obtained for plasma leptin values of the control group. Changes in obesity markers (body condition score, adiponectin and plasma leptin) and plasma oxidative stress ( peroxidation, total antioxidant and oxidant capacities and oxidative stress index) were measured in all the dogs selected. Neutrophil oxidative  was evaluated in flow cytometry by superoxide production with the probe hydroethidine and by hydrogen peroxide production with the probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, with or without phorbol myristate  (PMA) stimulation. Apoptosis and neutrophil viability were quantified in a capillary flow cytometer using Annexin VPE, with or without camptothecin apoptosis inducing effect. Obese dogs presented higher systemic oxidative stress, hyperleptinemia and preactivated neutrophils with accelerated apoptosis. Dogs with hyperleptinemia and obese dogs presented higher neutrophil superoxide production under PMA stimulation and the presence of systemic oxidative stress compared with control. To our knowledge, this is probably the first evidence that preactivation of the oxidative  of circulating neutrophils occurs in dogs with hyperleptinemia, a condition that can induce systemic oxidative stress in the canine species.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In response to cold or other adrenergic stimuli, brown adipocytes increase their substrate uptake and oxidative activity while uncoupling ATP synthesis from the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. Brown adipocytes are found in classic depots such as in the interscapular BAT (iBAT). They can also develop in white adipose tissue (WAT), such as in the inguinal WAT (iWAT), where their presence has been associated with metabolic improvements. We previously reported that the induction of oxidative  in iWAT is low compared with that of iBAT, even after sustained adrenergic stimulation. One explanation to this apparent lack of thermogenic ability of iWAT is the presence of an active iBAT, which may prevent the full activation of iWAT. In this study, we evaluated whether iBAT denervation-induced browning of white  enhanced the thermogenic activity of iWAT following cold acclimation, under beta-3 adrenergic stimulation (CL 316,243). Following a bilateral denervation of iBAT, we assessed energy balance, evaluated the oxidative activity of iBAT and iWAT using C-, and quantified the dynamic glucose uptake of those tissues using 2-deoxy-2-[F]- fluoro-d-glucose. Our results indicate that despite portraying marked browning and mildly enhanced glucose uptake, iWAT of cold-adapted mice does not exhibit significant oxidative activity following beta-3 adrenergic stimulation in the absence of a functional iBAT. The present results suggest that iWAT is not readily recruitable as a thermogenic organ even when functional iBAT is lacking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29729383>Ameliorative potential of Lavandula stoechas in metabolic syndrome via multitarget interactions.</a></h2><p>Decoction and infusion prepared from aerial parts of Lavandula stoechas L. (L. stoechas) have been traditionally used as remedy against several components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and associated disorders including type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by Anatolian people.The aim is to elucidate the potential ameliorative effects of L. stoechas aqueous extracts on insulin resistance and inflammation models through multitarget in vitro approaches and also to elucidate mechanism of action by analyzing transcriptional and metabolic responses.An aqueous extract was prepared and fractionated to give rise to ethyl  (EE) and butanol (BE) extracts. The anti-insulin resistance effects of BE and EE were evaluated on palmitate induced insulin resistance model of H4IIE, C2C12 and 3T3L1 cells by using several metabolic parameters. Specifically, whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed by using microarray over 55.000 genes in control, insulin resistant and EE (25 µg/mL) treated insulin resistant H4IIE cells. Anti-inflammatory effects of both extracts were analyzed in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.Both EE and BE at low doses (25-50 µg/mL) significantly decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis in H4IIE cell line by suppressing the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase. In C2C12 myotubes, both extracts increased the insulin stimulated glucose uptake more effectively than metformin. Both extracts decreased the isoproterenol induced lipolysis in 3T3L1 cell line. Moreover, they also effectively increased the expression of lipoprotein lipase protein level in insulin resistant myotubes at low doses. EE increased the protein level of PPARγ and stimulated the activation AKT in insulin resistant H4IIE and C2C12 cell lines. The results obtained from biochemical assays, mRNA/protein studies and whole genome transcriptome analyses were found to be complementary and provided support for the hypothesis that EE might be biologically active against insulin resistance and act through the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and AKT activation. Besides, LPS induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages was mainly inhibited by EE through suppression of iNOS/NO signaling, IL1β and COX-2 genes. HPLC-TOF/MS analysis of EE of L. stoechas mainly resulted in caffeic acid, apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid and its methyl ester, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, ferrulic acid and salicylic acid.Data suggest that EE of L. stoechas contains phytochemicals that can be effective in the treatment/prevention of insulin resistance and inflammation. These results validate the traditional use of L. stoechas in Anatolia against several metabolic disorders including metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2018.

The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), DPPH scavenging activity and the ameliorative effects of the extracts on Fe-induced oxidative injury was investigated both in vitro and ex vivo. Alpha glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory potentials of the extracts were examined in vitro, while the effects of the ethanol extract on abdominal glucose intake and muscle glucose uptake were determined in freshly harvested tissues ex vivo. The extracts were subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify their possible bioactive components. The ethanol extract showed the most potent FRAP and DPPH radical scavenging activities compared to other extracts. All extracts increased catalase and SOD activities, and GSH levels in oxidative pancreatic injury. Both ethanol and aqueous extracts exhibited remarkable enzyme inhibitory activities, which was significantly higher than ethyl  extract and acarbose but was not comparable to orlistat. The ethanol extract portrayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on jejunal glucose uptake and enhancement of muscle glucose uptake. 9-(4 methoxyphenyl) xanthene, xanthone and stigmasterol showed strong binding affinities for α-glucosidase and lipase enzymes tested. Data from this study suggest that aerial parts of B. diffusa (particularly the ethanol extract) may not only exhibit antioxidant potentials but may also mediate anti-lipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects via inhibiting  and carbohydrate digestion as well as abdominal glucose intake and enhancing muscle glucose uptake.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Recent study revealed that the extracts from sea cucumber, Holothuroidea spp., exhibited neuroprotective and lifespan extension effects in Caenorhabditis elegans model. Interestingly, the black sea cucumber, Holothuria leucospilota, possesses body wall and a specialized organ called cuvierian tubules containing high amount of bioactive compounds. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of the body wall (BW) and cuvierian tubules (CT) from this sea cucumber against PD were evaluated using C. elegans as a model. H. leucospilota were extracted using ethanol (ET), ethyl  (EA), butanol (BU) and aqueous (AQ) fractions. Extracts from these fractions were used to treat the 6-OHDA-induced BZ555 and α-synuclein expressing NL5901 strains of C. elegans. Treatment with ET, EA, BU and AQ fractions of H. leucospilota extracts could significantly prevent degeneration of DA neurons in 6-OHDA-induced worms, improve food-sensing behavior mediated by DA neurons, and up-regulate cat-2 and sod-3 gene expressions. These results indicate the neuroprotective activity of the extracts which may be attributed to the anti-oxidant activity of the bioactive compounds. Moreover, α-synuclein aggregation was significantly reduced together with the recovery of  deposition upon the treatment with H. leucospilota extracts. In addition, treatment with H. leucospilota extracts was able to increase the lifespan of 6-OHDA-induced N2. NMR analysis revealed the major chemical components in the effective EA fractions were terpenoids, steroids, saponins, and glycosides. In summary, H. leucospilota extracts exhibited anti-Parkinson effect in both toxin-induced and transgenic C. elegans models of PD. Further study will be performed to elucidate the most effective anti-PD molecules which will lead to the development of anti-PD drug.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

The current study was designed to evaluate the protective effect of ethyl  fraction from Rotula aquatica (EFRA) against gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity. The antioxidant enzymes status,  peroxidation, nitrate and ROS level, serum markers like creatinine, Urea, BUN were estimated in the present study. The histopathological analysis of renal tissues was done by H&E and PAS staining. The mRNA level expression of KIM-1, NF-κB, TNF- α, and IL-6 were measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The changes in antioxidant parameters were restored by the treatment of EFRA at different dose (50 mg/kg bwt, 100 mg/kg bwt). The serum parameters, ROS, MDA and nitrate level were decreased by administration of EFRA. The EFRA ameliorates histological changes associated with gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity. The mRNA level expression of KIM-1, NF-κB, TNF- α, and IL-6 were downregulated in EFRA treated groups. The results from present study reveals the role of EFRA as good anti-inflammatory and nephro protective drug.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol ,  digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High- diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs , propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high- diet-related colon cancer. This article reviews the current knowledge concerning the effects of secondary BAs and SCFAs on the proliferation of colon epithelial cells, inflammation, cancer, and the associated microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30118879>Premna integrifolia ameliorates cyclophosphamide-induced hepatotoxicity by modulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effect of ethyl  extract of Premna integrifolia L. (EAEPI) leaves in cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced hepatic injury in mice. Mice were intoxicated with CP (200 mg/kg b. wt., i.p.) for 5 weeks or EAEPI (400 and 600 mg/kg b. wt., orally) in combination with CP. The results demonstrated that EAEPI exerts protective effect against CP induced hepatotoxicity, as evident from restoration of altered haematological parameters and alleviations of liver marker enzymes in serum. EAEPI also attenuated oxidative stress and antioxidant markers as evident from reversal of  peroxidation, glutathione levels as well as activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes. Moreover, EAEPI attenuated apoptosis and histopathological liver tissue damage in CP-intoxicated mice. In conclusion, EAEPI could protect mice liver against cyclophosphamide toxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis.The protective activity of EAEPI may be due to presence of polyphenolic compounds as identified by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Like enterocytes, EEs express components of the immune deficiency (IMD) innate immune pathway, which activates transcription of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. The discovery of large  droplets in intestines of IMD pathway mutants prompted us to investigate the role of the IMD pathway in the host metabolic response to its intestinal microbiota. Here we provide evidence that the short-chain fatty acid  is a microbial metabolic signal that activates signaling through the enteroendocrine IMD pathway in a PGRP-LC-dependent manner. This, in turn, increases transcription of the gene encoding the endocrine peptide Tachykinin (Tk), which is essential for timely larval development and optimal  and insulin signaling. Our findings suggest innate immune pathways not only provide the first line of defense against infection but also afford the intestinal microbiota control over host development and .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The possibility of masking their bitter taste and enhancing sustained release in the rumen can be achieved through encapsulation. The objectives of this study were to prepare an encapsulated Acacia tannin extract (ATE) suitable for ruminants using the solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) method, and to evaluate the microparticles in terms of morphology, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release under varying pH. Subsequently, the effect of the microparticles on rumen in vitro gas and methane production would be evaluated.  microparticles were prepared using the double emulsion process with palm oil and lard, dichloromethane, and Tween80/Span80 emulsifiers. The microparticles produced by S/O/W emulsion tended to be smaller (P = 0.06), and had greater encapsulation efficiency compared with those produced by the melt dispersion method. Scanning electron micrographs showed microparticles had stable cylindrical and spherical shapes, with mean size of 34± 10.2 μm. Maximum encapsulation efficiencies of 78.6% and 80.1% were obtained with lard and palm oil as  wall materials, respectively, even under high core material loading percentage of 80%. Wall material type did not affect the characteristics of microparticles. In  buffer, only about 20% of tannin was released from the -encapsulated microparticles into buffer media after 24 hours. In contrast, about 90% of the tannin had been released into solution before eight hours in the crude extract. -encapsulated ATE reduced rumen gas and methane production in vitro (P ˂0.05) in both Eragrostis and total mixed ration (TMR) diet substrates, but the magnitude of reduction was lower than that obtained when unencapsulated ATE was the additive (10% vs 20% for total gas and 17% vs 24% for methane). Crude ATE and palm oil encapsulated ATE reduced the concentration of methane in sampled gas (P = 0.054) when fermenting the TMR substrate, but this effect was not observed in the Eragrostis substrate. Ammonia nitrogen concentration was greater in encapsulated ATE compared with the crude ATE (P ˂0.001). These results show that the -encapsulated ATE produced small-sized and more uniform microparticles, with high encapsulation efficiency compared with microparticles prepared by melt dispersion. Encapsulation of ATE enhanced the sustained release of tannin in the rumen, and with the potential to improve gas production and reduce methane production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162795>Lipidomic characteristics and clinical findings of epileptic patients treated with valproic acid.</a></h2><p>Our early study has found valproic acid (VPA)-induced lipid dysmetabolism in animal model, however, the details of lipid profiling of VPA-treated epileptic patients remain unknown. Therefore, in this study, the blood samples of VPA-treated epileptic patients and VPA-free controls were collected for lipidomic and biochemical assays. As results, clinical data showed the changes of some blood lipid molecules in VPA-treated epileptic patients. In lipidomic assays, all 3797 annotated positive ions were identified prior to the data validation. In addition, the number of differentially expressed lipids were identified. And the 133 lipid molecules in VPA-treated cases were significantly up-regulated when compared to those in controls, while other 250 lipid metabolites were down-regulated. Further, these lipid metabolites were mainly constituted with glycerolipids, glycerophopholipids, fatty acyls, sterol lipids. In addition, the most significant elevations of metabolite molecules of triglyceride, sphingomyelin, phosphorylcholine, ceramides, phenolic phthiocerol, as well as topped reductions of phosphoethanolamines, diradylglycerols, 1α,25-dihydroxy-24-oxo-22-oxavitamin D3, 2-deoxy-20-hydroxy-5alpha-ecdysone 3-, dolichyl-4 phosphate were identified respectively. Taken together, these clinical findings demonstrate that negative impacts of exposure to VPA on expression of lipid mediators, progressively disrupting the functions of lipid molecules. Interestingly, these differentially expressed metabolites may be potential biomarkers for screening VPA-induced dyslipidemia.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the structure activity relationships (SAR) studies of flavonoids against this disease have not been thoroughly comprehended. Hence, in the present study, 14 structurally related flavonoids viz. wogonin, techtochrysin, norwogonin, isoscutellarein, hypolaetin, kaempferol, quercetin, methyl ether of wogonin,  of wogonin,  of norwogonin, 8-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone, chrysin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were taken into account for in vitro antidiabetic evaluation. Cell viability of RIN-5F pancreatic cells and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells was initially tested, then an insulin secretion assay of RIN-5F as well as adipogenesis and glucose uptake measurements of adipocyte were investigated. Subsequently, protein expressions study through adipokines measurement (leptin, adiponectin, TNF-α, RBP-4) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, Western blotting analysis against GLUT4 and C/EBP-α as well as molecular docking against GLUT1 were analyzed. The results from cell culture antidiabetic assays (insulin secretion, adipogenesis, and glucose uptake), protein expressions and molecular docking pointed that the methoxy group at position C-8 is responsible for antidiabetic property of selected flavonoids via glucose uptake mechanism indicated by up regulation of GLUT4 and C/EBP-α expressions. The mechanism could be enhanced by the addition of an  group at C-5 and C-7 of the flavone skeleton.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29874688>Chondroitin Sulphate Attenuates Atherosclerosis in ApoE Knockout Mice Involving Cellular Regulation of the Inflammatory Response.</a></h2><p>Chondroitin sulphate (CS) has long been used to treat osteoarthritis. Some investigations have also shown that the treatment with CS could reduce coronary events in patients with heart disease but no studies have identified the mechanistic role of these therapeutic effects. We aimed to investigate how the treatment with CS can interfere with the progress of atherosclerosis. The aortic arch, thoracic aorta and serum were obtained from apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice fed for 10 weeks with high- diet and then treated with CS (300 mg/kg,  = 15) or vehicle ( = 15) for 4 weeks. Atheromatous plaques were highlighted in aortas with Oil Red staining and analysed by microscopy. ApoE knockout mice treated with CS exhibited attenuated atheroma lesion size by 68% as compared with animals receiving vehicle. Serum lipids, glucose and C-reactive protein were not affected by treatment with CS. To investigate whether CS locally affects the inflamed endothelium or the formation of foam cells in plaques, human endothelial cells and monocytes were stimulated with tumour necrosis factor α or phorbol myristate  in the presence or absence of CS. CS reduced the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and ephrin-B2 and improved the migration of inflamed endothelial cells. CS inhibited foam cell formation in vivo and concomitantly CD36 and CD146 expression and oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake and accumulation in cultured activated human monocytes and macrophages. Reported cardioprotective effects of CS may arise from modulation of pro-inflammatory activation of endothelium and monocytes and foam cell formation.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001637>Rv1075c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a GDSL-Like Esterase and Is Important for Intracellular Survival.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis  pathways facilitate access to carbon and energy sources during infection. M. tuberculosis gene Rv1075c was annotated as a conserved hypothetical protein. We identified that Rv1075c amino acid sequence shares similarities with other bacterial lipase/esterases and we demonstrated that it has esterase activity, with preference for short-chain fatty acids, particularly , with highest activity at 45°C, pH 9. Site-direct mutagenesis revealed its activity triad as Ser80, Asp244, and His247. We further determined that rRv1075c hydrolyzed triacetin and tributyrin, and it was mainly distributed in cell wall and membrane. Its expression was induced at pH 4.5, mimicking the acidic phagosome of macrophages. Mutation of Rv1075c led to reduced bacterial growth in THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived macrophages, and attenuated M. tuberculosis infection in mice.

SAMPLE Surfactant samples obtained from 6 horses with severe asthma and 7 healthy horses. PROCEDURES Clinical evaluation of horses and surfactant analysis were performed. Samples obtained from horses with severe asthma and healthy horses before (baseline), during, and after exposure to hay were analyzed. Crude surfactant pellets were dried prior to dissolution in a solution of isopropanol:methanol:chloroform (4:2:1) containing 7.5mM ammonium . Shotgun lipidomics were performed by use of high-resolution data acquisition on an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Findings were analyzed by use of an ANOVA with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. RESULTS Results of lipidomic analysis were evaluated to detect significant differences between groups of horses and among exposure statuses within groups of horses. Significantly increased amounts of cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) were detected in surfactant from severely asthmatic horses during exposure to hay, compared with baseline and postexposure concentrations. Concentrations of cPA and DAG did not change significantly in healthy horses regardless of exposure status. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE cPA 16:0 and DAG 36:2 were 2 novel  mediators identified in surfactant obtained from asthmatic horses with clinical disease. These molecules were likely biomarkers of sustained inflammation. Further studies are needed to evaluate a possible correlation with disease severity and potential alterations in the plasma lipidomic profile of horses with asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782289>Bioactivity evaluation and HPLC UV-VIS based quantification of antioxidant secondary metabolites from extract and fractions of Bistorta amplexicaulis rhizome.</a></h2><p>Bistorta amplexicaulis is a popular medicinal plant and reported as rich source of antioxidant compounds. The present study was designed for antioxidant and anticancer potential of polarity based fractions of B. amplexicaulis and its correlation to the secondary metabolites quantified by HPLC-UV/VIS.Crude extract was prepared by maceration method and polarity based fractions were prepared by solvent-solvent extraction. Antioxidant and anticancer potential was investigated by using various physiological and non-physiological assays while secondary metabolites rutin, naringin and quercetin present in extract and fractions were quantified by using HPLC- UV/VIS. All extracts showed Antioxidant potential but highest activity was obtained with ethyl  fraction (DPPH IC50 5.76±0.03 µg/ml, ABTS IC50 0.74±0.1 µg/ml, Total Antioxidant Assay 72.55±0.098 Ascorbic acid equivalents, Super oxide radical scavenging assay IC506.86±0.1909 µg/ml, Hydroxyl radical scavenging assay IC50 0.96±0.1690 µg/ml). The cytotoxicity of fractions against HepG2 cell lines showed lowest ell viability in n-hexane fraction (11%). The results revealed that ethyl  fraction of B. amplexicaulis can be a potential source of novel antioxidant compounds while n hexane fraction could provide anticancer compounds. A new method of simultaneous quantification of three flavonoids by using UV/VIS detector is reported in this study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558515>Effect of Zingiber officinale on some biochemical parameters and cytogenic analysis in lead-induced toxicity in experimental rats.</a></h2><p>Exposure to toxic elements is greatly unavoidable in our daily activities due to several routes of coming in contact with these elements. Thus lead (Pb), is one of the major causes of health hazard in human. In this study, evaluation of Zingiber officinale as mitigating measure against Pb induced biochemical and cytogenic toxicity in albino rats was investigated. Experimental rats were grouped into five with five animals per group, group I serves as control and groups 2-5 were induced intraperitoneal with lead  dissolved in distilled water at 3 mg/kg body weight whereas group 3-5 were orally administered with 200 mg/kg vitamin C, 200 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg of Z. officinale, respectively for 7 d. The obtained results show that aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),  peroxidation, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were significantly increased (p < 0.05) and catalase (CAT) were reduced progressively in Pb alone induced rats. Hematological parameters showed a progressive reduction (p < 0.05) in lead  alone rats. There were significant changes in micronuclei (MN), chromosomal aberrations (CA) frequency, and oxidative damages in the bone marrow cells from lead  alone induced rats, although, mitotic index scores in these cells were reduced gradually (p < 0.05). The altered parameters were significantly reversed toward the levels observed in normal control rats administered with vitamin C and aqueous extract of Z. officinale. Hence, these results suggest that Z. officinale roots might contain therapeutic potential that can ameliorate the hazard effect of lead  poison.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268629>Cellulose , a new candidate feed supplement for ruminant animals: In vitro evaluations.</a></h2><p>Cellulose  (CA), a derivative of cellulose in which some hydroxyl groups are substituted with acetyl groups, was evaluated as a new cellulosic feed source for ruminants. In the present work, a series of in vitro studies was carried out to determine how CA supplementation affects rumen fermentation and microbiota. Batch culture studies were conducted to select the type of CA suitable for feed use and to define the optimal supplementation level. Rumen fluid from 2 Holstein cows was mixed with McDougall's buffer in test tubes into which grass hay and concentrate containing a fiber source [cellulose (control), water-soluble CA (WSCA), or insoluble CA] had been placed. Each fiber source was supplemented at 10% of total substrate. Tubes were incubated for 24 h to determine fermentation and microbial parameters. Then, the dose response of these parameters to different supplementation levels of WSCA (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30%) was tested in the same manner. We also operated a continuous culture system with WSCA supplementation and evaluated the effects on digestibility, fermentation, and microbial parameters. The supplementation level of WSCA was set at 15% of total feed. In batch culture studies, WSCA, but not insoluble CA, yielded dose-dependent increases in ruminal  levels. In the continuous culture system study, WSCA yielded increases in ruminal  levels and in the abundance of bacteria of the genus Prevotella, including Prevotella ruminicola. Dry matter digestibility and total gas production were not affected. These results suggest that WSCA supplementation at 15% of total feed yielded increased  levels without negatively affecting feed digestion; these effects may reflect activation of Prevotella species. As ruminal  is involved in milk  synthesis, WSCA can be considered as a candidate feed additive suitable for dairy cattle.The Authors.

In the present study, the molecular mechanism underlying the antiobesity effect of consuming blackberry anthocyanins (BLA) and blueberry anthocyanins (BBA) was investigated in high--diet- (HFD-) fed C57BL/6 mice. Sixty mice were administered a low- diet (LFD), a HFD, or a HFD plus orlistat, and BLA or BBA in their daily food for 12 weeks. As a result, the consumption of BLA and BBA inhibited body weight gain by 40.5% and 55.4%, respectively, in HFD-fed mice. The BLA and BBA treatments markedly reduced serum and hepatic  levels and significantly increased hepatic superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. In addition, the treatments effectively increased fecal  and butyrate levels and significantly attenuated expression of tumor necrosis factor TNF-, interleukin-6, and nuclear factor-kappaB genes. Moreover, gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectroscopy results suggested that BLA and BBA significantly affected the hepatic  and glucose metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid , glutathione , and the insulin-signaling pathway.

Alterations in the adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) may contribute to the adipose tissue remodeling associated with metabolic syndrome and impact the regional distribution of adipose tissue by generating inherently dysfunctional adipocytes. Here we examine the expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes and their relationship with the lipogenic, antioxidant and oxidative potential of adipocytes generated from visceral ASCs (adipo-visASCs) and subcutaneous ASCs (adipo-subASCs) from subjects with different metabolic profiles.Paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were processed to isolate the respective ASCs from normal-weight (Nw) subjects and obese patients with metabolic syndrome (METS) and without METS (NonMETS). qPCR was used to quantify the expression levels of the genes studied in both adipo-ASCs from the patient groups and those generated after silencing by small interfering RNA of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes. The accumulation of lipids was quantified by absorbance.No significant differences in cell yield or CD34CD31CD45 ASC percentage were observed between the different patient groups. Unlike adipo-visASCs, adipo-subASCs from METS patients showed a decrease in expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes as well as proteins linked to lipogenesis, antioxidant defense and fatty acid oxidation. Transcriptional silencing of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes in adipo-subASCs reduced  accumulation and affected transcription levels of lipogenic and antioxidant defense proteins.Adipo-subASCs may be more susceptible than adipo-visASCs to deterioration of the lipogenic, oxidative and antioxidant potential associated with metabolic syndrome. Intrinsic alterations in transcription levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes may contribute to the metabolic reprogramming of adipo-subASCs from METS patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

More than 31 BPH-resistance genes have been located, and several of them have been isolated. Nevertheless, the metabolic mechanism related to BPH-resistance genes remain uncharacterized.To elucidate the resistance mechanism of the BPH-resistance gene Bph6 at the metabolic level, a Bph6-transgenic line R6 (BPH-resistant) and the wild-type Nipponbare (BPH-susceptible) were used to investigate their  profiles under control and BPH treatments.In conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, BPH-induced  changes in leaf blade and leaf sheath were investigated by GC-MS-based lipidomics.Forty-five lipids were identified in leaf sheath extracts. Leaf sheath lipidomics analysis results show that BPH infestation induces significant differences in the  profiles of Nipponbare and R6. The levels of hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester, linoleic acid, methyl ester, linolenic acid, methyl ester, glycidyl palmitate, eicosanoic acid, methyl ester, docosanoic acid, methyl ester, beta-monolinolein, campesterol, beta-sitosterol, cycloartenol, phytol and phytyl  had undergone enormous changes after BPH feeding. These results illustrate that BPH feeding enhances sterol biosynthetic pathway in Nipponbare plants, and strengthens wax biosynthesis and phytol  in R6 plants. The results of quantitative real-time PCR of 5 relevant genes were consistent with the changes in metabolic level. Forty-five lipids were identified in the leaf blade extracts. BPH infestation induces distinct changes in the  profiles of the leaf blade samples of Nipponbare and R6. Although the  changes in Nipponbare are more drastic, the changes within the two varieties are similar.  profiles in leaf sheath brought out significant differences than in leaf blade within Nipponbare and R6. We propose that Bph6 mainly affects the levels of lipids in leaf sheath, and mediates resistance by deploying metabolic re-programming during BPH feeding.The results indicate that wax biosynthesis, sterol biosynthetic pathway and phytol  play vital roles in rice response to BPH infestation. This finding demonstrated that the combination of lipidomics and quantitative real-time PCR is an effective approach to elucidating the interactions between brown planthopper and rice mediated by resistance genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218046>The gut microbiota promotes hepatic fatty acid desaturation and elongation in mice.</a></h2><p>Interactions between the gut microbial ecosystem and host  homeostasis are highly relevant to host physiology and metabolic diseases. We present a comprehensive multi-omics view of the effect of intestinal microbial colonization on hepatic , integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and lipidomic analyses of liver and plasma samples from germfree and specific pathogen-free mice. Microbes induce monounsaturated fatty acid generation by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and polyunsaturated fatty acid elongation by fatty acid elongase 5, leading to significant alterations in glycerophospholipid acyl-chain profiles. A composite classification score calculated from the observed alterations in fatty acid profiles in germfree mice clearly differentiates antibiotic-treated mice from untreated controls with high sensitivity.

Both flutolanil and its metabolites contain the 2-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid (2-TFMBA) moiety. In this method, flutolanil and its metabolites are converted to 2-TFMBA by hydrolysis. The method involves direct hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide at 200°C, acidification, partitioning into a mixture of ethyl -n-hexane (1:9, v/v), clean-up using a strong anion exchange cartridge (InertSep SAX), and then quantification using LC-MS/MS. The optimal conditions for the complete hydrolysis of flutolanil to 2-TFMBA are an incubation time of 6 h and a temperature of 200°C. The developed method was evaluated using seven types of food: bovine samples of muscle, , liver and milk, as well as egg, eel, and freshwater clam. Samples were spiked both at 0.01 mg/kg and at the Japanese maximum residue limit (MRL) established for each food type. The validation results show excellent recoveries (88-107%) and precision (< 10%) for flutolanil and M-4. The limit of quantification (S/N ≥ 10) of the developed method is 0.01 mg/kg. The developed method is applicable to the definition of residual flutolanil for animal-based food commodities and MRLs established by the Codex Alimentarius, and will be useful for the regulatory monitoring of residual flutolanil and its metabolites in food products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030922>Potential roles of nitrate and live yeast culture in suppressing methane emission and influencing ruminal fermentation, digestibility, and milk production in lactating Jersey cows.</a></h2><p>Concern over the carbon footprint of the dairy industry has led to various dietary approaches to mitigate enteric CH production. One approach is feeding the electron acceptor NO, thus outcompeting methanogens for aqueous H. We hypothesized that a live yeast culture (LYC; Saccharomyces cerevisiae from Yea-Sacc 1026, Alltech Inc., Nicholasville, KY) would stimulate the complete reduction of NO to NH by selenomonads, thus decreasing the quantity of CH emissions per unit of energy-corrected milk production while decreasing blood methemoglobin concentration resulting from the absorbed intermediate, NO. Twelve lactating Jersey cows (8 multiparous and noncannulated; 4 primiparous and ruminally cannulated) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cattle were fed diets containing 1.5% NO (from calcium ammonium nitrate) or an isonitrogenous control diet (containing additional urea) and given a top-dress of ground corn without or with LYC, with the fourth week used for data collection. Noncannulated cows were spot measured for CH emission by mouth using GreenFeed (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). The main effect of NO decreased CH by 17% but decreased dry matter intake by 10% (from 19.8 to 17.8 kg/d) such that CH:dry matter intake numerically decreased by 8% and CH:milk net energy for lactation production was unaffected by treatment. Milk and milk  production were not affected, but NO decreased milk protein from 758 to 689 g/d. Ruminal pH decreased more sharply after feeding for cows fed diets without NO. :propionate was greater for cows fed NO, particularly when combined with LYC (interaction effect). Blood methemoglobin was higher for cattle fed NO than for those fed the control diet but was low for both treatments (1.5 vs. 0.5%, respectively; only one measurement exceeded 5%), indicating minimal risk for NO accumulation at our feeding level of NO. Although neither apparent organic matter nor neutral detergent fiber digestibilities were affected, apparent N digestibility had an interaction for NO × LYC such that apparent N digestibility was numerically lowest for diets containing both NO and LYC compared with the other 3 diets. Under the conditions of this study, NO mitigated ruminal methanogenesis but also depressed dry matter intake and milk protein yield. Based on the fact that few interactions were detected, LYC had a minimal role in attenuating negative cow responses to NO supplementation.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The antioxidant properties of the coatings were investigated by Vapour Phase-DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay. The CA coatings containing CL or EU showed 43-92% and 43-94% inhibition against DPPH free radicals through the vapour phase, respectively, whereas AC/S/CL and AC/S/EU coatings resulted in DPPH inhibition of 21-65% and 25-84%, respectively. AC/S/EU and CA/EU coatings on OPP containing from 0.32 ± 0.03 to 6.40 ± 0.14 g/m of EU were used to prepare packaging for fresh beef (Longissimus thoracis). After 14 days, the  oxidation in beef steaks kept in control and antioxidant packages was 3.33 and 1.00-1.22 mg of malondialdehyde per kilogram of meat, respectively. Moreover, red colour of beef in antioxidant packages was retained.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its source is unclear. Here, we report that pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis and key node in central carbon , quantitatively generates  in mammals. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced in the context of nutritional excess, such as during hyperactive glucose . Conversion of pyruvate to  occurs through two mechanisms: (1) coupling to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (2) neomorphic enzyme activity from keto acid dehydrogenases that enable function as pyruvate decarboxylases. Further, we demonstrate that de novo  production sustains Ac-CoA pools and cell proliferation in limited metabolic environments, such as during mitochondrial dysfunction or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) deficiency. By virtue of de novo  production being coupled to mitochondrial , there are numerous possible regulatory mechanisms and links to pathophysiology.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Renal biopsy is the gold standard for classification of nephritis, but because of its impracticality, new approaches for improving patient prognostication and monitoring treatment efficacy are needed. We aimed to evaluate the potential of metabolic profiling in identifying biomarkers to distinguish disease and monitor treatment efficacy in patients with LN. Serum samples from patients with LN ( n = 18) were profiled on NMR-based metabolomics platforms at diagnosis and after 6 months of treatment. LN patients had a different metabolomic fingerprint as compared with healthy controls, with increased lipoproteins and lipids and reduced  and amino acids. Using multivariate statistical analysis, we found that the metabolic changes observed in naïve LN patients at diagnosis displayed a variation in the opposite direction upon responding to treatment. Increased levels of  metabolites including low- and very-low-density lipoproteins (LDL/VLDL) in LN patients significantly decreased after 6 months of treatment, whereas the serum levels of  increased. These levels correlated significantly with SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI 2K), renal SLEDAI, and serum C3 and C4 levels. The result presented in this pilot longitudinal study revealed the reprogramming of metabolome in LN patients on immunosuppressive therapy using NMR-based metabolomics, and thus this approach may be used to monitor the response to treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502333>Changes in physicochemical properties of kidney cells membrane as a consequence of hypertension and treatment of hypertensive rats with FAAH inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is a civilization disease leading to remodeling and damage of blood vessels, impaired renal function and premature death. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of chronic administration of URB597, the FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase) inhibitor, to rats with primary (SHRs) and secondary (DOCA-salt hypertensive rats) hypertension on electrical and physicochemical properties of kidney cells membranes. Changes in the electrical charge of the membrane may affect the cell functions. The electrical properties of the kidney cells (surface charge density, zeta potential) were measured by electrophoresis. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the membrane (phospholipids and proteins) was determined by HPLC and  peroxidation product (4-hydroxy-2E-hexenal; 4-HHE) level was examined by GCMSMS, while the sialic acid content was measured by resorcinol method. In rats with primary hypertension (SHR) and secondary hypertension (DOCA-salt), changes in electrical properties (increase of electric charge and zeta potential) and membrane composition (increase in sialic acid and protein concentration and decrease in phospholipid level) of kidney cells are observed in comparison to control animals. Greater changes were observed in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Changes in membrane properties caused by URB597 depend on the type of hypertension. The administration of URB597 to rats with primary hypertension partially prevents changes in the electrical properties (electrical charge, zeta potential) of the membrane caused by hypertension as well as in the sialic acid and proteins content. However, there is no reduction in oxidative stress, assessed by the level of 4-HHE, which may affect the metabolic function of the kidneys. URB597 administered to rats with DOCA salt does not prevent, but rather intensifies, changes caused by hypertension in the kidney. In conclusion, URB597 given to individuals with hypertension, particularly with secondary hypertension, enhancing some disturbances in electric and physicochemical properties of kidney cells observed in hypertension what may lead to additional kidney disorders. Therefore, further researches are necessary.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The rats in the control group received subcutaneous injection of 0.9% normal saline (5 mg•mg•d for 7 days), and those in the model and EA groups received subcutaneous injection of isopropylarterenol hydrochloride (5 mg•mg•d for 7 days) to establish CMI model. EA (2 Hz/100 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Zusanli" (ST 36), "Guanyuan" (CV 4) and "Neiguan" (PC 6) for 10 min, once daily for 21 days. The ECG-ST segment of the standard limb lead II was used for evaluating the severity of myocardial ischemia, and the histopathological changes of myocardium were observed under microscope after H．E. staining. The profile of serum metabolites was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance mass spectrometry combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) in 21 rats (＝7 in each group)．.After modeling, the amplitude of ECG-ST was significantly increased in comparison with the normal control group (<0.01), suggesting a successful establishment of CMI model. H．E. stain showed an apparent injury of the myocardial tissue as interstitial edema, vasodilatation and hemorrhage, infiltration of inflammatory cells, unclear veins, and increased intercellular space, etc. with irregularly arranged myocardial cells being dissolved, ruptured and necrotic, and with obvious edema, blurred shape, uneven staining, karyopyknosis, and glass-like lesions. After EA intervention, the amplitude of ECG-ST in the EA group was evidently lower than that of the model group (<0.01), and the severity of the myocardial injury was relatively milder relevant to the model group, suggesting an alleviation of the injured myocardium. In the PLS-DA score plot, the normal control group and the EA group outline were close to each other, and Glucose, Lactate, Creatine, , 3-Hydroybutyrate might be the potential metabolic differential biomarkers (VIP > 1). The PLS-DA analysis revealed deviations in 51 differential biomarkers in serum，among which, Glucose, Lactate, Creatine,  and 3-Hydroybutyrate may contribute to the effect of EA in improving CMI.EA stimulation of acupoints can ameliorate ischemic myocardial injury in CMI rats, which may be related to its effect in regulating serum sugar,  and energy .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31010992>The enhancing effect of Acanthopanax sessiliflorus fruit extract on the antibacterial activity of porcine alveolar 3D4/31 macrophages via NF-κB1 and  regulation.</a></h2><p>The demand for measures to improve disease resistance and productivity of livestock are increasing, as most countries prohibit the addition of antibiotics to feed. This study therefore aimed to uncover functional feed additives to help enhance livestock immunity and disease resistance, using Acanthopanax sessiliflorus fruit extract (ASF).ASF was extracted with 70% EtOH, and total polyphenolic and catechin contents were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu and vanillin assay, respectively. The 3D4/31 porcine macrophage cells (MΦ) were activated by Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- (PMA), and cell survival and growth rate were measured with or without ASF treatment. Flow-cytometric analysis determined the lysosomal activity, reactive oxygen species levels (ROS), and cell cycle distribution. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein expression levels were quantified by western blotting and densitometry analysis. Quantitative PCR was applied to measure the -related genes expression level. Lastly, the antibacterial activity of 3D4/31 MΦ cells was evaluated by the colony forming unit assay.ASF upregulated the cell viability and growth rate of 3D4/31 MΦ, with or without PMA activation. Moreover, lysosomal activity and intracellular ROS levels were increased after ASF exposure. In addition, the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 expression levels were proportionately increased with ROS levels. Both ASF and PMA treatment resulted in upregulation of NF-κB protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α mRNA expression levels,  synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation . Interestingly, co-treatment of ASF with PMA resulted in recovery of NF-κB, TNFα, and  levels. Finally, ASF pretreatment enhanced the in vitro bactericidal activity of 3D4/31 MΦ against Escherichia coli.s: This study provides a novel insight into the regulation of NF-κB activity and  in MΦ, and we anticipate that ASF has the potential to be effective as a feed additive to enhance livestock immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30515277>Red pepper seed water extract inhibits preadipocyte differentiation and induces mature adipocyte apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Reducing the number of adipocytes by inducing apoptosis of mature adipocytes as well as suppressing differentiation of preadipocytes plays an important role in preventing obesity. This study examines the anti-adipogenic and pro-apoptotic effect of red pepper seed water extract (RPS) prepared at 4℃ (RPS4) in 3T3-L1 cells.Effect of RPS4 or its fractions on  accumulation was determined in 3T3-L1 cells using oil red O (ORO) staining. The expressions of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adipogenic associated proteins [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins α (C/EBP α), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)] were measured in 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4. Apoptosis and the expression of Akt and Bcl-2 family proteins [B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), Bcl-2 like protein 4 (Bax), Bal-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak)] were measured in mature 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4.Treatment of RPS4 (0-75 µg/mL) or its fractions (0-50 µg/mL) for 24 h did not have an apparent cytotoxicity on pre and mature 3T3-L1 cells. RPS4 significantly suppressed differentiation and cellular  accumulation by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and reducing the expression of PPAR-γ, C/EBP α, SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC. In addition, all fractions except ethyl  fraction significantly suppressed cellular  accumulation. RPS4 induced the apoptosis of mature adipocytes by hypophosphorylating Akt, increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bak, Bax, and Bad, and reducing the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and p-Bad.These finding suggest that RPS4 can reduce the numbers as well as the size of adipocytes and might useful for preventing and treating obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408964>Complex formation equilibria between cholesterol and diosgenin analogues in monolayers determined by the Langmuir method.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between diosgenin analogues [DioA: diosgenin  (DAc) and (25)-5α,6β-dihydroxyspirostan-3β-ol  (DSol)] and cholesterol (Ch) monolayers at the air/water interface.

Therefore, we propose a method that requires fewer sample preparation steps, which can be used for the quantitation of several polyunsaturated fatty acids in human plasma. The method offers rapid, accurate, sensitive, and simultaneous quantification of omega 3 (α-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) and omega 6 fatty acids (arachidonic and linoleic acids) using high-performance LC-MS/MS. The selected fatty acids were analysed in  extracts from both free and total forms. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed phase C18 column with isocratic flow using ammonium  for improving negative electrospray ionization (ESI) response. Mass detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, and deuterated internal standards were used for each target compound. The limits of quantification were situated in the low nanomolar range, excepting linoleic acid, for which the limit was in the high nanomolar range. The method was validated according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, and offers a fast, sensitive, and reliable quantification of selected omega 3 and 6 fatty acids in human plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295470>Ocimum kilimandscharicum L. restores ovarian functions in letrozole - induced Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in rats: Comparison with metformin.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common causes of female infertility, affecting 5-10% of the population. Women with PCOS manifest hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, low-grade systemic inflammation, and polycystic ovaries. Unfortunately, current available medications are only symptomatic without relevant reported treatment. Therefore, a pressing need for alternative safe approaches is necessitated. To this end, the present study is designed to investigate therapeutic merits of the edible plant: Ocimum kilimandscharicum (Ok), in a letrozole PCOS rat model, and compare it to metformin.PCOS rats were treated with Ok total extract and its different fractions at 100 mg/kg orally for 10 consecutive days. Moreover, phytochemical characterization was applied using HPLC/PDA/ESI-MS to identify different secondary metabolites in the bioactive fractions.Results revealed that the total extract (Ok) and ethyl  (EA) fraction improved insulin sensitivity and restored normal hormonal and lipid profiles as well as normal morphological structure of the reproductive system. Furthermore, elevation of SOD and reduction of VEGF levels in comparison with metformin were recorded.These results suggest that Ok extract and EA fraction halt letrozole-induced reproductive dysfunctions and restore normal morphological and physiological functions in PCOS rats, even superior to metformin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report that T2, administered for 1 week to hypothyroid rats, increases total fatty acid synthesis from  in isolated hepatocytes. Studies carried out on liver subcellular fractions demonstrated that T2 not only increases the activity and the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase but also of other proteins linked to DNL such as the mitochondrial citrate carrier and the cytosolic ATP citrate lyase. Parallelly, T2 stimulates the activities of enzymes supplying cytosolic NADPH needed for the reductive steps of DNL. With respect to both euthyroid and hypothyroid rats, T2 administration decreases the hepatic mRNA level of SREBP-1, a transcription factor which represents a master regulator of DNL. However, when compared to hypothyroid rats T2 significantly increases, without bringing to the euthyroid value, the content of both mature (nSREBP-1), and precursor (pSREBP-1) forms of the SREBP-1 protein as well as their ratio. Moreover, T2 administration strongly augmented the nuclear content of ChREBP, another crucial transcription factor involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes. Based on these results, we can conclude that in the liver of hypothyroid rats the transcriptional activation by T2 of DNL genes could depend, at least in part, on SREBP-1- and ChREBP-dependent mechanisms.© 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679516>STC1 and PTHrP Modify Carbohydrate and  in Liver of a Teleost Fish.</a></h2><p>Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) are calciotropic hormones in vertebrates. Here, a recently hypothesized metabolic role for these hormones is tested on European sea bass treated with: (i) teleost PTHrP(1-34), (ii) PTHrP(1-34) and anti-STC1 serum (pro-PTHrP groups), (iii) a PTHrP antagonist PTHrP(7-34) or (iv) PTHrP(7-34) and STC1 (pro-STC1 groups). Livers were analysed using untargeted metabolic profiling based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) spectroscopy. Concentrations of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), alanine, glutamine and glutamate increased in pro-STC1 groups suggesting their mobilization from the muscle to the liver for degradation and gluconeogenesis from alanine and glutamine. In addition, only STC1 treatment decreased the concentrations of succinate, fumarate and , indicating slowing of the citric acid cycle. In the pro-PTHrP groups the concentrations of glucose, erythritol and lactate decreased, indicative of gluconeogenesis from lactate. Taurine, trimethylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide and carnitine changed in opposite directions in the pro-STC1 versus the pro-PTHrP groups, suggesting opposite effects, with STC1 stimulating lipogenesis and PTHrP activating lipolysis/β-oxidation of fatty acids.

The method involves sample digestion with hot sodium hydroxide, thus releasing the bound residues of various triclabendazole metabolites in bovine tissues. The target compounds are extracted from the digest mixture with ethyl , defatted by liquid-liquid partitioning using n-hexane and acetonitrile, then oxidized with hydrogen peroxide in a mixture of ethanol and acetic acid. The reaction mixture is cleaned up using a strong cation exchange cartridge (Oasis MCX) and the analytes are quantified using LC-MS/MS. The optimal conditions for the complete oxidation of triclabendazole and its metabolites to keto-triclabendazole are an incubation time of 16 h and a temperature of 90 °C. The developed method was evaluated using three bovine samples: muscle, , and liver. Samples were spiked with triclabendazole and its principal metabolites at 0.01 mg/kg and at the Japanese Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) established for each sample. The validation results show excellent recoveries (81-102%) and precision (<10%) for all target compounds. The limit of quantification (S/N ≥ 10) of the developed method is 0.01 mg/kg. These results suggest the developed method is applicable to quantifying residual triclabendazole in bovine tissues in compliance with the MRLs established by the Codex Alimentarius and EU and Japanese regulations, and thus the proposed method will be a useful tool for the regulatory monitoring of residual triclabendazole and its metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the key enzyme responsible for degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide, are postulated to possess anti-hypertensive potential. Here, we compared the effects of hypertension and chronic FAAH inhibition by URB597 on the endocannabinoid system and redox balance in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and hypertensive deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt rats. Enhanced oxidative stress and  peroxidation were found in both hypertension models. Hypertension affected cardiac and plasma endocannabinoid systems in a model-dependent manner: anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels decreased in SHR and increased in DOCA-salt. Cardiac CB receptor expression increased in both models while higher CB receptor expression was only in DOCA-salt. URB597 increased endocannabinoid levels in both models but produced the partial reduction of oxidative stress in DOCA-salt but not in SHR. Notably, URB597 decreased antioxidant defense and increased  peroxidation products in normotension.

Therefore, this study evaluated the digestibility and metabolic effects of transitioning blue-fronted amazons from a high  diet (sunflower seeds) to processed diets with three degrees of starch gelatinization (SG). The same feed formulation was processed to obtain pelletized feed (PEL) at 27.1% SG; low-cooked extruded feed (EXT ) at 81.6% SG; and high-cooked extruded feed (EXT ) at 98.5% SG. Thirty adult parrots were fed sunflower seeds for 90 days, then were distributed in a completely randomized design with 10 repetitions per treatment, and fed one of the three prepared diets for 160 days. Feed palatability, apparent digestibility, excreta concentrations of volatile fatty acids, lactate and ammonia, initial and final radiographic examinations, blood cell counts and glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and uric acid levels were evaluated. The data were analysed by an analysis of variance and compared by Tukey's test (p < 0.05). Sunflower seed was more digestible than processed feeds (p < 0.05). Diet processing interfered with  and starch digestibility (p < 0.001), being higher in the PEL than in the EXT and EXT respectively. Transitioning from sunflower seeds to balanced diets reduced serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and AST (p < 0.05) and increased red blood cell, haemoglobin, lymphocyte, monocyte and leucocyte counts (p < 0.01). Radiographs indicated a decreased hourglass (p = 0.015) and a reduced heart-liver ratio after ingesting the processed feeds (p < 0.05). Feed processing did not affect blood cell counts, serum biochemistry or radiographic examinations. In conclusion, parrots preferred the extruded diet and did not require an extensive SG to properly digest the feed.

Autologous transplantation of fecal microbiota of Ldlr mice served as control. Mice were cohoused for 8 or 13 weeks and fed chow or high- cholesterol-rich diet. Fecal samples were collected, and factors related to inflammation, , intestinal health, and atherosclerotic phenotypes were measured. Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr microbiota into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high- cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice.

Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid  and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment.3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- (PMA). D. Brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI).

However, the anti-diabetic effects and constituents of the fruit and aerial parts of this plant have not been studied extensively.The purpose of this study was to investigate the antidiabetic potential of Physalis alkekengi and identify its chemical constituents.In the present study, the in vitro glucose uptake capacity was tested using the 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG) assay in HepG2 cells. Secondly, the anti-diabetes effects of the ethyl  extracts of the aerial parts/fruit (EAP/EAF) of P. alkekengi were evaluated in high- diet-fed and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (seven groups, n = 7) daily at doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg for 28 days. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured with a glucometer and the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), glycated serum protein (GSP), and fasting insulin (FINS) were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were calculated based on FBG and FINS. Changes in blood glucose concentration were assessed after an oral glucose challenge in diabetic rats treated with EAF and EAP extracts. In all assays, rosiglitazone, a current antidiabetic drug and insulin sensitizer, was also tested. Finally, the compounds in EAP were identified by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis.EAP increased the uptake of 2-NBDG, a measure of direct glucose uptake, in HepG2 cells. Next, in diabetic rats treated with P. alkegenki extracts for 28 days, the levels of FBG, TC, TG and GSP and were lowered effectively, while FINS was increased significantly. EAP/EAF enhanced insulin sensitivity significantly as measured by ISI and HOMA-IR along with oral glucose tolerance test analysis. The EAP generally exerted the greatest effects. Lastly, a HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis identified 50 compounds, including 26 physalins, 10 flavonoids, and 9 phenolic acids, with 21 compounds found for the first time in P. alkekengi.The results support the merit of P. alkekengi as an antidiabetic herbal medicine or dietary supplement.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to investigate the potential use of this plant bark as antioxidants, and α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors. Five different extracts of  bark (TDB) consisting of the extract (TDBS) and factional extracts hexane (TDBH), ethyl  (TDBE), butanol (TDBB), and water (TDBW) were evaluated. The TDBS extract contained the highest amount of total phenolic (112.14 mg gallic acid equivalent per g dry weight), while the TDBB extract had the most effective antioxidant capacity compared to other extracts. Its IC values were 12.33, 47.87, 33.25, and 103.74 µg/mL in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (ABTS), reducing power (RP), and nitric oxide (NO) assays, respectively. Meanwhile, the  peroxidation inhibition of the four above extracts was proximate to that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as a standard antioxidant. The result of porcine pancreatic α-amylase inhibition showed that TDB extracts have promising effects which are in line with the commercial diabetic inhibitor acarbose. Interestingly, the inhibitory ability on α-glucosidase of all the extracts was higher than that of acarbose. Among the extracts, the TDBB extract expressed the strongest activity on the enzymatic reaction (IC = 18.93 µg/mL) followed by the TDBW extract (IC = 25.27 µg/mL), TDBS (IC = 28.17 µg/mL), and TDBE extract (IC = 141.37 µg/mL). The phytochemical constituents of the TDB extract were identified by gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The principal constituents included nine phenolics, eight terpenoids, two steroids, and five compounds belonging to other chemical classes, which were the first reported in this plant. Among them, the presence of α- and β-amyrins were identified by GC-MS and appeared as the most dominant constituents in TDB extracts (1.52 mg/g). The results of this study revealed that  bark possessed rich phenolics and terpenoids, which might confer on reducing risks from diabetes. A high quantity of α- and β-amyrins highlighted the potentials of anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-tumor, and hepatoprotective properties of  bark.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30904293>Invited review: Plant polyphenols and rumen microbiota responsible for fatty acid biohydrogenation, fiber digestion, and methane emission: Experimental evidence and methodological approaches.</a></h2><p>The interest of the scientific community in the effects of plant polyphenols on animal nutrition is increasing. These compounds, in fact, are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, especially in some spontaneous plants exploited as feeding resources alternative to cultivated crops and in several agro-industry by-products. Polyphenols interact with rumen microbiota, affecting carbohydrate fermentation, protein degradation, and . Some of these aspects have been largely reviewed, especially for tannins; however, less information is available about the direct effect of polyphenols on the composition of rumen microbiota. In the present paper, we review the most recent literature about the effect of plant polyphenols on rumen microbiota responsible for unsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation, fiber digestion, and methane production, taking into consideration the advances in microbiota analysis achieved in the last 10 yr. Key aspects, such as sample collection, sample storage, DNA extraction, and the main phylogenetic markers used in the reconstruction of microbial community structure, are examined. Furthermore, a summary of the new high-throughput methods based on next generation sequencing is reviewed. Several effects can be associated with dietary polyphenols. Polyphenols are able to depress or modulate the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids by a perturbation of ruminal microbiota composition. In particular, condensed tannins have an inhibitory effect on biohydrogenation, whereas hydrolyzable tannins seem to have a modulatory effect on biohydrogenation. With regard to fiber digestion, data from literature are quite consistent about a general depressive effect of polyphenols on gram-positive fibrolytic bacteria and ciliate protozoa, resulting in a reduction of volatile fatty acid production (mostly  molar production). Methane production is also usually reduced when tannins are included in the diet of ruminants, probably as a consequence of the inhibition of fiber digestion. However, some evidence suggests that hydrolyzable tannins may reduce methane emission by directly interacting with rumen microbiota without affecting fiber digestion.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Due to its high flavonoid contents, we aimed to find a new application for this plant. Preliminary tests using its ethanolic leaf extract showed that it could suppress the accumulation of lipids in adipocytes. We therefore studied the anti-adipogenic effect of several C. odorata leaf extracts and the relationship between molecular structure and bio-activity of its isolated flavonoid constituents using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes/adipocytes as a model.Three leaf extracts and thirteen flavonoids isolated from C. odorata were tested for their effect on  accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using AdipoRed reagent, with quercetin as the positive control. The effects of active flavonoids on the adipocytes were confirmed by oil red O staining and visualized under a light microscope.n-Hexane and ethyl  extracts of C. odorata leaves displayed anti-adipogenic activity. The latter extract was the more potent one, especially at 40 µg/mL. Four flavonoids, pectolinarigenin, kaempferide, 4,2'-dihydroxy-4',5',6'-trimethoxychalcone and dillenetin, exhibited significant, concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on  accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The most potent flavonoid obtained in this study was 4,2'-dihydroxy-4',5',6'-trimethoxychalcone, which caused 75% and 90% inhibition of cellular  accumulation at 30 and 50 µmol/L, respectively. Both kaempferide and 4,2'-dihydroxy-4',5',6'-trimethoxychalcone were major constituents in the ethyl  extract of this plant.C. odorata leaves contained several flavonoids with anti-adipogenic effects against  accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Camelina meal is a by-product from the biofuel industry that contains on average 38% crude protein and between 10 to 20% of residual , which limits the inclusion levels of camelina meal in dairy cow diets as the main protein supplement. Thus, we conducted a solvent extraction on ground camelina seed on a laboratory scale. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the effects of replacing canola meal (CM) with solvent-extracted camelina meal (SCAM) in lactating dairy cow diets; and (2) to determine the effects of SCAM on microbial fermentation and AA flow in a dual-flow continuous culture system. Diets were randomly assigned to 6 fermentors in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with three 10-d experimental periods consisting of 7 d for diet adaptation and 3 d for sample collection. Treatments were 0, 50, and 100% SCAM inclusion, replacing CM as the protein supplement. Diets contained 55:45 forage:concentrate, and fermentors were fed 72 g of dry matter/d equally divided in 2 feeding times. On d 8, 9, and 10 of each period, samples were collected for analyses of pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), N , NH-N digestibility, and AA flow. Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and linear and quadratic effects of SCAM inclusion were assessed. Total VFA concentration and pH were not affected by diets. Molar proportion of  decreased, whereas molar proportion of propionate increased with SCAM inclusion. Total branched-chain VFA concentration was the least in fermentors fed diet 0, and greatest in fermentors fed diet 50. Digestibility of NDF decreased in fermentors fed SCAM diets, and dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein true digestibility were similar across diets. Concentration of NH-N linearly decreased, and non-NH-N linearly increased with SCAM inclusion. Bacterial efficiency (calculated as g of bacterial N flow/kg of organic matter truly digested) tended to be greater in fermentors fed diet 100. Outflow of Arg linearly increased with SCAM inclusion, whereas overall AA flow was not affected by diet. In conclusion, replacing CM with SCAM increased propionate molar proportion and non-NH-N flow, and decreased NH-N flow and concentration, which may improve animal energy status and N utilization. Inclusion of SCAM did not change most AA flow, indicating that it can be a potential replacement for CM.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The CH is primarily produced by the rumen microbes. Although the composition of the diet and animal intake amount have the largest effect on CH production and yield (CH production/dry matter intake, DMI), the host also influences CH yield. Shorter rumen feed mean retention time (MRT) is associated with higher dry matter intake and lower CH yield, but the molecular mechanism(s) by which the host affects CH production remain unclear. We integrated rumen wall transcriptome data and CH phenotypes from two independent experiments conducted with sheep in Australia (AUS,  = 62) and New Zealand (NZ,  = 24). The inclusion of the AUS data validated the previously identified clusters and gene sets representing rumen epithelial, metabolic and muscular functions. In addition, the expression of the cell cycle genes as a group was consistently positively correlated with  and butyrate concentrations ( < 0.05, based on AUS and NZ data together). The expression of a group of metabolic genes showed positive correlations in both AUS and NZ datasets with CH production ( < 0.05) and yield ( < 0.01). These genes encode key enzymes in the ketone body synthesis pathway and included members of the poorly characterized aldo-keto reductase 1C () family. Several  family genes appear to have ruminant specific evolution patterns, supporting their specialized roles in the ruminants. Combining differential gene expression in the rumen wall muscle of the shortest and longest MRT AUS animals (no data available for the NZ animals) with correlation and network analysis, we identified a set of rumen muscle genes involved in cell junctions as potential regulators of MRT, presumably by influencing contraction rates of the smooth muscle component of the rumen wall. Higher rumen expression of these genes, including  (synaptopodin,  < 0.01) and  (nexilin,  < 0.05), was associated with lower CH yield in both AUS and NZ datasets. Unlike the metabolic genes, the variations in the expression of which may reflect the availability of rumen metabolites, the muscle genes are currently our best candidates for causal genes that influence CH yield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160120>  in Physiology, Cancer, and Beyond.</a></h2><p> and the related  of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) confer numerous  functions, including energy production, lipid synthesis, and protein acetylation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate protective effect of  against ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in Wistar rat. Animals were divided into 9 groups as follows: control (normal saline), ethanol (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), ethanol with 3 doses (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg) of ethyl  flower and leaf extracts, and positive control (vitamin E 80 mg/kg). Animals were gavaged 30 min before ethanol injection for 28 days. Then, animals were killed and the livers were separated. Oxidative stress parameters, including reactive oxygen species,  peroxidation, and protein carbonyl as well as glutathione content, were evaluated. Also, histopathological examination was performed and assessment of blood alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total antioxidant capacity were evaluated. Ethanol significantly increased oxidative stress markers in liver. Interestingly, administration of both extracts significantly decreased oxidative stress markers in liver tissue and biochemical parameters in the plasma.

Fifty-six Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were adapted during a 28-d control period to a basal total mixed ration consisting of 34% grass silage, 33% corn silage, 5% grass hay, and 28% concentrate on a dry matter (DM) basis. Experimental rations were fed for 28 d immediately following the control period and consisted of (1) low protein, low  (LP/LF), (2) high protein, low  (HP/LF), (3) low protein, high  (LP/HF), and (4) high protein, high  (HP/HF). To obtain the high-protein (HP) and high- (HF) diets, intake of the basal ration was restricted and supplemented isoenergetically [net energy (MJ/d) basis] with 2.0 kg/d rumen-protected protein (soybean + rapeseed, 50:50 mixture on a DM basis) and 0.68 kg/d hydrogenated palm fatty acids on a DM basis. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected on d 28 of both periods. Isoenergetic supplements (MJ/d) of protein and  independently and additively increased milk yield, PT increased protein yield, and FT increased  yield. A PT × FT interaction affected arterial concentration of all essential AA (EAA) groups, where they increased in response to PT by a greater magnitude at the LF level (on average 35%) compared with the HF level (on average 14%). Mammary gland plasma flow was unaffected by PT or FT. Supplementation with PT tended to decrease mammary clearance of total EAA and decreased group 1 AA clearance by 19%. In response to PT, mammary uptake of total EAA and group 2 AA increased 12 and 14%, respectively, with significantly higher uptake of Arg, Ile, and Leu. Energy from  had no effect on mammary clearance or uptake of any AA group. The mammary gland uptake:milk protein output ratio was not affected by FT, whereas PT increased this ratio for EAA and group 2 AA. Arterial plasma insulin concentration decreased in response to FT, in particular on the HP/HF diet, as indicated by a PT × FT interaction. Arterial concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, triacylglycerol, and long-chain fatty acids increased in response to FT, and concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and  decreased in response to FT only at the HP level. Mammary clearance and uptake of triacylglycerol and long-chain fatty acids increased in response to FT. Energy from PT and FT increased lactose yield despite no change in arterial glucose concentration or mammary glucose uptake. Mammary-sequestered glucose with PT or FT was used in the same amount for lactose synthesis, and a positive net mammary glucose balance was found across all treatments.

For the selection of transformants in N. limnetica on plates, 0.07 μg mL of zeocin or 5 μg mL of hygromycin B was proved sufficient, and the transformation efficiency was < 2 × 10 with a single pulse ranging from 2200 to 2600 V using 2-mm electroporation cuvettes. Pretreatment of N. limnetica with 10 mM lithium  and 3 mM dithiothreitol before electroporation increased transformation efficiency hundreds of times, and the highest transformation efficiency of 10-11 × 10 was obtained with an electric field strength of 12,000 V/cm. Our results help to expand the biotechnological applications of this freshwater species and provide means for successful electrotransformation of other microalgae as well. High-efficiency transformation of freshwater Nannochloropsis pretreatment of N. limnetica with 10 mM lithium  and 3 mM dithiothreitol before electroporation increased transformation efficiency hundreds of times.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29984733>Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Renoprotective Effect of Tribulus terrestris against Obesity-Related Glomerulopathy in Rats.</a></h2><p>Tribulus terrestris L. (Zygophyllaceae) (TT) is usually used as a cardiotonic, diuretic, and aphrodisiac, as well as for herbal post-stroke rehabilitation in traditional Chinese medicine. However, little is known about the renoprotective effects of TT on obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). In this study, 340 monomeric compounds were identified from TT extracts obtained with ethyl  combined with 50% methanol. In vitro, IC of TT was 912.01 mg/L, and the appropriate concentration of TT against oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) was 4 mg/L. TT significantly increased the viability (63.2%) and migration (2.33-fold increase) of HRGECs. ORG model rats were induced by a chronic high- diet (45%) for 20 weeks and were then treated with TT extract (2.8 g/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, the kidneys were removed and their differentially expressed protein profile was identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-TOF MS. Molecular categorization and functional analysis of bioinformatic annotation suggested that excessive energy , decreased response to stress and low immunity were the potential etiologies of ORG. After TT administration for 8 weeks, body weight, blood pressure, serum cystatin C and cholesterol were decreased. Additionally, TT significantly enhanced the resistance of rats to ORG, decreased energy consumption and the hemorrhagic tendency, and improved the response to acute phase reactants and immunity. In conclusion, TT may play a protective role against ORG in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426593>The Short-Chain Fatty Acid  in Body Weight Control and Insulin Sensitivity.</a></h2><p>The interplay of gut microbiota, host , and metabolic health has gained increased attention. Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate , and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular,  beneficially affects host energy and substrate  via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and  oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and  production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant SCFA  and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral  administration (vinegar intake), colonic  infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities. Notably, human data are scarce, which highlights the necessity for further human research to investigate 's role in host physiology, metabolic, and cardiovascular health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545309>Metformin regulates atrial SK2 and SK3 expression through inhibiting the PKC/ERK signaling pathway in type 2 diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Our previous study showed that metformin regulates the mRNA and protein levels of type 2 small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK2) and type 3 small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK3) in atrial tissue as well as the ion current of atrial myocytes in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the underlying signaling mechanism is unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether metformin regulates atrial SK2 and SK3 protein expression in T2DM rats though the protein kinase C (PKC)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway.A T2DM rat model was established using a high- and high-sugar diet combined with a low-dose intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The rats were randomly divided into the following five groups: the control group, the untreated T2DM group, the metformin-treated only group, the phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA; a PKC agonist administered by intraperitoneal injection) treatment group, and the recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rh-EGF; an ERK agonist administered by tail vein injection) treatment group. The activity of PKC in atrial tissues was assayed by a PKC kinase activity assay kit. The protein expression of SK2, SK3, and phosphorylated ERK (pERK) were determined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.Compared with the Control group, atrial PKC activity and pERK and SK3 protein expression were increased, while SK2 protein expression was decreased in atrial tissues of T2DM rats. Eight weeks of metformin treatment inhibited the PKC activity and pERK and SK3 expression, and elevated SK2 expression compared with the T2DM group. Compared with the metformin-treated only group, the injection of rh-EGF increased pERK and SK3 expression, and decreased SK2 expression; the injection of PMA increased PKC activity and SK3 expression, and decreased SK2 expression. In addition, the injection with PMA significantly elevated the expression of pERK.The PKC/ERK signaling pathway is involved in the downregulation of SK2 expression and the upregulation of SK3 expression in the atrium of T2DM rats. Long-term metformin treatment prevents the SK2 downregulation and the SK3 upregulation through inhibiting the PKC/ERK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931571>Disordered Metabolic Profiling in Plasma and Tissues of Mice Infected with Artemisinin-Sensitive and -Resistant Plasmodium berghei K173 Determined by H NMR Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Artemisinin resistance has inevitably emerged in several malaria-endemic areas and led to an incremental clinical failure rate for artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which is strongly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Genetically resilient malaria parasites have evolved antimalarial drug-evasion mechanisms; meanwhile, the metabolic cross-talk between the malaria parasites and the host is of significance during the invasion. The intention of this work, therefore, is to propose a feasible method to discover the systematic metabolic phenotypes of mice invaded with artemisinin-sensitive or -resistant Plasmodium berghei K173 when compared with healthy mice. Biological samples, including plasma, liver, spleen, and kidney, of mice collected after euthanasia at day 7 were subjected to H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multivariable data analysis was utilized to estimate the metabolic characteristics of these samples from uninfected and infected mice. In contrast with healthy mice, both sensitive and resistant malaria-parasite-infected models displayed distinct metabolic profiles. Parasite invasion significantly changed the glycolysis, Kreb's cycle, and amino acid  in plasma and tissues. Decreased N, N-dimethylglycine and glycine levels in plasma from the artemisinin-sensitive P. berghei-infected group and increased lactate, , and aspartate in the artemisinin-resistant P. berghei-infected group were observed, respectively. In the liver, the artemisinin-sensitive group up-regulated the glutamate level and down-regulated glutamine. Artemisinin-resistant parasite exposure decreased ethanol and allantoin levels. The levels of myo-inositol and valine in the spleen were increased due to artemisinin-sensitive P. berghei infection, together with decreased trimethylamine N-oxide, phosphocholine, β-glucose, and acetoacetic acid. In the artemisinin-resistant group, the spleen showed a remarkably increased phosphocholine content along with decreased dimethylglycine and arginine levels. In the kidney, artemisinin-sensitive P. berghei K173 caused increased lysine, glutamate, creatine, and 2-hydroxybutyrate as well as decreased ethanol. Artemisinin-resistant P. berghei led to low glycerophosphorylcholine and high , betaine, and hypoxanthine. Mutual and specific altered metabolites and, accordingly, metabolic pathways induced by the infection of artemisinin-sensitive or -resistant P. berghei were therefore screened out. This should be considered a preliminary study to establish a direct relationship with the host metabolic background and artemisinin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29735319> accumulation of Chlorella pyrenoidosa under mixotrophic cultivation using  and ammonium.</a></h2><p> and ammonium were used as organic carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, during mixotrophic cultivation of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Cell growth, content of neutral  (NL), productivity of biomass and total , and fatty acid profiles were investigated. Results showed that C. pyrenoidosa could endure high concentrations of NH-N (100-200 mg/L) and immediately entered logarithmic growth, when the culture media contained 2.0-10.0 g/L NaAc. The 2.0-10.0 g/L NaAc in the media also resulted in the NL content of 1.87-3.05 mg/10cells, much higher than 0.5 mg/10cells of the controls. The maximum productivities of biomass and total  were achieved under 50 and 10 mg/L NH-N respectively when the 2.0 g/L NaAc was dosed. The fatty acids were mainly composed of C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, and C18:1 under the mixotrophic cultivation, with the higher saturation compared to the controls.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

First-line mCRPC treatment with enzalutamide and AAP yields similar overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival in phase III trials. Thus, treatment selection relies on patient choice, cost and side effects. The aim of this randomised trial is to investigate differences in fatigue, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and metabolic side effects in men with mCRPC treated with first-line enzalutamide versus AAP.In this ongoing open-label randomised (1:1) clinical trial, enzalutamide is compared with AAP as first-line treatment for men with mCRPC. The primary endpoint is fatigue assessed with the questionnaire Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue version 4. Secondary endpoints are changes in body composition (ie,  mass, visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lean body mass assessed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), glucose  assessed with a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, serum lipids, blood pressure and HRQoL assessed with the questionnaire Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P). All study endpoints are assessed at baseline and 12-week postintervention. Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and at time of progression on allocated treatment for future investigation of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in prostate cancer treatment. The planned sample size is 170 participants. All participants are recruited from Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Denmark. Estimated last patient's last visit is February 2020.The study received project approval from the National Committee on Health Research Ethics and Danish Data Protection Agency and Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT no.: 2017-000027-99).
