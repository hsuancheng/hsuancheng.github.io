The effect of cooking oils depends on their fatty  composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of  (OA) (50.93%) and α-linolenic  (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively. After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a significantly lower body weight, fat weight, liver weight, fat ratio, food intake and energy intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive  species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index (AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28665150>Association Between Plasma N-Acylethanolamides and High Hemoglobin Concentration in Southern Peruvian Highlanders.</a></h2><p>Alarcón-Yaquetto, Dulce E., Lidia Caballero, and Gustavo F. Gonzales. Association between plasma N-acylethanolamides and high hemoglobin concentration in Southern Peruvian highlanders. High Alt Med Biol 18:322-329, 2017.-High-altitude (HA) hypoxia is a stressful condition endured by organisms through different mechanisms. Failing to adapt to chronic HA exposure leads to a disease called chronic mountain sickness (CMS) characterized by excessive erythrocytosis (hemoglobin [Hb] ≥19 g/dL for women and ≥21 g/dL for men). Genes encoding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subunits α and γ have been proposed as candidate genes for HA adaptation. N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) are endogenous fatty  substances that bind to PPAR-α and -γ. NAEs are also able to modulate the endocannabinoid system, a signaling pathway activated in physiological stressful conditions. In the frame of a metabolomic study, we measured plasma levels of four NAEs: palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), stearoyl ethanolamide (SEA), and linoleoyl ethanolamide (LEA) in natives from Puno (3830 m), a city located in the Peruvian Southern Andes, and Lima (150 m). All NAEs were significantly higher in the HA population (p < 0.001, q < 0.001). Subjects with higher NAE values were those with higher Hb concentration and lower pulse  saturation. However, there was no association between NAEs and CMS score. Our results suggest that PEA and OEA could be involved in physiological regulation following long-term HA exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29926639>[Effects of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in rats with -induced acute lung injury].</a></h2><p>To study the effects of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signal transduction pathway inhibitor SB203580 on the inflammatory reaction and lung water clearance, and to explore the role of p38MAPK in acute lung injury, to provide new way for p38MAPK inhibitor -SB203580 intervene fat embolism syndrome induced lung injury.Twenty-four adult male SD rats were randomly assigned to normal control group (OA group) (=8), -induced lung injury group (OA group, =8)and SB203580 pretreatment group (=8). OA-group was administered  (0.20 ml/kg)  right jugular vein; In SB203580-group, SB203580(5 mg/kg) was injected  jugular vein, followed 30 min before by OA infusion; At the 4 hours animals were sacrificed. Arterial blood gas, the wet/dry weight(W/D)of the right lower lung were examined, lung index(LI), pulmonary permeability index(PPI) and levels of tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF) were examined. The expressions of p38MAPK and phospho-p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK) were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemical method. Pathological changes of the lung tissue were examined with light microscrope.Compared to control group, arterial  partial pressure (PaO) and PaO/FiO were decreased in the animals of OA-group, while right lower lung wet/dry ratio, lung index, PPI, levels of TNF-α in BALF and the protein expression of p-p38MAPK were increased significantly (<0.01). The pathological changes were observed significantly in injured lung tissue. Compared to OA-group, those indexes were improved in SB203580 pretreated group.p38MAPK signal transaction path mediated inflammatory response process and played an important role in acute lung injury. SB203580 could inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines, reduce lung edema, protect lung tissue of rats from OA-induced lung injury obviously. Therefore, inhibition of p38MAPK activity provides a new way for the clinical treatment of fat embolism syndrome induced lung injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470518>Beyond the Scavenging of Reactive  Species (ROS): Direct Effect of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles in Reducing Fatty Acids Content in an In Vitro Model of Hepatocellular Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic accumulation of lipids. Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation. To address this question, in this work, we used an in vitro model of hepatocellular steatosis, exposing HepG2 cells to  and palmitic . Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with  and palmitic  increased lipogenesis and the content of different fatty acids. CeONPs reduced palmitic and stearic  and most fatty acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced fatty  content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in fatty  metabolism, thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089410>Higd1a Protects Cells from Lipotoxicity under High-Fat Exposure.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia-inducible gene domain family member 1A (Higd1a) has recently been reported to protect cells from hypoxia by helping to maintain normal mitochondrial function. The potential induction of Higd1a under high-fat exposure and whether it could protect cells from oxidative stress attracted our attention. Initially, 0.4 mM  and 0.2 mM palmitate were added to the growth media of HepG2 and LO2 cells for 72 hours. We discovered increased Higd1a expression, and knocking down Higd1a impaired mitochondrial transmembrane potential and induced cell apoptosis. We then identified that elevated reactive  species (ROS) is responsible for increased Higd1a expression. Furthermore, we found that ROS promoted Higd1a expression by upregulating HIF-1a and PGC-1a expressions, and these two proteins could exert synergistic effects in inducing Higd1a expression. Taken together, these data suggest that Higd1a plays positive roles in protecting cells from oxidative stress, and ROS could induce Higd1a expression by upregulating PGC-1a and HIF-1a expressions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26950511>Morphology and Phase Controlled Construction of Pt-Ni Nanostructures for Efficient Electrocatalysis.</a></h2><p>Highly open metallic nanoframes represent an emerging class of new nanostructures for advanced catalytic applications due to their fancy outline and largely increased accessible surface area. However, to date, the creation of bimetallic nanoframes with tunable structure remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a simple yet efficient chemical method that allows the preparation of highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nanocrystals with controllable shape and high yield. The selective use of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and control of oleylamine (OM)/ (OA) ratio are critical to the controllable creation of highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nanocrystals. While DTAC mediates the compositional anisotropic growth, the OM/OA ratio controls the shapes of the obtained highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nanocrystals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on composition segregated tetrahexahedral Pt-Ni NCs. Importantly, by simply treating the highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nanocrystals with acetic  overnight, those solid Pt-Ni nanocrystals can be readily transformed into highly open Pt-Ni nanoframes with hardly changed shape and size. The resulting highly open Pt-Ni nanoframes are high-performance electrocatalysts for both  reduction reaction and alcohol oxidations, which are far better than those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our results reported herein suggest that enhanced catalysts can be developed by engineering the structure/composition of the nanocrystals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510272>Higher lipid turnover and oxidation in cultured human myotubes from athletic versus sedentary young male subjects.</a></h2><p>In this study we compared fatty  (FA) metabolism in myotubes established from athletic and sedentary young subjects. Six healthy sedentary (maximal  uptake (VO) ≤ 46 ml/kg/min) and six healthy athletic (VO > 60 ml/kg/min) young men were included. Myoblasts were cultured and differentiated to myotubes from satellite cells isolated from biopsy of musculus vastus lateralis. FA metabolism was studied in myotubes using [C]. Lipid distribution was assessed by thin layer chromatography, and FA accumulation, lipolysis and re-esterification were measured by scintillation proximity assay. Gene and protein expressions were studied. Myotubes from athletic subjects showed lower FA accumulation, lower incorporation of FA into total lipids, triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester, higher TAG-related lipolysis and re-esterification, and higher complete oxidation and incomplete β-oxidation of FA compared to myotubes from sedentary subjects. mRNA expression of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III gene UQCRB was higher in cells from athletic compared to sedentary. Myotubes established from athletic subjects have higher lipid turnover and oxidation compared to myotubes from sedentary subjects. Our findings suggest that cultured myotubes retain some of the phenotypic traits of their donors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28317281>Comparison of dietary polyphenols for protection against molecular mechanisms underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a cell model of steatosis.</a></h2><p>Dietary polyphenols have shown promise in protecting the liver against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The relative effectiveness and mechanisms of different polyphenols however is mostly unknown.In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, we evaluated the protective effects of different classes of polyphenols and the contributing mechanisms. The treatment of the cells with  increased reactive  species (ROS) generation and expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), decreased expression of uncoupling protein 2, and decreased mitochondrial content and markers of biogenesis. The treatment with 1-10 μM polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, cyanidin, kuromanin, and berberine), as well as phenolic degradation products (caffeic , protocatechuic , and 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde), all protected by more than 50% against the  induced increase in ROS. In other mechanisms involved, the polyphenols except anthocyanins strongly prevented or reversed the effect on mitochondrial content/biogenesis, increased expression of manganese superoxide dismutase, and prevented the large increase in TNF-α expression. Most polyphenols also prevented the decrease in uncoupling protein 2. The anthocyanins were unique in decreasing ROS generation without inducing mitochondrial biogenesis or manganese superoxide dismutase expression.While different polyphenols similarly decreased cellular ROS in this model of steatosis, they differed in their ability to suppress TNF-α expression and induce mitochondrial biogenesis and content.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Different physicochemical parameters of substrates and their role in phylogenesis.]</a></h2><p>Physicochemical differences between О3 oxidation parameters for palmitic and  fatty acids (FA) during phylogenesis (evolution) are fundamental for а) production of palmitoleic monounsaturated fatty (MFA), b) formation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase as a FA transporter to mitochondria, and c) in vivo production of  MFA under humoral regulatory effect of insulin. In the strive for the best kinetic parameters of biological organisms without a possibility of modifying physicochemical and biochemical reactions in the mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondria can be provided with a substrate that increases energy production efficiency and the amount of ATP. Physicochemical parameters of  MFA has become the standard of an oxidation substrate for in vivo energy production; this MFA was synthesized in organisms for millions of years. Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological, energy and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis. This abuse is the major cause of metabolic pandemias in human population. They are: insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, obesity and nonalcoholic liver disease. The most effective measures preventing metabolic pandemias, cardiac heart disease and myocardial infarction are extremely simple. People should remain herbivorous.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254384>Excessive intake of trans fatty  accelerates atherosclerosis through promoting inflammation and oxidative stress in a mouse model of hyperlipidemia.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that trans fatty acids (TFAs) are a risk for coronary artery disease. However, the precise mechanism underlying the proatherogenic effect of TFA has not been completely elucidated. To obtain better understanding of the impact of TFA on vascular diseases, this study investigated the effect of TFA on oxidative stress using a mouse model of atherosclerosis.Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor knockout mice were fed with diet containing 0.5% cholesterol (control), 0.5% cholesterol+5% elaidic acids (Trans group), and 0.5% cholesterol+5%  acids (Cis group) for 8 weeks. Atherosclerotic lesion and oxidative stress in aortic wall were evaluated. In vitro experiments using smooth muscle cells were performed to corroborate in vivo findings.The atherosclerotic lesion area was significantly larger in Trans group than that in control or Cis group. Lipoprotein fractionation was similar among groups, while plasma oxidized LDL level and superoxide production in the vessel wall were markedly increased in Trans group. Elaidic acids were accumulated in a variety of tissues including liver and adipose tissue, which was associated with the high level of inflammatory cytokines in these tissues and plasma. Aortic wall from Trans group showed augmented expression of reactive  species and NAPDH oxidase (p22phox) in smooth muscle cells. In vitro experiments confirmed that elaidic acids upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase and inflammatory cytokines in cultured smooth muscle cells.Excessive intake of TFA contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis by evoking inflammation and oxidative stress in mice.Copyright © 2017 Japanese College of Cardiology.

Here, gold nanoparticles were synthesized by vacuum evaporation (VE) methods in ricinoleic  and , two typical unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The two solvents formed black aggregates after deposition and then shrunk and finally disappeared with the progress of time. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, nanoparticles in ricinoleic acids formed aggregates and then dispersed by time, while in  big aggregates were not observed in all timescales. From TEM images and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, the mean size of the nanoparticles was about 4 nm in both ricinoleic and  acids. UV-Vis spectra were also taken as a function of time and the results were consistent with the growth behavior presumed by TEM images. Air exposure had an influence on the behavior of the sample triggering the nanoparticle formation in both solvents. From control experiments, we discovered that  gas triggered the phenomenon and nanoparticles function as a catalyst for the oxidation of the UFAs. It stimulates the phenomenon and in ricinoleic , specifically, electrons are transferred from riconleic  to the gold nanoparticles, enhancing the surface potential of the nanoparticles and the repulsive force between their electronic double layers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496699>-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier inhibit neutrophil activities in the presence of albumin and alleviates skin inflammation.</a></h2><p>This paper reports on the incorporation of  (OA) within nanostructured lipid carriers (OA-NLC) to improve the anti-inflammatory effects in the presence of albumin.NLCs produced via hot high-shear homogenization/ultrasonication were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, and toxicity.

Increased sarcolemmal fatty  translocase (FAT/CD36) imports more fatty  into the diabetic myocardium, feeding increased fatty  oxidation and elevated lipid deposition. Unlike other metabolic modulators that target mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, we proposed that pharmacologically inhibiting fatty  uptake, as the primary step in the pathway, would provide an alternative mechanism to rebalance metabolism and prevent lipid accumulation following hypoxic stress.Hearts from type 2 diabetic and control male Wistar rats were perfused in normoxia, hypoxia and reoxygenation, with the FAT/CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) infused 4 min before hypoxia. SSO infusion into diabetic hearts decreased the fatty  oxidation rate by 29% and myocardial triglyceride concentration by 48% compared with untreated diabetic hearts, restoring fatty  metabolism to control levels following hypoxia-reoxygenation. SSO infusion increased the glycolytic rate by 46% in diabetic hearts during hypoxia, increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by 53% and decreased lactate efflux rate by 56% compared with untreated diabetic hearts during reoxygenation. In addition, SSO treatment of diabetic hearts increased intermediates within the second span of the Krebs cycle, namely fumarate, oxaloacetate, and the FAD total pool. The cardiac dysfunction in diabetic hearts following decreased  availability was prevented by SSO-infusion prior to the hypoxic stress. Infusing SSO into diabetic hearts increased rate pressure product by 60% during hypoxia and by 32% following reoxygenation, restoring function to control levels.Diabetic hearts have limited metabolic flexibility and cardiac dysfunction when stressed, which can be rapidly rectified by reducing fatty  uptake with the FAT/CD36 inhibitor, SSO. This novel therapeutic approach not only reduces fat oxidation but also lipotoxicity, by targeting the primary step in the fatty  metabolism pathway.© The Author 2017.

This work focuses on the physicochemical evaluation of faveleira oil, as well as it investigates the bioactive properties of faveleira seeds, faveleira oil and the press cake obtained during the oilseed processing. The seeds were cold pressed and the following tests were performed: physicochemical characteristics (acidity, peroxide values, moisture and volatile matter, density and viscosity) and fatty  profile of faveleira oil; total phenolic and flavonoid content of faveleira seed and press cake; antibacterial activity of seed, oil and press cake; and antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power assay, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide radical scavenging assay and  radical absorbance capacity) of seed, oil and press cake. Our work demonstrated that the faveleira seed oil has low acidity (0.78 ± 0.03% ) and peroxide value (1.13 ± 0.12 mEq/1000g), associated with the relevant concentration of linoleic  (53.56%). It was observed that important phenolics (398.89 ± 6.34 mg EAG/100 g), especially flavonoids (29.81 ± 0.71 mg RE/g) remain in the press cake, which indicates that the by-product of the faveleira oilseed production constitutes a rich residual source of bioactive compounds. No bacterial growth inhibition was detected, but all samples including faveleira seeds, press cake, oil and its fractions have potent antioxidant activities, mainly the press cake, with  radical absorbance capacity of 28.39 ± 4.36 μM TE/g.

This study compared the effects of nitro- (OLA-NO2) with those of native  (OLA) on intracellular reactive  species (ROS) generation, anti-oxidants and metabolism of triglycerides and cholesterol in J774A.1 macrophages. Upon incubating the cells with physiological concentrations of OLA-NO2 (0-1 µM) or with equivalent levels of OLA, ROS levels measured by 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, decreased dose-dependently, but the anti-oxidative effects of OLA-NO2 were significantly augmented. Copper ion addition increased ROS generation in OLA treated macrophages without affecting OLA-NO2 treated cells. These effects could be attributed to elevated glutathione levels and to increased activity and expression of paraoxonase2 that were observed in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated cells. Beneficial effects on triglyceride metabolism were noted in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated macrophages in which cellular triglycerides were reduced due to attenuated biosynthesis and accelerated hydrolysis of triglycerides. Accordingly, OLA-NO2 treated cells demonstrated down-regulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase1, the key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis, and increased expression of hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase that regulate triglyceride hydrolysis. Finally, OLA-NO2 vs OLA treatment resulted in modest but significant beneficial effects on macrophage cholesterol metabolism, reducing cholesterol biosynthesis rate and low density lipoprotein influx into the cells, while increasing high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Collectively, compared with OLA, OLA-NO2 modestly but significantly reduces macrophage oxidative status and cellular triglyceride content via modulation of cellular anti-oxidants and triglyceride metabolizing enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29723825>Rice tolerance to suboptimal low temperatures relies on the maintenance of the photosynthetic capacity.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this research was to identify differences between two contrasting rice cultivars in their response to suboptimal low temperatures stress. A transcriptomic analysis of the seedlings was performed and results were complemented with biochemical and physiological analyses. The microarray analysis showed downregulation of many genes related with PSII and particularly with the  evolving complex in the sensitive cultivar IR50. Complementary studies indicated that the PSII performance, the degree of  evolving complex coupling with the PSII core and net photosynthetic rate diminished in this cultivar in response to the stress. However, the tolerant cultivar Koshihikari was able to maintain its energy equilibrium by sustaining the photosynthetic capacity. The increase of  in Koshihikari could be related with membrane remodelling of the chloroplasts and hence contribute to tolerance.

The major bioactive ingredients include , palmitic , palmitoleic , linoleic , proline, and glutamic . Although HD is associated with immunoregulatory activities in allergic diseases, the therapeutic mechanisms of the action of HD in allergic diseases have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-asthmatic potential of HD in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of allergic asthma. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential of HD was examined to identify a plausible mechanism of action of HD in vitro. HD strongly reduced goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophil infiltration, and reactive  species (ROS), which reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammation, and the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The expression of IL-5, IL-4, eotaxin-2, lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2), and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was attenuated in the lungs. In an in vitro assay, HD exerted immunomodulatory effects through the suppression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13), IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production through downregulation of GATA-3 expression in EL-4 T cells. These findings suggest that the anti-asthmatic activity of HD may occur through the suppression of Th2 cytokines and total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production by inhibition of the GATA-3 transcription pathway. Our results suggest that HD may be a potential alternative therapy, or a novel therapeutic traditional medicine, for the treatment of allergic asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187072>Understanding the growth of the bio-struvite production Brevibacterium antiquum in sludge liquors.</a></h2><p>Biological struvite (bio-struvite) production through biomineralization has been suggested as an alternative to chemically derived struvite production to recover phosphorus from wastewater streams. In this study, statistical experimental design techniques were used to find the optimal growth rate (μ) of Brevibacterium antiquum in sludge liquors. Acetate, , NaCl, NH-N, and Ca were shown to affect the growth rate of B. antiquum. The growth rate reached 3.44 1/d when the bacteria were supplemented with 3.0% w/v NaCl and 1124 mg chemical  demand/L as acetate. However, NaCl was found to hinder the biomineralization of bio-struvite. A two-stage experiment demonstrated that bio-struvite was produced in the presence of acetate. Bio-struvite production was confirmed with X-ray spectroscopy and crystal morphology (prismatic, tabular, and twinned crystal habit) through electron microscope analysis. The bio-struvite production was estimated by measuring phosphate content of the recovered precipitates, reaching 9.6 mg P/L as bio-struvite. Overall, these results demonstrated the optimal conditions required to achieve high growth rates as well as bio-struvite production with B. antiquum.

Conversely, unsaturated fatty acids like docosahexaenoic  were proven to preserve muscle mass. However, it is not known if the most common unsaturated oleate will protect skeletal myotubes against palmitate-mediated atrophy, and its specific mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of oleate on atrophy-related factors in palmitate-conditioned myotubes. Exposure of myotubes to palmitate, but not to oleate, led to an induction of fragmented nuclei, myotube loss, atrophy, and mitochondrial superoxide in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of oleate to myotubes attenuated production of palmitate-induced mitochondrial superoxide in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment of oleate or MitoTEMPO to palmitate-conditioned myotubes led to inhibition of palmitate-induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory (TNF- and IL6), mitochondrial fission (Drp1 and Fis1), and atrophy markers (myostatin and atrogin1). In accordance with the gene expression data, our immunocytochemistry experiment demonstrated that oleate and MitoTEMPO prevented or attenuated palmitate-mediated myotube shrinkage. These results provide a mechanism indicating that oleate prevents palmitate-mediated atrophy via at least partial modulation of mitochondrial superoxide production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982401>The negative effect of lipid challenge on autophagy inhibits T cell responses.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with changes in the immune system that significantly hinder its ability to mount efficient immune responses. Previous studies have reported a dysregulation of immune responses caused by lipid challenge; however, the mechanisms underlying that dysregulation are still not completely understood. Autophagy is an essential catabolic process through which cellular components are degraded by the lysosomal machinery. In T cells, autophagy is an actively regulated process necessary to sustain homeostasis and activation. Here, we report that CD4 T cell responses are inhibited when cells are challenged with increasing concentrations of fatty acids. Furthermore, analysis of T cells from diet-induced obese mice confirms that high lipid load inhibits activation-induced responses in T cells. We have found that autophagy is inhibited in CD4 T cells exposed in vitro or in vivo to lipid stress, which causes decreased autophagosome formation and degradation. Supporting that inhibition of autophagy caused by high lipid load is a key mechanism that accounts for the effects on T cell function of lipid stress, we found that ATG7 (autophagy-related 7)-deficient T cells, unable to activate autophagy, did not show additional inhibitory effects on their responses to activation when subjected to lipid challenge. Our results indicate, thus, that increased lipid load can dysregulate autophagy and cause defective T cell responses, and suggest that inhibition of autophagy may underlie some of the characteristic obesity-associated defects in the T cell compartment.

Here, we discuss direct conjugation of mitochondrial-targeting moieties to anticancer drugs, antioxidants and sensor molecules. Among them, the most widely applied mitochondrial targeting moiety is triphenylphosphonium (TPP), which is a delocalized cationic lipid that readily accumulates and penetrates through the mitochondrial membrane due to the highly negative mitochondrial membrane potential. Other moieties, including short peptides, dequalinium, guanidine, rhodamine, and F16, are also known to be promising mitochondrial targeting agents. Direct conjugation of mitochondrial targeting moieties to anticancer drugs, antioxidants and sensors results in increased cytotoxicity, anti-oxidizing activity and sensing activity, respectively, compared with their non-targeting counterparts, especially in drug-resistant cells. Although many mitochondria-targeted anticancer drug conjugates have been investigated  and , further clinical studies are still needed. On the other hand, several mitochondria-targeting antioxidants have been analyzed in clinical phases I, II and III trials, and one conjugate has been approved for treating eye disease in Russia. There are numerous ongoing studies of mitochondria-targeted sensors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28520897>Alpha-linolenic  protects the developmental capacity of bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes matured under lipotoxic conditions in vitro.</a></h2><p>Elevated concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs), predominantly palmitic, stearic, and  acids (PSO), exert detrimental effects on oocyte developmental competence. This study examined the effects of omega-3 alpha-linolenic  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive  species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

However, the throughputs of those batch-based syntheses are typically limited to a scale of 5-25 mg Pt per batch, which is far below the amount needed for commercial evaluation. Here we report the use of droplet reactors for the continuous and scalable production of Pt-Ni octahedra with high activities toward ORR. In a typical synthesis, Pt(acac)2, Ni(acac)2, and W(CO)6 were dissolved in a mixture of oleylamine, , and benzyl ether, and then pumped into a polytetrafluoroethylene tube. When the solution entered the reaction zone at a temperature held in the range of 170-230 °C, W(CO)6 quickly decomposed to generate CO gas, naturally separating the reaction solution into discrete, uniform droplets. Each droplet then served as a reactor for the nucleation and growth of Pt-Ni octahedra whose size and composition could be controlled by changing the composition of the solvent and/or adjusting the amount of Ni(acac)2 added into the reaction solution. For a catalyst based on Pt2.4Ni octahedra of 9 nm in edge length, it showed an ORR mass activity of 2.67 A mgPt(-1) at 0.9 V, representing an 11-fold improvement over a state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.24 A mgPt(-1)).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654300>Electrophiles modulate glutathione reductase activity via alkylation and upregulation of glutathione biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Cells evolved robust homeostatic mechanisms to protect against oxidation or alkylation by electrophilic species. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular thiol, protects cellular components from oxidation and is maintained in a reduced state by glutathione reductase (GR). Nitro  (NO-OA) is an electrophilic fatty  formed under digestive and inflammatory conditions that both reacts with GSH and induces its synthesis upon activation of Nrf2 signaling. The effects of NO-OA on intracellular GSH homeostasis were evaluated. In addition to upregulation of GSH biosynthesis, we observed that NO-OA increased intracellular GSSG in an oxidative stress-independent manner. NO-OA directly inhibited GR in vitro by covalent modification of the catalytic Cys61, with k of (3.45 ± 0.04) × 10 M s, k of (4.4 ± 0.4) × 10 s, and K of (1.3 ± 0.1) × 10 M. Akin to NO-OA, the electrophilic Nrf2 activators bardoxolone-imidazole (CDDO-Im), bardoxolone-methyl (CDDO-Me) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) also upregulated GSH biosynthesis while promoting GSSG accumulation, but without directly inhibiting GR activity. In vitro assays in which GR was treated with increasing GSH concentrations and GSH depletion experiments in cells revealed that GR activity is finely regulated via product inhibition, an observation further supported by theoretical (kinetic modeling of cellular GSSG:GSH levels) approaches. Together, these results describe two independent mechanisms by which electrophiles modulate the GSH/GSSG couple, and provide a novel conceptual framework to interpret experimentally determined values of GSH and GSSG.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Most studies investigating temperature and membrane fatty acids use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae without considering other yeasts, such as Kluyveromyces marxianus, which has physiological differences and industrial advantages with respect to S. cerevisiae. One of the primary traits of K. marxianus is its thermotolerance. The effect of fatty  addition (, linoleic , linolenic  and araquidic ) on the thermotolerance of the K. marxianus strain SLP1 was evaluated. SLP1 yeast exhibited temperature tolerance of up to 50°C; at 55°C, viability was reduced significantly, probably due to an increase in the generation of reactive  chemical species. Externally added fatty acids were incorporated in the yeast membrane, increasing their proportion to approximately 70%, thereby changing membrane fluidity. SLP1 cells supplemented with polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased cell thermotolerance and increased the degree of lipoperoxidation, while arachidic  addition exhibited a tendency to increase yeast thermotolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26634892>Gastrodin Ameliorates Oxidative Stress and Proinflammatory Response in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through the AMPK/Nrf2 Pathway.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate the antioxidative, antiinflammatory and metabolism-regulating effects of gastrodin (GSTD) in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  (OA) was used to induce steatosis in HL-7702 cells; a high-fat or high-fat and high-cholesterol diet was used to induce NAFLD in mice and rats. Our results showed that GSTD significantly increased hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) but decreased reactive  species (ROS)/malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines both in vitro and in vivo. GSTD promoted the phosphorylation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) at serine (Ser) 40, stimulated its nuclear translocation and increased hepatic expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). GSTD activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), suppressed hepatic steatosis, lowered serum triglyceride (TG)/glucose and decreased body weight gain in animals with NAFLD. The stimulating effects of GSTD on the Nrf2 pathway as well as its antioxidative/antiinflammatory activities were abolished by compound C in OA-treated HL-7702 cells. In summary, our results demonstrate that GSTD activates the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway, ameliorates oxidative stress/proinflammatory response and improves lipid metabolism in NAFLD. Our findings may support the future clinical application of GSTD for the treatment of NAFLD to reduce hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and proinflammatory response.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151418>[VEGF165 transfected endothelial progenitor cells mediated by lentivirus alleviated ALI in rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effects of vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF165) transfected the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mediated by lentivirus on acute lung injury (ALI) in rats.The mononuclear cells from the male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were isolated and cultured to get the EPCs for study. The lentivirus vector carrying the human VEGF165 gene was constructed. According to the random number table method, 90 male SD rats were divided into ALI model group, phosphate buffer solution (PBS) group, EPCs treatment group, none transfected EPCs treatment group and VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment group, and the rats in each group were subdivided into 4, 12 and 48 hours subgroups, with 6 rats in each subgroup. The rat model of ALI was reproduced by intravenous injection of  (0.15 μL/g). Then each treatment group was given PBS, EPCs, none transfected EPCs and VEGF165 transfected EPCs respectively with the same volume of 0.2 mL. For the groups with cells, about 1×10 cells were contained. Abdominal aortic blood and lung tissue were harvested at 4, 12 and 48 hours. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed. The lung wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) was calculated. The expressions of induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and VEGF165 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After dyed with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), the lung tissue pathology was observed and the lung injury score was performed.Compared with the ALI model group, the arterial partial pressure of  (PaO) in EPCs, none transfected EPCs and VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment groups was significantly increased from 4 hours, and lung W/D, expressions of iNOS and ET-1 were significantly decreased, and VEGF165 expression was significantly increased. Compared with the EPCs treatment group, the increase in PaO, the decrease in lung W/D and expressions of iNOS and ET-1, and the increase in VEGF165 expression in VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment group were more significant [4 hours: PaO (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) was 82.84±10.69 vs. 72.34±9.36, lung W/D ratio was 4.83±0.23 vs. 5.55±0.37, iNOS (ng/mg) was 8.77±1.10 vs. 14.84±1.34, ET-1 (ng/mg) was 103.41±5.66 vs. 153.08±5.12, VEGF165 (ng/mg) was 130.56±12.16 vs. 83.03±5.95; 12 hours: PaO (mmHg) was 91.67±6.81 vs. 78.5±8.81, lung W/D ratio was 4.44±0.35 vs. 5.32±0.25, iNOS (ng/mg) was 7.23±0.24 vs. 14.04±1.18, ET-1 (ng/mg) was 91.98±3.52 vs. 125.99±7.55, VEGF165 (ng/mg) was 164.49±5.71 vs. 96.61±6.12]; individual parameters reached valley value or peak value at 48 hours [lung W/D ratio was 4.26±0.30 vs. 4.89±0.15, iNOS (ng/mg) was 5.79±0.85 vs. 12.72±1.10, ET-1 (ng/mg) was 74.53±7.10 vs. 108.33±5.84, VEGF165 (ng/mg) was 237.43±10.79 vs. 134.24±11.99, all P < 0.05]. Over time, lung tissue injury in each group was gradually increased, and the lung injury score was gradually increased. The lung injury score at 48 hours in the EPCs, none transfected EPCs and VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment groups were lower than that in the ALI model group. Compared with the EPCs treatment group, the VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment group had a lower score at 48 hours (8.50±1.05 vs. 10.50±1.05, P < 0.05).The transplantation of EPCs which were transfected with VEGF165 mediated by lentivirus could obviously improve the  pressure, reduce the lung water seepage, decrease the iNOS and ET-1 expressions in lung tissue, and had obvious protective effects on ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27704259>The Emulsified PFC Oxycyte Improved  Content and Lung Injury Score in a Swine Model of  Lung Injury (OALI).</a></h2><p>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) can transport 50 times more  than human plasma. Their properties may be advantageous in preservation of tissue viability in -deprived states, such as in acute lung injury. We hypothesized that an intravenous dose of the PFC emulsion Oxycyte would improve tissue oxygenation and thereby mitigate the effects of acute lung injury.Intravenous  (OA) was used to induce lung injury in anesthetized and instrumented Yorkshire swine assigned to three experimental groups: (1) PFC post-OA received Oxycyte (5 ml/kg) 45 min after -induced lung injury (OALI); (2) PFC pre-OA received Oxycyte 45 min before OALI; and (3) Controls which received equivalent dose of normal saline. Animals were observed for 3 h after OALI began, and then euthanized.The median survival times for PFC post-OA, PFC pre-OA, and control were 240, 87.5, and 240 min, respectively (p = 0.001). Mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure were both higher in the PFC post-OA (p < 0.001 for both parameters).  content was significantly different between PFC post-OA and the control (p = 0.001). Histopathological grading of lung injury indicated that edema and congestion was significantly less severe in the PFC post-OA compared to control (p = 0.001).The intravenous PFC Oxycyte improves blood  content and lung histology when used as a treatment after OALI, while Oxycyte used prior to OALI was associated with increased mortality.

Electrophilic nitrated fatty  derivatives, such as nitro- (OA-NO) are also noted to display a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects via interaction with critical signaling pathways. An alternative process in which nitrated fatty acids may extend anti-inflammatory actions is via inactivation of XOR, a process that is more effective than allo/oxypurinol-mediated inhibition.

The production of reactive species and calcium overload are the main contributors to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I / R) injury. We investigated the ability of novel dihydropyridines (DHPs) to improve the effect of protecting against the injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in cardioblasts when compared to nifedipine. Forty three DHPs were created varying the fatty chains derived from palmitic , stearic  and  acids and aromatic moiety in addition to the addition of chemical elements such as chlorine, nitrogen dioxide, furfural, hydroxyl and methoxy. Cytotoxicity and inhibition of linoleic oxidation were evaluated for all new DHPs and also for nifedipine. The alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were used as antioxidants controls. The compounds with the best antioxidant potential were used in the ischemia and reperfusion (I / R) induction test in cardioblasts (H9c2). Cardioblasts were treated 24 h after assembly of plates and submitted to the ischemia simulation (30 min), after which, normoxia and cellular nutrition conditions were reestablished, simulating reperfusion (additional 30 min). Right after, cell viability, apoptosis, necrosis, and the generation of reactive  species (ROS) were evaluated. Cell viability during I / R was not altered in cells treated with nifedipine, BHT and the new DHP composed of palmitic  with hydroxyl group in the aromatic substituent. The other new DHPs increased cell viability during I / R simulation and reduced levels of reactive species compared to the I / R group, demonstrating the antioxidant capacity of the new DHPs. Therefore, DHPS with palmitic and  acids in the C3 and C5 position with NO2 or Cl in aromatic moiety, presented the highest antioxidant potential (linoleic oxidant test). The new DHPs increased cell viability during I / R simulation and reduced levels of reactive species compared to the ischemia and reperfusion group, demonstrating the antioxidant capacity of the new DHPs. Taken together, these results indicate that those new DHPs have a greater cardioprotective antioxidant capacity to face the damages of ischemia and reperfusion.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of MG against  (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammatory damage in HepG2 cells and in a tyloxapol (Ty)-induced hyperlipidemia mouse model. Our findings indicated that MG can effectively inhibit OA-stimulated tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion, reactive  species generation, and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Further study manifested that MG significantly suppressed OA-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways and that these inflammatory responses can be negated by pretreatment with inhibitors of extracellular regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (U0126 and SP600125, respectively). In addition, MG dramatically upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) translocation and reduced sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) protein synthesis and excretion, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and AKT kinase (AKT). However, MG suspended the activation of PPARα expression and was thus blocked by pretreatment with LY294002 and compound c (specific inhibitors of AKT and AMPK). Furthermore, MG clearly alleviated serum TG and total cholesterol release; upregulated AKT, AMPK, and PPARα expression; suppressed SREBP-1c generation; and alleviated hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia in Ty-induced hyperlipidemia mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MG exerts protective effects against steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and the underlying mechanism, which may be closely associated with AKT/AMPK/PPARα activation and MAPK/NF-κB/SREBP-1c inhibition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28654229>Tung Oil Wood Finishes with Improved Weathering, Durability, and Scratch Performance by Addition of Cellulose Nanocrystals.</a></h2><p>The main aim of this study is to verify whether cellulose nanocrystal (CNCs)-reinforced tung oil (TO) composites are effective for wood finishes and offer enhanced mechanical and weathering performance owing to the high strength, stiffness, and barrier properties of CNCs. To achieve even dispersion of CNC particles in a polymeric coating film, surface hydrophobization of the CNCs was carried out by grafting poly(lactic ) oligomers and . These new TO coating formulations contain 0 (controlled sample) to 10 wt % of hydrophobized cellulose nanocrystals (hCNCs). The coating performance (degree of wrinkle, leveling, and instantaneous filling) of the hCNC-TO finishes as well as their coating properties (topography, optical properties, mechanical properties, and gas permeability) were investigated in this study. The influence of the hCNC content in the tung oil composite coatings was examined using scratch/impact resistance tests and  transmission rate (OTR) measurements. An increase in the hCNC content led to an increase in scratch/impact resistance as well as a slight decrease in the color-b change, gloss, surface roughness, and OTR value of their film coatings. The hCNC-TO composites for wood coatings presented here showed enhanced performance for utilization in wood-working processes in terms of desired mechanical properties (scratch and impact resistance), weathering performance (color stability), and easy production without any deterioration in surface gloss and roughness after the addition of hCNC to a TO matrix. The hCNC enhanced coating system is a promising candidate for substantial protection of wood surfaces in demanding settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274279>Chemiluminescence of  Capped Black Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Highly Selective Detection of Sulfite in PM.</a></h2><p>Quantum dots (QDs), especially metal-free QDs with their unique optoelectronic properties, environmental friendliness, and excellent biocompatibility, have opened a new avenue to explore novel chemiluminescence (CL) systems for analytical applications. However, the unknown CL properties, relatively weak emission, and instability of some of them in water (e.g., black phosphorus QDs) often seriously hinder their further practical applications. Chemical modification trends have offered new properties for materials and have been proved to be desirable ways to establish sensing platforms with improved sensitivity and stability. Herein,  capped black phosphorus QDs (OA-BP QDs) with improved stability and optical properties were successfully synthesized. More importantly, an extraordinary CL emission when OA-BP QDs reacted with SO was first observed.

Lenalidomide was covalently bound to FePt-NH by pH sensitive hydrazone bonding. Hyaluronic  was conjugated to amino groups of APTES while lactoferrin (Lf) was directly conjugated to excess carboxylic group present on hyaluronic  (HA) to form surface modified pH sensitive alloy-drug nanoconjugates (SPANs). The multifunctional nanoconjugates were characterized and evaluated using extensive in vitro and in vivo techniques. The nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent heating ability on exposure to alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation. The acidic microenvironment of lysozome triggered release of LND from SPANs. Owing to leaching of Fe and Pt contents, SPANs demonstrated ability to generate reactive  species (ROS) in U87MG cell line which further enhanced therapeutic effect of SPANs. Significant difference in cell viability suppression was observed in in vitro photothermal, chemo-photothermal and chemo-magnetophotothermal killing of cancer cells using SPANs in U87MG cell lines. Significant difference in heating ability and cell cytotoxicity of SPANs in comparison to alternative magnetic field and NIR irradiation was observed for DUAL-mode exposure of SPANs. The results of cellular internalization study showed efficient internalization of SPANs inside U87MG cells. The in vivo results (both qualitative and quantitative) confirmed enhanced uptake of SPANs in brain after intranasal administration with enhanced nasal and mucus penetration owing to presence of Lf.

The rat model of ARDS was induced by intravenous injection of  (OA), and observed for 4 h. The lung injury was evaluated by arterial blood gas, lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) and histological analyses. Simultaneously, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for total and differential cell analysis and total protein determination. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) level in BALF was determined with a rat TNF-α ELISA kit. Expressions of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) in lung tissue were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. The interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 was explored by immunoprecipitation. The results showed that, compared with those in control group, total white blood cells count (WBC), polymorphonuclear percentage (PMN%), total protein concentration, TNF-α level in BALF, W/D, and the alveolar-arterial  tension difference (P(A-a)O) in OA group were significantly increased at 4 h after OA injection. Western blot and immunostaining further showed remarkably increased expressions of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL in lung tissue from OA group. Additionally, immunoprecipitation results indicated an enforced interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 in OA group. Collectively, the TNF-α level in BALF and the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling pathway in lung tissue were found to be upregulated and activated with the process of ARDS. These findings implicate that RIPK1/RIPK3-mediated necroptosis plays a possible role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which may provide a new idea to develop novel drugs for the therapy of ARDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26845454>Interactive effects of hypoxia, carbon monoxide and acute lung injury on  transport and aerobic capacity.</a></h2><p>This study determined how breathing hypoxic gas, reducing circulatory capacitance for O2 by breathing CO, and impairing pulmonary gas exchange by acutely injuring the lungs interact to limit cardiopulmonary O2 delivery, O2 extraction and maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max). Five goats ran on a treadmill at VO2max following  induced acute lung injury that impaired pulmonary gas exchange, after partial recovery or with no acute lung injury. Goats breathed normoxic or hypoxic inspired gas fractions (FIO2 0.21 or 0.12) with and without small amounts of CO to maintain carboxyhemoglobin fractions (FHbCO) of 0.02 or 0.30. With the exception of elevated FHbCO with acute lung injury (P=0.08), all combinations of hypoxia, elevated FHbCO and acute lung injury attenuated the reduction in VO2max by 15-27% compared to the sum of each treatment's individual reduction in VO2max when administered separately. Simultaneous administration of two treatments attenuated the reduction in VO2max by attenuating the decrease in cardiopulmonary O2 delivery, not synergistically increasing O2 extraction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The method is based on the reduction processes occurring at a platinum microdisk electrode involving the free fatty acids present in the matrices. To overcome problems related to the low conductivity of the samples investigated, olive oils were mixed with suitable amounts of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), tri-hexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([P][NTf]), which acted as a supporting electrolyte. Conditions for a reliable quantification of the acids were preliminarily investigated by performing voltammetric and chronoamperometric measurements in RTIL solutions containing  at different concentrations.  (OA) was chosen as a model compound as it is the main component of the FFA content in olive oils. In order to establish the effect of  on the electroanalytical responses, the reduction process of OA was investigated under both deoxygenated and oxygenated conditions. It was found that, in both situations, the current arising from the electrode process of OA depended linearly on the OA concentration over a wide range varying from 0.1% to 8% OA (w/w). This range includes FFA values which can be found on all categories of commercially available oil samples, including extra-virgin, virgin and lampante oils. Voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments were also performed in oil/RTIL samples artificially acidified (extra-virgin olive oils with known addition of ) and in natural olive oils from some commercial categories. The results obtained indicated that the electrochemical procedure developed was satisfactory in terms of both sensitivity and detection limits. The reliability of the proposed approach for the detection of FFA was finally assessed by comparison of the voltammetric/chronoamperometric values with those obtained by the official method for quantification of olive oil acidity, which is an /base volumetric titration.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The cause for this cognitive impairment is still not clear. One possible mechanism could be cerebral inflammation as result of a "lung-brain-crosstalk". Even mechanical ventilation itself can induce cerebral inflammation. We hypothesized, that an acute lung injury aggravates the cerebral inflammation induced by mechanical ventilation itself and leads to neuronal damage.After approval of the institutional and state animal care committee 20 pigs were randomized to one of three groups: lung injury by central venous injection of  (n = 8), lung injury by bronchoalveolar lavage in combination with one hour of injurious ventilation (n = 8) or control (n = 6). Brain tissue of four native animals from a different study served as native group. For six hours all animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 7 ml kg-1 and a scheme for positive end-expiratory pressure and inspired  fraction, which was adapted from the ARDS network tables. Afterwards the animals were killed and the brains were harvested for histological (number of neurons and microglia) and molecular biologic (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) examinations.There was no difference in the number of neurons or microglia cells between the groups. TNFalpha was significantly higher in all groups compared to native (p < 0.05), IL-6 was only increased in the lavage group compared to native (p < 0.05), IL-1beta showed no difference between the groups.With our data we can confirm earlier results, that mechanical ventilation itself seems to trigger cerebral inflammation. This is not aggravated by acute lung injury, at least not within the first 6 hours after onset. Nevertheless, it seems too early to dismiss the idea of lung-injury induced cerebral inflammation, as 6 hours might be just not enough time to see any profound effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29550120>α-Lactalbumin- complex kills tumor cells by inducing excess energy metabolism but inhibiting mRNA expression of the related enzymes.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the anti-tumor α-lactalbumin- complex (α-LA-OA) may target the glycolysis of tumor cells. However, few data are available regarding the effects of α-LA-OA on energy metabolism. In this study, we measured glycolysis and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to α-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that α-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to α-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the glycolysis process and the tricarboxylic  cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein β subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that α-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the energy demand. Our results may help clarify the mechanism of apoptosis induced by reactive  species and mitochondrial destruction.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Herein, multifunctional NaYF4:Yb/Er@polypyrrole (PPy) core-shell nanoplates are developed by combining a thermal decomposition reaction and a chemical oxidative polymerization reaction. Within such a composite nanomaterial, the core of the NaYF4:Yb/Er nanoplate can serve as an efficient nanoprobe for upconversion luminescence (UCL)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) dual-modal imaging, the shell of the PPy shows strong near infrared (NIR) region absorption and makes it effective in photothermal ablation of cancer cells and infrared thermal imaging in vivo. Thus, this platform can be simultaneously used for cancer diagnosis and photothermal therapy, and compensates for the deficiencies of individual imaging modalities and satisfies the higher requirements on the efficiency and accuracy for diagnosis and therapy of cancer.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction may be a part of these pleiotropic effects, which are insufficiently described in the kidney. We hypothesize that simvastatin (SIM) transcriptionally activates HO-1 that protects renal proximal tubule cells from lipotoxic injury.Impact of SIM on 100 μmol/l  (OA)-mediated reactive  species (ROS) production and consequent oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) content) as well as cell injury/apoptosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, caspase-3 activation) were determined in cultured renal proximal tubule (NRK52E) cells. Effect of SIM on the HO-1 promoter and its enhancer elements (antioxidant response element (ARE), CCAAT, AP1, and cAMP response element (CRE)) was also determined in reporter luciferase assays. Dominant-negative (dnMEK, M1CREB) and pharmacologic (H89) approaches were used to inhibit activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), CREB, and protein kinase A (PKA), respectively.SIM dose-dependently activated the HO-1 promoter that was essential for protection against OA-dependent ROS production/oxidative stress and LDH release/caspase-3 activation. We found that the HO-1 promoter was induced through ERK and PKA-dependent activation of the CRE by SIM.SIM may protect the kidney from adverse effects of circulating fatty acids by upregulating the antioxidant HO-1, aside from its well-described lipid-lowering effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27479333>Liquid PEG Polymers Containing Antioxidants: A Versatile Platform for Studying -Sensitive Photochemical Processes.</a></h2><p>This article proposes the exploitation of widely available, inexpensive, innocuous "green" liquid polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers containing the  scavenger  (OA) as promising media for studying -sensitive photochemical processes. Here we report the successful application of this media to detailed investigations of triplet-sensitized photochemical upconversion, previously established as being readily poisoned by dissolved . Three different PEG materials were investigated with increasing molecular weight from 200 to 600 g/mol, coded as PEG-200, PEG-400, and PEG-600. These fluidic polymers facilitate an -depleted environment in comparison to commonly employed organic solvents while providing high solubility and diffusion for the dissolved chromophores. Moreover, the low  permeation afforded by these PEG solvents allows them to remain deoxygenated in open containers under ambient conditions for extended time periods. OA, 9,10-dimethylanthracene (DMA), and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) are shown to efficiently and quantitatively consume dissolved  in the PEG environment in the presence of the photoactivated triplet sensitizer platinum(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PtTPBP).  consumption was directly correlated with systematically increasing sensitizer excited-state lifetimes that eventually reach the same plateau as achieved through extensive N2 sparging. Diffusion-controlled bimolecular triplet-triplet energy transfer quenching between PtTPBP and the acceptor/annihilator 9,10-bisphenylethynylanthracene (BPEA) was observed in all three PEG formulations investigated. Subsequent triplet-triplet annihilation, between triplet excited BPEA acceptors, achieves bright and stable upconverted singlet fluorescence from BPEA with no decrease in intensity over 20 h under ambient conditions. In the champion composition (PEG 200), the upconversion quantum efficiency reached 31% under conditions where triplet-triplet annihilation was maximized. This is in stark contrast for the same upconverting pair measured in toluene under ambient conditions, which rapidly decomposes upon exposure to visible light. To illustrate that these PEG compositions could be translated into a suitable solid-state format, these viscous solutions were embedded in a transparent polyurethane polymer shell yielding a flexible and long-term stable upconverting cell that can be manipulated for possible real-world applications. Although the current investigation focused on photochemical upconversion, the -depleted environments developed here can be utilized to study a plethora of -intolerant photochemical reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172501>Combined Phycocyanin and Hematoporphyrin Monomethyl Ether for Breast Cancer Treatment via Photosensitizers Modified FeO Nanoparticles Inhibiting the Proliferation and Migration of MCF-7 Cells.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT), combining the laser and photosensitizers to kill tumor cells, has the potential to address many current medical requirements. In this study, magnetic FeO nanoparticles were first employed as cores and modified with  (OA) and 3-triethoxysilyl-1-propanamine. Then, the photosensitizers phycocyanin (PC) and hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME), which might be able to stimulate the cell release of reactive  species after the irradiation of a near-infrared (NIR) laser, were grafted on the surface of such nanoparticles. Our results revealed the high-efficiency inhibition of breast cancer MCF-7 cells growing upon near-infrared irradiation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it was the synergy between the natural photosensitizers PC and the synthetic photosensitizers HMME that deeply influenced such inhibition compared to the groups that used either of these medicines alone. To utilize the combination of different photosensitive agents, our study thus provides a new strategy for breast cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262144>Cellular fatty  level regulates the effect of tolylfluanid on mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin sensitivity in C2C12 skeletal myotubes.</a></h2><p>Previous research suggests that the endocrine disrupting chemical tolylfluanid (TF) may promote metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance in humans. The potential impact of TF on skeletal muscle metabolism has yet to be fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether TF can promote insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in mammalian skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 murine skeletal myotubes were exposed to 1 ppm TF for 24 h. To examine the potential effect of cellular fatty  levels on TF-dependent regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and insulin signaling, we treated skeletal myotubes with 0.25 mM or 1.0 mM  (OA) during TF exposure trials. Tolylfluanid (1-10 ppm) reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 20% in 0.25 and 1.0 mM OA treated cells. The addition of 0.25 mM OA completely inhibited the TF-dependent reduction in maximal mitochondrial  consumption rate (OCR) while 1.0 mM OA exacerbated the TF-dependent reduction in mitochondrial OCR. Exposing skeletal myotubes to 1 ppm TF promoted an 80% reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was completely inhibited by 0.25 mM OA and partially inhibited by1.0 mM OA. The addition of 0.25 mM OA promoted a TF-dependent increase in insulin-dependent P-Akt (Ser473). In contrast, the addition of 1.0 mM OA promoted a significant reduction in insulin-dependent P-Akt (Ser473). Further, the addition of 1 ppm TF significantly reduced insulin-dependent mTORC1 activity regardless of OA concentration. Finally, TF significantly reduced insulin-dependent protein synthesis in the 1 mM OA treated cells only. Our results demonstrate that the effect of 1 ppm TF on mitochondrial function and insulin-dependent protein synthesis in skeletal myotubes was largely dependent upon cellular fatty  levels.Copyright © 2018.

The obtained results indicated that sewage sludge, organic fraction of municipal waste (OFMSW) and grease trap sludge (GTS) possess complementary properties that can be combined for successful anaerobic digestion. During the co-digestion period, methane yield and VS removal were significantly higher in comparison to digestion of sewage sludge alone. Addition of GTS to digesters treating sewage sludge resulted in increased VS removal and methane yield up to 13% (from 50 to 56.4) and 52% (from 300 to 456,547m/Mg VS), respectively. While the use of OFMSW as the next co-substrate in the feedstock, can boost methane yield and VS removal up to 82% (300-547m/Mg VS) and approximately 29% (from 50% to 64.7%), respectively. Moreover, the results of the present laboratory study revealed that the addition of co-substrates to the feedstock had a significant influence on biogas composition. During the experiment methane content in biogas ranged from 67% to 69%. While, the concentration of LCFAs was increasing with the gradual increase in the share of co-substrates in the mixtures, wherein only the  was higher than some inhibition concentrations which have been reported in the literature.

In terms of biochemical compositions, free amino acids, fatty acids and organic acids analysis was performed. The free amino acids ranged from 2617.31 (PC2) to 3773.01 μg∙g(-1) dry weight (PC4).  and linoleic  were the principal fatty acids, which were significantly higher in PC4 and PC1, respectively. PC4 presented the highest amount of organic  content (4212 mg∙kg(-1)), whereas PC2 presented the lowest (2498 mg∙kg(-1)). PC2 contained higher total phenolic content and flavonoid content, whereas PC3 had the lowest amount as compared to other cultivars. The in vitro DPPH, ABTS and superoxide anion radicals scavenging activity increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PC2 showed significantly higher scavenging activities as compared to PC1, PC2 and PC4 types. In the case of AChE inhibition, PC4 showed a moderate activity (67.34% ± 1.8%). In conclusion, the current findings reveal that the studied persimmon seeds cultivars are a source of bioactive natural antioxidants and AChE inhibitors. Such natural products could be employed in pharmaceutical and food industries, whilst can also be considered for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29507591> Suppresses -Induced Lipid Accumulation through an Activation of LKB1/AMPK Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p> (ZA) has been used as folk medicines in East Asian and recently reported to have several bioactivity; however, the studies of ZA on the regulation of triacylglycerol (TG) biosynthesis have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we examined whether the methanol extract of ZA (ZA-M) could reduce - (OA-) induced intracellular lipid accumulation and confirmed its mode of action in HepG2 cells. ZA-M was shown to promote the phosphorylation of AMPK and its upstream LKB1, followed by reduction of lipogenic gene expressions. As a result, treatment of ZA-M blocked de novo TG biosynthesis and subsequently mitigated intracellular neutral lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. ZA-M also inhibited OA-induced production of reactive  species (ROS) and TNF-, suggesting that ZA-M possess the anti-inflammatory feature in fatty  over accumulated condition. Taken together, these results suggest that ZA-M attenuates OA-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation through the activation of LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251632>Role of SGK1 for fatty  uptake, cell survival and radioresistance of NCI-H460 lung cancer cells exposed to acute or chronic cycling severe hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Unsaturated fatty acids (FA) are required for cancer cell growth. In normoxia cells can generate unsaturated FA from saturated stearic and palmitic  by desaturation. However, since the desaturation step is -dependent hypoxic cancer cells display an increased dependence on the uptake of unsaturated FA. Up to now the mechanism of increased FA uptake in hypoxia is largely unknown. Here we aimed to study the role of human serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1) in the regulation of FA uptake in cancer cells exposed to acute or chronic cycling hypoxia and explore its use as target for the radiosensitization of hypoxic cancer cells.The effect of SGK1-inhibition (GSK650394) on NCI-H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to normoxia, acute or chronic cycling hypoxia was analyzed under standard and serum-deprived conditions by short-term proliferation, apoptosis and cell death assays. The impact of SGK1-inhibition on radiation sensitivity was determined by standard colony formation assays. The effect of GSK650394 on FA uptake was quantified by measuring intracellular accumulation of fluorescent FA (C1-BODIPY®-C12).Exposure to acute or chronic cycling hypoxia was associated with up-regulated expression of SGK1 in NCI-H460 cells, increased uptake of FA from the culture medium, and increased sensitivity to serum deprivation. Survival of serum-deprived hypoxic NCI-H460 cells was rescued by the addition of the unsaturated FA, , whereas the saturated FA, palmitic  was highly toxic to the hypoxic cancer cells. Interestingly, SGK1 inhibition abrogated the rescue effect of  in serum-deprived hypoxic cancer cells and this effect was associated with a reduction in FA uptake particularly in anoxia-tolerant cancer cells exposed to severe hypoxia. Finally, SKG1 inhibition decreased long-term survival and potently sensitized the parental and anoxia-tolerant NCI-H460 cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation in normoxia as well as the anoxia-tolerant cancer cells in severe hypoxia.Our data suggest that SGK1 plays a role in the regulation of FA uptake that becomes essential under conditions of acute or chronic cycling hypoxia. We assume that SGK1 may represent a promising therapeutic target for the eradication of hypoxic cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206239>Type 1 diabetes alters lipid handling and metabolism in human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</a></h2><p>Triggers of the autoimmune response that leads to type 1 diabetes (T1D) remain poorly understood. A possibility is that parallel changes in both T cells and target cells provoke autoimmune attack. We previously documented greater Ca2+ transients in fibroblasts from T1D subjects than non-T1D after exposure to fatty acids (FA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). These data indicate that metabolic and signal transduction defects present in T1D can be elicited ex vivo in isolated cells. Changes that precede T1D, including inflammation, may activate atypical responses in people that are genetically predisposed to T1D. To identify such cellular differences in T1D, we quantified a panel of metabolic responses in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) from age-matched T1D and non-T1D subjects, as models for non-immune and immune cells, respectively. Fibroblasts from T1D subjects accumulated more lipid, had higher LC-CoA levels and converted more FA to CO2, with less mitochondrial proton leak in response to oleate alone or with TNFα, using the latter as a model of inflammation. T1D-PBMCs contained and also accumulated more lipid following FA exposure. In addition, they formed more peroxidized lipid than controls following FA exposure. We conclude that both immune and non-immune cells in T1D subjects differ from controls in terms of responses to FA and TNFα. Our results suggest a differential sensitivity to inflammatory insults and FA that may precede and contribute to T1D by priming both immune cells and their targets for autoimmune reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28862046>Glucose metabolism and metabolic flexibility in cultured skeletal muscle cells is related to exercise status in young male subjects.</a></h2><p>We hypothesised that skeletal muscles of healthy young people have a large variation in oxidative capacity and fibre-type composition, and aimed therefore to investigate glucose metabolism in biopsies and myotubes isolated from musculus vastus lateralis from healthy males with varying degrees of maximal  uptake.

However, fatty acids from the microalgae are mainly unsaturated and show low stability in oxygenated environments, due to oxidation of the double bonds. The branched-chain fatty , 10-methyl stearic , is synthesized from  in certain bacteria; the fatty  is saturated, but melting point is low. Thus, it is stable in the presence of  and is highly fluid. We previously demonstrated that BfaA and BfaB in Mycobacterium chlorophenolicum are involved in the synthesis of 10-methyl stearic  from . In this study, as a consequence of the introduction of bfaA and bfaB into the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we succeeded in producing 10-methyl stearic , with yields up to 4.1% of the total fatty  content. The synthesis of 10-methyl stearic  in Synechocystis cells did not show a significant effect on photosynthetic activity, but the growth of the cells was retarded at 34 °C. We observed that the synthesis of 10-methylene stearic , a precursor of 10-methyl stearic , had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the transformants, which was mitigated under microoxic conditions. Eventually, the amount of 10-methyl stearic  present in the sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol of the transformants was remarkably higher than that in the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol. Overall, we successfully synthesized 10-methyl stearic  in the phototroph, Synechocystis, demonstrating that it is possible to synthesize unique modified fatty acids via photosynthesis that are not naturally produced in photosynthetic organisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146638>Inhibition of the antioxidant activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase from  exposed to a  antifungal fraction.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the  effect of an antifungal fraction obtained from  plant (JmAF) in the generation of reactive  species (ROS) and the activity of the catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes from , as well as their influence in the viability of the fungus spores.

Based on a combined high-resolution photoemission and soft X-ray absorption study, we report that superlubricity can be realized for engineering applications in bearing steel coated with ultra-smooth tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) under  lubrication. The results show that tribochemical reactions promoted by the oil lubrication generate strong structural changes in the carbon hybridization of the ta-C hydrogen-free carbon, with initially high sp content. Interestingly, the macroscopic superlow friction regime of moving mechanical assemblies coated with ta-C can be attributed to a few partially oxidized graphene-like sheets, with a thickness of not more than 1 nm, formed at the surface inside the wear scar. The sp planar carbon and -derived species are the hallmark of these mesoscopic surface structures created on top of colliding asperities as a result of the tribochemical reactions induced by the  lubrication.

Further, the study focuses on all possible characterization and utilization of the three layers obtained from chloroform-methanol extraction of lipids. The lipid from the chloroform layer was transesterified for Fatty  methyl esters (FAME) production. The fatty  methyl esters derived by , palmitic , linoleic  and phytol were majorly analysed by GC-MS. The methanol layer was analysed with HPLC and stachyose, maltotriose, glucose, fructose, acetic , butyric , DMSO, glycerol were identified. The cell debris was further physically activated, and physiochemical properties of raw algae, residual algae and algae bio-char were compared. Spectrum peaks of FTIR study identified many alkyl‒halide stretches. Similarly, EDX analysed the presence of carbon, nitrogen, , potassium, chlorine, calcium, iron, magnesium and phosphorus. The SEM reveals that residual algae was comparatively crystalline and hence could not be utilized directly as an adsorbent. Therefore, further physical treatment was applied, and methylene blue dye adsorption study was also conducted to know the time and capacity of biochar as an adsorbent.

We show here that Minerval also acts, selectively in cancer cell lines, as an ATP depleting uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). As a function of its exposure time, Minerval compromised the capacity of glioblastoma U87-MG cells to compensate for aberrant respiration by up-modulation of glycolysis. This effect was not exposure time-dependent in the lung carcinoma A549 cell line, which was more sensitive to Minerval. Compared with OxPhos inhibitors FCCP (uncoupler), rotenone (electron transfer inhibitor), and oligomycin (F1F0-ATPase inhibitor), Minerval action was similar only to that of FCCP. This similarity was manifested by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, facilitation of  consumption rate (OCR), restriction of mitochondrial and cellular reactive  species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, compared with other OxPhos inhibitors, Minerval uniquely induced ER stress in cancer cell lines. These new modes of action for Minerval, capitalizing on the high fatty  requirements of cancer cells, can potentially enhance its cancer-selective toxicity and improve its therapeutic capacity.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29434789>Effects of pumpless extracorporeal lung assist on hemodynamics, gas exchange and inflammatory cascade response during experimental lung injury.</a></h2><p>Pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) has been reported to efficiently remove the systemic CO production and provide mild to moderate oxygenation, thereby allowing for ventilator settings and modes prioritizing oxygenation and lung protection. However, an adequate bypass flow, the capacity to provide respiratory support and the effect on the inflammatory cascade response and tissue perfusion require further study to be determined. After induction of acute lung injury (ALI) by  injection, pECLA was implemented in 12 anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated dogs for 48 h. Improved oxygenation [partial  pressure (PaO) and  saturation (SaO) was measured by arterial blood gas analysis, and increased by 29 and 18%, respectively] and CO elimination (partial CO pressure decreased by 43.35%) were obtained after pECLA implementation. A maximum arterio-venous shunt flow of up to 25% of the foundational CO resulted in stable hemodynamics. The pECLA procedure did not elicit any further increase in the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and endothelin-1 compared with that in the group subjected to  injection only. In addition, the pECLA procedure had no effect on lactate levels and urine production. In conclusion, pECLA is an efficient and promising strategy for providing a mild to moderate oxygenation and adequate decarboxylation, while avoiding excessive inflammatory cascade response and tissue hypoperfusion in an experimental ALI model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657403>The Equilibration of PCO2 in Pigs Is Independent of Lung Injury and Hemodynamics.</a></h2><p>In mechanical ventilation, normoventilation in terms of PCO2 can be achieved by titration of the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume. Although a linear relationship has been found between changes in respiratory rate and resulting changes in end-tidal cO2 (△PetCO2) as well as between changes in respiratory rate and equilibration time (teq) for mechanically ventilated patients without lung injury, it is unclear whether a similar relationship holds for acute lung injury or altered hemodynamics.We performed a prospective randomized controlled animal study of the change in PetCO2 with changes in respiratory rate in a lung-healthy, lung-injury, lung-healthy + altered hemodynamics, and lung-injury + altered hemodynamics pig model.University research laboratory.Twenty mechanically ventilated pigs.Moderate lung injury was induced by injection of  in 10 randomly assigned pigs, and after the first round of measurements, cardiac output was increased by approximately 30% by constant administration of noradrenalin in both groups.We systematically increased and decreased changes in respiratory rate according to a set protocol: +2, -4, +6, -8, +10, -12, +14 breaths/min and awaited equilibration of Petco2. We found a linear relationship between changes in respiratory rate and △PetCO2 as well as between changes in respiratory rate and teq. A two-sample t test resulted in no significant differences between the lung injury and healthy control group before or after hemodynamic intervention. Furthermore, exponential extrapolation allowed prediction of the new PetCO2 equilibrium and teq after 5.7 ± 5.6 min.The transition between PetCO2 equilibria after changes in respiratory rate might not be dependent on moderate lung injury or cardiac output but on the metabolic production or capacity of cO2 stores. Linear relationships previously found for lung-healthy patients and early prediction of PetCO2 equilibration could therefore also be used for the titration of respiratory rate on the PetCO2 for a wider range of pathologies by the physician or an automated ventilation system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354017>Results of fibre and toner flotation depending on  dosage.</a></h2><p>The literature was reviewed with respect to deinking flotation methods with toner samples, specifically emphasizing the speciation of copy machine and laser printing, which produce an increasing quantity of paper that is difficult to recycle. Speciation here refers to the physical-chemical characteristics of the toner, which change because of the polymerization (fusion) and oxidation process, due to exposure to heat, light and  (air) during the printing process. To simulate the deinking flotation, after the ideal disintegration process, samples of toner were prepared in order to provide free toner particles. Synthetic toner has iron content and the same physical-chemical features as free disintegrated printed toner particles.We report the toner (I) and fibre (Y) recovery and the brightness (B) of laboratory filter pads formed of deinked product as deinking efficiencies. The application of  as the collector in the flotation stage gives a better flotation recovery in alkaline than in acidic conditions. The highest brightness (BF = 93.66%) and flotation recoveries (I = 90, Y = 92.82%) were achieved during testing at an  concentration of 3.38·10(-6) mol l(-1), which is the lowest dose used.

But the high concentration of GSH inside tumor cells can neutralize the generated ROS during PDT, resulting in an insufficient therapeutic effect. To address this issue, we combined ICG-loaded nanoparticles with PEITC for potent PDT. ICG encapsulated in novel hydroxyethyl starch- conjugate (HES-OA) nanoparticles (∼50 nm) exhibited excellent stability and efficient singlet  generation under laser irradiation, promoted cellular uptake, and enhanced tumor accumulation, whilst PEITC depleted intracellular GSH significantly. As a result, PDT based on ICG-loaded NPs combined with PEITC synergistically suppressed cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Potentiating ICG-loaded NPs with PEITC represents a novel and efficient strategy to enhance PDT efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28154945>Metabolomics analysis of the effect of dissolved  on spinosad production by Saccharopolyspora spinosa.</a></h2><p>Spinosad, a universal bio-pesticide, is obtained from the soil actinomycete Saccharopolyspora spinosa. Dissolved , an important contributing factor in aerobic microbial fermentation, however, is not always available in sufficient amounts. To alleviate  limitation in spinosad production, three different  vectors, namely , toluene, and n-dodecane, were added into early fermentation. Results indicated that n-dodecane was the optimal  vector. Spinosad yield was increased by 44.2% compared to that in the control group in the presence of 0.5% n-dodecane, added after 120 h of incubation. Yields of the test group reached 6.52 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW), while that of the control group was limited to 4.52 mg/g DCW. Metabolomics analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was performed to demonstrate the metabolism mechanism in the presence and absence of  vector. In total, 78 principal intracellular metabolites in S. spinosa were detected and quantified in the presence and absence of n-dodecane. Levels of some metabolites that were related to the tricarboxylic  cycle and pentose phosphate pathway varied significantly. Aspartic  and glucose-1-phosphate levels varied significantly and contributed most in the distinction of the fermentation conditions and phases.

Accordingly, organisms evaluate  availability to control lipid homeostasis. The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors regulate lipid homeostasis. In mammals, SREBP-2 controls cholesterol biosynthesis, whereas SREBP-1 controls triacylglycerol and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the SREBP-2 homolog Sre1 regulates sterol homeostasis in response to changing sterol and  levels. However, notably missing is an SREBP-1 analog that regulates triacylglycerol and glycerophospholipid homeostasis in response to low . Consistent with this, studies have shown that the Sre1 transcription factor regulates only a fraction of all genes up-regulated under low . To identify new regulators of low  adaptation, we screened the S. pombe nonessential haploid deletion collection and identified 27 gene deletions sensitive to both low  and cobalt chloride, a hypoxia mimetic. One of these genes, mga2, is a putative transcriptional activator. In the absence of mga2, fission yeast exhibited growth defects under both normoxia and low  conditions. Mga2 transcriptional targets were enriched for lipid metabolism genes, and mga2Δ cells showed disrupted triacylglycerol and glycerophospholipid homeostasis, most notably with an increase in fatty  saturation. Indeed, addition of exogenous  to mga2Δ cells rescued the observed growth defects. Together, these results establish Mga2 as a transcriptional regulator of triacylglycerol and glycerophospholipid homeostasis in S. pombe, analogous to mammalian SREBP-1.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713567>Palmitic  induces neurotoxicity and gliatoxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma and T98G human glioblastoma cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity-related central nervous system (CNS) pathologies like neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis are associated with high-fat diet (HFD) related elevation of saturated fatty acids like palmitic  (PA) in neurons and astrocytes of the brain.Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y (as a neuronal model) and human glioblastoma cells T98G (as an astrocytic model), were treated with 100-500 µM PA,  (OA) or lauric  (LA) for 24 h or 48 h, and their cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimetylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The effects of stable overexpression of γ-synuclein (γ-syn), a neuronal protein recently recognized as a novel regulator of lipid handling in adipocytes, and transient overexpression of Parkinson's disease (PD) α-synuclein [α-syn; wild-type (wt) and its pathogenic mutants A53T, A30P and E46K] in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, were also evaluated. The effects of co-treatment of PA with paraquat (PQ), a Parkinsonian pesticide, and leptin, a hormone involved in the brain-adipose axis, were also assessed. Cell death mode and cell cycle were analyzed by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Reactive  species (ROS) level was determined using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescien diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay and lipid peroxidation level was determined using thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) assay.MTT assay revealed dose- and time-dependent PA cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, but not OA and LA. The cytotoxicity was significantly lower in SH-SY5Y-γ-syn cells, while transient overexpression of wt α-syn or its PD mutants (A30P and E46K, but not A53T) modestly (but still significantly) rescued the cytotoxicity of PA in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells. Co-treatment of increasing concentrations of PQ exacerbated PA's neurotoxicity. Pre-treatment of leptin, an anti-apoptotic adipokine, did not successfully rescue SH-SY5Y cells from PA-induced cytotoxicity-suggesting a mechanism of PA-induced leptin resistance. Annexin V/PI flow cytometry analysis revealed PA-induced increase in percentages of cells in annexin V-positive/PI-negative quadrant (early apoptosis) and subG-G fraction, accompanied by a decrease in G-M phase cells. The PA-induced ROS production and lipid peroxidation was at greater extent in T98G as compared to that in SH-SY5Y.In conclusion, PA induces apoptosis by increasing oxidative stress in neurons and astrocytes. Taken together, the results suggest that HFD may cause neuronal and astrocytic damage, which indirectly proposes that CNS pathologies involving neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis could be prevented via the diet regimen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29758980>Metabolomics for the Effect of Biotin and Nicotinamide on Transition Dairy Cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate alterations in serum metabolites of transition dairy cows affected by biotin (BIO) and nicotinamide (NAM) supplementation. A total of 40 multiparous Holsteins were paired and assigned randomly within a block to one of the following four treatments: control (T), 30 mg/day BIO (T), 45 g/day NAM (T), and 30 mg/day BIO + 45 g/day NAM (T). Supplemental BIO and NAM were drenched on cows from 14 days before the expected calving date.

In comparison to T, T, T, and T had higher serum glucose concentrations, while non-esterified fatty  in T and T and triglyceride in T were lower. Adenosine 5'-triphosphate was significantly increased in T. Both T and T had higher glutathione and lower reactive  species. Moreover, T significantly increased inosine and guanosine concentrations, decreased β-alanine, etc. Certain fatty  concentrations (including linoleic , , etc.) were significantly decreased in both T and T. Some amino  derivatives (spermidine in T, putrescine and 4-hydroxyphenylethanol in T, and guanidinosuccinic  in both T and T) were affected. Correlation network analysis revealed that the metabolites altered by NAM supplementation were more complicated than those by BIO supplementation. These findings showed that both BIO and NAM supplementation enhanced amino  metabolism and NAM supplementation altered biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty  metabolism.

In this study, VHb was expressed in oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica, and its effect on lipid accumulation was analysed. During fermentation, the dissolved  (DO) concentration was controlled at 5, 10, 20 and 30 of full O saturation and also uncontrolled by varying the stirring speed and aeration rate. Yarrowia lipolytica harbouring the VHb gene (VHb strain) displayed more pseudomycelium than the control strain (VHb strain), and VHb expression also enhanced the cell density. When DO level was controlled at 30%, the biomass of VHb strains reached about 19 g l and increased by 27% compared to VHb strains. Total fatty  contents, although, were higher in VHb strains than in VHb strains under all DO levels, and maximally increased by c. 40% (from 10·5 to 14·5% of the biomass) when the DO concentration was controlled at 30%.

A potential key player in this process is the protein myoglobin (Mb). Indeed, there is a catalogue of empirical evidence supporting direct interaction of globins with fatty  metabolites; however, the binding pocket and regulation of the interaction remains to be established. In this study, we employed a computational strategy to elucidate the structural determinants of fatty acids (palmitic & ) binding to Mb. Sequence analysis and docking simulations with a horse (Equus caballus) structural Mb reference reveals a fatty -binding site in the hydrophobic cleft near the heme region in Mb. Both palmitic  and  attain a "U" shaped structure similar to their conformation in pockets of other fatty -binding proteins. Specifically, we found that the carboxyl head group of palmitic  coordinates with the amino group of Lys45, whereas the carboxyl group of  coordinates with both the amino groups of Lys45 and Lys63. The alkyl tails of both fatty acids are supported by surrounding hydrophobic residues Leu29, Leu32, Phe33, Phe43, Phe46, Val67, Val68 and Ile107. In the saturated palmitic , the hydrophobic tail moves freely and occasionally penetrates deeper inside the hydrophobic cleft, making additional contacts with Val28, Leu69, Leu72 and Ile111. Our simulations reveal a dynamic and stable binding pocket in which the  molecule and heme group in Mb are required for additional hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, these findings support a mechanism in which Mb acts as a muscle transporter for fatty  when it is in the oxygenated state and releases fatty  when Mb converts to deoxygenated state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116430>Bamboo Leaf Flavonoids Extracts Alleviate Oxidative Stress in HepG2 Cells via Naturally Modulating Reactive  Species Production and Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Defense Responses.</a></h2><p>In this study, bamboo leaf flavonoids extracts (BFE) were employed to alleviate oxidative stress induced by  in HepG2 cells. Biochemical indexes, intracellular reactive  species production, lipid droplets accumulation, antioxidant enzymes production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined to show the alleviation performance of BFE intervention (P < 0.05). Importantly, the results of qRT-PCR and western blot determination indicated that BFE intervention upregulated the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 to initiate the antioxidant defense response for counteracting oxidative stress (P < 0.05). Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential-mediated apoptosis and FOXO signaling pathway initiation caused by BFE intervention may together contribute to oxidative stress alleviation in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, these findings suggested that BFE intervention upregulated related antioxidant defense responses for preventing cells from oxidative damage.

Nanomedicines have shown significant antimicrobial potential against various drug-resistant microbes. Silver nanoparticles (AgNps) are known for their antimicrobial properties and lower host toxicity; however, for clinical applications, evaluation of their impact at cellular and molecular levels is essential. The present study aims to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AgNp-induced toxicity in a common fungal pathogen, .AgNps were synthesized by chemical reduction method and characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence, and zeta potential. The anti- activity of AgNps was assessed by broth microdilution and spot assays. Effects of AgNps on cellular and molecular targets were assessed by monitoring the intracellular reactive  species (ROS) production in the absence and presence of natural antioxidant, changes in surface morphology, cellular ultrastructure, membrane microenvironment, membrane fluidity, membrane ergosterol, and fatty acids.Spherical AgNps (10-30 nm) showed minimum inhibitory concentration (minimum concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms) at 40 μg/mL. Our results demonstrated that AgNps induced dose-dependent intracellular ROS which exerted antifungal effects; however, even scavenging ROS by antioxidant could not offer protection from AgNp mediated killing. Treatment with AgNps altered surface morphology, cellular ultrastructure, membrane microenvironment, membrane fluidity, ergosterol content, and fatty  composition, especially .To summarize, AgNps affected multiple cellular targets crucial for drug resistance and pathogenicity in the fungal cells. The study revealed new cellular targets of AgNps which include fatty acids like , vital for hyphal morphogenesis (a pathogenic trait of ). Yeast to hypha transition being pivotal for virulence and biofilm formation, targeting virulence might emerge as a new paradigm for developing nano silver-based therapy for clinical applications in fungal therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29042439>A genome-wide screen in  reveals that ubiquinone is a key antioxidant for metabolism of long-chain fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are used as a rich source of metabolic energy by several bacteria including important pathogens. Because LCFAs also induce oxidative stress, which may be detrimental to bacterial growth, it is imperative to understand the strategies employed by bacteria to counteract such stresses. Here, we performed a genetic screen in  on the LCFA, oleate, and compared our results with published genome-wide screens of multiple non-fermentable carbon sources. This large-scale analysis revealed that among components of the aerobic electron transport chain (ETC), only genes involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, an electron carrier in the ETC, are highly required for growth in LCFAs when compared with other carbon sources. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that this increased requirement of ubiquinone is to mitigate elevated levels of reactive  species generated by LCFA degradation. Intriguingly, we find that unlike other ETC components whose requirement for growth is inversely correlated with the energy yield of non-fermentable carbon sources, the requirement of ubiquinone correlates with oxidative stress. Our results therefore suggest that a mechanism in addition to the known electron carrier function of ubiquinone is required to explain its antioxidant role in LCFA metabolism. Importantly, among the various oxidative stress combat players in , ubiquinone acts as the cell's first line of defense against LCFA-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, our results emphasize that ubiquinone is a key antioxidant during LCFA metabolism and therefore provides a rationale for investigating its role in LCFA-utilizing pathogenic bacteria.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29316749>[Effects of baicalin on the changes in hemorheology of acute respiratory distress syndrome in rats].</a></h2><p> To investigate the effect of baicalin on the changes in hemorheology and its mechanism during the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) induced by  (OA) in rats.  Rats were randomized into 3 groups: control, ARDS (OA induction, 0.12 mg/kg) and ba-icalin-treated group (300 mg/kg). The blood samples were collected at 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 6 h after OA injection. The whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, Maximum erythrocyte deformability index (DImax) were detected. Meanwhile, blood gas analysis and Routine blood test were also performed.  The level of arte-rial  partial pressure and oxygenation index decreased (P<0.01 vs. control) and oxygenation index (178 mm Hg, 1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) reached the diagnostic standard of ARDS at 2 h in ARDS group. In baicalin-treated group, the level of arterial  partial pressure and oxygenation index increased versus the ARDS group. The platelet count (PLT) decreased in baicalin-treated and ARDS groups. Compared with the ARDS group, the level of PLT increased significantly in baicalin-treated group at 30min, 1, 2, and 3 h. Hematocrit (HCT) increased in baicalin-treated and ARDS groups. Compared with the ARDS group, the level of HCT de-creased significantly in baicalin-treated group at 2, 3, 6 and 12 h. Meanwhile, all the index of hemorheology improved in baicalin-treated group.

However, a high fat diet has been shown to reduce the density of L-cells in the mouse intestine and a positive correlation has been indicated between L-cell number and GLP-1 secretion. Thus, the mechanism of fatty -stimulated GLP-1 secretion, potential effects of long-term exposure to elevated levels of different fatty  species, and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we sought to determine how long-term exposure to saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids, by direct effects on GLP-1-producing cells, alter function and viability, and the underlying mechanisms.GLP-1-secreting GLUTag cells were cultured in the presence/absence of saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids (0.125 mM for 48 h, followed by analyses of viability and apoptosis, as well as involvement of fatty  oxidation, free fatty  receptors (FFAR1) and ceramide synthesis. In addition, effects on the expression of proglucagon, prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), free fatty  receptors (FFAR1, FFAR3), sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT) and subsequent secretory response were determined.Saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids exerted opposing effects on the induction of apoptosis (1.4-fold increase in DNA fragmentation by palmitate and a 0.5-fold reduction by oleate; p<0.01). Palmitate-induced apoptosis was associated with increased ceramide content and co-incubation with Fumonisin B1 abolished this lipo apoptosis. Oleate, on the other hand, reduced ceramide content, and-unlike palmitate-upregulated FFAR1 and FFAR3, evoking a 2-fold increase in FFAR1-mediated GLP-1 secretion following acute exposure to 0.125 mmol/L palmitate; (p<0.05).Saturated (16:0), but not unsaturated (18:1), fatty acids induce ceramide-mediated apoptosis of GLP-1-producing cells. Further, unsaturated fatty acids confer lipoprotection, enhancing viability and function of GLP-1-secreting cells. These data provide potential mechanistic insight contributing to reduced L-cell mass following a high fat diet and differential effects of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids on GLP-1 secretion in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268138>Dorsal recruitment with flow-controlled expiration (FLEX): an experimental study in mechanically ventilated lung-healthy and lung-injured pigs.</a></h2><p>Concepts for optimizing mechanical ventilation focus mainly on modifying the inspiratory phase. We propose flow-controlled expiration (FLEX) as an additional means for lung protective ventilation and hypothesize that it is capable of recruiting dependent areas of the lungs. This study investigates potential recruiting effects of FLEX using models of mechanically ventilated pigs before and after induction of lung injury with .Seven pigs in the supine position were ventilated with tidal volume 8 ml·kg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set to maintain partial pressure of  in arterial blood (paO) at ≥ 60 mmHg and monitored with electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Two ventilation sequences were recorded - one before and one after induction of lung injury. Each sequence comprised 2 min of conventional volume-controlled ventilation (VCV), 2 min of VCV with FLEX and 1 min again of conventional VCV. Analysis of the EIT recordings comprised global and ventral and dorsal baseline levels of impedance curves, end-expiratory no-flow periods, tidal variation in ventral and dorsal areas, and regional ventilation delay index.With FLEX, the duration of the end-expiratory zero flow intervals was significantly shortened (VCV 1.4 ± 0.3 s; FLEX 0.7 ± 0.1 s, p < 0.001), functional residual capacity was significantly elevated in both conditions of the lungs (global: healthy, increase of 87 ± 12 ml, p < 0.001; injured, increase of 115 ± 44 ml, p < 0.001; ventral: healthy, increase of 64 ± 11 ml, p < 0.001; injured, increase of 83 ± 22 ml, p < 0.001; dorsal: healthy, increase of 23 ± 5 ml, p < 0.001; injured, increase of 32 ± 26 ml, p = 0.02), and ventilation was shifted from ventral to dorsal areas (dorsal increase: healthy, 1 ± 0.5%, p < 0.01; dorsal increase: injured, 6 ± 2%, p < 0.01), compared to conventional VCV. Recruiting effects of FLEX persisted during conventional VCV following FLEX ventilation mostly in the injured but also in the healthy lungs.FLEX shifts regional ventilation towards dependent lung areas in healthy and in injured pig lungs. The recruiting capabilities of FLEX may be mainly responsible for lung-protective effects observed in an earlier study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458843>A critical role for very long-chain fatty  elongases in -mediated Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Elongases FEN1/ELO2 and SUR4/ELO3 are important enzymes involved in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) to very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The molecular mechanism of the involvement of these elongases in lipotoxicity is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of VLCFA elongases in -mediated yeast cytotoxicity. The spot test showed that yeast strains with the deletion of ELO2 or ELO3 were strikingly sensitive to , while there was no change on the growth of strain with deleted ELO1 which was involved in the elongation of C fatty  (FA) to C FA. By using GC-MS, the unsaturation index was increased in elo2△ and elo3△ mutants after treatment with  (OLA). However, the proportion of VLCFAs was increased in response to OLA in the wild-type strain. The growth inhibition of elo2△ and elo3△ could be partially rescued by two commonly used antioxidant agents N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and Ascorbic  (VC). The further study showed that exposure to excess OLA led to an increase in the levels of reactive  species (ROS) and thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS), and a decline in the quantity of reduced glutathione (GSH) in both the wild type and mutant strains. However, the antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were increased in the wild type and elo1△ strains, while they were significantly decreased in the mutants of elo2△ and elo3△ after treated with excess OLA. Thus, oxidative damage mainly contributed to the cell death induced by OLA in ole2△ and ole3△. Taken together, although disruption of ELO2 or ELO3 did not affect the cellular lipid unsaturation, they altered the distribution and propotion of cellular VLCFAs, leading to the cell membrane impairment, which augmented the ability of OLA to permeabilize the plasma membrane. The data suggest that the very long-chain fatty acids elongases ELO2 and ELO3 play important roles in lipotoxic cell death induced by OLA through maintaining a balanced FA composition in plasma membrane.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The pathogenic fungi Fusarium and Colletotrichum and their formae speciales (f. spp.) infect many types of crops with severe consequences and Fusarium oxysporum can also induce keratitis and allergic conditions in humans. These fungi code for homologues of dioxygenase-cytochrome P450 (DOX-CYP) fusion proteins of the animal heme peroxidase (cyclooxygenase) superfamily. The objective was to characterize the enzymatic activities of the DOX-CYP homologue of Colletotrichum graminicola (EFQ34869) and the DOX homologue of F. oxysporum (EGU79548). The former oxidized  and linoleic acids in analogy with 7,8-linoleate diol synthases (LDSs), but with the additional biosynthesis of 8,11-dihydroxylinoleic . The latter metabolized fatty acids to hydroperoxides with broad substrate specificity. It oxidized 20:4n-6 and 18:2n-6 to hydroperoxides with an R configuration at the (n-10) positions, and other n-6 fatty acids in the same way. [11S-(2)H]18:2n-6 was oxidized with retention and [11R-(2)H]18:2n-6 with loss of deuterium, suggesting suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and  insertion. Fatty acids of the n-3 series were oxidized less efficiently and often to hydroperoxides with an R configuration at both (n-10) and (n-7) positions. The enzyme spans 1426 amino acids with about 825 residues in the N-terminal domain with DOX homology and 600 residues at the C-terminal domain without homology to other enzymes. We conclude that fungal oxylipins can be formed by two novel subfamilies of cyclooxygenase-related DOX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544656>Anchoring PEG-oleate to cell membranes stimulates reactive  species production.</a></h2><p>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives possessing oleyl and reactive groups for conjugating functional substrates, such as proteins and quantum dots, are useful materials for cell-surface engineering and cell immobilization onto substrates. The reagent is known as a biocompatible anchor for cell membranes (BAM). Here, BAM-anchoring on cell membranes is reported to stimulate reactive  species (ROS) production in those cells. Significant increases in ROS production and release to the surrounding environment were detected in mouse fibroblast cell line 10T1/2 when soaked in a solution containing BAM conjugated with 1/10mol/mol bovine serum albumin at 1.5μM-protein. ROS production stimulation was confirmed to be independent of the protein crosslinked with BAM and of cell type. Similar stimulation was detected for BAMs conjugated with ovalbumin and casein, in human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Initially, the free radical scavenging activities of water‑soluble pigments (DMG‑Na, betalain, capsanthin and cyanidin‑3‑rutinoside) were measured and compared with those of Trolox. Subsequently, freshly collected swine blood was mixed with heparin and centrifuged to obtain erythrocytes. In order to induce the free radical chain oxidation in erythrocytes, the aqueous peroxyl radicals were generated by thermal decomposition of 2,2'‑azobis(2‑amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) in .

We verified whether this pattern is influenced by an abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT).

Myocardial lactate exchange and oleate oxidation were also measured. At Rest, DCM patients showed a reduced nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) myocardial uptake, while glucose utilization increased only in DCM-AGT. In response to Pacing, glucose uptake promptly rose in N-AGT (from 72 ± 21 to 234 ± 73 nmol/min/g, p < 0.05), did not change in DCM-AGT, and slowly increased in DCM-NGT. DCM-AGT sustained the extra workload by increasing NEFA oxidation (from 1.3 ± 0.2 to 2.9 ± 0.1 μmol/min/gO2 equivalents, p < 0.05), while DCM-NGT showed a delayed increase in glucose uptake. Substrate oxidation rates paralleled the metabolites data.

Indeed, NMR experiments have shown that the saturated fatty  (FA) palmitate (PA) can interact with myoglobin (Mb) in its ligated state (MbCO and MbCN) but does not interact with Mb in its deoxygenated state. The observation has led to the hypothesis that Mb can also serve as a fatty  transporter. The present study further investigates fatty  interaction with the physiological states of Mb using the more soluble but unsaturated fatty ,  (OA). OA binds to MbCO but does not bind to deoxy Mb. OA binding to Mb, however, does not alter its O affinity. Without any Mb, muscle has a significantly lower level of triglyceride (TG). In Mb knock-out (MbKO) mice, both heart and skeletal muscles have lower level of TG relative to the control mice. Training further decreases the relative TG in the MbKO skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, the absence of Mb and lower TG level in muscle does not impair the MbKO mouse performance as evidenced by voluntary wheel running measurements. The results support the hypothesis of a complex physiological role for Mb, especially with respect to fatty  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30114710>CD38 Deficiency Protects Heart from High Fat Diet-Induced Oxidative Stress Via Activating Sirt3/FOXO3 Pathway.</a></h2><p>Previous studies showed that CD38 deficiency protected heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice. However, the role of CD38 in HFD-induced heart injury remains unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the effects and mechanisms of CD38 deficiency on HFD-induced heart injury.The metabolites in heart from wild type (WT) and CD38 knockout (CD38-/-) mice were examined using metabolomics analysis. Cell viability, lactate hydrogenase (LDH) release, super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reactive  species (ROS) production, triglyceride concentration and gene expression were examined by biochemical analysis and QPCR.Our results revealed that CD38 deficiency significantly elevated the intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration and GSH/GSSG ratio, decreased the contents of free fatty acids and increased intracellular NAD+ level in heart from CD38-/- mice fed with HFD. In addition, in vitro knockdown of CD38 significantly attenuated OA-induced cellular injury, ROS production and lipid synthesis. Furthermore, the expression of mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3 as well as its target genes FOXO3 and SOD2 were markedly upregulated in the H9C2 cell lines after OA stimulation. In contrast, the expressions of NOX2 and NOX4 were significantly decreased in the cells after OA stimulation.Our results demonstrated that CD38 deficiency protected heart from HFD-induced oxidative stress via activating Sirt3/FOXO3-mediated anti-oxidative stress pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

Ct acquires host fatty acids (FA) to meet the metabolic and growth requirements of the organism. Lipid droplets (LDs) are storehouses of FAs in host cells and have been proposed to be a source of FAs for the parasitophorous vacuole, termed inclusion, in which Ct replicates. Previously, cells devoid of LDs were shown to produce reduced infectious progeny at 24 hr postinfection (hpi). Here, although we also found reduced progeny at 24 hpi, there were significantly more progeny at 48 hpi in the absence of LDs compared to the control wild-type (WT) cells. These findings were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy where cells without LDs were shown to have significantly more metabolically active reticulate bodies at 24 hpi and significantly more infectious but metabolically inert elementary bodies at 48 hpi than WT cells. Furthermore, by measuring basal  consumption rates (OCR) using extracellular flux analysis, Ct infected cells without LDs had higher OCRs at 24 hpi than cells with LDs, confirming ongoing metabolic activity in the absence of LDs. Although the FA  is a major source of phospholipids for Ct and stimulates LD synthesis, treatment with , but not other FAs, enhanced growth and led to an increase in basal OCR in both LD depleted and WT cells, indicating that FA transport to the inclusion is not affected by the loss of LDs. Our results show that Ct regulates inclusion metabolic activity and growth in response to host FA availability in the absence of LDs.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215805>Effect of body position on ventilation distribution during PEEP titration in a porcine model of acute lung injury using advanced respiratory monitoring and electrical impedance tomography.</a></h2><p>Lung failure after acute lung injury remains a challenge in different clinical settings.

Differences in the prone and the supine group were significant for PaCO2 at incremental PEEP 10 and 20 and at decremental PEEP 20 (20d) and 10 (10d), for PaO2/FiO2 at PEEP 10 and 10d and for alveolar dead space at PEEP 10d. Electrical impedance tomography revealed homogenous ventilation distribution in prone position during PEEP 20, 30 and 20d.Prone position leads to improved oxygenation and ventilation parameters in a lung injury model.

Cytoglobin has been shown to exert protective effects under oxidative stress conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether recombinant human cytoglobin (rhCYGB) has protective effects against atherosclerosis. We intraperitoneally injected rhCYGB (0, 4, or 7 mg/kg BW) into the atherosclerotic rats daily for 60 days. The rhCYGB injections reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in a dose-dependent manner, rhCYGB (7 mg/kg) significantly attenuated atherosclerosis. Blood proteins were separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis and analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the majority of the proteins in question were participated in oxidative stress pathways and cardiovascular diseases. Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) cells were treated with  (0.3 mmol/L), and Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells were incubated with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL; 50 µg/mL) to induce foam cell (FC) formation in vitro. Treatment with different concentrations of rhCYGB (0, 5, 10, and 15 μg/mL) significantly decreased the lipid droplet levels in HepG2 cells and cholesterol ester levels in FCs. Moreover, rhCYGB significantly increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity and decreased malondialdehyde and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity in cells. In addition, rhCYGB decreased NO and Reactive  species (ROS) levels in FCs by functioning as an NO dioxygenase enzyme and ROS scavenger.

The compound was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XPRD), and single crystal X-ray analysis. The X-ray structure revealed that the Cu(II) atom is coordinated by one  and three nitrogen atoms from two p-2yeinh ligands and one chloride anion with a CuNOCl donor set with square pyramid geometry. This arrangement produces a large quadric nuclear square ring composed of four square pyramid Cu(II) moieties linked together by two p-2yeinh units (M4L4). The adjacent frameworks connected by strong hydrogen bonding interactions of methanol molecules that interact together and with the rings and π-π interactions of adjacent aromatic rings of p-2yeinh and other weak interactions. Consequently, the labile interactions also allow the discrete structure to form a 3D metal-organic coordination network.

We previously found that β-oxidation mutants were defective in virulence and did not grow on acetate. Here, we demonstrate that acetate inhibits filamentation during mating and in response to . We therefore examined the influence of different carbon sources by comparing the transcriptomes of cells grown on acetate,  or glucose, with expression changes for the fungus during tumour formation in planta. Guided by the transcriptional profiling, we found that acetate negatively influenced resistance to stress, promoted the formation of reactive  species, triggered cell death in stationary phase and impaired virulence on maize. We also found that acetate induced mitochondrial stress by interfering with mitochondrial functions. Notably, the disruption of  perception or inhibition of the electron transport chain also influenced filamentation and mating. Finally, we made use of the connections between acetate and β-oxidation to test metabolic inhibitors for an influence on growth and virulence. These experiments identified diclofenac as a potential inhibitor of virulence. Overall, these findings support the possibility of targeting mitochondrial metabolic functions to control fungal pathogens.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545246>Partial liquid ventilation-induced mild hypothermia improves the lung function and alleviates the inflammatory response during acute respiratory distress syndrome in canines.</a></h2><p>Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is the severest form of pulmonary injury, is the leading cause of death in critical care. At present, the mortality remains high in ARDS. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) using perfluorocarbon (PFC) has been proven to improve gas exchange and respiratory dynamics of the lungs during ARDS. However, PLV has not been shown to reduce the mortality of ARDS. Some studies have shown that mild hypothermia therapy can reduce lung injuries in animal models of ARDS by reducing inflammatory cytokine levels in lung tissues. However, hypothermia cannot produce a lung protection effect alone, and it may have a synergistic effect with other protective measures. To explore the possible role of PLV combined with mild hypothermia in the treatment of ARDS, in this study, we used PFC liquid ventilation to induce mild hypothermia in dogs suffering from ARDS and analyzed the effects of PFC liquid ventilation-induced mild hypothermia on the levels of inflammatory factors and lung histopathology in dogs with ARDS. The experimental dogs were randomly divided into conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), normal temperature PFC liquid ventilation (NPLV), hypothermic PFC liquid ventilation (HPLV), and mechanical ventilation (MV) groups. After induction of ARDS, the CMV group was treated with CMV for respiratory support, the HPLV group was treated with PLV-induced mild hypothermia using 15 °C PFC and maintained the rectal temperature at 34-36 °C, the NPLV group was treated with PLV using 36 °C PFC and maintained the rectal temperature at 36-38 °C. The MV group served as the control group. Analyses of the pulmonary pathology, partial pressure of  in the blood, and lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/T) of each dog revealed that PLV-induced mild hypothermia significantly increased the PaO values and attenuated lung injury, and there were no adverse effects on hemodynamics. Furthermore, treatment with PLV-induced mild hypothermia significantly increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and attenuated the expression of interleukin (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in peripheral blood and in lung BALF. Moreover, the results showed that the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NF-κB p65 in lung tissues was significantly decreased by PLV-induced mild hypothermia compared with NPLV and CMV. Our results indicated that PLV combined with mild hypothermia can provide protection against -induced ARDS in dogs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Devoid of the estrogen and progesterone receptors, along with the receptor tyrosine kinase ERB2 (HER2), that define most mammary cancers, there are no targeted therapies for patients with TNBC. This, combined with a high metastatic rate and a lower 5-year survival rate than for other breast cancer phenotypes, means there is significant unmet need for new therapeutic strategies. Herein, the anti-neoplastic effects of the electrophilic fatty  nitroalkene derivative, 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic  (nitro-, NO-OA), were investigated in multiple preclinical models of TNBC. NO-OA reduced TNBC cell growth and viability , attenuated TNFα-induced TNBC cell migration and invasion, and inhibited the tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell xenografts in the mammary fat pads of female nude mice. The up-regulation of these aggressive tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion phenotypes is mediated in part by the constitutive activation of pro-inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in TNBC. NO-OA inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in human TNBC cells and suppressed downstream NF-κB target gene expression, including the metastasis-related proteins intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The mechanisms accounting for NF-κB signaling inhibition by NO-OA in TNBC cells were multifaceted, as NO-OA () inhibited the inhibitor of NF-κB subunit kinase β phosphorylation and downstream inhibitor of NF-κB degradation, () alkylated the NF-κB RelA protein to prevent DNA binding, and () promoted RelA polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Comparisons with non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial MCF-10A and MCF7 cells revealed that NO-OA more selectively inhibited TNBC function. This was attributed to more facile mechanisms for maintaining redox homeostasis in normal breast epithelium, including a more favorable thiol/disulfide balance, greater extents of multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1) expression, and greater MRP1-mediated efflux of NO-OA-glutathione conjugates. These observations reveal that electrophilic fatty  nitroalkenes react with more alkylation-sensitive targets in TNBC cells to inhibit growth and viability.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753173>Comparative effects of avocado oil and losartan on blood pressure, renal vascular function, and mitochondrial oxidative stress in hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (Ang-II) antagonism alleviates hypertensive kidney damage by improving mitochondrial function and decreasing oxidative stress. This condition also is associated with altered renal vascular tone due to enhanced constriction by Ang-II. Thus, approaches ameliorating these events are desirable to alleviate kidney damage. Avocado oil, a source of antioxidants and , is known to improve mitochondrial function, while  has antihypertensive effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether avocado oil counteracts, to a similar degree as the Ang-II blocker losartan, the deleterious effects of hypertension on blood pressure, renal vascular performance, kidney mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress.Hypertensive rats induced with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were supplemented during 45 d with avocado oil or losartan. Vascular responses were analyzed in perfused kidney. Membrane potential, reactive  species levels, and glutathione were analyzed in isolated kidney mitochondria.In hypertensive rats, avocado oil decreased 21.2% and 15.5% diastolic and systolic blood pressures, respectively, and alleviated impaired renal vasodilation. Hypertension decreased membrane potential by 83.7% and augmented reactive  species levels by 51% in mitochondria fueled with a complex I substrate, whereas it augmented the levels of oxidized glutathione in 48%. These alterations were normalized by avocado oil at a comparable degree to losartan.Because avocado oil mimicked the effects of losartan, we propose that the effects of avocado oil might be mediated by decreasing the actions of Ang-II on mitochondria. These results suggest that avocado oil intake might be a nutritional approach to attenuate the deleterious effects of hypertension on kidney.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

At inflammatory conditions, the enzyme myeloperoxidase generates hypochlorous  (HOCl) which adds to the double bonds of fatty acyl residues of (phospho)lipids under the formation of chlorohydrins. This may lead to the development of many inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis or arthritis, if the ROS generation exceeds a certain extent.

Unlike the general acceptance, the reaction of  and HOCl leads not exclusively to the formation of chlorohydrin (isomers) but is much more complex: there are also considerable amounts of dimeric and (to a minor extent) trimeric products which can be assigned to isomeric ethers and esters. The obtained products after  chlorination were also compared with the reaction products of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and HOCl.

In addition, a decrease in the antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been observed in the kidneys of mice fed a high‑fat diet. The present study aimed to determine whether the pro‑oxidant p66shc mediates NIC‑dependent increases in renal oxidative stress by augmenting the production of reactive  species (ROS) and suppressing the FFA‑induced antioxidant response in cultured NRK52E renal proximal tubule cells. Briefly, NRK52E renal proximal tubule cells were treated with 200 µM NIC, 100 µM  (OA), or a combination of NIC and OA. The expression levels of p66shc and MnSOD were modulated according to genetic methods. ROS production and cell injury, in the form of lactate dehydrogenase release, were subsequently detected. Promoter activity of p66shc and MnSOD, as well as forkhead box (FOXO)‑dependent transcription, was investigated using reporter luciferase assays. The results demonstrated that NIC exacerbated OA‑mediated intracellular ROS production and cell injury through the transcriptional activation of p66shc. NIC also suppressed OA‑mediated induction of the antioxidant MnSOD promoter activity through p66shc‑dependent inactivation of FOXO activity. Overexpression of p66shc and knockdown of MnSOD had the same effect as treatment with NIC on OA‑mediated lipotoxicity. These data may be used to generate a therapeutic means to ameliorate renal lipotoxicity in obese smokers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279625>Increased oxidative stress and renal injury in patients with sepsis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of death in intensive care units. The early phase of sepsis is characterized by a massive formation of reactive  and nitrogen species such as superoxide and nitric oxide. However, few comprehensive studies on plasma antioxidants have been reported. Increased oxidative stress was confirmed in sepsis patients ( = 18) at the time of hospitalization by a significant decrease in plasma ascorbic  and a significant increase in the percentage of oxidized form of coenzyme Q10 in total coenzyme Q10 compared to age-matched healthy controls ( = 62). Tissue oxidative damage in patients was suggested by a significant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty  contents and a significant increase in  contents in total free fatty acids. Thus, it is reasonable that plasma uric  (end product of purines) would be significantly elevated. However, uric  levels were continuously decreased during hospitalization for 7 days, indicating a continuous formation of peroxynitrite. A greater decrease in free cholesterol (FC) compared to cholesterol esters (CE) was observed. Thus, the FC/CE ratio significantly increased, suggesting deficiency of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase secreted from the liver. Plasma levels of prosaposin, a coenzyme Q10 binding protein, significantly decreased as compared to healthy controls. This may be correlated with renal injury in sepsis patients, since the kidney is thought to be a major secretor of prosaposin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428625>Furanoid F- F6 Uniquely Induces NETosis Compared to C16 and C18 Fatty Acids in Human Neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Various biomolecules induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation or NETosis. However, the effect of fatty acids on NETosis has not been clearly established. In this study, we focused on the NETosis-inducing ability of several lipid molecules. We extracted the lipid molecules present in Arabian Gulf catfish (, Val) skin gel, which has multiple therapeutic activities. Gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the lipid fraction-3 from the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid F- (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic ) and common long-chain fatty acids such as palmitic  (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic  (PO; C16:1), stearic  (SA; C18:0), and  (OA; C18:1). Using pure molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis that is rapid and induces reactive  species (ROS) production by both NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for long-chain fatty -induced NETosis, whereas, in F--induced NETosis, Akt is additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing. These findings are useful for understanding F-- and other fatty -induced NETosis and to establish the active ingredients with therapeutic potential for regulating diseases involving NET formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151152>UV-curable nanocomposite based on methacrylic-siloxane resin and surface-modified TiO2 nanocrystals.</a></h2><p>A novel UV-light-curable nanocomposite material formed of a methacrylic-siloxane resin loaded with 1 wt %  and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate silane (OLEA/MEMO)-coated TiO2 nanorods (NRs) has been manufactured as a potential self-curing structural coating material for protection of monuments and artworks, optical elements, and dental components. OLEA-coated TiO2 NRs, presynthesized by a colloidal chemistry route, have been surface-modified by a treatment with the methacrylic-based silane coupling agent MEMO. The resulting OLEA/MEMO-capped TiO2 NRs have been dispersed in MEMO; that is a monomer precursor of the organic formulation, used as a "common solvent" for transferring the NRs in prepolymer components of the formulation. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy have allowed investigation of the effects of the incorporation of the OLEA/MEMO-capped TiO2 NRs on reactivity and photopolymerization kinetics of the nanocomposite, demonstrating that the embedded NRs significantly increase curing reactivity of the neat organic formulation both in air and inert atmosphere. Such a result has been explained on the basis of the photoactivity of the nanocrystalline TiO2 which behaves as a free-radical donor photocatalyst in the curing reaction, finally turning out more effective than the commonly used commercial photoinitiator. Namely, the NRs have been found to accelerate the cure rate and increase cross-linking density, promoting multiple covalent bonds between the resin prepolymers and the NR ligand molecules, and, moreover, they limit inhibition effect of  on photopolymerization. The NRs distribute uniformly in the photocurable matrix, as assessed by transmission electron microscopy analysis, and increase glass transition temperature and water contact angle of the nanocomposite with respect to the neat resin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27180146>Mild hypothermia attenuate kidney injury in canines with -induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.</a></h2><p>Hypothermia may attenuate ventilator induced-lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the impact of hypothermia on extra-pulmonary organ injury in ARDS remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether hypothermia affects extra-pulmonary organ injury in a canine ARDS model induced by .Twelve anesthetized canines with -induced ARDS were randomly divided (n=6 per group) into a hypothermia group (core temperature of 33±1°C, HT group) and a normothermia group (core temperature of 38±1°C, NT group) and treated for four hours. The liver, small intestine and kidney were assessed by evaluating biochemical parameters, plasma and tissue cytokine levels, and tissue histopathological injury scores.The HT group showed a lower plateau pressure, lung elastance and pulmonary vascular resistance. Hypothermia was associated with lower  consumption (138.4±55.0mlmin(-1)vs. 72.0±11.2mlmin(-1), P<0.05) and higher  saturation of mixed venous blood (62.8%±8.0% vs. 77.5%±10.1%, P<0.05).

To date, little is known about whether fatty acids can affect HO-1 induction. Here, we report the induction of HO-1 by docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and the associated molecular mechanisms in human myelomonocytic lymphoma U937 cells. When U937 cells were treated with DHA, eicosapentaenoic , palmitic  or , DHA was the most effective inducer of HO-1. The activation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β did not significantly change after DHA treatment. However, DHA increased the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), but not of other mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p38 and JNK. The increase in HO-1 expression was significantly inhibited by U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and its binding to the HO-1 promoter significantly increased upon DHA treatment. An increase in intracellular reactive  species was detected by dichlorofluorescein diacetate, but not by hydroethidium or 2-[6-(4-hydroxy)phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl] benzoic  after DHA treatment. Pretreatment with NAC dramatically inhibited the ERK1/2 activation, binding of Nrf-2 to antioxidant response elements (AREs) located in the HO-1 promoter and the induction of HO-1 by DHA. In conclusion, DHA increased HO-1 expression in U937 cells via activation of ERK1/2 and increased Nrf-2 binding to ARE in the HO-1 promoter. These findings will help develop better strategies for treating inflammatory disorders with DHA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The in vitro DOX release from the spheres was prolonged, sustained, and pH-dependent and fit a zero-order kinetics model and an anomalous mechanism. Interestingly, the spheres did not show a DOX burst effect, ensuring the minimal exposure of the healthy cells and an increased drug payload at the tumor site.

Highest lipid content in C. vulgaris and A. obliquus was 49 and 43% in BG11 amended with 0.4 M NaCl. The microalgal strains C. vulgaris and A. obliquus grow better at 0.06 M NaCl concentration than control condition. At 0.06 M NaCl, improved dry biomass content in C. vulgaris and A. obliquus was 0.92 and 0.68 gL, respectively. Stress biomarkers like reactive  species, antioxidant enzyme catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were also lowest at 0.06 M NaCl concentration revealing that both the microalgal strains are well acclimatized at 0.06 M NaCl concentration. The fatty  composition of the investigated microalgal strains was also improved by increased NaCl concentration. At 0.4 M NaCl, palmitic  (37%),  (15.5%), and linoleic  (20%) were the dominant fatty acids in C. vulgaris while palmitic  (54%) and stearic  (26.6%) were major fatty acids found in A. obliquus.

Surface properties are of high importance for certain applications which include microfluidics and tissue engineering, as they drastically affect the end result. It is important to develop techniques to modify zein surface properties without compromising bulk material properties. In this study, we developed a facile technique to change the water affinity of zein film surfaces, compatible with patterning techniques via soft lithography. This is achieved by a simple solvent casting technique onto a polydimethylsilohexane (PDMS) substrate that was exposed to  plasma. Water contact angle measurements (WCA) were used to assess the hydrophillicity of zein surfaces and they reached as low as 20°. Atomic force microscopy, optical absorbance and light microscopy were used to study the characteristics of the film and its surface topography. Hydrophilic zein surfaces had higher roughness values compared to hydrophobic ones. Surface roughness, introduced by sandpaper and gratings does not have the same effect as surface chemistry. The amphiphilic nature of plasticizer  also contributed to the change in the water contact angle of the films. In conclusion, we demonstrated that zein film's surface properties can be controlled by its ability to self-assemble depending on the substrate that it is being cast on.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies proposed renal lipotoxicity in glomerular and tubular cells but the effect of lipid on renal erythropoietin (EPO)-producing (REP) cells in the interstitium has not been elucidated. Since renal anemia is caused by derangement of EPO production in REP cells, we evaluated the effect of palmitate, a representative long-chain saturated fatty , on EPO production and the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. EPO production was suppressed by palmitate (palmitate-conjugated bovine serum albumin [BSA]) or a high palmitate diet, but not -conjugated BSA or a high  diet, especially under cobalt-induced pseudo-hypoxia both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, suppression of EPO production was not induced by a decrease in transcription factor HIF activity, while it was significantly associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, particularly transcription factor ATF4 activation, which suppresses 3'-enhancer activity of the EPO gene. ATF4 knockdown by siRNA significantly attenuated the suppressive effect of palmitate on EPO production. Studies utilizing inherited super-anemic mice (ISAM) mated with EPO-Cre mice (ISAM-REC mice) for lineage-labeling of REP cells showed that ATF4 activation by palmitate suppressed EPO production in REP cells. Laser capture microdissection confirmed ATF4 activation in the interstitial area of ISAM-REC mice treated with palmitate-conjugated BSA. Thus, endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitate suppressed EPO expression by REP cells in a manner independent of HIF activation. The link between endoplasmic reticulum stress, dyslipidemia, and hypoxia may contribute to development and progression of anemia in CKD.Copyright © 2018 International Society of Nephrology.

Using the Seahorse XF96 analyzer, the energetic phenotypes of Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complex mutants are further characterized in the current study. The underlying regulation of energetic changes in these mutants is determined in glucose and non-glucose conditions when compared to wild type (WT) cells. In parental cells, the rate of  consumption remains constant for 2.5 h following the addition of glucose, oligomycin, and 2-DG, but glycolysis is highly active upon the addition of glucose. In comparison, over the same time period, electron transport complex mutants (CI, CIII and CIV) have heightened activities in both  consumption and glycolysis upon glucose uptake. We refer to the response in these mutants as an "explosive respiration," which we believe is caused by low energy levels and increased production of reactive  species (ROS). Accompanying this phenotype in mutants is a hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as an energetic stress response protein kinase for maintaining energy homeostasis. Compared to wild type cells, a 2.9- to 4.4-fold hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p is observed in all ETC mutants in the presence of glucose. However, the explosive respiration and hyperphosphorylation of Snf1 can be partially reduced by the replacement of glucose with either glycerol or  in a mutant-specific manner. Furthermore, Inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (BSO) or anti-oxidants (mito-TEMPO) likewise confirmed an increase of Sfn1 phosphorylation in WT or mutant due to increased levels of ROS. Our data establish the role of the C. albicans Snf1 as a surveyor of cell energy and ROS levels. We interpret the "explosive respiration" as a failed attempt by ETC mutants to restore energy and ROS homeostasis via Snf1 activation. An inherently high OCR baseline in WT C. albicans with a background level of Snf1 activation is a prerequisite for success in quickly fermenting glucose.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Rutin is a natural flavonoid with significant roles in combating cellular oxidative stress and regulating lipid metabolism. The current study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying rutin's hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Rutin treatment was applied to male C57BL/6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet and HepG2 cells challenged with . Hepatic lipid accumulation was evaluated by triglyceride assay and Oil Red O staining. Oxidative hepatic injury was assessed by malondialdehyde assay, superoxide dismutase assay and reactive  species assay. The expression levels of various lipogenic and lipolytic genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions. In addition, liver autophagy was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In both fat-challenged murine liver tissues and HepG2 cells, rutin treatment was shown to significantly lower triglyceride content and the abundance of lipid droplets. Rutin was also found to reduce cellular malondialdehyde level and restore superoxide dismutase activity in hepatocytes. Among the various lipid-related genes, rutin treatment was able to restore the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and its downstream targets, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and 2 (CPT-1 and CPT-2), while suppressing those of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), diglyceride acyltransfase 1 and 2 (DGAT-1 and 2), as well as acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, rutin was shown to repress the autophagic function of liver tissues by down-regulating key autophagy biomarkers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). The experimental data demonstrated that rutin could reduce triglyceride content and mitigate oxidative injuries in fat-enriched hepatocytes. The hypolipidemic properties of rutin could be attributed to its ability to simultaneously facilitate fatty  metabolism and inhibit lipogenesis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Because antioxidants are gaining attention as potent preventive agents for HS, we aimed to investigate anti-lipogenic effects of the antioxidants vitamin C (VC), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and astaxanthin (ATX) using hepatocytes. For this, we established an in vitro model using 1 mM  (OA) and human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells; 10 μM antioxidants were evaluated for their ability to reduce fat accumulation in hepatocytes. Our results showed that all three antioxidants were effective to reduce fat accumulation for the molecular targets such as reduction in lipid droplets, triglyceride (TG) concentration, reactive  species (ROS) production, and cell apoptosis, as well as in gene expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related effectors, lipogenesis, and inflammatory cytokines. There were simultaneous increases in diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging effect, cell survival, AMPK phosphorylation, NRF2-related gene expression for cellular defense, and FA β-oxidation. However, among these, ATX more effectively inhibited ER stress and lipogenesis at the intracellular level than VC or NAC. Consequently, ATX was also more effective in inhibiting cell death, lipotoxicity, and inflammation. Our result emphasizes that ATX achieved greater lipotoxicity reduction than VC and NAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28779139>Exceptionally strong, stiff and hard hybrid material based on an elastomer and isotropically shaped ceramic nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>In this work the fabrication of hard, stiff and strong nanocomposites based on polybutadiene and iron oxide nanoparticles is presented. The nanocomposites are fabricated via a general concept for mechanically superior nanocomposites not based on the brick and mortar structure, thus on globular nanoparticles with nanosized organic shells. For the fabrication of the composites  functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles are decorated via ligand exchange with an α,ω-polybutadiene dicarboxylic . The functionalized particles were processed at 145 °C. Since polybutadiene contains double bonds the nanocomposites obtained a crosslinked structure which was enhanced by the presence of  or sulfur. It was found that the crosslinking and filler percolation yields high elastic moduli of approximately 12-20 GPa and hardness of 15-18 GPa, although the polymer volume fraction is up to 40%.

Three hours after the injection with OA, the arterial  partial pressure (PaO), arterial  saturation (SaO), carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO), and bicarbonate (HCO) levels were analyzed using blood gas analyzer. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured by commercial kits, and pathological changes of lung tissue were examined by HE staining. Finally, the correlations of MPO activity or MDA level with the levels of TNF-α or IL-1β were analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis.We found decreased PaO levels and the pathological changes of lung tissue of ALI after OA injection. In addition, OA increased the levels of MDA, TNF-α, and IL-1β, as well as MPO activity in lung tissues (P < 0.05). However, after treatment with HSS, all of these changes were alleviated (P < 0.05), and these changes were mitigated when treated with HSS by ip then iv injection (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MDA level and MPO activity were positively correlated with TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the lung tissue, respectively (P < 0.01).HSS attenuated ALI induced by OA in rats and might protect against ALI through selective resistance to oxidation and inhibiting inflammatory infiltration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27588065>Effect of setting high APRV guided by expiratory inflection point of pressure-volume curve on  delivery in canine models of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the effect of setting high airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) pressure guided by an expiratory inflection point of pressure-volume (PV) curve following lung recruitment maneuver (RM) on  delivery (DO) in canine models of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was examined. Canine models of severe ARDS were established by intravenous injection of . After injection of sedative muscle relaxants, a PV curve plotted using the super-syringe technique, and the pressure at lower inflection point (LIP) at the inhale branch and the pressure at the point of maximum curvature (PMC) at the exhale branch were measured. The ventilation mode was biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP), an inspiration to expiration ratio of 1:2, and P 40 cm HO, P 25 cm HO. P was decreased to 30 cm HO after 90 sec. The dogs were randomized into 3 groups after RM, i.e., Blip group, BiPAP P = LIP+2 cm HO; Bpmc group, BiPAP P = PMC; and Apmc group. In the APRV group, P was set as PMC, with an inspiratory duration of 4 sec and expiratory duration of 0.4 sec. PMC was 18±1.4 cm HO, and LIP was 11±1.3 cm HO. Thirty seconds after RM was stabilized, it was set as 0 h. Hemodynamics, oxygenation and DO were measured at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h after RM in ARDS dogs. The results demonstrated: i) cardiac index (CI) in the 3 groups, where CI was significantly decreased in the Bpmc group at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h after RM compared to prior to RM (P<0.05) as well as in the Blip and Apmc groups (P<0.05). CI in the Blip and Apmc groups was not significantly altered prior to and after RM. ii) Oxygenation at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h in the 3 groups was improved after RM and the oxygenation indices for the 3 groups at 1 and 2 h were not significantly different (P>0.05). However, the oxygenation index in the Blip group at 4 h was significantly lower than those at 0 h for the Apmc and Bpmc groups (P<0.05). Oxygenation for the Apmc group at 4 h was higher than that for the Blip and Bpmc groups (P<0.05). Oxygenation for the Bpmc group was lower than that at 0 h, although the difference was not significant (P>0.05). iii) DO in at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h in the Bpmc group was significantly lower than that in the Blip and Apmc groups, and not significantly improved after RM. DO in the Blip and Apmc groups after RM was improved as compard to that before RM and that in the Bpmc group. However, DO at 4 h in the Blip group was significantly lower than that at 0 h and in the Apmc group (P<0.05). DO at 4 h in the Apmc group was higher than that at 0 h and that in the remaining 2 groups (P<0.05).

Thus this study investigated the antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect of blackberry, wild blueberry, strawberry, and chokeberry ACN-rich extracts, with different structural characteristics, on -induced hepatic steatosis in vitro. Four major ACNs from these berries, with different aglycones, namely cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glu), delphinidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside, were also investigated.Blackberry ACN-rich extract exhibited the most significant inhibitory effect on TG clearance (30.5% ± 3.4%) and reactive  species generation. TG clearance was significantly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.991, P < 0.05) and  radical absorbance capacity value (r = 0.961, P < 0.05). Furthermore, Cy-3-glu showed the highest inhibitory effect on intracellular TG overaccumulation, with a maximum TG clearance of 61.3% at 40 µg mL(-1) .Our findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of different ACNs on -induced hepatic steatosis significantly vary.

We previously showed that HO-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca]) in lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) involve the membrane Ca channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) and that inhibiting this channel attenuated HO-induced barrier disruption in vitro. We also showed that phosphorylation of TRPV4 by the Src family kinase, Fyn, contributes to HO-induced Ca influx in LMVEC. In endothelial cells, Fyn is tethered to the cell membrane by CD36, a fatty  transporter. In this study, we assessed the effect of genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of CD36 on Ca responses to HO HO-induced Ca influx was attenuated in LMVEC isolated from mice lacking CD36 (CD36). TRPV4 expression and function was unchanged in LMVEC isolated from wild-type (WT) and CD36 mice, as well as mice with deficiency for Fyn (Fyn). TRPV4 immunoprecipitated with Fyn, but this interaction was decreased in CD36 LMVEC. The amount of phosphorylated TRPV4 was decreased in LMVEC from CD36 mice compared with WT controls. Loss of CD36 altered subcellular localization of Fyn, while inhibition of CD36 fatty  transport with succinimidyl oleate did not attenuate HO-induced Ca influx. Lastly, we found that CD36 mice were protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD36 plays an important role in HO-mediated lung injury and that the mechanism may involve CD36-dependent scaffolding of Fyn to the cell membrane to facilitate TRPV4 phosphorylation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862029>Peanut Sprout Extracts Attenuate Triglyceride Accumulation by Promoting Mitochondrial Fatty  Oxidation in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Peanut sprouts (PS), which are germinated peanut seeds, have recently been reported to have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects. However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates lipid metabolism are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated adipogenesis by inhibiting lipid accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty  (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]- (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial  consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes. In summary, PSE was effective in reducing lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through mitochondrial fatty  oxidation involved in AMPK and mitochondrial activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615022>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Modifies the Changes Induced in Non-Nervous Organs and Tissues by Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Models.</a></h2><p>This study reveals the existence of oxidative stress (reactive  species (ROS)) in non-nervous organs and tissues in multiple sclerosis (MS) by means of a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats. This model reproduces a similar situation to MS, as well as its relationship with intestinal microbiota starting from the changes in bacterial lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) in the outer wall of the gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the administration of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytirosol (HT), and  (OA) exert beneficial effects. Twenty-five Dark Agouti two-month-old male rats, weighing around 190 g, were distributed into the following groups: Control, EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis group), EAE + EVOO, EAE + HT, and EAE + OA. The glutathione redox system with the EAE was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and small and large intestines. The LPS and the correlation with oxidative stress in the small and large intestines were also investigated. The results showed that (1) the oxidative damage in the EAE model affects non-nervous organs and tissues; (2) The LPS is related to inflammatory phenomena and oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue and in other organs; (3) The administration of EVOO, HT, and OA reduces the LPS levels at the same time as minimizing the oxidative damage; (4) EVOO, HT, and OA improve the disease's clinical score; and (5) on balance, EVOO offers a better neuroprotective effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26720456>The Effect of Ambient Ozone on Unsaturated Tear Film Wax Esters.</a></h2><p>Tear film lipid layer (TFLL) is constantly exposed to reactive ozone in the surrounding air, which may have detrimental effects on ocular health. Behenyl oleate (BO), a representative tear film wax ester, was used to study the reaction with ozone at the air-water interface.Time-dependent changes in mean molecular area of BO monolayers were measured at different ozone concentrations and surface pressures. In addition, the effect of ascorbic  on the reaction rate was determined. Reaction was followed using thin-layer chromatography and reaction products were identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Tear fluid samples from healthy subjects were analyzed with LC-MS for any ozonolysis reaction products.Behenyl oleate was found to undergo rapid ozonolysis at the air-water interface at normal indoor ozone concentrations. The reaction was observed as an initial expansion followed by a contraction of the film area. Ascorbic  was found to decrease the rate of ozonolysis. Main reaction products were identified as behenyl 9-oxononanoate and behenyl 8-(5-octyl-1,2,4-trioxolan-3-yl)octanoate. Similar ozonolysis products were not detected in the tear fluid samples.At the air-water interface, unsaturated wax esters react readily with ozone in ambient air. However, no signs of ozonolysis products were found in the tear fluid. This is most likely due to the antioxidant systems present in tear fluid. Last, the results show that ozonolysis needs to be controlled in future surface chemistry studies on tear film lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469345>Tanycytic TSPO inhibition induces lipophagy to regulate lipid metabolism and improve energy balance.</a></h2><p>Hypothalamic glial cells named tanycytes, which line the 3 ventricle (3V), are components of the hypothalamic network that regulates a diverse array of metabolic functions for energy homeostasis. Herein, we report that TSPO (translocator protein), an outer mitochondrial protein, is highly enriched in tanycytes and regulates homeostatic responses to nutrient excess as a potential target for an effective intervention in obesity. Administration of a TSPO ligand, PK11195, into the 3V, and tanycyte-specific deletion of  reduced food intake and elevated energy expenditure, leading to negative energy balance in a high-fat diet challenge. Ablation of tanycytic  elicited AMPK-dependent lipophagy, breaking down lipid droplets into free fatty acids, thereby elevating ATP in a lipid stimulus. Our findings suggest that tanycytic TSPO affects systemic energy balance through macroautophagy/autophagy-regulated lipid metabolism, and highlight the physiological significance of TSPO in hypothalamic lipid sensing and bioenergetics in response to overnutrition.  3V: 3 ventricle; ACAC: acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase; AGRP: agouti related neuropeptide; AIF1/IBA1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ARC: arcuate nucleus; Atg: autophagy related; Bafilo: bafilomycin A; CAMKK2: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, beta; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CNS: central nervous system; COX4I1: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1; FFA: free fatty ; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; HFD: high-fat diet; ICV: intracerebroventricular; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2; LD: lipid droplet; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MBH: mediobasal hypothalamus; ME: median eminence; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; NCD: normal chow diet; NEFM/NFM: neurofilament medium; NPY: neuropeptide Y; OL: ; POMC: pro-opiomelanocortin-alpha; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; : retina and anterior neural fold homeobox; RBFOX3/NeuN: RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog (C. elegans) 3; RER: respiratory exchange ratio; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TG: triglyceride; TSPO: translocator protein; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1; VCO: carbon dioxide production; VMH: ventromedial hypothalamus; VO:  consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941349>Lipotoxic Palmitate Impairs the Rate of β-Oxidation and Citric  Cycle Flux in Rat Neonatal Cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Diabetic hearts exhibit intracellular lipid accumulation. This suggests that the degree of fatty  oxidation (FAO) in these hearts is insufficient to handle the elevated lipid uptake. We previously showed that palmitate impaired the rate of FAO in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Here we were interested in characterizing the site of FAO impairment induced by palmitate since it may shed light on the metabolic dysfunction that leads to lipid accumulation in diabetic hearts.We measured fatty  oxidation, acetyl-CoA oxidation, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (Cpt1b) activity. We measured both forward and reverse aconitase activity, as well as NAD+ dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. We also measured reactive  species using the 2', 7'-Dichlorofluorescin Diacetate (DCFDA) assay. Finally we used thin layer chromatography to assess diacylglycerol (DAG) levels.We found that palmitate significantly impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation as well as citric  cycle flux, but not Cpt1b activity. Palmitate negatively affected net aconitase activity and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The impaired enzyme activities were not due to oxidative stress but may be due to DAG mediated PKC activation.This work demonstrates that palmitate, a highly abundant fatty  in human diets, causes impaired β-oxidation and citric  cycle flux in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes. This metabolic defect occurs prior to cell death suggesting that it is a cause, rather than a consequence of palmitate mediated lipotoxicity. This impaired mitochondrial metabolism can have important implications for metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

To examine the reactions of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids bearing a double bond at different positions, an electron spin resonance, a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance and a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass spectrometry were employed. The control reaction mixtures contained 25μmolL(-1) of flavin mononucleotide, 1.0mmolL(-1) of FeSO4(NH4)2SO4, 10mmolL(-1) of cholic , 30mmolL(-1) of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1molL(-1) of α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone in deuterium oxide.

The control reaction mixtures without FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone were exposed to the visible light at 436nm (7.8Jcm(-2)). After the irradiation, α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was added. The reactions started from adding FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and performed at 25°C for 1min. Electron spin resonance measurements of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent signals (α(N)=1.58mT and α(Hβ)=0.26mT). High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent peaks at the retention times of 31.1min {(z)-6-octadecenoic }, 39.6min {(z)-9-octadecenoic }, 44.9min {(z)-11-octadecenoic } and 40.2min {(z, z)-9, 12-octadecadienoic }. High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed that 4-carboxybutyl, 7-carboxyheptyl and 9-carboxynonyl radicals formed in the control reaction mixtures of (z)-6-octadecenoic , (z)-9-octadecenoic  {or (z, z)-9,12-octadecadienoic } and (z)-11-octadecenoic , respectively. The 4-carboxybutyl, 7-carboxyheptyl and 9-carboxynonyl radicals are all generated through β-scission of alkoxy radicals formed on carboxyl ends of the double bonds of the unsaturated fatty acids.

Here, kinetics of heterogeneous reaction of ozone with six unsaturated fatty acids (, vaccenic , eladic , myristoleic , palmitoleic  and 2-hexadecenoic ) were studied via a flow system combined with attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) and overall reactive uptake coefficients (γ) values were derived according to the changes in absorbance from infrared spectra. Results have shown reaction rates are highly dependent on structures of unsaturated fatty acids. Cis-isomer has faster reaction kinetics than trans-isomer, and conjugated system between CC and CO bonds can greatly inhibit reactivity. Also, it is found that a longer carbon chain length between CC bond and COOH group or a shorter chain length between CC bond and last carbon seemingly enhances reaction kinetics.

To address this, the deep photochemical processes were evaluated by Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometry coupled with a discrimination of its leaf fatty  profile. Plants exposed to 125-250 mm NaCl showed higher photochemical light harvesting efficiencies and lower energy dissipation rates. under higher NaCl exposure, there is evident damage of the  evolving complexes (OECs). On the other hand, Reaction Centre (RC) closure net rate and density increased, improving the energy fluxes entering the PS II, in spite of the high amounts of energy dissipated and the loss of PS II antennae connectivity. Energy dissipation was mainly achieved through the auroxanthin pathway. Total fatty  content displayed a similar trend, being also higher under 125-250 mm NaCl with high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The increase in  and palmitic  allows the maintenance of the good functioning of the PS II. Also relevant was the high concentration of chloroplastic C16:1t in the individuals subjected to 125-250 mm NaCl, related with a higher electron transport activity and with the organization of the Light Harvesting Complexes (LHC) and thus reducing the activation of energy dissipation mechanisms. All these new insights shed some light not only on the photophysiology of this potential cash-crop, but also highlight its important saline agriculture applications of this species as forage and potential source of essential fatty acids.© 2016 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561889>Assessment of oxidative damage induced by iron oxide nanoparticles on different nervous system cells.</a></h2><p>Iron oxide nanoparticles (ION) have received much attention for their utility in biomedical applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery and hyperthermia, but concerns regarding their potential harmful effects are also growing. Even though ION may induce different toxic effects in a wide variety of cell types and animal systems, there is a notable lack of toxicological data on the human nervous system, particularly important given the increasing number of applications on this specific system. An important mechanism of nanotoxicity is reactive  species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress. On this basis, the main objective of this work was to assess the oxidative potential of silica-coated (S-ION) and -coated (O-ION) ION on human SH-SY5Y neuronal and A172 glial cells. To this aim, ability of ION to generate ROS (both in the absence and presence of cells) was determined, and consequences of oxidative potential were assessed (i) on DNA by means of the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1)-modified comet assay, and (ii) on antioxidant reserves by analyzing ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Conditions tested included a range of concentrations, two exposure times (3 and 24 h), and absence and presence of serum in the cell culture media. Results confirmed that, even though ION were not able to produce ROS in acellular environments, ROS formation was increased in the neuronal and glial cells by ION exposure, and was parallel to induction of oxidative DNA damage and, only in the case of neuronal cells treated with S-ION, to decreases in the GSH/GSSG ratio. Present findings suggest the production of oxidative stress as a potential action mechanism leading to the previously reported cellular effects, and indicate that ION may pose a health risk to human nervous system cells by generating oxidative stress, and thus should be used with caution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Then, the steatotic cells were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations (25 to 100 μmol/L) of silybin as phytosome complex with vitamin E. The effects of silybin on lipid accumulation and metabolism, and on indices of oxidative stress were evaluated by absorption and fluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, spectrophotometric and fluorimetric assays.Lipid-loading resulted in intracellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation inside lipid droplets, whose number and size increased. TG accumulation was mediated by increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). The lipid imbalance was associated with higher production of reactive  species (ROS) resulting in increased lipid peroxidation, stimulation of catalase activity and activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Incubation of steatotic cells with silybin 50 μmol/L significantly reduced TG accumulation likely by promoting lipid catabolism and by inhibiting lipogenic pathways, as suggested by the changes in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), PPAR and SREBP-1c levels. The reduction in fat accumulation exerted by silybin in the steatotic cells was associated with the improvement of the oxidative imbalance caused by lipid excess as demonstrated by the reduction in ROS content, lipid peroxidation, catalase activity and NF-κB activation.We demonstrated the direct anti-steatotic and anti-oxidant effects of silybin in steatotic cells, thus elucidating at a cellular level the encouraging results demonstrated in clinical and animal studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640183>Water Extract of  L. Ameliorates Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to investigate whether hot water extract (CLW) of  L. could prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). HepG2 cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) mixture (: palmitic , 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro fatty liver. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce fatty liver in vivo. Intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and fatty  transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW. These results suggest that CLW could be a potentially useful agent for the prevention of NAFLD through modulating fatty  uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154622> Prevents Isoprenaline-Induced Cardiac Injury: Effects on Cellular Oxidative Stress, Inflammation and Histopathological Alterations.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to assess the cardio-protective role of  in myocardial injury (MI) induced by intra-peritoneal injection of isoprenaline (ISO) in rats for 2 consecutive days.  (OA) was administered orally (@ 5 mg/kg b.wt and 10 mg/kg b.wt) for 21 days before inducing MI. Pre-exposure to OA at higher dose significantly improved the HW/BW ratio, myocardial infarct size, lipid profiles (total cholesterol, HDL-C) and cardiac injury biomarkers (LDH, CK-MB, cardiac troponin-I, MMP-9), thus suggesting its cardio-protective role. The ameliorative potential of the higher dose of OA was further substantiated by its ability to reduce the cardiac oxidative stress as evidenced by significant decrease in lipid peroxidation coupled with increase in superoxide dismutase activity and reduced glutathione level. Significant decrease in heart rate as well as increase in RR and QT intervals in  pre-exposed rats were also observed. OA pre-treatment also reduced the histopathological alterations seen in myocardial injury group rats. The mRNA expression of cardiac UCP-2 gene, a regulator of reactive  species (ROS) generation, was significantly increased in  pre-exposure group compared to the ISO-induced myocardial injury group. Thus increase in expression of UCP-2 gene in cardiac tissue seems to be one of the protective measures against myocardial injury. Based on the above findings, it may be inferred that  possesses promising cardio-protective potential against myocardial injury due to its anti-oxidative property and ability to modulate cardiac metabolic processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425576>Forever panting and forever growing: physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at extremely low  availability in the absence of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>We sought to investigate how far the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under full anaerobiosis is dependent on the widely used anaerobic growth factors (AGF) ergosterol and . A continuous cultivation setup was employed and, even forcing ultrapure N2 gas through an O2 trap upstream of the bioreactor, neither cells from S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D (a lab strain) nor from PE-2 (an industrial strain) washed out after an aerobic-to-anaerobic switch in the absence of AGF. S. cerevisiae PE-2 seemed to cope better than the laboratory strain with this extremely low O2 availability, since it presented higher biomass yield, lower specific rates of glucose consumption and CO2 formation, and higher survival at low pH. Lipid (fatty  and sterol) composition dramatically altered when cells were grown anaerobically without AGF: saturated fatty , squalene and lanosterol contents increased, when compared to either cells grown aerobically or anaerobically with AGF. We concluded that these lipid alterations negatively affect cell viability during exposure to low pH or high ethanol titers.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26721561>Characterization of zebrafish neuroglobin and cytoglobins 1 and 2: Zebrafish cytoglobins provide insights into the transition from six-coordinate to five-coordinate globins.</a></h2><p>Neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb) are two six-coordinate heme proteins of unknown physiological function. Although studies on the mammalian proteins have elucidated aspects of Ngb and Cygb biophysics and indicated potential functions, the properties of non-mammalian Ngbs and Cygbs are largely uncharacterized. We have expressed the recombinant zebrafish proteins Ngb, Cygb1, and Cygb2 in Escherichia coli and characterized their nitrite reduction rates, spectral properties, autoxidation rate constants, redox potentials and lipid binding properties. The three zebrafish proteins can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide with a broad range of reaction rate constants. (Ngb, 0.68 ± 0.04 M(-1) s(-1); Cygb1, 28.6 ± 3.1 M(-1) s(-1); Cygb2, 0.94 ± 0.18 M(-1) s(-1)). We observe that zebrafish Ngb and Cygb2 have comparable spectral features to those of human Ngb and Cygb, consistent with a six-coordinate heme, whereas unexpectedly Cygb1 has a five-coordinate heme, a slower autoxidation and in general has properties more akin to  transport proteins. In agreement with a possible  carrier and nitrite reductase role, we detect mRNA transcript for Cygb1 but not Cygb2 or Ngb in zebrafish blood. Unlike human Cygb, neither of the zebrafish globins binds  with high affinity. This finding suggests that lipid binding may be a trait acquired later during evolution and not an ancestral property of cytoglobins. Altogether, our results uncover unexpected properties of zebrafish globins and reveal the pivotal role of cytoglobins in the transition of heme globins from six-coordinate to five-coordinate  carriers and nitrite reductases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effective bioconjugation of inorganic nanoparticles to the molecule-specific proteins, free of agglomeration, nonspecific binding, or biomolecule deactivation, is crucial for molecular recognition of target molecules or cells. The current available protocols require multiple steps which can lead to low probe stability, specificity, and reproducibility. Here we report a simple and rapid protein bioconjugation method based on a one-step ligand exchange using the DNAs as the linker. Our method benefits from the robust DNA-protein conjugates as well as from multiple ions binding capability. Protein can be preconjugated via an amino group at the 3' end of a synthetic DNA molecule, so that the 5' end phosphoric  group and multiple phosphate  atoms in the phosphodiester bonds are exposed to replace the  ligands on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles due to their stronger chelating capability to lanthanides. We demonstrated that our method can efficiently pull out the upconversion nanoparticles from organic solvent into an aqueous phase. The upconversion nanoparticles then become hydrophilic, stable, and specific biomolecules recognition. This allows us to successfully functionalize the upconversion nanoparticles with horseradish peroxidise (HRP) for catalytic colorimetric assay and for streptavidin (SA)-biotin immunoassays.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348600>Chinese olive extract ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo by regulating lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Chinese olive contains plenty of polyphenols, which possess a wide range of biological actions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ethyl acetate fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc) in the modulation of lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo. In cellular studies, CO-EtOAc attenuated -induced lipid accumulation; we then elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CO-EtOAc in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. CO-EtOAc suppressed the mRNA levels of fatty  transporter genes (CD36 and FABP) and lipogenesis genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC1), but upregulated genes that govern lipolysis (HSL) and lipid oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1, and ACOX). Moreover, CO-EtOAc increased the protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK, ACC1, CPT-1, and PPARα, but downregulated the expression of mature SREBP-1c and FAS. AMPK plays an essential role in CO-EtOAc-mediated amelioration of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that CO-EtOAc significantly inhibited body weight gain, epididymal adipose tissue weight, and hepatic lipid accumulation via regulation of the expression of fatty  transporter, lipogenesis, and fatty  oxidation genes and proteins in C57BL/6 mice fed a 60% high-fat diet. Therefore, Chinese olive fruits may have the potential to improve the metabolic abnormalities associated with fatty liver under high fat challenge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27313828>S-Propargyl-cysteine Exerts a Novel Protective Effect on Methionine and Choline Deficient Diet-Induced Fatty Liver via Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the antioxidative effect of S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC) on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) by treating mice fed a methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet with SPRC for four weeks. We found that SPRC significantly reduced hepatic reactive  species (ROS) and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) levels. Moreover, SPRC also increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. By Western blot, we found that this protective effect of SPRC was importantly attributed to the regulated hepatic antioxidant-related proteins, including protein kinase B (Akt), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE, an enzyme that synthesizes hydrogen sulfide). Next, we examined the detailed molecular mechanism of the SPRC protective effect using - (OA-) induced HepG2 cells. The results showed that SPRC significantly decreased intracellular ROS and MDA levels in OA-induced HepG2 cells by upregulating the phosphorylation of Akt, the expression of HO-1 and CSE, and the translocation of Nrf2. SPRC-induced HO-1 expression and Nrf2 translocation were abolished by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. Moreover, the antioxidative effect of SPRC was abolished by CSE inhibitor DL-propargylglycine (PAG) and HO-1 siRNA. Therefore, these results proved that SPRC produced an antioxidative effect on NAFLD through the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214972>Avocado oil induces long-term alleviation of oxidative damage in kidney mitochondria from type 2 diabetic rats by improving glutathione status.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia and mitochondrial ROS overproduction have been identified as key factors involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. This has encouraged the search for strategies decreasing glucose levels and long-term improvement of redox status of glutathione, the main antioxidant counteracting mitochondrial damage. Previously, we have shown that avocado oil improves redox status of glutathione in liver and brain mitochondria from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; however, the long-term effects of avocado oil and its hypoglycemic effect cannot be evaluated because this model displays low survival and insulin depletion. Therefore, we tested during 1 year the effects of avocado oil on glycemia, ROS levels, lipid peroxidation and glutathione status in kidney mitochondria from type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. Diabetic rats exhibited glycemia of 120-186 mg/dL the first 9 months with a further increase to 250-300 mg/dL. Avocado oil decreased hyperglycemia at intermediate levels between diabetic and control rats. Diabetic rats displayed augmented lipid peroxidation and depletion of reduced glutathione throughout the study, while increased ROS generation was observed at the 3rd and 12th months along with diminished content of total glutathione at the 6th and 12th months. Avocado oil ameliorated all these defects and augmented the mitochondrial content of . The beneficial effects of avocado oil are discussed in terms of the hypoglycemic effect of  and the probable dependence of glutathione transport on lipid peroxidation and thiol oxidation of mitochondrial carriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076361>Dopaminergic Neurons Respond to Iron-Induced Oxidative Stress by Modulating Lipid Acylation and Deacylation Cycles.</a></h2><p>Metal-imbalance has been reported as a contributor factor for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson Disease (PD). Specifically, iron (Fe)-overload and copper (Cu) mis-compartmentalization have been reported to be involved in the injury of dopaminergic neurons in this pathology. The aim of this work was to characterize the mechanisms of membrane repair by studying lipid acylation and deacylation reactions and their role in oxidative injury in N27 dopaminergic neurons exposed to Fe-overload and Cu-supplementation. N27 dopaminergic neurons incubated with Fe (1 mM) for 24 hs displayed increased levels of reactive  species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and elevated plasma membrane permeability. Cu-supplemented neurons (10, 50 μM) showed no evidence of oxidative stress markers. A different lipid acylation profile was observed in N27 neurons pre-labeled with [3H] arachidonic  (AA) or [3H]  (OA). In Fe-exposed neurons, AA uptake was increased in triacylglycerols (TAG) whereas its incorporation into the phospholipid (PL) fraction was diminished. TAG content was 40% higher in Fe-exposed neurons than in controls. This increase was accompanied by the appearance of Nile red positive lipid bodies. Contrariwise, OA incorporation increased in the PL fractions and showed no changes in TAG. Lipid acylation profile in Cu-supplemented neurons showed AA accumulation into phosphatidylserine and no changes in TAG. The inhibition of deacylation/acylation reactions prompted an increase in oxidative stress markers and mitochondrial dysfunction in Fe-overloaded neurons. These findings provide evidence about the participation of lipid acylation mechanisms against Fe-induced oxidative injury and postulate that dopaminergic neurons cleverly preserve AA in TAG in response to oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28522296>Oleate protects macrophages from palmitate-induced apoptosis through the downregulation of CD36 expression.</a></h2><p>In obese patients, free fatty acids ectopically accumulated in non-adipose tissues cause cell death. Saturated fatty acids are more deleterious to non-adipose cells, and supplementation with monounsaturated fatty acids has been proposed to rescue cells from saturated fatty -induced cytotoxicity; however, the mechanisms are not well understood. To understand the cytoprotective role of monounsaturated fatty acids in lipotoxic cell death of macrophages, we investigated the antagonizing effect of oleate and the underlying mechanisms in palmitate-treated RAW264.7 cells. Palmitate strongly induced apoptosis in macrophages by increasing CD36 expression, which was identified to mediate both endoplasmic reticulum stress and the generation of reactive  species. Co-treatment with oleate significantly reduced CD36 expression and its downstream signaling pathways of apoptosis in palmitate-treated cells. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which oleate protects macrophages from palmitate-induced lipotoxicity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, the PL intensity of C-dots remains stable under high ionic strength. The C-dots can protect cells from oxidative stress, which shows potential to expand the biological application of C-dots, especially in medical treatment.

We have previously characterized the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) formation in the neuronal response to Fe-induced OS. In this work we characterize the role of the α-syn variant A53T during Fe-induced injury and investigate whether lipid metabolism has implications for neuronal fate. To this end, we used the N27 dopaminergic neuronal cell line either untransfected (UT) or stably transfected with pcDNA3 vector (as a transfection control) or pcDNA-A53T-α-syn (A53T α-syn). The overexpression of A53T α-syn triggered an increase in TAG content mainly due to the activation of Acyl-CoA synthetase. Since fatty  (FA) β-oxidation and phospholipid content did not change in A53T α-syn cells, the unique consequence of the increase in FA-CoA derivatives was their acylation in TAG moieties. Control cells exposed to Fe-induced injury displayed increased OS markers and TAG content. Intriguingly, Fe exposure in A53T α-syn cells promoted a decrease in OS markers accompanied by α-syn aggregation and elevated TAG content. We report here new evidence of a differential role played by A53T α-syn in neuronal lipid metabolism as related to the neuronal response to OS.Copyright © 2018.

Dietary fat, in particular monounsaturated fatty acids, such as  (OA), potently stimulates GLP-1 secretion from L-cells. It is, however, unclear whether the intracellular metabolic handling of OA is involved in this effect.First we determined the optimal medium for the bioenergetics measurements. Then we examined the effect of OA on the metabolism of the immortalized enteroendocrine GLUTag cell model and assessed GLP-1 release in parallel. We measured  consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in response to OA and to different metabolic inhibitors with the Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.OA increased cellular respiration and potently stimulated GLP-1 release. The fatty  oxidation inhibitor etomoxir did neither reduce OA-induced respiration nor affect the OA-induced GLP-1 release. In contrast, inhibition of the respiratory chain or of downstream steps of aerobic glycolysis reduced the OA-induced GLP-1 release, and an inhibition of the first step of glycolysis by addition of 2-deoxy-d-glucose even abolished it.These findings indicate that an indirect stimulation of glycolysis is crucial for the OA-induced release of GLP-1.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ROS production was detected using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The protein levels of NOX4 and cleaved-caspase3 were detected using Western blot assay. O/P significantly decreased cell viability at 10, 100, 500 μM, and 5 mM in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the cell viability was reduced by 500 μM O/P mixture at 6, 24, and 48 h in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with 500 μM O/P significantly enhanced ROS production and cell apoptosis in chondrocytes. Furthermore, treatment with O/P mixture significantly enhanced the expression of NOX4 and caspase3 activation in a dose- and time- dependent manner. More importantly, inhibition of NOX4 could partially eliminate O/P-induced chondrocytes apoptosis by reducing ROS production. To conclude, O/P treatment enhances ROS production and cell apoptosis mainly by upregulating the protein levels of NOX4 and caspase3 activation in chondrocytes, indicating a potential therapeutic target of OA in obesity patients.© 2016 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730927>Epoxy Stearic , an Oxidative Product Derived from , Induces Cytotoxicity, Oxidative Stress, and Apoptosis in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>In the present study, effects of cis-9,10-epoxy stearic  (ESA) generated by the thermal oxidation of  on HepG2 cells, including cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, were investigated. Our results revealed that ESA decreased the cell viability and induced cell death. Cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide staining showed that ESA induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in HepG2 cells. Cell apoptosis analysis with annexin V and propidium iodide staining demonstrated that ESA induced HepG2 cell apoptotic events in a dose- and time-dependent manner; the apoptosis of cells after treated with 500 μM ESA for 12, 24, and 48 h was 32.16, 38.70, and 65.80%, respectively. Furthermore, ESA treatment to HepG2 cells resulted in an increase in reactive  species and malondialdehyde (from 0.84 ± 0.02 to 8.90 ± 0.50 nmol/mg of protein) levels and a reduction in antioxidant enzyme activity, including superoxide dismutase (from 1.34 ± 0.27 to 0.10 ± 0.007 units/mg of protein), catalase (from 100.04 ± 5.05 to 20.09 ± 3.00 units/mg of protein), and glutathione peroxidase (from 120.44 ± 7.62 to 35.84 ± 5.99 milliunits/mg of protein).

This study elucidated the mechanisms of brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1) in the protective effects of RES against liver lipid metabolism disorders. The results indicated that RES ameliorated free fatty  (FFA)-induced ( (OA): palmitic  (PA) = 2:1) glycolipid metabolic disorders in hepatocytes. Simultaneously, RES partially reverted the relatively shallow daily oscillations of FFA-induced circadian clock gene transcription and protein expression in HepG2 cells. RES also attenuated FFA-triggered reactive  species (ROS) secretion and restored mitochondrial membrane potential consumption, as well as the restoration of mitochondrial respiratory complex expression. This study provides compelling evidence that RES controls intracellular lipid metabolic imbalance in a Bmal1-dependent manner. Overall, RES may serve as a promising natural nutraceutical for the regulation of lipid metabolic disorders relevant to the circadian clock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28408132>Comparison of the effects of major fatty acids present in the Mediterranean diet (, docosahexaenoic ) and in hydrogenated oils (elaidic ) on 7-ketocholesterol-induced oxiapoptophagy in microglial BV-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), which results mainly from cholesterol auto-oxidation, are often found in the plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and might contribute to activation of microglial cells involved in neurodegeneration. As major cellular dysfunctions are induced by 7KC, it is important to identify molecules able to impair its side effects. Since consumption of olive and argan oils, and fish is important in the Mediterranean diet, the aim of the study was to determine the ability of  (OA), a major compound of olive and argan oil, and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) present in fatty fishes, such as sardines, to attenuate 7KC-induced cytotoxic effects. Since elaidic  (EA), the trans isomer of OA, can be found in hydrogenated cooking oils and fried foods, its effects on 7KC-induced cytotoxicity were also determined. In murine microglial BV-2 cells, 7KC induces cell growth inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunctions, reactive  species overproduction and lipid peroxidation, increased plasma membrane permeability and fluidity, nuclei condensation and/or fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, which are apoptotic characteristics, and an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, which is a criterion of autophagy. 7KC is therefore a potent inducer of oxiapoptophagy (OXIdation+APOPTOsis+autoPHAGY) on BV-2 cells. OA and EA, but not DHA, also favor the accumulation of lipid droplets revealed with Masson's trichrome, Oil Red O, and Nile Red staining. The cytotoxicity of 7KC was strongly attenuated by OA and DHA. Protective effects were also observed with EA. However, 7KC-induced caspase-3 activation was less attenuated with EA. Different effects of OA and EA on autophagy were also observed. In addition, EA (but not OA) increased plasma membrane fluidity, and only OA (but not EA) was able to prevent the 7KC-induced increase in plasma membrane fluidity. Thus, in BV-2 microglial cells, the principal fatty acids of the Mediterranean diet (OA, DHA) were able to attenuate the major toxic effects of 7KC, thus reinforcing the interest of natural compounds present in the Mediterranean diet to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Worldwide, this effluent is responsible for serious environmental issues. In Reunion Island, between 100 and 200 thousand tons of SDW are produced each year by the three local distilleries. In this study, the potential of  to reduce the pollution load of SDW and to produce interesting metabolites has been investigated.The fungal biomass yield was 35 g L corresponding to a yield of 0.47 g of biomass/g of vinasse without nutrient complementation. Analysis of sugar consumption indicated that mono-carbohydrates were initially released from residual polysaccharides and then gradually consumed until complete exhaustion. The high biomass yield likely arises from polysaccharides that are hydrolysed prior to be assimilated as monosaccharides and from organic acids and other complex compounds that provided additional C-sources for growth. Comparison of the size exclusion chromatography profiles of raw and pre-treated vinasse confirmed the conversion of humic- and/or phenolic-like molecules into protein-like metabolites. As a consequence, chemical  demand of vinasse decreased by 53%. Interestingly, analysis of intracellular lipids of the biomass revealed high content in  and physical properties relevant for biodiesel application.The soft-rot fungus  demonstrated a great ability to grow on vinasse and to degrade this complex and hostile medium. The high biomass production is accompanied by a utilization of carbon sources like residual carbohydrates, organic acids and more complex molecules such as melanoidins. We also showed that intracellular lipids from fungal biomass can efficiently be exploited into biodiesel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172044>Facile Synthesis of Ferric-Modified Phosphomolybdic  Composite Catalysts for Biodiesel Production with Response Surface Optimization.</a></h2><p>An attempt has been made to optimize the preparation of biodiesel from the transesterification of  with methanol over iron(III)-doped phosphomolybdic  (HPMo) catalysts. The prepared doped HPMo salts were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The detailed characterization results demonstrated that the doped HPMo salts have a strong interaction between the iron(III) ions and metal  cluster, well preserving a typical Keggin structure of heteropolyacids and possessing good thermal stability. The effect of esterification reaction parameters was investigated and optimized using single-factor experiments method in combination with response surface methodology (RSM). The doped catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity, affording the  conversion of 89.2% with single factor optimization and 95.1% with RSM. More importantly, the catalyst was simply separated by decantation and exhibited good stability, with the  conversion of 70.2% after three consecutive cycles. Besides, this catalyst can also catalyze the esterification of other free fatty acids. Therefore, the doped HPMo catalyst is a promising candidate for eco-friendly production of biodiesel in industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29117333> stimulation of motility of human extravillous trophoblast cells is mediated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity.</a></h2><p>Do fatty acids regulate development and motility of human extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs)? is a promising lipid molecule that has beneficial effects on motility and development of human EVTs.Fatty  uptake into trophoblast cells is important for maintaining cellular events during pregnancy, but the molecular mechanisms of action of various fatty acids, including trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, in EVT cell lines are not clear.Effects of , elaidic , palmitic  and stearic  on HTR8/SVneo cells were assessed in diverse assays in a dose- and time-dependent manner.Effects of fatty acids on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis (Annexin V expression, propidium iodide staining, TUNEL and invasion assays) of HTR8/SVneo cells were determined. Signal transduction pathways in HTR8/SVneo cells in response to fatty acids were determined by Western blot analyses. Regulation of fatty acids on oxidative conditions in EVTs were determined and validated by measurement of production of cellular reactive  species, intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+and lipid peroxidation assays.In present study, we confirmed different effects of  and elaidic  on migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis of the EVT cell line, HTR8/SVneo. We also investigated stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) to determine if its activity contributed to -induced migration of HTR8/SVneo cells. Next, we analyzed cell signaling molecules mediated by  and elaidic  treatment, including MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in HTR8/SVneo cells. We further established whether selective inhibition of signaling molecules altered the ability of fatty acids to cause changes in migration and proliferation of HTR8/SVneo cells. Last, we examined the regulatory effects of  and SCD1 on oxidative stress in HTR8/SVneo cells.N/A.The lack of in vivo animal studies is a major limitation of this research. Effectiveness of  to stimulate migration of human EVT cells requires further investigation.Our results suggest that  can play an important role in promoting invasion of human EVT cell lines while both trans fatty acids and saturated fatty acids are not conducive to normal placentation.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying elaidic ‑induced neuronal damage in vitro. The SH‑SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was used as a model in the present study. Following treatment of cells with various concentrations of elaidic  or with vehicle for 24 h, cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive  species (ROS) release were measured using flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was measured by Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining, and cellular redox status was determined using ELISA analysis. Furthermore, western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of factors associated with oxidative damage and components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways. The results demonstrated that elaidic  treatment inhibited cell viability, elevated cell apoptosis and resulted in a loss of MMP. In addition, elaidic  induced marked alterations in cellular redox status. Treatment with high doses of elaidic  treatment also enhanced the release of ROS, and upregulated lipid peroxide and malondialdehyde levels; however, it reduced superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Furthermore, elaidic  resulted in upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 and downregulation of heme oxygenase 1, which are two key antioxidative factors. Elaidic  treatment also induced or inhibited the expression of numerous ER stress/UPR‑associated molecules. It induced glucose‑regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expression, whereas the expression levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) were upregulated and then downregulated following treatment with various doses of elaidic . These results indicated that elaidic  inhibited SH‑SY5Y cell growth and induced apoptosis by enhancing oxidative stress and activating the ER stress/UPR signaling pathway and the GRP78/ATF4/CHOP pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218681>Graphene oxide nano-bio interaction induces inhibition of spermatogenesis and disturbance of fatty  metabolism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Graphene oxide (GO) has the potential for wide applications, which necessitates an intensive investigation of its potential hazard on human and environmental health. Even if previous studies show reproductive toxicity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the mechanisms of reproductive toxicity by GO are poorly understood. To understand the underlying mechanisms of GO-induced reproductive toxicity, we investigated the interaction between GO and C. elegans using Raman spectroscopy, sperm counts produced by spermatogenesis, progeny and analyzed the fatty  metabolism using molecular techniques. GO-characteristic Raman spectral bands measured throughout C. elegans, brood size and Hoecst staining of dissected gonads clearly showed GO accumulation in the reproductive organs, reduced progeny and low sperm counts, which are possibly direct results of the reproductive toxicity from GO exposure. Interestingly, reduced fatty  metabolites, such as stearic, , palmitoleic, and palmitic acids, were found with GO exposure. We found that GO increased intestinal fat accumulation in wild type N2, fat-5(tm420), and fat-7(wa36) mutants, whereas it decreased fat storage in the fat-6(tm331) and nhr-49(nr2041) mutants. GO exposure affected C. elegans fat accumulation and consumption, which was possibly regulated by daf-16 and nhr-80 gene activity. Also, GO exposure suppressed the survival of long-lived fat-5(tm420) mutants, whereas it increased the survival of short-lived nhr-49(nr2041) mutants. Hence, our studies collectively indicated that GO accumulation in reproductive organs, suppression of spermatogenesis, and the alteration of fatty  metabolism play critical roles in understanding mechanisms of toxicity in C. elegans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, many smart redox-sensitive nanocarriers have been developed to address this problem. However, due to significant tumor heterogeneity, some redox-sensitive nanomedicines still show poor selectivity in drug release. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a ROS-triggered prodrug nanoplatform fabricated with oxidation-responsive cabazitaxel (CTX) prodrugs for synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy, thioether-/selenoether-linked conjugates of CTX and  (OA). These prodrugs can be readily self-assembled into nanoparticles, with pyropheophorbide a (PPa) co-encapsulated into the prodrug-nanosystem for combination therapy. The dual-source ROS-responsive prodrug nanosystems selectively and rapidly release CTX not only in response to endogenous ROS overproduced in tumor cells, but also to exogenous PPa-generated ROS under laser irradiation. Moreover, the selenium-containing linkage demonstrates significant advantages over a sulfur-containing linkage in terms of ROS-triggered drug release and cytotoxicity. The prepared prodrug-nanosystems significantly prolong the systemic circulation and tumor distribution of both CTX and PPa, thereby demonstrating synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy in vivo. All these drug delivery advantages render the nanosystem extremely promising for cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30029553>Cytoprotective Activities of Milk Thistle Seed Oil Used in Traditional Tunisian Medicine on 7-Ketocholesterol and 24S-Hydroxycholesterol-Induced Toxicity on 158N Murine Oligodendrocytes.</a></h2><p>The Asteraceae family is economically very important, because many of these plants are grown mainly for their food value, such as lettuce (Lactuca), chicory (Cichorium), and sunflower (Heliantus aminus). One of the typical properties of this family, which includes milk thistle (), is the richness of the oil in various compounds (flavonoids, alkaloids, tocopherols, and unsaturated fatty acids). Currently, and for the coming decades, age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, are a major public health problem. Preventing their appearance or opposing their evolution is a major objective. In this context, the cytoprotective activities of milk thistle seed oil produced in Tunisia were studied on the 158N model using 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S) as cytotoxic agents. 7KC and 24S were used because they can be increased in the brain and body fluids of patients with major age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In order to evaluate the cytoprotective properties of milk thistle seed oil, complementary techniques of microscopy, flow cytometry, and biochemistry were used. The chemical composition of milk thistle seed oil has also been determined by various chromatography techniques. Milk thistle seed oils from different area of Tunisia are rich in tocopherols and are strongly antioxidant according to various biochemical tests (KRL (Kit Radicaux Libres), FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power), and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl)). The main fatty acids are linoleic  (C18:2 n-6) and  (C18:1 n-9). The main polyphenols identified are homovanillic , p-coumaric , quercetin, and apigenin, with a predominance of vanillic . On 158N cells, milk thistle seed oil attenuates the cytotoxicity of 7KC and 24S including: loss of cell adhesion, increased plasma membrane permeability, mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction of reactive  species, induction of apoptosis, and autophagy. The attenuation of the cytotoxicity of 7KC and 24S observed with the milk thistle seed oil is in the order of that observed with α-tocopherol used as a positive control. In the presence of nigella seed oil, considered potentially cytotoxic, no cytoprotective effects were observed. Given the chemical characteristics, antioxidant properties, and cytoprotective activities of milk thistle seed oil, our results highlight the potential benefit of this oil for human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28223501>Biosynthetic pathway of aliphatic formates via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation in mechanism present in astigmatid mites.</a></h2><p>Astigmatid mites depend on bioactive glandular secretions, pheromones, and defensive agents to mediate intra- and interspecies interactions. Aliphatic formates, such as (,)-8,11-heptadecadienyl formate (8,11-F17) and ()-8-heptadecenyl formate (8-F17), are rarely encountered natural products that are abundant in  sp. Sasagawa (Acari: Acaridae) mite secretions. Linoleic  and  are predicted as key intermediates in the synthesis of the closely related aliphatic formates. To gain insight in this biosynthetic pathway, acarid mite feeding experiments were conducted using C-labeled precursors to precisely track incorporation. Analyses using C NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the C-labeling pattern of the precursors was detectable on formates in exocrine secretions and likewise on fatty acids in total lipid pools. Curiously, the results demonstrated that the formates were biosynthesized without the dehomologation of corresponding fatty acids. Careful examination of the mass spectra from labeling experiments revealed that the carbonyl carbon of the formates is originally derived from the C-1 position of the fatty acids. Consistent with a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reaction, labeling studies support the insertion of an  atom between the carbonyl group and carbon chain. Empirical data support the existence of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase responsible for the catalyzation of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. The predicted existence of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase capable of converting aliphatic aldehydes to formates represents an exciting opportunity to expand the enzymatic toolbox available for controlled biochemical synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26138421>[Effects of mechanical ventilation with different tidal volumes on coagulation/fibrinolysis in rabbits with acute respiratory distress syndrome].</a></h2><p>To observe the effects of mechanical ventilation with different tidal volumes (VT) on coagulability and fibrinolytic characteristics in rabbits with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by two-hits with  (OA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Forty healthy adult male rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (8 rabbits in each group): sham operation group, model group, low VT group (6 mL/kg), rontine VT group (10 mL/kg ), high VT group (15 mL/kg). ARDS model was reproduced by sequential injection of 0.1 mL/kg OA and 500 μg/kg LPS via auricular vein, and the rabbits in sham operation group received normal saline in same volume. Mechanical ventilation was performed in different VT groups after model reproduction, and the end of the experiment was determined as 6 hours after LPS injection. Blood was collected from the carotid artery at 30 minutes and 360 minutes after LPS injection, with which arterial partial pressure of  (PaO2) was determined, and oxygenation index was calculated. Internal jugular vein blood was collected at 5, 120, 240, and 360 minutes after LPS injection, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (Fib) and antithrombin III (AT-III) were determined. The blood was collected at the end of the experiment, and then the rabbits were sacrificed, and serum levels of procollagen type III (PIIIP), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as well as PIIIP level in lung tissue were determined. The wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) of lung tissues was calculated.Compared with sham operation group, oxygenation index at both 30 minutes and 360 minutes were significantly decreased in model group, while W/D ratio was significantly increased. PT and APTT at 5 minutes were significantly shortened followed by a gradual increase. Fib and AT-III showed no change at 5 minutes followed by a gradual decrease, while serum PAI-1 and PIIIP as well as PIIIP in lung tissue were significantly increased. There was no significant difference in oxygenation index between all VT groups and model group, with a tendency to increase in low VT group. W/D ratio in low VT group was the lowest (5.09±0.19), and it was significantly lower than that of the model group (6.02±0.27, P<0.01), while it was the highest in high VT group (6.27±0.32).

Serum contents of PAI-1 and PIIIP as well as PIIIP in lung tissue were significantly lowered [ serum PAI-1 (ng/L): 1.14±0.26 vs. 1.63±0.91, serum PIIIP (ng/L): 1.62±0.52 vs. 2.91±0.64, lung PIIIP (ng/L): 4.40±0.58 vs. 5.75±0.47, all P<0.01]. The change tendency of all parameters in routine VT group was lower than that in low VT group, PT at 120 minutes and 360 minutes, APTT at 240 minutes and 360 minutes was significantly shorter than that in model group, and Fib at 120 minutes and 240 minutes were significantly higher than those in model group (all P<0.05). No significant difference was found in AT-III, serum PAI-1 and PIIIP as well as lung PIIIP as compared with model group. PT and APTT at 360 minutes in high VT group were significantly longer than those in model group, Fib at 360 minutes was significantly lower than that in model group, and lung PIIIP was significantly higher than that in model group.There are some important changes in coagulability which changes from a hyper state into a hypo coagulate state, while fibrinolysis is inhibited during the pathological process of ARDS produced by two-hit of OA and LPS. Mechanical ventilation with low VT can obviously improve coagulability and fibrinolytic status, while ventilation with routine VT has little effect on coagulability and fibrinolytic status. Mechanical ventilation with high VT, however, will greatly deteriorate the coagulability and fibrinolytic function in ARDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27107705>Caffeic -coated multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles for the treatment and bimodal imaging of tumours.</a></h2><p>Accurate theragnosis of tumour is essential for improving the life rate of tumour patients. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been used as both diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, their application is often limited because of a lack of water solubility, lack of cancer treatment efficacy, and ineffective targeting of tumour cells. In this report, a double ligand (caffeic -polyethylene glycol-folic ; FA-PEG-CA, caffeic -polyethylene glycol-pheophorbide-a; PheoA-PEG-CA) coated iron oxide nanoparticle has been fabricated that overcomes the limitations of conventional SPION. Photosensitizer and tumour targeting ligands were coated on SPION using a ligand-substitution method. We confirmed the successful substitution of  ligands with FA-PEG-CA and PheoA-PEG-CA ligands by FT-IR spectroscopy. The caffeic  coated iron oxide nanoparticles (CAMNPs) also demonstrated high water solubility in an aqueous environment and folate-mediated active tumour targeting. The water solubility of CAMNPs was evaluated by DLS measurement and TEM images. The cytotoxicity of CAMNPs increased two-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells at a laser irradiation condition. The fabricated CAMNPs retained their ability to function as both MRI diagnostic and tumour-selective therapeutic agents. These results suggest that these efficient characteristics of CAMNPs can be incorporated into applications, thus enhancing the efficacy of clinical cancer treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Lipokines are circulating lipid species that have recently been reported to affect metabolism in response to cold. Here, lipidomics analysis revealed that a bout of moderate-intensity exercise causes a pronounced increase in the circulating lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-diHOME) in male, female, young, old, sedentary, and active human subjects. In mice, both a single bout of exercise and exercise training increased circulating 12,13-diHOME and surgical removal of brown adipose tissue (BAT) negated the increase in 12,13-diHOME, suggesting that BAT is the tissue source for exercise-stimulated 12,13-diHOME. Acute 12,13-diHOME treatment of mice in vivo increased skeletal muscle fatty  uptake and oxidation, but not glucose uptake. These data reveal that lipokines are novel exercise-stimulated circulating factors that may contribute to the metabolic changes that occur with physical exercise.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to palmitic , unsaturated fatty acids produced significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both cell types. Increases were fatty  specific, dose-dependent and different for each cell type. The arachidonic  effects on [Ca2+]i were higher in spermatids than in spermatocytes and persisted when residual extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i originated from release of intracellular calcium stores. At the concentrations required for these increases, unsaturated fatty acids produced no significant changes in the plasma membrane potential of or non-specific permeability in spermatogenic cells. For the case of arachidonic , the [Ca2+]i increases were not caused by its metabolic conversion to eicosanoids or anandamide; thus we attribute this effect to the fatty  itself. As estimated with fluorescent probes, unsaturated fatty acids did not affect the intracellular pH but were able to induce a progressive decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The association of this decrease with reduced reactive  species (ROS) production strongly suggests that unsaturated fatty acids induced mitochondrial uncoupling. This effect was stronger in spermatids than in spermatocytes. As a late event, arachidonic  induced caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of external Ca2+. The concurrent but differential effects of unsaturated fatty acids on [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial functions are additional manifestations of the metabolic changes that germ cells undergo during their differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409663>Characterisation and attempted differentiation of European and extra-European olive oils using stable isotope ratio analysis.</a></h2><p>European law requires a designation of origin for virgin and extra virgin olive oils (at least in terms of EU/non-EU provenance). Stable isotope ratios have been successfully applied to determine the geographical origin of olive oils, but never to distinguish EU and non-EU oils. In this study H/H, C/C and O/O ratios were analysed in bulk olive oils using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) as well as C/C and H/H in the four main fatty acids (linoleic, , palmitic and stearic acids) using IRMS coupled with GC. The isotopic composition of olive oils was successfully used to distinguish samples originating in the two areas. Specifically, when bulk data were combined with fatty  isotopic data the differentiation power of the method improved clearly. This separation is due to the specific isotopic fingerprint of the individual countries making up the EU and non-EU samples.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Since mitochondrial-targeted anticancer therapy (mitocans) may be useful in breast cancer, we examined the effect of anacardic  on cellular bioenergetics and OXPHOS pathway proteins in breast cancer cells modeling progression to endocrine-independence: MCF-7 estrogen receptor α (ERα)+ endocrine-sensitive; LCC9 and LY2 ERα+, endocrine-resistant, and MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. At concentrations similar to cell proliferation IC50 s, anacardic  reduced ATP-linked  consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial reserve capacity, and coupling efficiency while increasing proton leak, reflecting mitochondrial toxicity which was greater in MCF-7 compared to endocrine-resistant and TNBC cells. These results suggest tolerance in endocrine-resistant and TNBC cells to mitochondrial stress induced by anacardic . Since anacardic  is an alkylated 2-hydroxybenzoic , the effects of salicylic  (SA, 2-hydroxybenzoic  moiety) and  (OA, monounsaturated alkyl moiety) were tested. SA inhibited whereas OA stimulated cell viability. In contrast to stimulation of basal OCR by anacardic  (uncoupling effect), neither SA nor OA altered basal OCR- except OA inhibited basal and ATP-linked OCR, and increased ECAR, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Changes in OXPHOS proteins correlated with changes in OCR. Overall, neither the 2-hydroxybenzoic  moiety nor the monounsaturated alky moiety of anacardic  is solely responsible for the observed mitochondria-targeted anticancer activity in breast cancer cells and hence both moieties are required in the same molecule for the observed effects.

Palmitic and  acids can induce steatosis in cultured hepatocytes. The aim of our study was to verify steatogenic and cytotoxic effects of palmitic  (PA),  (OA) and their combinations as well as their impact on functional capacity of rat primary hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to OA or PA (0.125-2 mmol/l) or their combination at ratios of 3:1, 2:1 or 1:1 at the final concentrations of 0.5-1 mmol/l. Both OA and PA caused a dose-dependent increase in triacylglycerol content in hepatocytes. PA was more steatogenic at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/l while OA at 0.75 and 1 mmol/l. PA exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect associated with ROS production, present markers of apoptosis and necrosis and a decrease in albumin production. OA induced a damage of the cytoplasmic membrane from 1 mM concentration. Mixture of OA and PA induced lower cytotoxicity with less weakened functional capacity than did PA alone. Extent of steatosis was comparable to that after exposure to OA alone. In conclusion, OA or combination of OA with PA is more suitable for simulation of simple steatosis than PA alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30461332>Toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) to THP-1 macrophages: interactions with saturated or unsaturated free fatty acids.</a></h2><p>In a biological microenvironment, free fatty acids (FFA) as ubiquitous biological molecules might interact with nanoparticles (NPs) and consequently change the toxicological responses. However, whether the chemical structures of FFA could influence their interactions with NPs remain unknown. This study investigated the interactions between ZnO NPs and saturated or unsaturated FFA (complexed to BSA), namely stearic  (SA, C18:0),  (OA, C18:1), and α-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3). It was shown that BSA, SA, OA, and ALA increased the atomic force microscope (AFM) heights as well the polydispersity index (PDI) of ZnO NPs. BSA modestly protected THP-1 macrophages from ZnO NP exposure, whereas OA and ALA led to relatively less cyto-protective effects of BSA. Moreover, only co-exposure to ZnO NPs and SA significantly promoted the release of interleukin-8. BSA, SA, OA, and ALA equally changed intracellular ROS and Zn ions associated with ZnO exposure, but co-exposure to ZnO NPs and OA/ALA particularly activated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis genes. In combination, these results showed that FFA could influence the colloidal aspects and toxicological signaling pathway of ZnO NPs, which is dependent on the number of unsaturated bonds of FFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590318>Ameliorative effect of Homalium zeylanicum against carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in rats.</a></h2><p>Objective is to evaluate the ameliorative effects of Homalium zeylanicum in carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in rats. To establish the nature of antioxidant principles in the bioactive ethyl acetate fractions of bark (HZEB) and leaf (HZEL);  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and cell-based antioxidant protection in erythrocytes (CAP-e) assays were performed. From acute toxicity study, HZEB and HZEL at 200 and 300 mg/kg b.w., were relatively safe at their effective doses. The degree of protection was measured by using biochemical parameters such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TB) and total protein (TP) contents. Hepatic markers e.g. thiobarbituric  reactive species (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were evaluated along with histopathological observations of liver tissues. Both fractions showed significant improvement in restoring SGOT, SGPT, ALP, TB and TP level. TBARS, SOD, CAT and GSH levels were significantly altered towards normal values. Both fractions at 300 mg/kg showed remarkable improvement in liver markers as compared to silymarin. Histopathological examinations showed reduction in hepatic necrosis and appeared normal hepatocellular architecture in HZEB and HZEL treated groups. In CAP-e assay, IC of HZEB (54.66 mg/mL) was higher than HZEL (60.88 mg/mL) and in ORAC assay, AUC of HZEB and HZEL were 33.46, 21.29 respectively and results were comparable with trolox. GC-MS and LC-MS analysis identified a total no. of 44 compounds. Few compounds were identified as bioactive compounds e.g. catechol (7.23%), tetraacetyl-d-xylonic nitrile (3%),  (0.49%), 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol (3.71%), 3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenol (0.31%), and conifer alcohol (7.41%). The presence of antioxidant principles in both fractions were responsible for hepatoprotective activities, however, the presence of catechol (7.23%) in the bark part imparted better activities in protecting liver than leaf of H. zeylanicum.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The imaging results agreed with earlier transmission electron microscopy studies that showed a 2 to 5 nm thick layer of AlO on all the Al surfaces. Spectral interpretations were guided by examination of the calculated transition energies, which agreed well with the spectroscopic measurements. Features observed in the experimental O and Al K-edge XAS were used to determine the chemical structure and phase of the AlO on the aluminum surfaces. For unprotected 18 and 100 nm Al nanoparticles, this analysis revealed an oxide layer that was similar to γ-AlO and comprised of both tetrahedral and octahedral Al coordination sites. For -protected Al nanoparticles, only tetrahedral Al oxide coordination sites were observed. The results were correlated to trends in the reactivity of the different materials, which suggests that the structures of different AlO layers have an important role in the accessibility of the underlying Al metal toward further oxidation. Combined, the Al K-edge XAS and STXM results provided detailed chemical information that was not obtained from powder X-ray diffraction or imaging from a transmission electron microscope.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30948926>Cx43 Inhibition Attenuates Sepsis-Induced Intestinal Injury via Downregulating ROS Transfer and the Activation of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Intestinal injury has long been considered to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of sepsis and has even been characterized as the "motor" of it. Thus, we explored the effects of connexin43 (Cx43) on sepsis-induced intestinal injury in order to provide potential therapeutic strategies. Rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models  and cell models (IEC-6 cells) pretreated with LPS  were used in the current study. Firstly, different methods, such as Cx43 inhibitors (18--GA and oleamide) or siRNA targeting Cx43 and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (a kind of ROS scavenger), were used to observe the effects of Cx43 channels mediating ROS transfer on intestinal injury. Secondly, the influence of ROS content on the activity of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway was explored through the application of NAC, sp600125 (a JNK1 inhibitor), and nicotinamide (a Sirt1 inhibitor). Finally, luciferase assays and ChIP were used to determine the direct regulation of FoxO3a on proapoptotic proteins, Bim and Puma. The results showed that sepsis-induced intestinal injury presented a dynamic change, coincident with the alternation of Cx43 expression. The inhibition of Cx43 attenuated CLP-induced intestinal injury  and LPS-induced IEC-6 injury . The changes of Cx43 channel function regulated ROS transfer between the neighboring cells, which mediated the activation of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway. FoxO3a directly affected its downstream target genes, Bim and Puma, which are responsible for cell or tissue apoptosis. In summary, our results suggest that Cx43 inhibition suppresses ROS transfer and inactivates the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway to protect against sepsis-induced intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30212593>Influence of  in different solvent media on BRL 3A cell growth and viability.</a></h2><p> (OA) is widely used in pathology studies of hepatocellular lipid deposition. Identifying the effects of different solvents on OA-induced liver lipid deposition would be beneficial for studies on hepatocytes. We treated BRL 3A cells with OA dissolved in different solvents. After 12 h incubation, cell viability was assessed using MTT assays. Reactive  species (ROS), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) counts, and the expression level of glucose regulated protein (GRP78), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1C) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were analyzed. Water, PBS and DMSO were disadvantageous to the dissolution of OA and did not cause an OA-induced response in hepatocytes. In the alcohol+OA-treated cells, the severe ER stress, oxidative stress and cellular fat deposition were significantly increased. BSA promoted cell growth and the cells treated with 1.2% BSA+OA showed a lower grade TG and endoplasmic reticulum stress compared with KOH+OA and alcohol+OA treatments. KOH had no significant influence on BRL 3A cells viability. When treated with OA dissolved in KOH, BRL 3A cells showed a typical hepatocyte damage. KOH was considered the suitable choice for an OA solvent for BRL 3A cells in hepatic lipidosis research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26033217>Support of Nerve Conduction by Respiring Myelin Sheath: Role of Connexons.</a></h2><p>Recently, we have demonstrated that myelin conducts an extramitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, hypothesizing a novel supportive role for myelin in favor of the axon. We have also hypothesized that the ATP produced in myelin could be transferred thought gap junctions. In this work, by biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological techniques, the existence of a connection among myelin to the axon was evaluated, to understand how ATP could be transferred from sheath to the axoplasm. Data confirm a functional expression of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated myelin. Moreover, WB and immunohistochemistry on optic nerve slices show that connexins 32 and 43 are present in myelin and colocalize with myelin basic protein. Interestingly, addition of carbenoxolone or oleamide, two gap junction blockers, causes a decrease in oxidative metabolism in purified myelin, but not in mitochondria. Similar effects were observed on conduction speed in hippocampal Schaffer collateral, in the presence of oleamide. Confocal analysis of optic nerve slices showed that lucifer yellow (that only passes through aqueous pores) signal was found in both the sheath layers and the axoplasma. In the presence of oleamide, but not with , signal significantly decreased in the sheath and was lost inside the axon. This suggests the existence of a link among myelin and axons. These results, while supporting the idea that ATP aerobically synthesized in myelin sheath could be transferred to the axoplasm through gap junctions, shed new light on the function of the sheath.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26489795>Appropriate conditions for applying NaOH-pretreated two-phase olive milling waste for codigestion with food waste to enhance biogas production.</a></h2><p>The high methane gas production potential of two phase olive milling waste (2POMW) makes its application to biogas plants in business an economical process to increase the productivity of the plants. The objective of this study was to investigate the appropriate conditions for the codigestion of NaOH-pretreated 2POMW with food waste. NaOH pretreatment can increase the methane production by increasing the soluble chemical  demand (sCOD), but it may cause inhibition because of higher levels of alkalinity, sodium ion, volatile fatty acids and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Therefore, the first experimental phase of this study aimed to investigate the effect of different mixing ratios of 2POMW to food waste. A continuous stirred tank reactor experiment with different mixing ratios of 3%, 4.3%, 5.7% and 8.3% (2POMW: food waste) was conducted. NaOH pretreatment in the range of 6-20% was used. A mixing ratio up to 4.3%, when 10% NaOH pretreatment was used, caused no inhibition and increased methane production by 445.9mL/g-VS(2POMW). For this mixing ratio an additional experimental phase was conducted with the 20% NaOH pretreatment as the 20% NaOH pretreatment had the highest sCOD. The methane gas production was increased by 503.6mL/g-VS(2POMW). However, pH adjustment was required for applying this concentration of the high alkalinity 20% NaOH-pretreated 2POMW. Therefore, we consider using 10% NaOH pretreatment in a mixing ratio of 4.3% to be more applicable. The increase in methane gas production was correlated to the  concentration inside the reactors. The high  concentration of 61.8mg/L for the 8.3% mixing ratio was responsible for the strong inhibition. This study showed that adjusting the appropriate mixing ratio of the NaOH-pretreated 2POMW could increase the electricity production of a reactor that regularly receives food waste.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The extraction yield of betacyanins was optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal PHWE conditions were attained and the actual yields of betacyanins under optimal conditions were well matched with the predicted yields. In addition, betacyanin pigment compositions as well as superoxide anion scavenging activity of individual betacyanins extract (BE) produced in optimal PHWE conditions were characterized by HPLC-ESI/MS and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of three BEs on -induced steatohepatitis in cellular model was comparatively investigated. The results showed that unlike PFP, RBS, and CPP presented excellent efficacy in decreasing intracellular triglyceride and reactive  species, inhibiting the release of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase as well as regulating fatty  synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 mRNAs expression. Practical applications In this study, PHWE, is firstly proposed for the enhancement of the extraction of betacyanins from three agricultural by-products. Betacyanin-rich extracts by PHWE method exhibit excellent activities in inhibition of ROS and regulation of lipid metabolism in hepatic cells. It suggests that PHWE has a strong potentiality in keeping bioactivity of BEs, which is significant for the production of betacyanins functional foods.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430456>Pinolenic  ameliorates -induced lipogenesis and oxidative stress via AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Pinolenic  (PLA), a natural compound isolated from pine nut oil, has been reported to exert bioactivity against lipid anabolism. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms still poorly elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of PLA on  (OA)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and their relationship with the lipid metabolic regulation. The results demonstrated that treatment with PLA dramatically inhibited lipid accumulation, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory responses induced by  in HepG2 cells. PLA also obviously decreased the levels of cellular triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive  species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). As well as PLA stilled promoted the antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Furthermore, PLA could increase the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) to alleviate oxidative damage. It also could reduce lipogenesis-related transcription factors expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). PLA treatment resulted in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression. However, pretreatment with compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) inhibited the effect of PLA on promoting the expression of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PPARα for lipolysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PLA possessed the potential to prevent lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cells via upregulating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, which supported the development of new drug candidate against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome, plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are increased. Several NEFA are deleterious to cells, activate Toll-like receptors and inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase, causing lung injury. A Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil is beneficial. The main component of olive oil is omega-9  (OA), a monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA). We analyzed the effect of OA supplementation on sepsis. OA ameliorated clinical symptoms, increased the survival rate, prevented liver and kidney injury and decreased NEFA plasma levels in mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). OA did not alter food intake and weight gain but diminished reactive  species (ROS) production and NEFA plasma levels. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (CPT1A) mRNA levels were increased, while uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) liver expression was enhanced in mice treated with OA. OA also inhibited the decrease in 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression and increased the enzyme expression in the liver of OA-treated mice compared to septic animals. We showed that OA pretreatment decreased NEFA concentration and increased CPT1A and UCP2 and AMPK levels, decreasing ROS production. We suggest that OA has a beneficial role in sepsis by decreasing metabolic dysfunction, supporting the benefits of diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081527>The Protection Potential of Antioxidant Vitamins Against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: a Rat Trial.</a></h2><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a fatal disease that includes inflammation formed by septic and non-septic causes. Reactive  radicals (ROS) play a key role in ARDS pathophysiology and constitute the base of damage process. Antioxidant vitamins are used for inhibiting hazardous effects of radicals. Therefore, effects of antioxidant vitamins such as α-lipoic  (ALA), vitamin E (VITE), and C (VITC) were investigated on  (OA)-induced ARDS rat model. Furthermore, high and low dose of methylprednisolone (HDMP, LDMP) was used for comparing effects of the vitamins. In this study, 42 male rats were divided to seven groups named control, OA, ALA, VITE, VITC, LDMP, and HDMP. OA was intravenously administered to all groups except control group and other compounds were orally administered (ALA, VITE, and VITC: 100 mg/kg, LDMP: 5 mg/kg, HDMP: 50 mg/kg) after OA injections. OA increased MDA level in lung tissue and TNF-α and IL-1β cytokine levels in serum. ALA, VITE, VITC, and both dose of MP significantly decreased the cytokine levels. Although OA reduced SOD, CAT, and GSH levels in lung tissue, the vitamins and LDMP markedly enhanced the levels except for HDMP. Furthermore, OA showed thickening in bronchi and alveolar septum, hyperemia in vessels, and inflammatory cell infiltrations in lung tissue histopathological examinations. Antioxidant vitamins may be useful for premedication of ARDS and similar disorders.

Fatty  oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive  species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to  was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive  species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage.

The yield and purity of SLs are two important factors to be considered during their commercial large-scale production. Notably, SL accumulation causes an increase in viscosity, decrease in dissolved  and product inhibition in the fermentation medium. This inhibits the further production and purification of SLs. This describes the development of a novel integrated system for SL production using Candida albicans O-13-1. Semicontinuous fermentation was performed using a novel bioreactor with dual ventilation pipes and dual sieve-plates (DVDSB). SLs were separated and recovered using a newly designed two-stage separation system. After SL recovery, the fermentation broth containing residual glucose and  was recycled back into the bioreactor. This novel approach considerably alleviated the problem of product inhibition and accelerated the rate of substrate utilization. Production of SLs achieved was 477 g l , while their productivity was 1.59 g l  h . Purity of SLs improved by 23.3%, from 60% to 74%, using DVDSB with the separation system. The conversion rate of carbon source increased from 0.5 g g (in the batch fermentation) to 0.6 g g .

Daphnetin (DAP) possesses notable antioxidative, anti‑inflammatory and anticoagulant activities; DAP is an active ingredient extracted from Daphne Koreana Nakai. To investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of DAP on NAFLD, we treated HepG2 cells with  (OA) and DAP simultaneously and non‑simultaneously. In the simultaneous treatment condition, HepG2 cells were co‑treated with 0.5 mM OA and DAP (5, 20, and 50 µM) for 24 h. In the non‑simultaneous treatment conditions, HepG2 cells were pretreated with 0.5 mM OA for 24 h, and then treated with DAP (5, 20 and 50 µM) for 24 h. Following the aforementioned treatments, the biochemical indexes associated with NAFLD were measured as follows: i) The intracellular contents of triglyceride (TG), reactive  species (ROS) and fluorescent glucose 2‑[N‑(7‑nitrobenz‑2‑oxa‑1,3‑diazol‑4‑yl) amino]‑2‑deoxyglucose were analyzed with corresponding detection kits; and ii) the cellular expression levels of glycolipid metabolism‑ and oxidative stress‑related genes, including 5'AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1C (SREBP‑1C), patatin‑like phospholipase domain‑containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor α (PPARα), phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor‑like 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and CYP4A were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results revealed the potential mechanism underlying the effects of DAP on NAFLD in vitro: i) By increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK, DAP inhibited the expression of SREBP‑1C and PNPLA3, and induced that of PPARα. Lipid accumulation within hepatocytes was reduced; ii) by upregulating PI3K expression and pAKT/AKT levels, DAP may alleviate insulin resistance and promote hepatocellular glucose uptake; and iii) by upregulating the expression of Nrf2, DAP downregulated the expression of CYP2E1 and CYP4A, and the levels of reactive  species in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and Liver Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked  consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26598510>Nitrated fatty acids suppress angiotensin II-mediated fibrotic remodelling and atrial fibrillation.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrosis, one of the most striking features in the pathology of atrial fibrillation (AF), is promoted by local and systemic inflammation. Electrophilic fatty  nitroalkenes, endogenously generated by both metabolic and inflammatory reactions, are anti-inflammatory mediators that in synthetic form may be useful as drug candidates. Herein we investigate whether an exemplary nitro-fatty  can limit atrial fibrosis and AF.Wild-type C57BL6/J mice were treated for 2 weeks with angiotensin II (AngII) and vehicle or nitro- (10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic , OA-NO2, 6 mg/kg body weight) via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps. OA-NO2 significantly inhibited atrial fibrosis and depressed vulnerability for AF during right atrial electrophysiological stimulation to levels observed for AngII-naive animals. Left atrial epicardial mapping studies demonstrated preservation of conduction homogeneity by OA-NO2. The protection from fibrotic remodelling was mediated by suppression of Smad2-dependent myofibroblast transdifferentiation and inhibition of Nox2-dependent atrial superoxide formation.OA-NO2 potently inhibits atrial fibrosis and subsequent AF.

The present study aims to compare the difference in pathology, blood gas values and biomarkers of two acute lung injury rat models at different time intervals. In the experiment, rats were randomly divided into three groups: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group,  (OA) group and control group. Changes of pathology, blood gas values and blood-air barrier biomarkers were analyzed at 15 minutes, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after injection. The results showed that the two models exhibited different features. Compared with the LPS rats, OA rats exhibited significantly severe pathological changes, lower arterial  partial pressure (PaO2) value and higher level of injury biomarkers. However, LPS rats boasted greater lactic  (LAC) level and more severe acidosis than OA rats. This study suggests that LPS-induced model has greater value in researches on microcirculation dysfunction and sepsis resulting from ALI, while OA-induced model has greater repeatability in area of gas exchanging after ALI. These events may provide a new theoretical evidence for the model establishment of ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535840>Visible Light-Activated Self-Recovery Hydrophobic CeO/Black TiO Coating Prepared Using Air Plasma Spraying.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobic coatings are widely used in many areas from home to industry. However, the hydrophobicity can be easily degraded by adsorption of the atmospheric contaminations. In this study, a novel CeO/black TiO hydrophobic coating with self-recovery capability is prepared using air plasma spraying without any chemical modification. The water contact angles (WCAs) of the coatings decreased after  contamination. Because of the presence of black TiO, the composite coating has the photodegradation property under irradiation of visible light, and the part of the black TiO transforms to be superhydrophilic after irradiation for the generation of the surface  vacancies. The  was decomposed and the WCAs changed depending on the volume percentage of the CeO. The coating exhibits hydrophilicity when the volume percentage of the CeO is less than 60%, and hydrophobic when higher. After storage in a dark and clean environment, all the coatings can recover their hydrophobicity for the black TiO that returned back to its origin state. It is believed that this hydrophobic self-cleaning ceramic coating should have potential in engineering applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737815>Isofraxidin, a coumarin component improves high-fat diet induced hepatic lipid homeostasis disorder and macrophage inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Isofraxidin (IF) is a coumarin compound produced in the functional foods Siberian ginseng and Apium graveolens. The first objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects and putative methods of IF in combating lipotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.  was used to induce lipid turbulence in human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Alterations in triglyceride metabolism, inflammation and oxidative status were monitored. Results show that IF mainly reduced triglyceride accumulation, TNF-α release and ROS activation in metabolic disordered cells. Next, a high-fat diet, which induced a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, was used to evaluate the therapeutic action of IF. Our results show that treatment with IF significantly inhibited the high-fat diet-induced elevation in body weight, liver weight, lipid metabolism (TG, TC and HDL-C) and hepatic injury in mice. In biochemical terms, treatment with IF resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC, as well as reduced hepatic expression of FAS and HMGC, suggesting that lipogenesis was compromised. We also found robust evidence that treatment with IF significantly depleted infiltrating inflammatory cells (F4/80 Kupffer cells and CD68 macrophages) and inflammatory cytokine release (TNFα and IL-6). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity in IF-treated hepatic tissue correlated with down-regulation of TLR4 expression and NF-κB transcription. In sum, these results suggest that IF might play a protective role against lipid metabolism disorder induced by a high-fat diet via inhibition of lipid production and inflammation in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27545328>Nitro- ameliorates  and glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation triggered oxidative stress in renal tubular cells via activation of Nrf2 and suppression of NADPH oxidase.</a></h2><p>Nitroalkene derivative of  (OA-NO), due to its ability to mediate revisable Michael addition, has been demonstrated to have various biological properties and become a therapeutic agent in various diseases. Though its antioxidant properties have been reported in different models of acute kidney injury (AKI), the mechanism by which OA-NO attenuates intracellular oxidative stress is not well investigated. Here, we elucidated the anti-oxidative mechanism of OA-NO in an in vitro model of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Human tubular epithelial cells were subjected to  and glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) injury. Pretreatment with OA-NO (1.25 μM, 45 min) attenuated OGD/R triggered reactive  species (ROS) generation and subsequent mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. This action was mediated via up-regulating endogenous antioxidant defense components including superoxide dismutase (SOD1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and γ-glutamyl cysteine ligase modulatory subunits (GCLM). Moreover, subcellular fractionation analyses demonstrated that OA-NO promoted nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2- related factor-2 (Nrf2) and Nrf2 siRNA partially abrogated these protective effects. In addition, OA-NO inhibited NADPH oxidase activation and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) and p22 up-regulation after OGD/R injury, which was not relevant to Nrf2. These results contribute to clarify that the mechanism of OA-NO reno-protection involves both inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity and induction of SOD1, Nrf2-dependent HO-1, and GCLM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29185131>Nimbolide attenuate the lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and antioxidant in primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Nimbolide is a bioactive compound found in Azadirachta indica. This work was devised to investigate the potential effects of nimbolide on intracellular lipid deposition and its associated redox modulation in primary hepatocytes (Heps). Lipid accumulation was induced in Heps by supplementing 1 mM  for 24 h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipids. The results demonstrated that nimbolide can decrease intracellular cholesterol, free fatty acids and triglycerides. Nimbolide may also improve hepatocytes function through its antioxidant effects by inhibiting oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation by curtailing the reactive  species levels. Further it also restore the mitochondrial potential, improving the endogenous antioxidant levels such as GSH and antioxidant enzyme activities. Nimbolide increased (P < 0.05) liver X receptor-α (LXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) gene expression in Heps. The biological significance of nimbolide may involve hypolipidemic effect, lipid peroxidation inhibition, DNA damage inhibition, ROS inhibition, restoring mitochondrial function, increases in GSH and SOD & CAT activities, and direct regulation of LXRα, PPARγ and SREBP1c gene expression. Nimbolide may be used as effective lipid lowering compound and lipid deposition-induced Heps changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30513370>Oleate increase neutral lipid accumulation, cellular respiration and rescues palmitate-exposed GLP-1 secreting cells by reducing ceramide-induced ROS.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs), and especially monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) stimulate GLP-1 release. However, lipotoxicity is indicated in GLP-1 secreting cells following long-term exposure to elevated levels of saturated FAs (SFAs) in vivo and in vitro, where in vitro studies indicate that cosupplementation with MUFAs confers lipoprotection. SFAs and MUFAs differentially affect the fate of cells in ways that depend on the cell type, concentration and ratio of the FAs. The present study was designed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of SFAs/MUFAs on GLP-1-producing cells in terms of lipotoxicity/lipoprotection and GLP-1 secretion.Cultured GLP-1 secreting cells were exposed to hyperlipidemia simulated by SFA-albumin complexes where the molar ratio was 2:1. The cellular response to simulated hyperlipidemia was assessed in the presence/absence of MUFA cosupplementation by determining intracellular ceramide, ROS, neutral lipid accumulation, and cellular respiration. The role for cellular respiration in GLP-1 secretion in response to SFAs/MUFAs was assessed.Generation of intracellular ceramide mediate a detrimental increased in ROS production following long term exposure to SFAs in GLP-1-secreting cells. Cosupplementation with MUFAs increases cellular respiration, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of ceramide kinase, while reducing ceramide synthesis and attenuating ROS production, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Further, acute secretory effects of unsaturated FAs are independent of FAO, but mediated by a FFAR1 induced increase in cellular respiration.This study demonstrates novel data supporting effects of MUFAs on the ceramide biosynthetic pathway, triglyceride storage respiration and secretion in GLP-1 secreting cells. These findings may be of value for nutritional interventions, as well as for identification of novel targets, to help preserve L-cell mass and potentiate GLP-1 secretion in diabesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The use of this effluent as a low-cost alternative cultivation medium for microalgae could represent a viable supplementary treatment. We cultivated 11 microalgae species with potential use for biodiesel production to assess their growth capacities in biodiesel industrial washing waters. Only Monoraphidium contortum, Ankistrodesmus sp., Chlorococcum sp., and one unidentified Chlorophyceae species grew effectively in that effluent. M. contortum showed the highest growth capacity and had the second highest fatty  content (267.9 mg g of DW), predominantly producing palmitic (20.9%), 7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic (14%),  (16.2%), linoleic (10.5%), and linolenic acids (23.2%). In the second phase of the experiment, the microalgae were cultivated in biodiesel wash water at 75% of its initial concentration as well as in WC (control) medium. After 21 days of cultivation, 25.8 and 7.2% of the effluent nitrate and phosphate were removed, respectively, and the chemical  demand was diminished by 31.2%. These results suggest the possibility of cultivating biodiesel producing microalgae in industrial wash water effluents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29764547>[Comparison of lung protection for hydrochloric  or  induced rat acute respiratory distress syndrome models pretreated with penehyclidine].</a></h2><p>To compare the lung protection roles of intraperitoneal pre-injection with penehyclidine for two kinds of rat models with pulmonary and extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDSp and ARDSexp).Forty healthy adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups (each n = 8): the rats in sham group received only tracheotomy; the ARDS rat models were reproduced by intratracheal inhalation of 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric  (HCl) 2 mL/kg to simulate ARDSexp (HCl group) and 0.15 mL/kg  (OA) intravenous injection to simulate ARDSp (OA group) after tracheotomy; and the rats in two intervention groups were intraperitoneal injected with penehyclidine 0.5 mg/kg. All rats were received mechanical ventilation immediately after model reproduction. Carotid arterial blood was collected 4 hours after model reproduction for determining the arterial partial pressure of  (PaO), and oxygenation index (PaO/FiO) was calculated. Carotid venous blood and lung tissues were harvested, and the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in serum and lung tissue were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pulmonary pathology was observed under optical microscope, and pathological score of Smith was calculated.Under optical microscope, a large number of inflammatory cells infiltration in lung tissue, obvious alveolar collapse, fibrous exudation in alveolar and alveolar hyaline were found in HCl group. In OA group, however, microvascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema were the main pathological changes, with alveolar structure being kept relatively intact. Compared with sham group, pathological score of Smith in HCl and OA groups were increased, oxygenation was lowered, and inflammatory factors levels in serum and lung tissue were increased with levels in lung tissue being higher than those in serum, without significant difference between the two models. When pretreated with penehyclidine, however, pathological injury induced by HCl or OA was alleviated, and pathological score of Smith was also decreased as compared with that of corresponding model groups (5.48±1.76 vs. 9.69±2.02, 3.97±2.14 vs. 8.71±2.18, both P < 0.05), PaO/FiO was raised significantly [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 323±55 vs. 211±27, 307±56 vs. 207±31, both P < 0.05], the inflammatory factors levels in serum and lung tissue were obviously decreased [MPO (μg/L): 11.91±1.55 vs. 14.82±1.25, 12.75±1.16 vs. 16.97±2.06 in serum, 25.80±3.36 vs. 35.18±4.01, 24.23±1.24 vs. 33.94±1.43 in lung tissue; IL-8 (ng/L): 358±30 vs. 459±25, 377±38 vs. 427±34 in serum, 736±53 vs. 866±51, 701±53 vs. 809±39 in lung tissue; NF-κB (ng/L): 483±68 vs. 632±73, 514±83 vs. 685±78 in serum, 984±75 vs. 1 217±123, 944±90 vs. 1 163±105 in lung tissue; all P < 0.05]. But all parameters above were similar between the two pretreatment groups (all P > 0.05).Inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar collapse mainly happened in HCl induced ARDSp, while pulmonary interstitial edema and hemorrhage was mostly seen in ARDSexp rats induced by OA intravenous injection. There was no significant difference in oxygenation and inflammatory response between the two models of rats. Pre-intraperitoneal injection of penehyclidine equally improved oxygenation state, inhibited lung inflammation response, and reduced lung injury in the two kinds of ARDS, but there was no difference in protective role between two models pretreated with penehyclidine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27340432>Enhanced lipid production by Rhodosporidium toruloides using different fed-batch feeding strategies with lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the sole carbon source.</a></h2><p>Industrial biotechnology that is able to provide environmentally friendly bio-based products has attracted more attention in replacing petroleum-based industries. Currently, most of the carbon sources used for fermentation-based bioprocesses are obtained from agricultural commodities that are used as foodstuff for human beings. Lignocellulose-derived sugars as the non-food, green, and sustainable alternative carbon sources have great potential to avoid this dilemma for producing the renewable, bio-based hydrocarbon fuel precursors, such as microbial lipid. Efficient bioconversion of lignocellulose-based sugars into lipids is one of the critical parameters for industrial application. Therefore, the fed-batch cultivation, which is a common method used in industrial applications, was investigated to achieve a high cell density culture along with high lipid yield and productivity.In this study, several fed-batch strategies were explored to improve lipid production using lignocellulosic hydrolysates derived from corn stover. Compared to the batch culture giving a lipid yield of 0.19 g/g, the dissolved--stat feeding mode increased the lipid yield to 0.23 g/g and the lipid productivity to 0.33 g/L/h. The pulse feeding mode further improved lipid productivity to 0.35 g/L/h and the yield to 0.24 g/g. However, the highest lipid yield (0.29 g/g) and productivity (0.4 g/L/h) were achieved using an automated online sugar control feeding mode, which gave a dry cell weight of 54 g/L and lipid content of 59 % (w/w). The major fatty acids of the lipid derived from lignocellulosic hydrolysates were predominately palmitic  and , which are similar to those of conventional oilseed plants.Our results suggest that the fed-batch feeding strategy can strongly influence the lipid production. The online sugar control feeding mode was the most appealing strategy for high cell density, lipid yield, and lipid productivity using lignocellulosic hydrolysates as the sole carbon source.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732887>Fatty  levels alterations in THP-1 macrophages cultured with lead (Pb).</a></h2><p>As cardiovascular events are one of the main causes of death in developed countries, each factor potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease deserves special attention. One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on lipid metabolism, and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0), palmitic  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1),  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic  (C18:3n6), arachidonic  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive  species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of  (OA) or palmitic  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive  species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of mitochondria, immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results of the present study may provide novel insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer types with IDH mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29459509>Study of Trans Fatty  Formation in Oil by Heating Using Model Compounds.</a></h2><p>The intake of trans fatty acids (TFAs) in foods changes the ratio of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in blood, which causes cardiovascular disease. TFAs are formed by trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The most recognized formation mechanisms of TFAs are hydrogenation of liquid oil to form partially hydrogenated oil (PHO,) and biohydrogenation of UFAs to form TFA in ruminants. Heating oil also forms TFAs; however, the mechanism of formation, and the TFA isomers formed have not been well investigated. In this study, the trans isomerization mechanism of unsaturated fatty  formation by heating was examined using the model compounds , trioleate, linoleic , and trilinoleate for liquid plant oil. The formation of TFAs was found to be suppressed by the addition of an antioxidant and argon gas. Furthermore, the quantity of formed TFAs correlated with the quantity of formed polymer in trioleate heated with air and . These results suggest that radical reactions form TFAs from UFAs by heating. Furthermore, trans isomerization by heating  and linoleic  did not change the original double bond positions. Therefore, the distribution of TFA isomers formed was very simple. In contrast, the mixtures of TFA isomers formed from PHO and ruminant UFAs are complicated because migration of double bonds occurs during hydrogenation and biohydrogenation. These findings suggest that trans isomerization by heating is executed by a completely different mechanism than in hydrogenation and biohydrogenation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27483795>Bio-Diesel Production from Deoxygenation Reaction Over Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 Supported Transition Metal (Ni, Cu, Co, and Mo) Catalysts.</a></h2><p>Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 supported transition metal (Me = Ni, Cu, Co, and Mo) catalysts have been investigated to screen for the catalytic activity and selectivity for deoxygenation reaction of .

However, these reduction-responsive nanocarriers are generally trapped within endolysosomes after internalization and are subjected to unwanted disintegration, remarkably compromising the therapeutic performance. Herein, amphiphilic polyprodrugs of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-EoS)-b-PCPTM were synthesized via sequential reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, where EoS and CPTM are Eosin Y- and camptothecin (CPT)-based monomers, respectively. An oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion method was applied to self-assemble the amphiphilic polyprodrugs into hybrid vesicles in the presence of hydrophobic  (OA)-stabilized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, NaYF:Yb/Er), rendering it possible to activate the EoS photosensitizer under a near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation with the generation of singlet  (O) through the energy transfer between UCNPs and EoS moieties. Notably, the in situ generated singlet  (O) can not only exert its photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect but also disrupt the membranes of endolysosomes and thus facilitate the endosomal escape of internalized nanocarriers (i.e., photochemical internalization (PCI)). Cell experiments revealed that the hybrid vesicles could be facilely taken up by endocytosis. Although the internalized hybrid vesicles were initially trapped within endolysosomes, a remarkable endosomal escape into the cytoplasm was observed under 980 nm laser irradiation as a result of the PCI effect of O. The escaped hybrid vesicles subsequently underwent GSH-triggered CPT release in the cytosol, thereby activating the chemotherapy process. The integration of PDT module into the design of reduction-responsive nanocarriers provides a feasible approach to enhance the therapeutic performance.</p></html>
