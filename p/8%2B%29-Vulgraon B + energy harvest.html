Herein we report how doping of a small quantity of formamidinium and/or chloride ion influences the single and multiexciton dynamics of CsPbI nanocrystals (NCs). With the help of ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopic measurements, we show that chloride doping can enhance the biexciton lifetime of the system significantly by slowing down the Auger recombination (AR) process. The measured biexciton AR time scale (∼195-205 ps) in some of these NCs is the longest among those reported to date for any similar size perovskites. We further demonstrate that suppression of the AR rate and consequent lengthening of biexciton lifetime allow  of these species for their utilization through rapid (18-45 ps) electron transfer to fullerene. The insights obtained from this study are expected to help design more efficient doped perovskites for  conversion purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25939034>Diatom milking: a review and new approaches.</a></h2><p>The rise of human populations and the growth of cities contribute to the depletion of natural resources, increase their cost, and create potential climatic changes. To overcome difficulties in supplying populations and reducing the resource cost, a search for alternative pharmaceutical, nanotechnology, and  sources has begun. Among the alternative sources, microalgae are the most promising because they use carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce biomass and/or valuable compounds. Once produced, the biomass is ordinarily harvested and processed (downstream program). Drying, grinding, and extraction steps are destructive to the microalgal biomass that then needs to be renewed. The extraction and purification processes generate organic wastes and require substantial  inputs. Altogether, it is urgent to develop alternative downstream processes. Among the possibilities, milking invokes the concept that the extraction should not kill the algal cells. Therefore, it does not require growing the algae anew. In this review, we discuss research on milking of diatoms. The main themes are (a) development of alternative methods to extract and  high added value compounds; () design of photobioreactors.(c) biodiversity and (d) stress physiology, illustrated with original results dealing with oleaginous diatoms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29494561>A Trust-Based Secure Routing Scheme Using the Traceback Approach for -Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks.</a></h2><p>The Internet of things (IoT) is composed of billions of sensing devices that are subject to threats stemming from increasing reliance on communications technologies. A Trust-Based Secure Routing (TBSR) scheme using the traceback approach is proposed to improve the security of data routing and maximize the use of available  in -Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EHWSNs). The main contributions of a TBSR are (a) the source nodes send data and notification to sinks through disjoint paths, separately; in such a mechanism, the data and notification can be verified independently to ensure their security. () Furthermore, the data and notification adopt a dynamic probability of marking and logging approach during the routing. Therefore, when attacked, the network will adopt the traceback approach to locate and clear malicious nodes to ensure security. The probability of marking is determined based on the level of battery remaining; when nodes  more , the probability of marking is higher, which can improve network security. Because if the probability of marking is higher, the number of marked nodes on the data packet routing path will be more, and the sink will be more likely to trace back the data packet routing path and find malicious nodes according to this notification. When data packets are routed again, they tend to bypass these malicious nodes, which make the success rate of routing higher and lead to improved network security. When the battery level is low, the probability of marking will be decreased, which is able to save . For logging, when the battery level is high, the network adopts a larger probability of marking and smaller probability of logging to transmit notification to the sink, which can reserve enough storage space to meet the storage demand for the period of the battery on low level; when the battery level is low, increasing the probability of logging can reduce  consumption. After the level of battery remaining is high enough, nodes then send the notification which was logged before to the sink. Compared with past solutions, our results indicate that the performance of the TBSR scheme has been improved comprehensively; it can effectively increase the quantity of notification received by the sink by 20%, increase  efficiency by 11%, reduce the maximum storage capacity needed by nodes by 33.3% and improve the success rate of routing by approximately 16.30%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25607663>Dewatering as a non-toxic control of nuisance midge larvae in algal wastewater treatment floways.</a></h2><p>Attached-algae floways have tremendous potential for use in wastewater treatment because natural algal communities show high nutrient removal efficiencies, have low operating costs, and are easy to maintain. Algal wastewater floways may also serve as a sustainable option for producing renewable  because algae grow rapidly, are easily harvested, and can serve as a source of biomass for biofuel. However, pests such as chironomids (Diptera) colonize open channel periphyton floways and their larvae damage the biofilms. While pesticides can control midge larvae, little information is known about alternative, non-toxic controls. This study examined the effectiveness of periodic, short-term dewatering (4 hours every 9 days) on midge abundance and periphyton growth in 16 recirculating, outdoor floways (3 m long, 0.1 m wide). We compared midge abundance and algal accumulation (chlorophyll a, , c, and pheophytin) among control (n=8) and dewatered (n=8) floways filled with secondarily treated wastewater (27 days, 10 hours of daylight). Dewatered flumes had 42% fewer midges and 28-49% lower algal productivity (as measured by chlorophyll a, , c, and pheophytin pigments). Chlorophyll a production rates averaged (±1 SD) 0.5±0.2 μg/cm2/day in control floways compared to 0.3±0.1 μg/cm2/day dewatered floways. Short-term dewatering effectively reduced midges but also damaged periphyton. To maximize the recovery of periphyton biomass, operators should  periphyton from floways during dewatering events before periphyton is damaged by desiccation or direct exposure to sunlight.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28476597>Hydration-induced crystalline transformation of starch polymer under ambient conditions.</a></h2><p>With synchrotron small/wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), we revealed that post- hydration at ambient conditions can further alter the starch crystalline structure. The hydration process induced the alignment of starch helices into crystalline lamellae, irrespective of the starch type (A- or -). In this process, non-crystalline helices were probably packed with water molecules to form new crystal units, thereby enhancing the overall concentration of starch crystallinity. In particular, a fraction of the monoclinic crystal units of the A-type starches encapsulated water molecules during hydration, leading to the outward movement of starch helices. Such movement resulted in the transformation of monoclinic units into hexagonal units, which was associated with the -type crystallites. Hence, the hydration under ambient conditions could enhance the -polymorphic features for both A-type and -type starches. The new knowledge obtained here may guide the design of biopolymer-based liquid crystal materials with controlled lattice regularity and demanded features.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier .V.

It is intriguing to discover if this departure from single chromophore architecture is singular or if it has been adopted by other microbial rhodopsins. In search of other cases, retinal protein encoding genes in numerous bacteria have been identified containing sequences corresponding to carotenoid binding sites like that in XR. Gloeobacter rhodopsin (GR), exhibiting particularly close homology to XR, has been shown to attach SX, and fluorescence measurements suggest SX can function as a light harvesting (LH) antenna in GR as well. In this study, we test this suggestion in real time using ultrafast transient absorption. Results show that  transfer indeed occurs from S2 of SX to retinal in the GR-SX composite with an efficiency of ∼40%, even higher than that in XR. This validates the earlier fluorescence study, and supports the notion that many microbial retinal proteins use carotenoid antennae to  light.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h2><p>Evidence has proven that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host   and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed. Theabrownin has high potential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29749153>[Ecological evaluation of different multiple cropping systems in red soil drylands.]</a></h2><p>In order to maximize the ecological function of red soil drylands and to determine the desirable multiple cropping systems, we evaluated the productivity, circulation of materials,  and value flows in four multiple cropping systems on the basis of a consecutive three-year field experiment. Four multiple cropping systems were designed: treatment A (CK): wheat/soybean-sesame; treatment : mixed green manure (rape × Chinese milk vetch × radish)-soybean ‖ maize-mung bean‖ sesame; treatment C: ryegrass-peanut‖ maize-millet‖ buckwheat; and treatment D: rape-mung bean‖ sweet potato; where interplanting was expressed as '/', intercropping as '‖', planting after  as '-', and mixed cropping as '×'. Thirteen variables were employed to compare economic, ecological, and social benefits among the four cropping systems using grey relational analysis. The results showed that 'mixed green manure (rape × Chinese milk vetch × radish)-soybean‖ maize-mung bean‖ sesame' exhibited the highest grey relational degrees in terms of economic, ecological, and social benefits, and a highest grey relational degree at 0.847 in the integrative benefit. This treatment was the best multiple cropping pattern suitable for red soil drylands. Thus, this cropping system could have a positive impact on the layout and optimization of the structure of agricultural production in red soil dryland regions in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28121148>Regulating the  Flow in a Cyanobacterial Light-Harvesting Antenna Complex.</a></h2><p>Photosynthetic organisms  light , utilizing the absorption and -transfer properties of protein-bound chromophores.

We isolated cyanobacterial light-harvesting proteins, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, and measured their optical properties in solution and in an aggregated-desiccated state. The results indicate that  band structures are changed, generating a switch between the two modes of operation, exciton transfer and quenching, achieved without dedicated carotenoid quenchers. This flexibility can contribute greatly to the large dynamic range of cyanobacterial light-harvesting systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29219747>Using magnetic materials to  microalgal biomass: evaluation of harvesting and detachment efficiency.</a></h2><p>Using naked iron oxide (FeO) and yttrium iron oxide (YFeO) nanoparticles as flocculants, the harvesting efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris biomass was investigated. The harvesting process includes two steps, which are the separation of microalgae from the culture solution with the magnetic nanoparticles and then the separation of the algae from the magnetic nanoparticles. The optimal dosages and pH values for the magnetic harvesting of microalgal biomass were determined. Results showed that YFeO nanoparticles were more efficient in microalgal biomass harvesting than FeO nanoparticles. In an effort to achieve more than 90% of harvesting efficiency, optimal dosages for FeO and YFeO to  microalgal biomass were 10 and 2.5 g/L, while the appropriate pH values were 6.2 and 7.3, respectively. The harvesting efficiency of FeO and YFeO nanoparticles increased as the pH value decreased. The experimental results also showed that under a higher pH value FeO nanoparticles were much easier to be separated from the flocs than YFeO. 62.9% of FeO nanoparticles could be de-attached from the aggregates, when the floc pH value reached 12.3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864653>Chemical Pretreatment-Independent Saccharifications of Xylan and Cellulose of Rice Straw by Bacterial Weak Lignin-Binding Xylanolytic and Cellulolytic Enzymes.</a></h2><p>Complete utilization of carbohydrate fractions is one of the prerequisites for obtaining economically favorable lignocellulosic biomass conversion. This study shows that xylan in untreated rice straw was saccharified to xylose in one step without chemical pretreatment, yielding 58.2% of the theoretically maximum value by  -6 PcAxy43A, a weak lignin-binding trifunctional xylanolytic enzyme, endoxylanase/β-xylosidase/arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase. Moreover, xylose yield from untreated rice straw was enhanced to 78.9% by adding endoxylanases PcXyn10C and PcXyn11A from the same bacterium, resulting in improvement of cellulose accessibility to cellulolytic enzyme. After autoclaving the xylanolytic enzyme-treated rice straw, it was subjected to subsequent saccharification by a combination of the  endoglucanase CtCel9R and  β-glucosidase TbCglT, yielding 88.5% of the maximum glucose yield, which was higher than the glucose yield obtained from ammonia-treated rice straw saccharification (59.6%). Moreover, this work presents a new environment-friendly xylanolytic enzyme pretreatment for beneficial hydrolysis of xylan in various agricultural residues, such as rice straw and corn hull. It not only could improve cellulose saccharification but also produced xylose, leading to an improvement of the overall fermentable sugar yields without chemical pretreatment. Ongoing research is focused on improving "green" pretreatment technologies in order to reduce  demands and environmental impact and to develop an economically feasible biorefinery. The present study showed that PcAxy43A, a weak lignin-binding trifunctional xylanolytic enzyme, endoxylanase/β-xylosidase/arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase from  -6, was capable of conversion of xylan in lignocellulosic biomass such as untreated rice straw to xylose in one step without chemical pretreatment. It demonstrates efficient synergism with endoxylanases PcXyn10C and PcXyn11A to depolymerize xylan in untreated rice straw and enhanced the xylose production and improved cellulose hydrolysis. Therefore, it can be considered an enzymatic pretreatment. Furthermore, the studies here show that glucose yield released from steam- and xylanolytic enzyme-treated rice straw by the combination of CtCel9R and TbCglT was higher than the glucose yield obtained from ammonia-treated rice straw saccharification. This work presents a novel environment-friendly xylanolytic enzyme pretreatment not only as a green pretreatment but also as an economically feasible biorefinery method.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048842>Aspalathin, a natural product with the potential to reverse hepatic insulin resistance by improving  metabolism and mitochondrial respiration.</a></h2><p>Aspalathin is a rooibos flavonoid with established blood glucose lowering properties, however, its efficacy to moderate complications associated with hepatic insulin resistance is unknown. To study such effects, C3A liver cells exposed to palmitate were used as a model of hepatic insulin resistance. These hepatocytes displayed impaired substrate metabolism, including reduced glucose transport and free fatty acid uptake. These defects included impaired insulin signaling, evident through reduced phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/ protein kinase  (PI3K/AKT) protein expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction, depicted by a lower mitochondrial respiration rate. Aspalathin was able to ameliorate these defects by correcting altered substrate metabolism, improving insulin signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Activation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be a plausible mechanism by which aspalathin increases hepatic  expenditure. Overall, these results encourage further studies assessing the potential use of aspalathin as a nutraceutical to improve hepatocellular  expenditure, and reverse metabolic disease-associated complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28791931>Effect of variety and  date on nutritive value and ruminal degradability of ensiled maize ears.</a></h2><p>The nutritive value of whole crop forage maize is influenced by the proportion of ears and stover in the whole crop and by the nutrient composition and digestibility characteristics of the plant parts. An experiment investigating the impact of variety,  date and year on the nutritive value of ensiled maize ears was carried out in three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2010). Nine different maize varieties were harvested at three different maturity stages (50, 55 and 60% dry matter (DM) content in the ears). After , ears and stover were ensiled separately and afterwards nutrient composition and ruminal nutrient degradability (organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and non-fibre carbohydrates (NFC)) were analysed. Variety had a significant influence on content of CP and effective ruminal degradability (ED) of OM at low passage rates, whereas ED of CP and NFC was not affected by variety. In contrast,  date and year significantly influenced nutrient composition and ruminal degradability of ensiled maize ears. The content of NFC increased and the content of fibre components as well as ED of OM, CP and NFC declined with processing maturity of the maize plants. At a passage rate of 5% h, ED of OM declined from 75.9% to 68.4%, ED of CP from 82.5% to 73.8% and ED of NFC from 88.0% to 82.3% between the early and late  date. The results of this study indicate that the nutrient composition and ruminal degradability of ensiled maize ears are affected mainly by maturity stage at  and by year, whereas variety has only little influence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335181>Enhancing the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells by adding Rhodamine  laser dye as co-sensitizer.</a></h2><p>Ternary blend (TB) strategy has been considered as an effective method to enhance the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report on TB-based PSCs containing two donor materials; poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and Rhodamine  (RhB) laser organic dye, and [6,6]-phenyl C butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. The influence of RhB weight percentage and injection volume was extensively studied. To gain insight into the influences of RhB on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, physicochemical and optical properties of TBs were compared with those of BHJ binary blend as a standard. RhB broadened the light absorption properties of the active layer and played a bridging role between P3HT and PCBM. The PCE and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the optimized TB-based PSCs comprising of 0.5 wt% RhB reached 5% and 12.12 mA/cm, respectively. Compared to BHJ standard cell, the PCE and the generated current was improved by two orders of magnitude due to higher photon  of the active layer, cascade  level structure of TB components and a considerable decrease in the charge carrier recombination. The results suggest that RhB can be considered as an effective material for application in PSCs to attain high photovoltaic performance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A specific focus is placed on nanocomposite materials as a means to solve the challenges presented by the contradictory material requirements necessary for efficient thermal  . Misfit layer compounds are highlighted as an example of a highly ordered anisotropic nanocomposite system. Their layered structure provides the opportunity to use multiple constituents for improved thermoelectric performance, through both enhanced phonon scattering at interfaces and through electronic interactions between the constituents. Recently, a class of metastable, turbostratically-disordered misfit layer compounds has been synthesized using a kinetically controlled approach with low reaction temperatures. The kinetically stabilized structures can be prepared with a variety of constituent ratios and layering schemes, providing an avenue to systematically understand structure-function relationships not possible in the thermodynamic compounds. We summarize the work that has been done to date on these materials. The observed turbostratic disorder has been shown to result in extremely low cross plane thermal conductivity and in plane thermal conductivities that are also very small, suggesting the structural motif could be attractive as thermoelectric materials if the power factor could be improved. The first 10 compounds in the [(PbSe)1+δ]m(TiSe2)n family (m, n ≤ 3) are reported as a case study. As n increases, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient is significantly increased without a simultaneous decrease in the in-plane electrical conductivity, resulting in an improved thermoelectric power factor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25196223>Adhesion and integration of tissue engineered cartilage to porous polyethylene for composite ear reconstruction.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to assess the ability of tissue engineered cartilage to adhere to and integrate with porous polyethylene (PPE) in vivo and to evaluate the biomechanical integrity of the bond formed at the interface. Porcine auricular, articular, and costal chondrocytes were suspended in fibrin gel polymer and placed between discs of PPE to form tri-layer constructs. Controls consisted of fibroblasts suspended in gel or gel alone between the discs. Constructs were implanted into nude mice for 6, 12, and 18 weeks. Upon , specimens were evaluated for neocartilage formation and integration into the PPE, using histological, dimensional (mass, thickness, diameter), and biomechanical (adhesion strength, interfacial stiffness, failure  and failure strain) analyses. Neotissue was formed in all experimental constructs, consisting mostly of neocartilage integrating with discs of PPE. Control samples contained only fibrous tissue. Biomechanical analyses demonstrated that adhesion strength, interfacial stiffness, and failure  were all significantly higher in the chondrocyte-seeded samples than in fibroblast-seeded controls, with the exception of costal constructs at 12 weeks, which were not significantly greater than controls. In general, failure strains did not vary between groups. In conclusion, porous polyethylene supported the growth of neocartilage that formed mechanically functional bonds with the PPE.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29236703>Rural protein insufficiency in a wildlife-depleted West African farm-forest landscape.</a></h2><p>Wildlife is an important source of protein for many people in developing countries. Yet wildlife depletion due to overexploitation is common throughout the humid tropics and its effect on protein security, especially for vulnerable households, is poorly understood. This is problematic for both sustainable rural development and conservation management.This study investigates a key dimension of protein security in a cash-crop farming community living in a wildlife-depleted farm-forest landscape in SW Ghana, a region where protein- malnutrition persists. Specifically, we monitored protein sufficiency, defined as whether consumption met daily requirements, as benchmarked by recommended daily allowance (RDA). We focus on whether more vulnerable households were less likely to be able to meet their protein needs, where vulnerability was defined by wealth, agricultural season and gender of the household head. Our central hypothesis was: (a) vulnerable households are less likely to consume sufficient protein. In the context that most plant proteins were home-produced, so likely relatively accessible to all households, while most animal proteins were purchased, so likely less accessible to vulnerable households, we tested two further hypotheses: () vulnerable households depend more on plant protein to cover their protein needs; and (c) vulnerable households are less likely to earn sufficient cash income to meet their protein needs through purchased animal sources.Between 14% and 60% of households (depending on plant protein content assumptions) consumed less than the RDA for protein, but neither protein consumption nor protein sufficiency co-varied with household vulnerability. Fish, livestock and food crops comprised 85% of total protein intake and strongly affected protein sufficiency. However, bushmeat remained an important protein source (15% of total consumption), especially during the post- season when it averaged 26% of total protein consumption. Across the year, 89% of households experienced at least one occasion when they had insufficient income to cover their protein needs through animal protein purchases. The extent of this income shortage was highest during the lean season and among poorer households.These findings indicate that despite wildlife depletion, bushmeat continues to make a substantial contribution to protein consumption, especially during the agricultural lean season. Income shortages among farmers limit their ability to purchase bushmeat or its substitutes, suggesting that wildlife depletion may cause malnutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593449>Evaluation of seasonal changes of triterpenic acid contents in Viscum album from different host trees.</a></h2><p>Viscum album L.

The reversed phase HPLC-PDA method was used for the analysis of triterpenic acids. The structure of the target components was confirmed by mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization source.Diversity in the content of both compounds was noted; however, OA was the dominant triterpenic acid and the amount thereof was ∼10 times higher than that of BA. The analysis of changes in the amount of triterpenic acids during the spring-winter period revealed the highest content of OA in summer (from 6.84 to 13.65 mg/g). In turn, in the other seasons of , the content was in the range of 4.41-9.83, 6.41-9.56 and 5.59-12.16 mg/g for spring, autumn and winter, respectively.

The maximum lipid productivity of 29.75 mg L(-1) day(-1) was obtained from the culture with the second reuse medium.

The maximum lipid content of 34.22% was obtained from the continuous culture at a dilution rate of 0.08 day(-1), whereas the maximum saturated and unsaturated fatty acid productivities of 79.96 and 104.54 mg L(-1) day(-1) were obtained at a dilution rate of 0.16 day(-1.).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891958>Selective manipulation of electronically excited states through strong light-matter interactions.</a></h2><p>Strong coupling between light and matter leads to the spontaneous formation of hybrid light-matter states, having different energies than the uncoupled states. This opens up for new ways of modifying the  landscape of molecules without changing their atoms or structure. Heavy metal-free organic light emitting diodes (OLED) use reversed intersystem crossing (RISC) to  light from excited triplet states. This is a slow process, thus increasing the rate of RISC could potentially enhance OLED performance. Here we demonstrate selective coupling of the excited singlet state of Erythrosine  without perturbing the  level of a nearby triplet state. The coupling reduces the triplet-singlet  gap, leading to a four-time enhancement of the triplet decay rate, most likely due to an enhanced rate of RISC. Furthermore, we anticipate that strong coupling can be used to create -inverted molecular systems having a singlet ground and lowest excited state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26004837>Examination of weekly mammary parenchymal area by ultrasound, mammary mass, and composition in Holstein heifers reared on 1 of 3 diets from birth to 2 months of age.</a></h2><p>Monitoring in vivo growth of mammary parenchyma (PAR) has historically been difficult, necessitating slaughter studies to measure PAR quantity. Advances in ultrasound (US) technology warrant revisiting its use as a noninvasive tool to monitor PAR growth in vivo. The level of nutrient intake during the first 2mo of life may affect measures of mammary growth and composition. Objectives were to examine the utility of US as an in vivo tool to quantify PAR cross-sectional area in Holstein heifers reared on 1 of 3 diets from birth to 2mo of age, assessing potential dietary effects; assess the relationships between weekly US measurements, teat length, manual palpation of PAR scores, and PAR mass at 2mo of age; and examine mammary composition in experimental animals. Holstein heifers (n=24; 41±1kg of initial body weight) from a single farm were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 milk replacers that differed in source and amount of fat. Milk replacer was fed at 660g of dry matter/d until weaning at 42 d. Heifers had ad libitum access to a common calf starter (20% crude protein) and water for the duration of the 56-d trial. Teat length and palpation scores were obtained weekly. A real-time -mode US with a 7.5-MHz convex probe was used to examine 2-dimensional PAR area in all 4 glands of heifers once weekly from 2 to 3 d of age to  at 56 d. The left front and left rear glands were also examined by US 24h postharvest to validate final US measurements, and then bisected to produce a sagittal plane view of PAR for comparison with US images. Mass and composition of mammary gland tissue were determined at 8 wk using standard methodology. Over the course of this 8-wk trial, average teat length increased from 11 to 17mm. The PAR area started small (6.6±3.2mm(2) per gland) and increased to 42.1±2.5mm(2) per gland by the end of the trial. As anticipated, based on measurements obtained at slaughter, US measurements were more related to amount of PAR (r=0.74) than either teat length (r=0.34) or palpation scoring (r=0.63). Importantly, US is quantitative, whereas palpation scoring is subjective. Diet did not affect mass or composition of PAR in young heifers; total udder PAR mass averaged 1.40±0.80g. In conclusion, we showed that in heifers younger than 2mo of age, obtaining weekly PAR measurements via ultrasound is an effective quantitative tool for measuring changes in PAR area in vivo. Future studies may incorporate and expand upon the methods developed here to determine what quantitative evaluation of PAR in young heifers can reveal about milk production capacity.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Therefore, it is desirable to construct a high-performance heterogeneous membrane capable of coordinating highly selective and rectified ionic transport with a simple, versatile, engineered method to mimic the delicate functionality of biological channels. Here, we demonstrate an engineered asymmetric heterogeneous membrane by combining a porous block copolymer (BCP) membrane, polystyrene--poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS48400--P4VP21300), with a track-etched asymmetric porous polyethylene terephthalate membrane. The introduction of chemical, geometrical, and electrostatic heterostructures provides our heterogeneous membrane with excellent anion selectivity and ultrahigh ionic rectification with a ratio of ca. 1075, which is considerably higher than that of existing ionic rectifying systems. This anion-selective heterogeneous membrane was further developed into an  conversion device to  the  stored in an electrochemical concentration gradient. The concentration polarization phenomenon that commonly exists in traditional reverse electrodialysis can be eliminated with an asymmetric bipolar structure, which considerably increases the output power density. This work presents an important paradigm for the use of versatile BCPs in nanofluidic systems and opens new and promising routes to various breakthroughs in the fields of chemistry, materials science, bioscience, and nanotechnology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829889>Stability of annual biomass  production of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) genotypes in the Northern region of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to estimate the stability of dry biomass production of elephant grass genotypes under an annual  regime, in soil-climatic conditions of the Northern region of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, and to compare methodologies for stability analyses of Yates and Cochran (YC), Plaisted and Peterson (PP), Annicchiarico (ANN), Lin and Binns (LB), Huenh (HU), and Kang and Phan (KP). A randomized block design with 83 treatments and two replicates was adopted. Four annual harvests were performed (2012-2015) and dry matter yield (DMY, t.ha.year) was evaluated. Individual and combined analyses of variance for DMY revealed significant effects for genotypes, harvests, and for the genotype x  interaction at the probability levels of 1 and 5%. Genotypes indicated by the YC and PP methods are associated with higher stability and lower DMY. The weighting of KP with YC and PP was highly effective in associating stability with DMY. The LB and ANN methods showed strong agreement with each other and produced similar classifications as to phenotypic stability, and so we recommend using one or the other.

Although photocurrent can be generated near a metal-graphene interface in lateral devices, the photoactive area is usually limited to a tiny one-dimensional line-like interface region. Here, we report photoelectric devices based on vertical graphene two-dimensional homojunction, which is fabricated via vertically stacking four graphene monolayers with asymmetric metal contacts. The devices show excellent photovoltaic output with excitation wavelength ranging from visible light to mid-infrared. The wavelength dependence of the internal quantum efficiency gives direct evidence of the carrier multiplication effect in graphene. The simple fabrication process, easy scale-up, large photoresponsive active area, and broadband response of the vertical graphene device are very promising for practical applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27409161>Anaerobic digestion of spring and winter wheat: Comparison of net  yields.</a></h2><p>Anaerobic digestion of wheat was investigated under batch conditions. The article compares the potential net  yield between a winter wheat (sown in the autumn) and a spring wheat (sown in the spring) grown in the same year and harvested at the same growth stage in the same farm. The spring wheat had a slightly higher biochemical methane potential and required lower  inputs in cultivation, but produced a lower dry biomass yield per hectare, which resulted in winter wheat providing the best overall net  yield.

However, several primary bottlenecks still exist in current technologies, including low biomass conversion efficiency, bio-invasion from the external environment, limited or costly nutrient sources, and high  and capital input for , and stalling its industrial progression. Coupling biofuel production with environmental treatment renders microalgae a more feasible feedstock. This review focuses on microalgae biotechnologies for both bioenergy generation and environmental treatment (e.g. CO sequestration and wastewater reclamation). Different intelligent technologies have been developed, especially during the last decade, to eliminate the bottlenecks, including mixotrophic/heterotrophic cultivation, immobilization, and co-cultivation. It has been realized that any single purpose for the cultivation of microalgae is not an economically feasible option. Combinations of applications in biorefineries are gradually reckoned to be necessary as it provides more economically feasible and environmentally sustainable operations. This presents microalgae as a special niche occupier linking the fields of  and environmental sciences and technologies. The integrated application of microalgae is also proven by most of the life-cycle analysis studies. This study summarizes the latest development of primary microalgal biotechnologies in the two areas that will bring researchers a comprehensive view towards industrialization with an economic perspective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31457093>Microbial rhodopsins are major contributors to the solar  captured in the sea.</a></h2><p>All known phototrophic metabolisms on Earth rely on one of three categories of -converting pigments: chlorophyll- (rarely -), bacteriochlorophyll- (rarely -), and retinal, which is the chromophore in rhodopsins. While the significance of chlorophylls in solar  capture has been studied for decades, the contribution of retinal-based phototrophy to this process remains largely unexplored. We report the first vertical distributions of the three -converting pigments measured along a contrasting nutrient gradient through the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The highest rhodopsin concentrations were observed above the deep chlorophyll- maxima, and their geographical distribution tended to be inversely related to that of chlorophyll-. We further show that proton-pumping proteorhodopsins potentially absorb as much light  as chlorophyll--based phototrophy and that this  is sufficient to sustain bacterial basal metabolism. This suggests that proteorhodopsins are a major -transducing mechanism to  solar  in the surface ocean.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037268>Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and insulin sensitivity.</a></h2><p>Animal studies indicate that the composition of gut microbiota may be involved in the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Probiotics and/or prebiotics could be a promising approach to improve insulin sensitivity by favourably modifying the composition of the gut microbial community, reducing intestinal endotoxin concentrations and decreasing  . The aim of the present review was to investigate the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics) on insulin resistance in human clinical trials and to discuss the potential mechanisms whereby probiotics and prebiotics improve glucose metabolism. The anti-diabetic effects of probiotics include reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines via a NF-κ pathway, reduced intestinal permeability, and lowered oxidative stress. SCFA play a key role in glucose homeostasis through multiple potential mechanisms of action. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors on L-cells by SCFA promotes the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY resulting in increased insulin and decreased glucagon secretion, and suppressed appetite. SCFA can decrease intestinal permeability and decrease circulating endotoxins, lowering inflammation and oxidative stress. SCFA may also have anti-lipolytic activities in adipocytes and improve insulin sensitivity via GLUT4 through the up-regulation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase signalling in muscle and liver tissues. Resistant starch and synbiotics appear to have favourable anti-diabetic effects. However, there are few human interventions. Further well-designed human clinical studies are required to develop recommendations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes with pro- and prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941762>Achieving ZT=2.2 with Bi-doped n-type SnSe single crystals.</a></h2><p>Recently SnSe, a layered chalcogenide material, has attracted a great deal of attention for its excellent p-type thermoelectric property showing a remarkable ZT value of 2.6 at 923 K.

A total of 630 straight run (Cobb) day-old broiler chicks were distributed to seven treatments following a completely randomized design, with ten replicates per treatment and nine birds per replicate per cage. Dietary treatments consisted of basal diet in combination with the following: without probiotics and AGP supplementation (treatment 1); 75 ppm each of chlorotetracycline (CTC) and Zn bacitracin (treatment 2); probiotic A, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 3); probiotic , Bacillus subtilis (treatment 4); probiotic C, Enterococcus faecium (treatment 5); and probiotic D, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 6); probiotic E, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium spp., Pediococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. (treatment 7). At day 42,  digestibility was determined by fasting three randomly selected birds from each treatment for 12 h and then subjecting them to their corresponding dietary treatments. Excreta were collected and pooled after 24 h of feeding. Pooled excreta were weighed, oven-dried, and subjected to  analyses after 3-day collection. Apparent total tract metabolizable  was then computed. At day 47, three birds were randomly selected per treatment for intestinal morphometry (villi height and crypt depth) of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Dietary supplementation using probiotics showed no significant effect on overall body weight, weight gain, feed consumption, feed efficiency, dressing percentage, mortality,  recovery, carcass quality parameters (e.g., meat to bone ratio and abdominal fat content), intestinal morphometry, and  digestibility.

Particularly, (6-4) photolyase ((6-4)PHR) plays an important role in maintaining genetic integrity by repairing thymine(6-4)thymine (T(6-4)T) and thymine(6-4)cytosine (T(6-4)C) photolesions. The majority of (6-4)PHR studies have been performed on the basis of the former's activity and assuming the equivalence of the two repair mechanisms, although the latter's activity remains poorly studied. Here, we describe investigations of the repair process of the T(6-4)C dimer using several computational methods from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to large quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approaches. Two possible mechanisms, the historically proposed azetidine four-member ring intermediate and the free NH formation pathways, were considered. The MD results predicted that important active site histidine residues employed for the repair of the T(6-4)C dimer have protonation states similar to those seen in the (6-4)PHR/T(6-4)T complex. More importantly, despite chemical differences between the two substrates, a similar repair mechanism was identified: His365 protonates NH, resulting in formation/activation mechanism of a free NH, inducing NH transfer to the 5' base, and ultimately leading to pyrimidine restoration. This reaction is thermodynamically favorable with a rate-limiting barrier of 20.4 kcal mol. In contrast, the azetidine intermediate is unfeasible, possessing an  barrier of 60 kcal mol; this barrier is similar to that predicted for the oxetane intermediate in T(6-4)T repair. Although both substrates are repaired with comparable quantum yields, the reactive complex in T(6-4)C was shown to be a 3' base radical with a lower driving force for back electron transfer combined with higher  barrier for catalysis. These results showed the similarity in the general repair mechanisms between the two substrates while emphasizing differences in the electron dynamics in the repair cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372996>Generating electric current based on the solvent-dependent charging effects of defective boron nitride nanosheets.</a></h2><p>This work presents a method of generating electric current based on the defects of few-layer boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs). The density functional theory calculations showed that the atomic charge of the  atom in acetone was more positive than in water. The electrostatic force microscopy measurements illustrated that the local electrical potential was 0.35 mV in acetone, while the potential signal was very difficult to capture when using water as the dispersant. This effect was further demonstrated by the performance of the acoustic -harvesting nanogenerator: the BNNSs were assembled into a film after being dispersed in acetone and then integrated into the generator device, generating average output current of ∼0.98 nA, which was much better than 0.2 nA, the average output current of another device with water as the dispersant.

The relationship between the pathway of charge transfer and the photocatalytic activity of the AuNRs/AgPO heterostructures was investigated systematically, revealing the specific role of AuNRs in regulating the photocatalytic activity.

In this study, powdery biomass was first enzymatically delignified and then saccharified using crude enzymes.The biological pretreatment decreased the lignin content of the biomass from an initial value of 295 to 137.7 g kg , with a simultaneous increase in exposed cellulose content from 379.3 to 615.9 g kg . For optimization of the saccharification, response surface methodology was adopted using a three-factor/three-level Box-Behnken design with crude fungal cellulase loading (FPU g substrate), substrate concentration (% w/v) and saccharification temperature (°C) as the main process parameters. A maximum saccharification yield of 47.19% was achieved under the optimized conditions (cellulase enzyme 18.4 FPU g substrate, substrate concentration 1.0% w/v, temperature 39.49 °C). Biological delignification and saccharification of the biomass were further confirmed through scanning electron microscopy analysis.It is evident from the study that bamboo, as a renewable  bioresource, can be hydrolysed to reducing sugars by using crude laccase/cellulase enzymes of fungal origin with good saccharification yield.

Changes in the environment, behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes. A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of metabolic diseases.We will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal microbiota on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.Altered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing   through specialized gut microbes. In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into metabolic active tissues. Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals. Finally, bacterial metabolic products, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and metabolic signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large. The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.Interventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin resistance and the related metabolic abnormalities in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

This forest NPP can also be a reflection of its sensitivity to, and its ability to adapt to, any climate change while also being harvested by humans. However detecting and identifying the vulnerability of forest and human ecosystems to climate change requires information on whether these coupled social and ecological systems are able to maintain functionality while responding to environmental variability. To better understand what parameters might be representative of environmental variability, we compiled a metadata analysis of 96 tropical forest sites. We found that three soil textural classes (i.e., sand, sandy loam and clay) had significant but different relationships between NPP and precipitation levels. Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of forests and forest dependent communities to drought was carried out using data from those sites that had one of those three soil textural classes. For example, forests growing on soil textures of sand and clay had NPP levels decreasing as precipitation levels increased, in contrast to those forest sites that had sandy loam soils where NPP levels increased. Also, forests growing on sandy loam soil textures appeared better adapted to grow at lower precipitation levels compared to the sand and clay textured soils. In fact in our tropical database the lowest precipitation level found for the sandy loam soils was 821 mm yr(-1) compared to sand at 1739 mm yr(-1) and clay at 1771 mm yr(-1). Soil texture also determined the level of NPP reached by a forest, i.e., forest growing on sandy loam and clay reached low-medium NPP levels while higher NPP levels (i.e., medium, high) were found on sand-textured soils. Intermediate precipitation levels (>1800-3000 mm yr(-1)) were needed to grow forests at the medium and high NPP levels. Low thresholds of NPP were identified at both low (∼750 mm) and high precipitation (>3500 mm) levels. By combining data on the ratios of precipitation to the amount of biomass produced in a year with how much less precipitation input occurs during a drought year, it is possible to estimate whether productivity levels are sufficient to support forest growth and forest dependent communities following a drought. In this study, the ratios of annual precipitation inputs required to produce 1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) biomass by soil texture class varied across the three soil textural classes. By using a conservative estimate of 20% of productivity collected or harvested by people and 30% precipitation reduction level as triggering a drought, it was possible to estimate a potential loss of annual productivity due to a drought. In this study, the total NPP unavailable due to drought and  by forest dependent communities per year was 10.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the sandy textured soils (64% of NPP still available), 8.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the sandy loam textured soils (60% available) and 12.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the clay textured soils (29% available). Forests growing on clay textured soils would be most vulnerable to drought triggered reductions in productivity so NPP levels would be inadequate to maintain ecosystem functions and would potentially cause a forest-to-savanna shift. Further, these forests would not be able to provide sufficient NPP to satisfy the requirements of forest dependent communities. By predicting the productivity responses of different tropical forest ecosystems to changes in precipitation patterns coupled with edaphic data, it could be possible to spatially identify where tropical forests are most vulnerable to climate change impacts and where mitigation efforts should be concentrated.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Metabolic power can be experimentally measured. However, for design purposes, it is essential to assess differences in metabolic power as a function of the device parameters.To this end, based on the proposed approach, we develop a mathematical model that considers the following parameters: the device's mass, its location on the human body, the electrical power output, cost of harvesting (COH), walking time, and the specific  of the battery.We apply the model in two ways. First, we conduct case studies to examine current ankle, knee, and back  harvesting devices, and assess the walking times that would make these devices preferable over batteries. Second, we conduct a design scenarios analysis, which examines future device developments.The case studies reveal that to be preferred over batteries, current harvesting devices located on the ankle, knee, or back would require walking for 227 hours, 98 hours, or 260 hours, respectively. This would replace batteries weighing 6.81 kg (ankle), 5.88 kg (knee), or 2.6 kg (back). The design scenarios analysis suggests that for harvesting devices to be beneficial with less than 25 walking hours, future development should focus on light harvesting devices (less than 0.2 kg) with low COH (equal or lower than 0). Finally, a comparison with portable commercial solar panels reveals that under ideal sun exposure conditions, solar panels outperform the current harvesting devices.Our model offers a tool for assessing the performance of  harvesting devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541641>ZnSe·0.5N2H4 hybrid nanostructures: a promising alternative photocatalyst for solar conversion.</a></h2><p>As the molecular precursor of ZnSe, ZnSe·0.5N2H4 inorganic-organic hybrids have received relatively less attention due to the feasibility of their further processing and decomposition into pure-phase ZnSe. Here we demonstrated that ZnSe·0.5N2H4 hybrid nanostructures, which were prepared using a facile hydrazine-assisted hydrothermal method, may practically  solar  for photoconversion applications. By modulating the volume ratio of hydrazine hydrate to deionized water employed in the synthesis, the morphology of the grown ZnSe·0.5N2H4 can be varied, which included nanowires, nanobelts and nanoflakes. With the relatively long exciton lifetime and highly anisotropic structure, ZnSe·0.5N2H4 nanowires performed much better in the photodegradation of rhodamine  than the other two counterpart products. As compared to pure ZnSe nanoparticles and single-phase ZnSe nanowires obtained from further processing ZnSe·0.5N2H4, the ZnSe·0.5N2H4 hybrid nanowires exhibited superior photocatalytic performance under visible light illumination. The hybrid nanowires were further decorated with Au particles to endow them with structural and compositional diversities. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra suggested that almost 40% of the photoexcited electrons in ZnSe·0.5N2H4 nanowires can be transported to the decorated Au, which enabled a fuller extent of participation of charge carriers in the photocatalytic process and thus conduced to a significant enhancement in the photocatalytic activity. The demonstrations from this work illustrate that ZnSe·0.5N2H4 hybrid nanostructures can serve as a versatile photocatalyst platform for advanced photocatalytic applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31153887>Light harvesting complexes in chlorophyll c-containing algae.</a></h2><p>Besides the so-called 'green lineage' of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms that include vascular plants, a huge variety of different algal groups exist that also  light by means of membrane intrinsic light harvesting proteins (Lhc). The main taxa of these algae are the Cryptophytes, Haptophytes, Dinophytes, Chromeridae and the Heterokonts, the latter including diatoms, brown algae, Xanthophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae amongst others. Despite the similarity in Lhc proteins between vascular plants and these algae, pigmentation is significantly different since no Chl  is bound, but often replaced by Chl c, and a large diversity in carotenoids functioning in light harvesting and/or photoprotection is present. Due to the presence of Chl c in most of the taxa the name 'Chl c-containing organisms' has become common, however, Chl -less is more precise since some harbour Lhc proteins that only bind one type of Chl, Chl a. In recent years huge progress has been made about the occurrence and function of Lhc in diatoms, so-called fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins (FCP), where also the first molecular structure became available recently. In addition, especially  transfer amongst the unusual pigments bound was intensively studied in many of these groups. This review summarises the present knowledge about the molecular structure, the arrangement of the different Lhc in complexes, the excitation  transfer abilities and the involvement in photoprotection of the different Lhc systems in the so-called Chl c-containing organisms.

The harvested MaB-floc biomass (33tonTSha(-1)y(-1)) needs further valorization. Therefore, the biochemical methane yield (BMY) of MaB-floc biomass was determined in batch experiments. The results show significant differences between the BMY of MaB-flocs amongst their  dates (128-226NLCH4kg(-1)VS), a low anaerobic digestion conversion efficiency (25.0-36.2%), a moderate chlorophyll a removal (51.5-86.9%) and a low biogas profit (<0.01€m(-3)wastewater). None of the pretreatment methods screened (freezing, thermal, microwave, ultrasonic and chlorination, flue gas sparging, and acid) can be recommended due to a low BMY improvement and/or unfavorable  balance. Therefore, anaerobic digestion of this MaB-floc biomass should only be granted a supporting role within a biorefinery concept.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using bionics principles, a bionic blade was designed by extracting the cutting tooth profile curve of the  palate. Using a double-blade cutting device testing system, a single stalk cutting performance contrast test for corn stalks obtained at  time was carried out. Results show that bionic blades have superior performance, demonstrated by strong cutting ability and good cut quality. Using statistical analysis of two groups of cutting test data, the average cutting force and cutting  of bionic blades and ordinary blades were obtained as 480.24 N and 551.31 N and 3.91 J and 4.38 J, respectively. Average maximum cutting force and cutting  consumption for the bionic blade were reduced by 12.89% and 10.73%, respectively. Variance analysis showed that both blade types had a significant effect on maximum cutting  and cutting  required to cut a corn stalk. This demonstrates that bionic blades have better cutting force and  consumption reduction performance than ordinary blades.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28537072>Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities of g-CN via Hybridization with a Bi-Fe-Nb-Containing Ferroelectric Pyrochlore.</a></h2><p>Ferroelectricity may promote photocatalytic performance because the carrier-separation efficiency can be effectively improved by the internal electrostatic field caused by spontaneous polarization. Heterostructures that combine ferroelectric materials with other semiconductor materials can be further advantageous to the photocatalysis process. In this work, BiFeNbO was hybridized with g-CN via a facile low-temperature method. The results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that a tight interface was formed between g-CN and BiFeNbO, which gave the (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) heterojunction a more superior visible light photocatalytic performance. The degradation of rhodamine  by optimized (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) under visible light was almost 3.3 times higher than that by monomer BiFeNbO and 7.4 times higher than that by g-CN. The (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) sample also showed the highest photocurrent in the photoelectrochemical tests. To further verify the benefit of the built-in electric field in terms of the photocatalytic performance, BiFeNbO, with a higher spontaneous polarization, was also synthesized and hybridized with g-CN. Both BiFeNbO and (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO) exhibited better photocatalytic activities than those of BiFeNbO and (g-CN)-(BiFeNbO), although the latter ones had a stronger visible-light absorbance. This implies the very promising prospects of applying ferroelectric materials for solar  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30764579>Enhanced Broadband RF Differential Rectifier Integrated with Archimedean Spiral Antenna for Wireless  Harvesting Applications.</a></h2><p>This work addresses the design and implementation of a broadband differential rectifier (DR) combined with an Archimedean spiral dipole antenna (ASDA) for wireless power harvesting at low incident power densities below 200 μ W/cm 2 . The proposed design exhibits an improved RF-DC conversion efficiency over a wide frequency range from 1.2 to 5 GHz. This frequency band is associated with several wireless communication services, for instance, ISM, WLAN, 5G, LTE, and GPS applications. The receiving planar ASDA exhibits circular polarization and has an average measured gain of 4.5 dBi from 1.2 to 5 GHz. To enable a wide operating bandwidth, the rectifier circuit is constituted by two architectures, designated A and . Each scheme is designed to  power efficiently across a specific bandwidth. The optimal performance of both rectifiers are obtained using the nonlinear harmonic-balance simulations. The antenna⁻rectifier integration yields a compact rectenna with a high-efficiency performance over the intended bandwidth from 1.2 to 5 GHz for an input power of 9 dBm and terminal load resistance of 1 k Ω . The total measured RF-DC conversion efficiency is maintained above 30% across the entire frequency range with a peak value of 61% achieved at 1.2 GHz. In comparison with similar architectures, the proposed rectenna maintains a stable output efficiency despite the wide fluctuations in the input frequency and also has a minimum footprint size (58 × 55 mm 2 ).</p></html>
