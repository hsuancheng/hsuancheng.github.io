Although ALK-positive ALCLs consistently bear rearrangements of the   kinase gene, ALK-negative ALCLs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. About 30% of ALK-negative ALCLs have rearrangements of  and have excellent long-term outcomes with standard therapy. To better understand this group of tumors, we evaluated their molecular signature using gene expression profiling. rearranged ALCLs belonged to a distinct subset of ALCLs that lacked expression of genes associated with JAK-STAT3 signaling, a pathway contributing to growth in the majority of ALCLs. Reverse-phase protein array and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the lack of activated STAT3 in rearranged ALCLs. rearranged ALCLs also overexpressed immunogenic cancer-testis antigen (CTA) genes and showed marked DNA hypomethylation by reduced representation bisulfate sequencing and DNA methylation arrays. Pharmacologic DNA demethylation in ALCL cells recapitulated the overexpression of CTAs and other DUSP22 signature genes. In addition, rearranged ALCLs minimally expressed PD-L1 compared with other ALCLs, but showed high expression of the costimulatory gene  and HLA class II. Taken together, these findings indicate that  rearrangements define a molecularly distinct subgroup of ALCLs, and that immunogenic cues related to antigenicity, costimulatory molecule expression, and inactivity of the PD-1/PD-L1   likely contribute to their favorable prognosis. More aggressive ALCLs might be pharmacologically reprogrammed to a DUSP22-like immunogenic molecular signature through the use of demethylating agents and/or   inhibitors.© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751335>The current evidence for a biomarker-based approach in cancer of unknown primary.</a></h1><p>Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for the seventh to eighth most frequently diagnosed cancer yet its prognosis remains poor with conventional chemotherapy. The spectrum of therapeutic management includes both locoregional and systemic therapy and should intend to offer optimal benefit to favorable CUP patients and palliative care to unfavorable cases. The recent molecular advances have revolutionized the armamentarium of cancer treatments though a biomarker-based approach. Unfortunately, solid data in CUP is lacking in the absence of a CUP-specific driver molecular signature. This prompted us to screen the medical literature for clinical data that evaluates the efficacy and safety of the biomarker-based approach in CUP patients. In this review, we will summarize the available evidence for the applicability of targeted therapies in CUP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although HCC can respond to   inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies against programmed death 1 (PD-1), many patients fail to respond or develop secondary resistance. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can contribute to  evasion. Mutations in β-catenin are among the most frequent mutations associated with HCC. Thus, our aim was to directly target β-catenin to enhance the therapeutic response to   inhibition. A synthetic transgenic mouse model of experimental HCC induced by -protein kinase Met/β-catenin expression and extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a therapeutic delivery agent was used to evaluate the efficacy of directly targeting β-catenin on the response to anti-PD-1. These studies showed that (1) oncogenic β-catenin could be therapeutically targeted using a biological nanoparticle-based delivery approach, (2) targeting β-catenin using small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivered within EVs can reduce tumor growth, and (3) the therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 can be enhanced by concomitantly targeting β-catenin using therapeutic EVs. These preclinical studies establish the efficacy of the use of biological nanoparticles as an endogenous delivery vehicle for therapeutic RNA delivery and support the use of therapeutic strategies targeting tumor-intrinsic β-catenin as an adjunct to anti-PD-1-based therapy.  Combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and β-catenin siRNA delivered using biological nanoparticles provides an effective strategy for the treatment of HCC. This strategy could be further exploited into targeted approaches for  potentiation by countering oncogene-mediated resistance to immunotherapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027701>Improvement in the survival of patients with stage IV non-small- lung cancer: Experience in a single institutional 1995-2017.</a></h1><p>In the past two decades several antineoplastic agents have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC), and the management of these patients has drastically changed. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of these advances on patient survival in clinical practice.We analyzed the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received any treatment in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) between January 1, 1995 and March 1, 2017. A total of 1,547 consecutive patients were included in this case series. In this analysis, five diagnostic periods were evaluated: 1995-1999 (period A), 2000-2004 (period B), 2005-2009 (period C), 2010-2014 (period D), and 2015-2017 (period E). We compared overall survival (OS) between the periods before and after propensity score matching (PSM) and in patients with EGFR mutation, with ALK fusion gene, or without driver mutation.In the past two decades the OS of patients with stage IV NSCLC improved. The median OSs for periods A, B, C, D, and E were 9.0, 11.0, 13.7, 17.9 months, and not reached, respectively. After PSM with known baseline characteristics, the trend of improvement in OS was similar. However, the OS of patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion gene did not improve between periods, despite the availability of several  kinase inhibitors in Japan. The OS of patients without a driver mutation was slightly longer in the period E.The introduction of new classes of drugs has significantly improved the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, the approval of similar types of drugs may not be associated with further improvement in survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Systemic treatments with several multi-targeted  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib and cabozantinib, have been widely utilized int the treatment of HCC. However, with tolerable adverse events and relative low survival time, neo or optimized therapies for advanced HCC are still urgently needed. New developed   inhibitors therapy have been first demonstrated effective in metastatic melanoma through against CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 to renew T  effector function. Preclinical data indicated that interference with   molecules results in HCC growth suppression, suggesting it may bring hope to the HCC treatment. Several clinical trials applying monoclonal antibodies to   molecules demonstrated that   inhibitors are safe and enable durable antitumor activity in advanced HCC patients. Several published immunotherapy trials in HCC using Anti-CTLA-4 agents (tremelimumab) or anit-PD-1 agents (Nivolumab) have showed promising results, in which have similar response rate (15%-30%) and disease control rate with TKIs therapies.

The patients were subdivided into three groups: low BMI (<18.5 kg/m), normal BMI (18.5 to <25.0 kg/m), and high BMI (≥25.0 kg/m). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with survival.In all patients, a low BMI was an independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS (p=0.0175 and p=0.0134, respectively). In patients with stage I, a low BMI was also an independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS (p=0.0066 and p<0.0001, respectively).A low BMI was an independent prognostic factor after surgical resection of stage I NSCLC. Molecular targeted therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, anaplastic lymphoma kinase- kinase inhibitors, and   inhibitors targeting the programmed  death-1/programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway have greatly improved the clinical course for patients with non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), especially advanced-stage NSCLC (1-7). However, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (8). Even in patients with stage I to IIIA NSCLC, the clinical course is unsatisfactory despite the fact that surgical resection is the main treatment option (9).

Here we unravel the results of an unbiased screen identifying high-dose (10 µM) crizotinib as an ICD-inducing  kinase inhibitor that has exceptional antineoplastic activity when combined with non-ICD inducing chemotherapeutics like cisplatin. The combination of cisplatin and high-dose crizotinib induces ICD in non-small  lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells and effectively controls the growth of distinct (transplantable, carcinogen- or oncogene induced) orthotopic NSCLC models. These anticancer effects are linked to increased T lymphocyte infiltration and are abolished by T  depletion or interferon-γ neutralization. Crizotinib plus cisplatin leads to an increase in the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumors, coupled to a strong sensitization of NSCLC to immunotherapy with PD-1 antibodies. Hence, a sequential combination treatment consisting in conventional chemotherapy together with crizotinib, followed by   blockade may be active against NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911337>HER2-positive breast cancer: new therapeutic frontiers and overcoming resistance.</a></h1><p>The introduction of anti-HER2 therapies to the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer has led to dramatic improvements in survival in both early and advanced settings. Despite this breakthrough, nearly all patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer eventually progress on anti-HER2 therapy due to  or acquired resistance. A better understanding not only of the underlying mechanisms of HER2 therapy resistance but of tumor heterogeneity as well as the host and tumor microenvironment is essential for the development of new strategies to further improve patient outcomes. One strategy has focused on inhibiting the HER2 signaling pathway more effectively with dual-blockade approaches and developing improved anti-HER2 therapies like antibody-drug conjugates, new anti-HER2 antibodies, bispecific antibodies, or novel  kinase inhibitors that might replace or be used in addition to some of the current anti-HER2 treatments. Combinations of anti-HER2 therapy with other agents like   inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors are also being extensively evaluated in clinical trials. These add-on strategies of combining optimized targeted therapies could potentially improve outcomes for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer but may also allow de-escalation of treatment in some patients, potentially sparing some from unnecessary treatments, and their related toxicities and costs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526549>-Mediated Therapies in Lymphoma.</a></h1><p>To review types of lymphoma, risk factors, and evaluate novel -mediated therapies, including side effects and management of -mediated toxicities.Published literature, national statistics, and Web sites.Novel biologic agents are being developed with the potential to improve outcomes.

In contrast, since adjuvant chemotherapy was first established twenty years ago as the standard of care, little has changed for resected early-stage (IB-IIIA) patients for whom the potential for cure is greatest. In this manuscript we will review recently presented data as well as ongoing/planned studies in this arena. So far, investigative efforts have yielded mixed results regarding the use of  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in early-stage NSCLC, though a series of now better planned, biomarker-driven ongoing phase III trials may be more informative. Several innovative immunotherapy studies have already shown promising results principally in the neoadjuvant setting with a large number of pivotal neo-adjuvant and adjuvant trials now in progress. Given the more robust design and biomarker-focused approach of the new generation of studies, significant advances in the optimal curative treatment of early stage NSCLC are anticipated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649889>Vitiligo Adverse Event Observed in a Patient With Durable Complete Response After Nivolumab for Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h1><p> Renal  carcinoma is the third most prevalent urological cancer worldwide and about 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic treatments for metastatic renal  carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However,   inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal  carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with  kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal  carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several -related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after 2 years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal  carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of -related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal  carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after   inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to immunotherapy in metastatic renal  carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577707>A case report of   inhibitor nivolumab combined with anti-angiogenesis agent anlotinib for advanced esophageal squamous  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The PD-1 inhibitors have shown good response in the treatment for many types of malignant tumors, but as monotherapy for advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, the objective response rate is low. Here we report a case of the patient with advanced esophageal squamous  carcinoma (ESCC) showing a completely response to nivolumab combined with a small molecule multi-target  kinase inhibitor (TKI) anlotinib.A 61-year-old male was put under a surgery as the response to the diagnosis of ESCC in March 2014.

Individuals with ILD have been excluded from most prospective clinical trials of lung cancer therapies because of the risk of ILD acute exacerbation. Thus, the optimal anticancer drug treatment for such patients has yet to be established.  kinase inhibitors are avoided for the treatment of advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) with ILD because of the concern of acute exacerbation, and information on the effects of - inhibitors is limited in these patients. Only three prospective single-arm studies of cytotoxic chemotherapies for advanced lung cancer with ILD have been reported. Based on the results of these studies and those of retrospective analyses, carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel are often selected in daily clinical practice for patients with NSCLC and ILD, whereas platinum plus etoposide is selected for those with small  lung cancer and ILD. Although the antitumor activity of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy appears similar in advanced lung cancer patients with and without ILD, its impact on overall survival of the former patients is limited. The risks and benefits of chemotherapy must therefore be carefully explained before treatment initiation, and careful follow-up is necessary for such patients, especially those with the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, a risk factor for chemotherapy-related exacerbation. Prospective clinical studies with large patient populations are still required to establish the appropriate treatments for advanced lung cancer with ILD.Copyright © 2018 The Japanese Respiratory Society.

Analysis of the epidermis from SUV-irradiated mice revealed rapid phosphorylation of STAT1 (pSTAT1) on both  (tyr701) and serine (ser727) residues and increased levels of IRF-1 while later timepoints showed increased levels of unphosphorylated STAT1 (uSTAT1). STAT1 activation led to upregulation of several proinflammatory chemokine mRNAs in epidermis including Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Ccl2, as well as, the   inhibitor Pd-l1. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2/COX2) were upregulated in epidermis following exposure to SUV. Mice with keratinocyte-specific STAT1 deletion did not exhibit increased IRF-1 or proinflammatory gene expression in epidermis. Furthermore, epidermal COX-2 induction after SUV exposure was significantly reduced in mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of STAT1. Additionally, SUV irradiation rapidly upregulated interferon gamma (IFNγ) mRNA in the epidermis and that skin resident epidermal CD3 + T-cells were the source of IFNγ production. IFNγ receptor-deficient mice confirmed dependency of STAT1 activation, proinflammatory gene expression and COX-2 upregulation in the epidermis on paracrine IFNγ signaling. Furthermore, keratinocyte-specific STAT1-deficiency reduced proliferation and hyperplasia due to SUV irradiation and this was associated with decreased  infiltration of mast cells in the dermis. Collectively, the current results demonstrate that exposure to SUV leads to upregulation of IFNγ and downstream pSTAT1/IRF-1/uSTAT1 signaling in the epidermis. Further study of this pathway could lead to identification of novel targets for the prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751136>Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Vaccine Antibodies Enhance the Efficacy of  Kinase Inhibitors and Delay the Emergence of Resistance in EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Mutations in EGFR correlate with impaired response to   inhibitors and the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches for EGFR mutant NSCLC is of particular interest. Immunization against epidermal growth factor (EGF) has shown efficacy in a phase III trial including unselected NSCLC patients, but little was known about the mechanisms involved in the effects of the anti-EGF antibodies generated by vaccination (anti-EGF VacAbs) or their activity in tumor cells with EGFR mutations.The EGFR-mutant, NSCLC  lines H1975, and PC9, together with several gefitinib and osimertinib-resistant cells derived from PC9, were treated with anti-EGF VacAbs and/or EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs).  viability was analyzed by proliferation assays,   by fluorescence-activated  sorting analysis, and levels of RNA and proteins by quantitative retro-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.Anti-EGF VacAbs generated in rabbits suppressed EGF-induced  proliferation and  progression and inhibited downstream EGFR signaling in EGFR-mutant cells. Sera from patients immunized with an EGF vaccine were also able to block activation of EGFR effectors. In combination, the anti-EGF VacAbs significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of all TKIs tested, suppressed Erk1/2 phosphorylation, blocked the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and downregulated the expression of AXL receptor  kinase (AXL). Finally, anti-EGF VacAbs significantly delayed the emergence in vitro of EGFR TKI resistant clones.EGFR-mutant patients can derive benefit from immunization against EGF, particularly if combined with EGFR TKIs.

This result suggests that leukaemia uses unique mechanisms to evade this therapy. Certain  inhibitory receptors that are expressed by normal  cells are also present on leukaemia cells. Whether these receptors can initiate -related primary signalling in tumour cells remains unknown. Here we use mouse models and human cells to show that LILRB4, an immunoreceptor -based inhibition motif-containing receptor and a marker of monocytic leukaemia, supports tumour  infiltration into tissues and suppresses T  activity via a signalling pathway that involves APOE, LILRB4, SHP-2, uPAR and ARG1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. Deletion of LILRB4 or the use of antibodies to block LILRB4 signalling impeded AML development. Thus, LILRB4 orchestrates tumour invasion pathways in monocytic leukaemia cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. LILRB4 represents a compelling target for the treatment of monocytic AML.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360140>Current and Future Systemic Therapies for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with unmet needs and limited effective therapeutic options. The management strategy for diagnosed HCC is based on Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging. Advanced HCC is treated with systemic therapy comprising oral  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and intravenous   inhibitors, provided that liver function is reasonable. Five new agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past 2 years for the treatment of HCC: lenvatinib in the first-line setting, and regorafenib, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cabozantinib as second-line therapies. The FDA is considering a label expansion of ramucirumab to include its use in HCC. These therapies have all been shown to extend overall patient survival and appear to have a reasonable safety profile. Multiple ongoing trials are studying   inhibition alone or in combination with TKIs. The results of these trials will help determine the optimal choice, timing, and sequence of agents. This article reviews the role of currently approved systemic therapies for HCC and highlights potential future combination therapeutic strategies. The article also brings forward the concept of a developing shift to the left for therapy, as mapped out in the BCLC staging and treatment algorithm, marking earlier use of systemic therapy prior to advanced progression of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634731>Gut microbiota and cancer: How gut microbiota modulates activity, efficacy and toxicity of antitumoral therapy.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota is involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.

Although complete tumor eradication is attainable in some cases, durable clinical responses are observed only in a small fraction of patients, underlining urgent need for improvement. We previously showed that RON, a receptor  kinase expressed in macrophages, suppresses antitumor  responses, and facilitates progression and metastasis of breast cancer. Here, we investigated the molecular changes that occur downstream of RON activation in macrophages, and whether inhibition of RON can cooperate with  immunotherapy to eradicate tumors. Activation of RON by its ligand, MSP, altered the gene expression profile of macrophages drastically and upregulated surface levels of CD80 and PD-L1, ligands for T-  receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of RON in combination with anti-CTLA-4, but not with anti-PD-1, resulted in improved clinical responses against orthotopically transplanted tumors compared to single-agent treatment groups, resulting in complete tumor eradication in 46% of the animals. Positive responses to therapy were associated with higher levels of T- activation markers and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Importantly, co-inhibition of RON and anti-CTLA-4 was also effective in clearing metastatic breast cancer cells in lungs, resulting in clinical responses in nearly 60% of the mice. These findings suggest that RON inhibition can be a novel approach to potentiate responses to  immunotherapy in breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387256>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Pathway, Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and the Regulation of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) in Non-Small  Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</a></h1><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is a well-studied oncogenic pathway in human non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). A subset of advanced NSCLC patients (15-55%) have EGFR-driven mutations and benefit from treatment with EGFR- kinase inhibitors (TKIs).   inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PDL-1 axis are a new anti-cancer therapy for metastatic NSCLC. The anti-PD-1/PDL-1 ICIs showed promising efficacy (~30% response rate) and improved the survival of patients with metastatic NSCLC, but the role of anti-PD-1/PDL-1 ICIs for EGFR mutant NSCLC is not clear. YAP (yes-associated protein) is the main mediator of the Hippo pathway and has been identified as promoting cancer progression, drug resistance, and metastasis in NSCLC. Here, we review recent studies that examined the correlation between the EGFR, YAP pathways, and PD-L1 and demonstrate the mechanism by which EGFR and YAP regulate PD-L1 expression in human NSCLC. About 50% of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs without known targetable secondary mutations. Targeting YAP therapy is suggested as a potential treatment for NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Future work should focus on the efficacy of YAP inhibitors in combination with   PD-L1/PD-1 blockade in EGFR mutant NSCLC without targetable resistant mutations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412566>The  Landscape of Thyroid Cancer in the Context of   Inhibition.</a></h1><p> cells play critical roles in tumor prevention as well as initiation and progression. However, -resistant cancer cells can evade the  system and proceed to form tumors. The normal microenvironment ( cells, fibroblasts, blood and lymphatic vessels, and interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM)) maintains tissue homeostasis and prevents tumor initiation. Inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and chemokines from an altered microenvironment promote tumor growth. During the last decade, thyroid cancer, the most frequent cancer of the endocrine system, has emerged as the fifth most incident cancer in the United States (USA), and its incidence is steadily growing. Inflammation has long been associated with thyroid cancer, raising critical questions about the role of  cells in its pathogenesis. A plethora of  cells and their mediators are present in the thyroid cancer ecosystem. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting  , such as mAbs anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) and anti-programmed  death protein-1/programmed  death ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1), have revolutionized the treatment of many malignancies, but they induce thyroid dysfunction in up to 10% of patients, presumably by enhancing autoimmunity. Combination strategies involving   inhibitors (ICIs) with  kinase (TK) or serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) inhibitors are showing considerable promise in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer. This review illustrates how different  cells contribute to thyroid cancer development and the rationale for the antitumor effects of ICIs in combination with BRAF/TK inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30147334>Adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung.</a></h1><p>Adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung (ASC), a relatively rare subtype of non-small- lung cancer, is defined as a malignancy containing components of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and lung squamous  carcinoma (SCC).

It is extremely difficult to diagnose preoperatively; pathology of surgically resected gross specimen is the most effective means for adequate diagnosis of ASC. Platinum-based postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for at least four cycles can significantly improve the survival in stage III patients with ASC. Epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as erlotinib and gefitinib can be the effective therapeutic strategies for advanced EGFR-mutant ASC.

Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (  inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib ( kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual  inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL-2 remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway. These emerging therapies include the combinations of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib, pembrolizumab/axitinib, avelumab/axitinib and atezolizumab/ bevacizu-mab and seem to introduce the mccRCC therapy in a new auspicious era. Moreover, emerging new targeted therapies and other, beyond ICIs, immunotherapies are currently underway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972888>Clinical significance of programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 expression in the tumor microenvironment of clear  renal  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Recently, immunotherapy based on blocking   with programmed death-1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Abs has been introduced for the treatment of advanced clear  renal  carcinoma (ccRCC), especially tumors resistant to vascular endothelial growth factor- kinase inhibitors (VEGF-TKIs), but the significance of their expression in the tumor microenvironment is unclear. We investigated these   markers in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating  cells (TIIC) in the tumor microenvironment of 100 untreated and 25 VEGF-TKI-treated primary ccRCC tissues. Upregulated expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 by TIIC, and PD-L1 by tumor cells was associated with the histological grade and unfavorable prognosis of RCC patients. High PD-1 and PD-L1 expression by TIIC was associated with a poorer response to VEGF-TKI, whereas PD-L1 expression by tumor cells did not affect the efficacy of the treatment. Furthermore, increased PD-1-positive TIIC and PD-L1-positive TIIC were observed in tumors treated with VEGF-TKIs compared with those in untreated tumors. Our data suggest that PD-1 and PD-L1 expression by TIIC in the tumor microenvironment is involved in treatment resistance, and that sequential therapy with   inhibitors could be a promising therapeutic strategy for ccRCC resistant to VEGF-TKI treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

In a preclinical study, VEGFR1+ clustering in lymph nodes (LNs) independently predicted time to biochemical recurrence (TTBR) in localized prostate cancer [1]. The hypothesis was that neoadjuvant pazopanib therapy will decrease VEGFR1+ clusters in pelvic lymph nodes and improve outcomes.This is a phase II trial () of neoadjuvant pazopanib 800 mg versus placebo daily for 4 weeks in high-risk localized prostate cancer. The primary endpoint was a decrease in VEGFR1+ MDSC clustering assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Secondary endpoints were safety, feasibility, and TTBR.Thirty patients were randomized to pazopanib versus placebo, with 15 patients randomized to each arm. Demographic and disease characteristics were similar in both arms. There was no difference in the VEGFR1+ clustering between the treatment arms (p = .345). Neoadjuvant therapy with pazopanib was well tolerated, and surgical complications were similar in both arms.Neoadjuvant pazopanib therapy did not alter the premetastatic niche; however, treatment targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the preoperative period was safe and feasible, which may open up the avenue to investigate novel combinatorial regimens, including a VEGF inhibitor in combination with   inhibitor in this setting.© AlphaMed Press; the data published online to support this summary is the property of the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30454551>[Molecular Mechanism of Different Signaling Pathways in Regulating PD-L1 Expression in EGFR Mutated Lung Adenocarcinoma].</a></h1><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)   inhibitors were landmarks in the treatment of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC).

Traditionally surgery, when indicated, and radiation therapy, either as whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery, constituted the major treatment options for brain metastases. Until recently, most of the systemic chemotherapy agents had limited activity for brain metastases. However, with the advent of small molecule  kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy agents, there has been renewed interest in using these agents in the management of brain metastases.  inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer among others. They modulate the  system to recognize tumor antigens as "non-self" antigens and mount an  response against them. Initial studies of using   inhibitors in brain metastases have shown promising activity, and several clinical trials are currently underway. Studies are also assessing the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy in brain metastases. The results of these ongoing clinical trials have the potential to change the therapeutic paradigm in patients with brain metastases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540976>Triple Therapy with MerTK and PD1 Inhibition plus Radiotherapy Promotes Abscopal Antitumor  Responses.</a></h1><p>Radiotherapy (RT) traditionally has been used for local tumor control in the treatment of cancer. The recent discovery that radiotherapy can have anti-cancer effects on the  system has led to recognition of its ability to sensitize the tumor microenvironment to immunotherapy. However, radiation can also prompt adverse immunosuppressive effects that block aspects of systemic response at other tumor sites. Our hypothesis was that inhibition of the MER proto-oncogene  kinase (MerTK) in combination with anti-programmed  death-1 (α-PD1)  blockade will enhance -mediated responses to radiotherapy.We tested the efficacy of this triple therapy (Radiation + α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs) in 129Sv/Ev mice with bilateral lung adenocarcinoma xenografts. Primary tumors were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (36 Gy in three 12-Gy fractions), and tumors were monitored for response.The triple therapy significantly delayed abscopal tumor growth, improved survival rates, and reduced numbers of lung metastases. We further found that the triple therapy increased the activated CD8 and NK cells populations measured by granzyme B expression with upregulation of CD8CD103 tissue-resident memory cells (T) within the abscopal tumor microenvironment relative to radiation only.The addition of α-PD1 + α-MerTK mAbs to radiotherapy could alter the  death to be more immunogenic and generate adaptive  response via increasing the retention of T cells in the tumor islets of the abscopal tumors which was proven to play a major role in survival of non-small  lung cancer patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799404>Non-Clear  Renal  Carcinoma - Pathology and Treatment Options.</a></h1><p>Non-clear  renal  carcinomas (nccRCC) are rare diseases with heterogeneous histopathologically and genetically defined entities. The clinical data on optimal systemic treatments of nccRCC is rather limited. In this review, the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of nccRCC based on histopathologic and genetic findings is reported. Regarding systemic treatment options, the most commonly used agents are mTOR inhibitors like everolimus or temsirolimus, or  kinase inhibitors like sunitinib. 2 small randomized clinical trials with nccRCC comparing sunitinib with everolimus revealed a trend towards a better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in favor of sunitinib. In RCC with predominant sarcomatoid features, both chemotherapy and targeted agents are reported without any preference for outcome. For subsequent lines of therapy, some case reports describe promising effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in nccRCC including sarcomatoid subtype and Bellini duct carcinoma. Currently, nccRCCs are treated similarly to clear  RCC or, whenever possible, within clinical trials. Clinical trials with   inhibitors are ongoing.© 2019 S.

While single agent pembrolizumab has become the standard therapy in patients with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells ≥ 50%, the combination of pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy has emerged as an effective first line treatment regardless of PD-L1 expression both in squamous and non-squamous NSCLC without oncogenic drivers. Furthermore, double   inhibition has shown promising results in treatment naïve patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB). Of note, the presence of both negative PD-L1 expression and low TMB may identify a subgroup of patients who has little benefit from immunotherapy combinations and for whom the best treatment option may still be platinum-based chemotherapy. To date, first-line single agent   blockade has demonstrated limited activity in EGFR mutated NSCLC and the combination of immunotherapy and targeted agents has raised safety concerns in both EGFR and ALK positive NSCLC patients. Finally, in EGFR mutated or ALK rearranged NSCLC, atezolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab is emerging as a potential treatment option upon progression to first line  kinase inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Children treated with external radiation therapy are at the highest risk for developing a thyroid-related late effect, but thyroid dysfunction and second primary thyroid neoplasms can also occur after treatment with radiopharmaceutical agents such as 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine. Increasingly recognized is the development of early thyroid dysfunction as an off-target consequence of the more novel cancer therapeutics such as the  kinase inhibitors and   inhibitors. Thyroid sequelae resulting from irradiation may manifest only after years to decades of follow-up, and their resultant clinical symptoms may be indolent and non-specific. Therefore, lifelong monitoring of the childhood cancer survivor at risk for thyroid disease is paramount.

Treatment outcomes with afatinib, in patients with or without  kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy prior to afatinib, were similar to previously reported clinical trials. Stratification of patients by the presence or absence of TKI pretreatment before afatinib, and the presence or absence of an acquired T790M mutation found no statistical difference in overall survival.This population-based study found that the disadvantages of pretreatment before afatinib, and absence of an acquired T790M EGFR mutation, could be overcome by an appropriate treatment strategy in clinical practice.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, molecular evidence of  expansion, acquisition of tumor cytotoxicity, and safety of CIK cells is required before putting them to clinical use. Here, we performed dynamic transcriptomic analyses of CIKs generated from primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to interferon-γ, OKT3, and interleukin-2. CIK mRNAs were extracted and sequenced at days 0, 1, 7, and 14 and subjected to bioinformatics analyses. Using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), we identified two major gene modules that mediate   activation and mitosis. We found that activation and cytotoxicity of CIK cells likely rely on cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and its protein partner LCK proto-oncogene, Src family  kinase (LCK). A time-course series analysis revealed that CIK cells have relatively low immunogenicity because of decreased expression of some self-antigens. Importantly, we identified several crucial activating receptors and auxiliary adhesion receptors expressed on CIK cells that may function as tumor sensors. Interestingly, cytotoxicity-associated genes, including those encoding PRF1, GZMB, FASL, and several cytokines, were up-regulated in mature CIK cells. Most - molecules and inflammatory tumor-promoting factors were down-regulated in the CIK cells, suggesting efficacy and safety in future clinical trials. Notably, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was highly expressed in CIK cells and may promote cytotoxicity, although it also could facilitate tumorigenesis. The transcriptomic atlas of CIK cells presented here may inform efforts to improve CIK-associated tumor cytotoxicity and safety in clinical trials.© 2018 Meng et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791458>Mouse-Derived Isograft (MDI) In Vivo Tumor Models II. Carcinogen-Induced cMDI Models: Characterization and Cancer Therapeutic Approaches.</a></h1><p>In this second study, we established syngeneic in vivo models named carcinogen-induced mouse-derived isografts (cMDIs). Carcinogen-induced tumors were obtained during short-term observation (3⁻9 months) of CBA/J mice treated with various administration routes with 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) or -methyl--nitrosourea (MNU) as carcinogens. During necropsy, primary tumors and suspicious tissues were assessed macroscopically and re-transplanted (in PDX-like manner) into sex-matched syngeneic animals. Outgrowing tumors were histologically characterized as either spinocellular carcinoma (1/8) or various differentiated sarcomas (7/8). Growth curves of four sarcomas showed striking heterogeneity. These cMDIs were further characterized by flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, or efficacy studies. A variable invasion of  cells into the tumors, as well as varying expression of  kinase receptor, IFN-γ signature, or   population marker genes could be observed.   inhibitor treatment (anti-mPD-1, anti-mCTLA-4, or a combination thereof) showed different responses in the various cMDI models. In general, cMDI models are carcinogen-induced tumors of low passage number that were propagated as tissue pieces in mice without any tissue culturing. Therefore, the tumors contained conserved tumor characteristics and intratumoral   populations. In contrast to the previously described spontaneous MDI, carcinogen induction resulted in a greater number of individual but histologically related tumors, which were preferentially sarcomas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526458>Molecular Mechanisms and Targeted Therapies Including Immunotherapy for Non-Small  Lung Cancer.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Molecular targeted therapy has greatly advanced the field of treatment for non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for the majority of lung cancers. Indeed, gefitinib, which was the first molecular targeted therapeutic agent, has actually doubled the survival time of NSCLC patients. Vigorous efforts of clinicians and researchers have revealed that lung cancer develops through the activating mutations of many driver genes including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) genes. Although ALK, ROS1, and RET are rare genetic abnormalities, corresponding  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can exert dramatic therapeutic effects. In addition to anticancer drugs targeting driver genes, bevacizumab specifically binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and blocks the VEGF signaling pathway. The VEGF signal blockade suppresses angiogenesis in tumor tissues and inhibits tumor growth. In this review, we also explore immunotherapy, which is a promising new NSCLC treatment approach. In general, antitumor  responses are suppressed in cancer patients, and cancer cells escape from the  surveillance mechanism.   inhibitors (ICIs) are antibodies that target the primary escape mechanisms,  . Patients who respond to ICIs are reported to experience longlasting therapeutic effects. A wide range of clinical approaches, including combination therapy involving chemotherapy or radiation plus adjuvant therapy, are being developed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29757193>Eya3 promotes breast tumor-associated  suppression via threonine phosphatase-mediated PD-L1 upregulation.</a></h1><p>Eya proteins are critical developmental regulators that are highly expressed in embryogenesis but downregulated after development. Amplification and/or re-expression of Eyas occurs in many tumor types. In breast cancer, Eyas regulate tumor progression by acting as transcriptional cofactors and  phosphatases. Intriguingly, Eyas harbor a separate threonine (Thr) phosphatase activity, which was previously implicated in innate immunity. Here we describe what we believe to be a novel role for Eya3 in mediating triple-negative breast cancer-associated  suppression. Eya3 loss decreases tumor growth in -competent mice and is associated with increased numbers of infiltrated CD8+ T cells, which, when depleted, reverse the effects of Eya3 knockdown. Mechanistically, Eya3 utilizes its Thr phosphatase activity to dephosphorylate Myc at pT58, resulting in a stabilized form. We show that Myc is required for Eya3-mediated increases in PD-L1, and that rescue of PD-L1 in Eya3-knockdown cells restores tumor progression. Finally, we demonstrate that Eya3 significantly correlates with PD-L1 in human breast tumors, and that tumors expressing high levels of Eya3 have a decreased CD8+ T  signature. Our data uncover a role for Eya3 in mediating tumor-associated  suppression, and suggest that its inhibition may enhance  therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30234011>Brain Radiation Necrosis: Current Management With a Focus on Non-small  Lung Cancer Patients.</a></h1><p>As the prognosis of metastatic non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is constantly improving with advances in systemic therapies (  blockers and new generation of targeted molecular compounds), more attention should be paid to the diagnosis and management of treatments-related long-term secondary effects. Brain metastases (BM) occur frequently in the natural history of NSCLC and stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) is one of the main efficient local non-invasive therapeutic methods. However, SRT may have some disabling side effects. Brain radiation necrosis (RN) represents one of the main limiting toxicities, generally occurring from 6 months to several years after treatment. The diagnosis of RN itself may be quite challenging, as conventional imaging is frequently not able to differentiate RN from BM recurrence. Retrospective studies have suggested increased incidence rates of RN in NSCLC patients with oncogenic driver mutations [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive] or receiving  kinase inhibitors. The risk of   inhibitors in contributing to RN remains controversial. Treatment modalities for RN have not been prospectively compared. Those include surveillance, corticosteroids, bevacizumab and local interventions (minimally invasive laser interstitial thermal ablation or surgery). The aim of this review is to describe and discuss possible RN management options in the light of the newly available literature, with a particular focus on NSCLC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899754>Immunotherapy in renal  carcinoma: latest evidence and clinical implications.</a></h1><p>Advances in understanding the mechanisms of tumour-induced immunosuppression have led to the development of - inhibitors in cancer patients, including those with renal  carcinoma (RCC).

In parallel with clinical trials combining CDK4/6 inhibitors to treat HER2+ breast cancer, we sought to prospectively model tumor evolution in response to this regimen in vivo and identify a clinically actionable strategy to combat drug resistance. Despite a promising initial response, acquired resistance emerges rapidly to the combination of anti-HER2/neu antibody and CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib. Using high-throughput single- profiling over the course of treatments, we reveal a distinct immunosuppressive immature myeloid  (IMC) population to infiltrate the resistant tumors. Guided by single- transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that combination of IMC-targeting  kinase inhibitor cabozantinib and   blockade enhances anti-tumor immunity, and overcomes the resistance. Furthermore, sequential combinatorial immunotherapy enables a sustained control of the fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant tumors.

We recently observed that high-dose (final concentration in vivo: ~10 µM) crizotinib can induce immunogenic  death (ICD) in cancer cells lacking ALK/ROS1 activation through off-target effects that require the inhibition of several other  kinases. When combined with cisplatin (which alone does not induce ICD), crizotinib sensitizes NSCLC models to subsequent immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade, allowing to cure more than 90% of established orthotopic cancers. Of note, simultaneous treatment of mice with cisplatin, crizotinib and PD-1 blocking antibodies causes acute hepatotoxicity that can be avoided by a sequential regimen involving initial treatment with cisplatin plus crizotinib, followed by PD-1 blockade one week later. It will be important to translate these results obtained in mice into a clinical trial in NSCLC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331862>Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma Rapidly Progressive to Sunitinib: What to Do Next?</a></h1><p>From 10% to 26% of patients with metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) experience rapidly progressive disease (PD) on treatment with sunitinib.To investigate the benefit of subsequent treatment with another  kinase inhibitor (TKI) or a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in such primary refractory patients.A total of 150 mRCC patients with rapidly PD on first-line sunitinib (within two cycles, n=93, or four cycles, n=57) were identified: median age 59yr; nephrectomy 86%; histological subtypes: clear  (77.8%), papillary (14%), and sarcomatoid features (18%); according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and French classifications: good risk (11% and 7%, respectively), intermediate (68% and 63%, respectively), and poor (21% and 29%, respectively).Data were retrospectively collected by a questionnaire from 19 European oncology centers between March 2005 and March 2011. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated (Kaplan-Meier method).Median OS from the start of first-line treatment was 7.4mo. Second-line treatment was administered to 86 (57%) patients (44 mTOR inhibitors: 23 everolimus and 21 temsirolimus; 39 TKIs alone or in combination; three chemotherapy). Second-line PFS was not significantly different between TKIs and mTOR inhibitors (2.0 vs 0.9mo; p=0.536). Median OS from the start of second-line treatment was 5.0mo for mTOR inhibitors and 6.6mo for TKIs (p=0.15).Treatment with further TKIs or mTOR inhibitors for mRCC patients primarily refractory to first-line sunitinib in the observed time period achieved very minimal benefit, suggesting avoiding TKI rechallenge and possibly preferring alternative strategies, such as   inhibitors, after PD to a treatment line including a TKI in this setting.The present work collected data about 150 patients affected by metastatic renal  carcinoma, who received one of the current standard of care as first-line treatment, namely, the antiangiogenic drug sunitinib, and experienced rapid worsening of the disease. We investigated and described the subsequent outcome of such patients treated with two different types of drug, administered as second-line therapy, to better understand the best strategy to adopt for patients who got no benefit from sunitinib and to describe the current therapeutic approach in such cases.Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology.

However, there is no definitive conclusion about how the inhibition of PTPN3 in lymphocytes affects  functions in human lymphocytes. In the present study, we showed that PTPN3 inhibition significantly contributes to the enhanced activation of activated human lymphocytes. The PTPN3 expression of lymphocytes was significantly increased through the activation process using IL-2 and anti-CD3 mAb. Interestingly, inhibiting the PTPN3 expression in activated lymphocytes significantly augmented the proliferation, migration, and cytotoxicity through the phosphorylation of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70), lymphocyte-specific protein  kinase (LCK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Lymphocyte activation by PTPN3 inhibition was observed only in activated CD3 T cells and not in NK cells or resting T cells.

Since 2006, the standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic RCC has been multitargeted  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. RCCs are highly vascularized tumors, and their angiogenesis is controlled by  kinases that play a vital role in growth factor signaling to stimulate this process. TKI therapy was introduced for direct targeting of angiogenesis in RCC. TKIs have been moderately successful in the treatment of metastatic RCC and initially increased cancer-specific survival times. However, RCC rapidly becomes resistant to TKIs, and no current drug has produced a cure for advanced RCC.  We provide an overview of RCC, explain some reasons for therapy resistance in RCC, and describe some therapies that may overcome resistance to TKIs. The key pathways that determine therapy resistance are illustrated.  Factors involved in the development and progression of RCC include genetic mutations, activation of hypoxia-inducible factor and related proteins, cellular metabolism, the tumor microenvironment, and growth factors and their receptors. Resistance to the therapeutic potential of TKIs can be acquired or intrinsic. Alternative therapies include other small molecule drugs and immunotherapy based on   blockade.  The treatment of RCC is undergoing a paradigm shift from sole use of small molecule antiangiogenesis TKIs as first-line therapy to include newly approved agents for second-line and third-line therapy that now involve the mTOR pathway and   blockade drugs for patients with advanced RCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30877100>Circulating Tumor DNA Provides a Sneak Peek into Treatment Responses in Non-Small  Lung Cancer.</a></h1><p>Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds great promise as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to guide treatment for patients with lung cancer.

The authors evaluated the expression of inhibitory receptors (programmed  death protein 1 [PD1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA4], lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], T- immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM3]) and stimulatory receptors (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein [GITR], OX40, 41BB [a type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein receptor], inducible T- costimulatory [ICOS]) on T- subsets and the expression of their ligands (41BBL, B7-1, B7-2, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, and OX40L) on AML blasts. Expression of these markers was correlated with patient age, karyotype, baseline next-generation sequencing for 28 myeloid-associated genes (including P53), and DNA methylation proteins (DNA methyltransferase 3α, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1[IDH1], IDH2, Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 [TET2], and Fms-related  kinase 3 [FLT3]).On histochemistry evaluation, the T- population in BM appeared to be preserved in patients who had AML compared with healthy donors. The proportion of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in BMAs was higher in patients with AML than in healthy donors. PD1-positive/OX40-positive T cells were more frequent in AML BMAs, and a higher frequency of PD1-positive/cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive T cells coexpressed TIM3 or LAG3. PD1-positive/CD8-positive T cells were more frequent in BMAs from patients who had multiply relapsed AML than in BMAs from those who had first relapsed or newly diagnosed AML. Blasts in BMAs from patients who had TP53-mutated AML were more frequently positive for PD-L1.The preserved T- population, the increased frequency of regulatory T cells, and the expression of targetable  receptors in AML BMAs suggest a role for T--harnessing therapies in AML.© 2018 The Authors.

Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in research and a better understanding of the molecular pathways of NSCLC, few effective therapeutic options are available for most patients with NSCLC without druggable targets, especially for patients with squamous  NSCLC.   inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have demonstrated durable response rates across a broad range of solid tumors, including NSCLC, which has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors. Here, we review the current status and future approaches of   inhibitors that are being investigated for NSCLC with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587590>  inhibition for the treatment of renal  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>: The systemic therapy in metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) is moving from  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors to   inhibitors and its combination with TKIs. : This review provides a general overview using   inhibition for the treatment of RCC. Clinical results from conducted and ongoing clinical trials are summarized and  inhibition is reviewed in the context to other available systemic therapies such as TKIs for mRCC based on the different International Metastastic RCC Database Consortium (IMCD) risk groups. Furthermore, prospects for the use of predictive biomarkers in the decision-making process of chosen therapy will be given. : Using  inhibition in mRCC has demonstrated a superior efficacy for patients with IMDC intermediate and poor risk for ipilimumab combined with nivolumab. Furthermore, therapeutic regimes with  kinase inhibition plus  -inhibition were recently presented and demonstrated superiority in all risk groups for axitinib plus pembrolizumab in overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) and axitinib plus avelumab in PFS compared to sunitinib monotherapy.

Cediranib, a -kinase inhibitor, has shown substantial activity in ASPS in non-randomised studies. The Cediranib in Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (CASPS) study was designed to discriminate the effect of cediranib from the intrinsically indolent nature of ASPS.In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial, we recruited participants from 12 hospitals in the UK (n=7), Spain (n=3), and Australia (n=2). Patients were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older; metastatic ASPS that had progressed in the previous 6 months; had an ECOG performance status of 0-1; life expectancy of more than 12 weeks; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Participants had to have no anti-cancer treatment within 4 weeks before trial entry, with exception of palliative radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1), with allocation by use of computer-generated random permuted blocks of six, to either cediranib (30 mg orally, once daily) or matching placebo tablets for 24 weeks. Treatment was supplied in number-coded bottles, masking participants and clinicians to assignment. Participants were unblinded at week 24 or sooner if they had progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1); those on placebo crossed over to cediranib and all participants continued on treatment until progression or death. The primary endpoint was percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters between baseline and week 24 or progression if sooner, assessed in the evaluable population (all randomly assigned participants who had a scan at week 24 [or sooner if they progressed] with target marker lesions measured). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number ; the European Clinical Trials database, number EudraCT2010-021163-33; and the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN63733470 recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing.Between July 15, 2011, and July 29, 2016, of 48 participants recruited, all were randomly assigned to cediranib (n=32) or placebo (n=16). 23 (48%) were female and the median age was 31 years (IQR 27-45). Median follow-up was 34·3 months (IQR 23·7-55·6) at the time of data cutoff for these analyses (April 11, 2018). Four participants in the cediranib group were not evaluable for the primary endpoint (one did not start treatment, and three did not have their scan at 24 weeks). Median percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters for the evaluable population was -8·3% (IQR -26·5 to 5·9) with cediranib versus 13·4% (IQR 1·1 to 21·3) with placebo (one-sided p=0·0010). The most common grade 3 adverse events on (blinded) cediranib were hypertension (six [19%] of 31) and diarrhoea (two [6%]). 15 serious adverse reactions in 12 patients were reported; 12 of these reactions occurred on open-label cediranib, and the most common symptoms were dehydration (n=2), vomiting (n=2), and proteinuria (n=2). One probable treatment-related death (intracranial haemorrhage) occurred 41 days after starting open-label cediranib in a patient who was assigned to placebo in the masked phase.Given the high incidence of metastatic disease and poor long-term prognosis of ASPS, together with the lack of efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, our finding of significant clinical activity with cediranib in this disease is an important step towards the goal of long-term disease control for these young patients. Future clinical trials in ASPS are also likely to involve   inhibitors.Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although the direct targets of PD-1 were not identified, its inhibitory action on the TCR signaling pathway was known much earlier. Recent experiments suggest that the PD-1 inhibits the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways at a very early stage ─ at the level of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of TCR and CD28 receptors. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the influence of inhibitory effect of PD-1 on the activation of early TCR and CD28 signaling molecules. Proposed model recaptures several quantitative experimental observations of PD-1 mediated inhibition. Model simulations show that PD-1 imposes a net inhibitory effect on the Lck kinase. Further, the inhibitory effect of PD-1 on the activation of TCR signaling molecules such as Zap70 and SLP76 is significantly enhanced by the PD-1 mediated inhibition of Lck. These results suggest a critical role for Lck as a mediator for PD-1 induced inhibition of TCR signaling network.

The treatment of these oncogene-addicted tumors has dramatically changed the outcome of these patients, where  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and rearranged anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have paved the way for a new era of precision cancer medicine. Another paradigm shift in the treatment of NSCLC, as well as numerous other tumor types, has been the introduction of immunotherapy (IO) with   inhibitors targeting mainly programmed  death-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PDL-L1, where studies have demonstrated an increased survival versus standard treatment with chemotherapy, both in the first- and second-line setting. However, the role of IO in oncogene-addicted NSCLC is still unclear where most clinical data come from subgroup analyses with low number of patients in larger randomized trials, and these data do not support the use of IO after TKI in this category of NSCLC patients. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing evidence about the use of IO in oncogenic-addicted NSCLC and highlight the issues that should be addressed in the future in order to define the role of IO for these patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443471>The Changing Therapeutic Landscape of Metastatic Renal Cancer.</a></h1><p>The practising clinician treating a patient with metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma (CCRCC) faces a difficult task of choosing the most appropriate therapeutic regimen in a rapidly developing field with recommendations derived from clinical trials. NCCN guidelines for kidney cancer initiated a major shift in risk categorization and now include emerging treatments in the neoadjuvant setting. Updates of European Association of Urology clinical guidelines also include   inhibition as the first-line treatment. Randomized trials have demonstrated a survival benefit for ipilimumab and nivolumab combination in the intermediate and poor-risk group, while pembrolizumab plus axitinib combination is recommended not only for unfavorable disease but also for patients who fit the favorable risk category. Currently vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapy based on  kinase inhibitors (TKI), sunitinib and pazopanib is the alternative regimen for patients who cannot tolerate   inhibitors (ICI). Cabozantinib remains a valid alternative option for the intermediate and high-risk group. For previously treated patients with TKI with progression, nivolumab, cabozantinib, axitinib, or the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab appear the most plausible alternatives. For patients previously treated with ICI, any VEGF-targeted therapy, not previously used in combination with ICI therapy, seems to be a valid option, although the strength of this recommendation is weak. The indication for cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) is also changing. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy does not add perioperative morbidity and can help identify non-responders, avoiding unnecessary surgery. However, the role of CN should be investigated under the light of new immunotherapeutic interventions. Also, markers of response to ICI need to be identified before the optimal selection of therapy could be determined for a particular patient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31348025>The current role for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy in renal  cancer.</a></h1><p>Here we explore the recent and relevant trials for treatment of renal  cancer (RCC) in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings as well as recent updates to the guidelines for RCC management.Most phase III studies of  kinase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting have been negative. Notably, sunitinib received regulatory approval by the FDA after showing improved disease-free survival in high risk populations. Recent improvements in the genetic classification and understanding of RCC molecular and genetic disorder will hopefully improve patient selection. Meanwhile, recent advances in metastatic RCC treatment, particularly with the combination of  kinase inhibitors and   inhibitors, have given rise to hope that advances can be made by moving these treatment strategies forward to the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings.In the absence of a clinical trial, observation remains the standard of care. Based on the S-TRAC data, sunitinib is approved for use in the adjuvant setting, and can be considered under select circumstances. Although there is optimism for  monotherapy and combination therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, ongoing studies will determine clinical benefit and tolerability in this setting. Therefore, for patients with high risk of recurrent disease clinical trials of  inhibitor therapy are viable options.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30270693>Cardiotoxicity of cancer chemotherapy in clinical practice.</a></h1><p>Several anticancer agents are associated with significant cardiotoxicity. The list of cardiotoxic cancer therapeutic agents includes anthracyclines, trastuzumab, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, which have been in use for decades; and recently introduced anticancer therapies such as  kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors,  inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors. Cardiac imaging using echocardiography, nuclear imaging techniques, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can help in the early detection of chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity. This can prevent the morbidity and mortality resulting from the cardiotoxicity of these agents. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism of their cardiotoxicity and to develop newer preventive and therapeutic strategies for chemotherapy related cardiotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29922881>Cardiotoxicity of Novel Targeted Chemotherapeutic Agents.</a></h1><p>With the continuing development of newer targeted therapies in oncology, it is necessary to understand their potential cardiovascular side effects. In this review, we discuss the association of novel targeted agents and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.Within the last 5 years, multiple new agents have been developed to target specific cancer pathways and found to have off-targeted cardiotoxicity. The most recent example is the recognition of myocarditis caused by   inhibitors. The development of targeted cancer therapies has revolutionized oncology, but many of these agents are inherently toxic to the cardiovascular system. Nearly all vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors cause cardiotoxicity to varying degrees. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors developed since the discovery of trastuzumab are significantly less cardiotoxic than their predecessor, but still convene risk. BCR-ABL  kinase inhibitors (TKI), once thought to pose significant risk as a class effect, appear to only be cardiotoxic if they have anti-VEGF activity. The newer generation of proteasome inhibitors such as carfilzomib appears to have significant cardiotoxicity, with almost 5% of patients developing symptomatic heart failure (HF).   inhibitors can very rarely cause rapidly fatal myocarditis. As of now, there are no sufficient guidelines to direct clinical care for patients on these new classes of agents, but this is likely to change as more data and clinical experience accumulate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30910561>Molecular cloning, expression and characterization of Pekin duck programmed death-1.</a></h1><p>Programmed death-1 (PD-1) has a pivotal role in the attenuation of adaptive  responses and peripheral tolerance. Here we describe the identification of the Pekin duck programmed death-1 orthologue (duPD-1). The duPD-1 cDNA encodes a 283-amino acid polypeptide that has an amino acid identity of 70%, 32% and 31% with chicken, murine and human PD-1, respectively. The duck PD-1 gene shares five conserved exons with chicken, murine and human PD-1 genes. A cluster of putative regulatory elements within the conserved region B (CR-B) of the basal promotor is conserved. Homology modeling was most compatible with the two β-sheet IgV domain structure of murine PD-1. Contact residues, shown to be critical for binding of the respective human and murine PD-1 ligands are mostly conserved between avian and mammalian species, whereas residues that define the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor -based switch motif (ITSM) are highly conserved across higher vertebrates and frog. Constitutive expression of duPD-1 transcripts was predominantly found in lymphocyte-rich tissues, and mitogen-stimulation of duck peripheral blood mononuclear cells transiently increased duPD-1 mRNA expression. A soluble duPD-1 protein was expressed and shown to engage the identified duck PD-1 ligands. Our observations show considerable evolutionary conservation between mammalian and avian PD-1 orthologues. This work will facilitate further investigation of the role of PD-1 signaling in adaptive immunity in the Pekin duck, a non-mammalian vertebrate and pathogen host with relevance for human and animal health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Differently from melanoma and non-small  lung cancer, where the use of   inhibitors results in a high efficacy, the response rate in other tumors, such as gastrointestinal cancers, breast cancer, sarcomas, and part of genitourinary cancers remains low. The first strategy evaluated to improve the response rate to   inhibitors is the use of predictive factors for the response such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and clinical features. In addition to the identification of the patients with a higher expression of   molecules, another approach currently under intensive investigation is the use of therapeutics in a combinatory manner with   inhibitors in order to obtain an enhancement of efficacy through the modification of the tumor  microenvironment. In addition to the abscopal effect induced by radiotherapy, a lot of studies are evaluating several drugs able to improve the response rate to   inhibitors, including microbiota modifiers, drugs targeting co-inhibitory receptors, anti-angiogenic therapeutics, small molecules, and oncolytic viruses.

For patients with oncogene-addicted metastatic NSCLC harbouring an epidermal growth factor receptor () or v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 () mutation or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase () or ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor  kinase () gene alteration (translocation, fusion, amplification) mutation-specific  kinase inhibitors (TKI) are already first-line standard treatment, while targeted treatment for other driver mutations affecting  human epidermal growth factor receptor ( 2, tropomyosin receptor kinases () 1-3 and others are currently under investigation. The role of ICI in these patient subgroups is currently under debate. This article summarises a round-table discussion organised by ESMO Open in Vienna in July 2018. It reviews current clinical data on ICI treatment in patients with metastatic oncogene-addicted NSCLC and discusses molecular diagnostic assessment, potential biomarkers and radiological methods for response evaluation of ICI treatment. The round-table panel concluded ICI should only be considered in patients with oncogene-addicted NSCLC after exhaustion of effective targeted therapies and in some cases possibly after all other therapies including chemotherapies.

Nevertheless, the number of patients experiencing clinical benefit from immunotherapy is still limited, while others obtain more benefit from  kinase inhibitors (TKI). The identification of prognostic and predictive factors would be crucial to better select patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy among the other potentially available therapeutic options. : This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge (2010-2019) on molecular prognostic and predictive biomarkers, assessed in peripheral blood and/or from tumor tissue, in mRCC patients treated with ICI. : Among all the biomarkers analyzed, PD-L1 expression on tumor tissue is the most studied. It has an unfavorable prognostic role for patients treated with TKI, which seems to be overcome by ICI-based combinations. Nevertheless, no clear predictive role of immunotherapy efficacy has been observed for PD-L1 in mRCC. Emerging evidence regarding pro-angiogenic or pro-immunogenic genomic and transcriptomic signatures suggests a potential predictive role in patients treated with ICI-based combinations. The rationale for TKI-ICI combinations is based on tumor microenvironment and genomic background, which represent the target of these two main therapeutic options for mRCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225907>Adjuvant therapy in renal  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Localized renal  carcinoma (RCC) has an associated risk of recurrence after nephrectomy.

However, acquired resistance is inevitable since the vast majority of patients experience disease relapse within ~1-2 years. Osimertinib is a novel irreversible, covalent third-generation EGFR-TKI and potent inhibitor of  T790M mutation, the most common mechanism of acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs. Several trials have consistently demonstrated the superior clinical activity and safety of osimertinib in patients with advanced NSCLC and acquired  T790M mutation after treatment with a first-generation EGFR-TKI. Recently, the efficacy of osimertinib in a first-line setting was demonstrated to be clearly superior to standard-first line treatment in patients with -mutant NSCLC regardless of T790M mutation status. Nevertheless, this advance, several unresolved issues of osimertinib should be emphasized including the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib, the feasibility of testing  T790M mutation from plasma circulating tumor DNA, its efficacy to patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases or exon 20 mutations, its combination with other therapeutic strategies such as   inhibitors and its role in adjuvant therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30237743> molecule PD-1-assisted CD8 T lymphocyte count in tumor microenvironment predicts overall survival of patients with metastatic renal  carcinoma treated with  kinase inhibitors.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether CD8 T lymphocyte and its -associated module programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1)/main ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) pathway impact overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) treated with  kinase inhibitors (TKIs).A total of 231 mRCC patients, from 2007 to 2017, treated with sunitinib or sorafenib in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were included in the study analyses. CD8, PD-1, and PD-L1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry on continuous paraffin-embedded slides. Kaplan-Meier method and COX regression model were applied in the survival analyses.Baseline characteristics were comparable between the training (n=118) and validation (n=113) sets. Patients with high CD8 T lymphocytes infiltration and low PD-1 expression had longer survival in both sets (=0.0106 and =0.0047 in training set, =0.0291 and =0.0011 in validation set, respectively). However, survival stratified by PD-L1 was only insignificant or marginally significant. Multivariable analyses verified that CD8 T lymphocytes, together with PD-1, but not tumor infiltrating mononuclear cells or tumor cells PD-L1, were independent prognostic factors (training set [HR 3.202, 95% CI 1.433-7.153, =0.011] and validation set [HR 4.012, 95% CI 2.354-6.838, <0.001]). Subsequent analysis revealed that the PD-1 high/CD8 low group had shorter survival (16 months) than PD-1 low/CD8 high group (51 months, <0.0001). Combining the International Metastatic Renal Cancer Database Consortium system with the PD-1/CD8 model exhibited much better accuracy for the prediction of OS.Our findings suggest that abundant CD8 T cells are significantly associated with longer OS in mRCC patients treated with TKIs. The most influential -associated molecule, PD-1, assisted CD8 T -stratified patients and could be used as a better predictive and prognostic factor for the mRCC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29774061>Immunotherapy in non-metastatic non-small  lung cancer: Can the benefits of stage IV therapy be translated into earlier stages?</a></h1><p>Over the last decade, several steps forward in the treatment of patients with stage IV non-small  lung cancer (NCSLC) were made. Examples are the use of pemetrexed, pemetrexed maintenance therapy, or bevacizumab for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. A big leap forward was the use of  kinase inhibitors in patients selected on the basis of an activating oncogene, such as epidermal growth factor receptor () activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase () translocations. However, all of these achievements could not be translated into survival benefits when studied in randomized controlled trials in patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC. Aside from chemotherapy and targeted therapy, immunotherapy has become the third pillar in the treatment armamentarium of advanced NSCLC. Antigen-specific immunotherapy (cancer vaccination) has been disappointing in large phase III clinical trials in stages I-III NSCLC. Based on the recent breakthroughs with   inhibitor immunotherapy in metastatic NSCLC, much hope currently rests on the use of this approach in patients with stage I-III NSCLC as well.

Gross tumor resection followed by concomitant and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide was performed. Routine follow-up imaging 8 months later showed a right parietal meningeal tumor. Resection confirmed a distant GBM, and next-generation sequencing revealed high tumor mutational burden, high-frequency microsatellite instability, and a pharmacologically targetable KIT mutation. Complete neuraxis imaging revealed multiple contrast-enhancing tumors in the craniocervical junction and levels C7, Th8-Th11, and S1. The craniocervical tumors and the cervical spine from C1-C2 were irradiated as palliative care, and second-line combined chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy with irinotecan and bevacizumab was initiated, which was later changed to an - blockade with pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab owing to tumor progression. Tumor growth was slowed, but the patient eventually developed a progressive paraparesis. Subsequent KIT-targeting  kinase inhibitor therapy with imatinib was administered for a short time. The patient died 13.8 months after initial diagnosis.High-risk genetic profiles for GBMs prone to develop extensive leptomeningeal metastases need to be identified. Guidelines on preemptive, complete neuraxis imaging in certain patients with GBM as well as treatment guidelines need to be developed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Application of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as  inhibitors is rapidly becoming a promising therapeutic approach in treating tumors, and some of them have successfully been commercialized in the past few years. However, not all patients show complete responses and adverse events have been noted, suggesting a better understanding of PD-1 pathway mediated immunosuppression is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy. Here, we review the progresses on the studies of the mechanistic role of PD-1 pathway in the tumor  evasion, recent clinical development and commercialization of PD-1 pathway inhibitors, the toxicities associated with PD-1 blockade observed in clinical trials as well as how to improve therapeutic efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728723>Pushing the limits of -related response: a case of "extreme pseudoprogression".</a></h1><p>The advent of   targeted immunotherapy has seen a spectrum of -related phenomena in both tumor responses and toxicities. We describe a case of pseudoprogression that pushes the limits of -related response criteria and challenges the boundaries and definitions set by trial protocols. A middle-aged man with conventional clear  renal  carcinoma (RCC) had received multiple prior systemic treatments including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitors, as well as multiple surgeries and radiotherapy treatments. He was eventually started on nivolumab-the anti-programmed death receptor-1 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of advanced RCC. Clinical deterioration was observed soon after a 100 mg dose of nivolumab, with onset of acute renal failure and declining performance status. Radiologic progression was documented in multiple sites including worsening tumor infiltration of his residual kidney. The patient was on palliative treatment and visited by the home hospice team in an end-of-life situation. The patient unexpectedly improved and went on to achieve a durable tumor response. The case is illustrative of an extreme manifestation of pseudoprogression, and impels us to probe the assumptions and controversies surrounding this phenomenon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148853>Overall survival of stage IV non-small  lung cancer patients treated with Viscum album L. in addition to chemotherapy, a real-world observational multicenter analysis.</a></h1><p>Stage IV non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with a five-year survival rate of around 1%. Treatment with Viscum album L. (VA) extracts has been shown to reduce chemotherapy (CTx)-related adverse events, decrease CTx dose reductions and improve quality of life in a number of cancers. Recent data suggest a beneficial effect of add-on treatment with Viscum album L. (VA, European mistletoe) on survival in cancer patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of VA in addition to chemotherapy on survival in stage IV NSCLC patients.The observational study was conducted using data from the Network Oncology clinical registry which is an accredited conjoint clinical registry of German oncological hospitals, practitioners and out-patient centers.Patients were included if they had stage IV NSCLC at diagnosis, lived at least for four weeks post-diagnosis and received chemotherapeutic treatment. Patients with EGFR mutations as well as patients receiving  kinase inhibitors or   inhibitors were not included. Overall survival and impact on hazard in patients with chemotherapy (CTx) to patients receiving CTx plus VA were compared. To identify factors associated with survival and to address potential sources of bias a multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard model was performed.The median age of the population was 64.1 years with 55.7% male patients. The highest proportion of patients had adenocarcinoma (72.2%) and most of the patients were current or past smokers (70.9%). Of 158 stage IV NSCLC patients, 108 received CTx only and 50 additional VA. Median survival was 17.0 months in the CTx plus VA group (95%CI: 11.0-40.0) and was 8.0 months (95%CI: 7.0-11.0) in the CTx only group (χ2 = 7.2, p = .007). Overall survival was significantly prolonged in the VA group (HR 0.44, 95%CI: 0.26-0.74, p = .002). One-year and three-year overall survival rates were greater with CTx plus VA compared to CTX alone (1y: 60.2% vs. 35.5%; 3y: 25.7% vs. 14.2%).Our findings suggest that concomitant VA is positively associated with survival in stage IV NSCLC patients treated with standard CTx. These findings complement pre-existing knowldedge of add-on VA's clinical impact, however, results should be interpreted with caution in light of the study's observational character.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496820>Impact of tivozanib on patient outcomes in treatment of advanced renal  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Renal  carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney malignancy, and the clear- subtype represents the majority of RCCs. RCC is a heterogeneous disease in terms of genetic and histological features which determine the behavior of the disease. The  () is a tumor suppressor gene and mutations of this gene are seen in 95% of clear- RCCs. Inactivation of  causes the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and in turn, accumulation of HIF-1 induces overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); the increase in VEGF expression makes RCC a highly vascularized tumor, and forms the rationale for antiVEGF treatment. In the past decade, improvement in the survival of RCC patients has been observed due to new effective therapies, such as antiVEGF and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) targeting agents and   inhibitors. The majority of VEGF targeted agents are not just selective to VEGF receptors, but usually also have inhibitory effects on other kinases, such as c-KIT and FLT3. Tivozanib is an extremely potent and selective  kinase inhibitor (TKI) of VEGFR-1, 2, and 3, with a relatively long half-life, that is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of advanced/metastatic RCC. Tivozanib, at very low serum concentration can inhibit phosphorylation of VEGFR -1, -2, and -3  kinase activity. This article summarizes the clinical data on tivozanib in the treatment of advanced/metastatic RCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466051>Targets for improving tumor response to radiotherapy.</a></h1><p>Radiotherapy is one of the most common treatment modalities for controlling a wide range of tumors. However, it has been shown that radiotherapy alone is unable to completely eradicate some tumors and could be associated with a high possibility of tumor recurrence. To date, various experimental and clinical studies have been conducted to explore some efficient targets within tumor microenvironment (TME) to enhance tumor response to radiotherapy; thus help eliminate or eradicate tumors. Although targeting DNA damage responses (DDRs) is associated with severe toxicities, studies in recent decade suggest that inhibition of some apoptosis/survival targets within TME is promising. This is also associated with changes in the numbers of T regulatory cells (Tregs) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have also shown promising results. The combination of receptor  kinase (RTK) inhibitors with radiotherapy is interesting as well as the clinical use of some drugs and antibodies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are the most common RTK inhibitors. Some clinical trials in recent years have shown very interesting results for   inhibitors (ICIs), especially programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CTLs-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors. It has been suggested that administration of ICIs during or after hypofractionated radiotherapy could lead to best results. In this review, we explain TME response to radiotherapy and potential targets for sensitization of cancer cells to radiotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the past decade, significant advances have been made in the science of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). Screening has been introduced with the goal of early detection. The National Lung Screening Trial found a lung cancer mortality benefit of 20% and a 6.7% decrease in all-cause mortality with the use of low-dose chest computed tomography in high-risk individuals. The treatment of lung cancer has also evolved with the introduction of several lines of  kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and NTRK mutations. Similarly,   inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the landscape of NSCLC treatment. Furthermore, the results of new trials continue to help us understand the role of these novel agents and which patients are more likely to benefit; ICIs are now part of the first-line NSCLC treatment armamentarium as monotherapy, combined with chemotherapy, or after definite chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC. Expression of programmed  death protein-ligand 1 in malignant cells has been studied as a potential biomarker for response to ICIs. However, important drawbacks exist that limit its discriminatory potential. Identification of accurate predictive biomarkers beyond programmed  death protein-ligand 1 expression remains essential to select the most appropriate candidates for ICI therapy. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the proper sequence and combinations of these new agents; however, the field is moving rapidly, and the overall direction is optimistic.Copyright © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

These fusions are consistently detected in rare cancer types (e.g., secretory breast carcinoma and congenital infantile fibrosarcoma), but the occurrence of NTRK fusions in common cancers and their relationship to other therapy biomarkers are largely unexplored. Tissue samples from 11,502 patients were analyzed for 53 gene fusions and sequencing of 592 genes, along with an immunohistochemical evaluation of TrkA/B/C and PD-L1. Thirty-one cases (0.27% of the entire cohort) had NTRK fusions. The most common fusions were ETV6:NTRK3 (n = 10) and TPM3:NTRK1 (n = 6). Gliomas had the highest number of NTRK fusions (14/982, 1.4%), most commonly involving NTRK2 (n = 9). Seventeen non-glioma cases with NTRK fusions included carcinomas of the lungs, thyroid, breast, cervix, colon, nasal cavity, cancer of unknown primary and soft tissue sarcomas. Strong and uniform Trk expression detected with a pan-Trk immunohistochemistry characterized 7/8 NTRK1 fusion cases and 8/9 NTRK2 fusion cases, while NTRK3 fused cases were positive in 6/11 (55%) of cases. 29% of NTRK fusion cases had no other pathogenic genomic alteration. PD-L1 expression was observed in 23% of NTRK fused cases while high tumor DNA microsatellite instability was detected in two cases. We confirm the rarity of NTRK genes fusions outside the brain malignancies. NTRK inhibitors alone or combined with   inhibitors may be a therapeutic option for a substantial proportion of these patients. Strategies for detection of the NTRK fusion-driven cancers may include immunohistochemistry, but gene fusion detection remains the most reliable tool.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078463>Axitinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced sarcomas including alveolar soft-part sarcoma: a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 trial.</a></h1><p>VEGF promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment and contributes to   inhibitor resistance in cancer. We aimed to assess the activity of the VEGF receptor -kinase inhibitor axitinib plus the anti-PD-1   inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with sarcoma.This single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 trial was undertaken at a tertiary care academic medical centre in Miami, FL, USA, and participants were recruited from all over the USA and internationally. Patients were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older, and had histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic sarcomas, including alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS); measurable disease with one site amenable to repeated biopsies; an ECOG performance status of 0-1; and progressive disease after previous treatment with at least one line of systemic therapy (unless no standard treatment existed or the patient declined therapy). The first five patients were enrolled in a lead-in cohort and were given axitinib 5 mg orally twice daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously for 30 min on day 8 and every 3 weeks for cycles of 6 weeks for up to 2 years. Thereafter, patients received escalating doses of axitinib (2-10 mg) plus flat dose pembrolizumab according to the schedule above. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival. All patients were evaluable for survival and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and is closed to accrual.Between April 19, 2016, and Feb 7, 2018, of 36 patients assessed for eligibility, 33 (92%) were enrolled and given study treatment (intention-to-treat population and safety population), 12 (36%) of whom had ASPS. With a median follow-up of 14·7 months (IQR 10·1-19·1), 3-month progression-free survival for all evaluable patients was 65·6% (95% CI 46·6-79·3). For patients with ASPS, 3-month progression-free survival was 72·7% (95% CI 37·1-90·3). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events included hypertension (five [15%] of 33 patients), autoimmune toxicities (five [15%]), nausea or vomiting (two [6%]), and seizures (two [6%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in seven (21%) patients, including autoimmune colitis, transaminitis, pneumothorax, haemoptysis, seizures, and hypertriglyceridemia. There were no treatment-related deaths.Axitinib plus pembrolizumab has manageable toxicity and preliminary activity in patients with advanced sarcomas, particularly patients with ASPS, warranting further investigation in randomised controlled trials.Merck, Pfizer, American Cancer Society, and Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The apparent efficacy of PD-1 blockade might be limited to a relatively small subset of advanced gastric cancer patients.In this study, preclinical and clinical studies, which investigated molecular features, promising treatment targets, and   inhibitor in gastric cancer, were reviewed via PubMed and the congress webpages of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society of Medical Oncology.Next-generation sequencing technologies have defined the genomic landscape of gastric cancer. Indeed, several molecular classifications have been proposed, and distinct molecular subtypes have been identified. Based on these molecular profiles, clinical trials of new agents such as receptor  kinases inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, and IMAB362 (anti-Claudin 18.2) are ongoing. In addition, biomarkers to predict response during   inhibitors and combination therapy have been enthusiastically investigated.Remarkable advances in an understanding of molecular profiles of gastric cancer enable the development of novel agents.

Although generally considered less toxic than cytotoxic chemotherapy, these new drugs can cause significant unanticipated side effects including thyroid dysfunction. This review provides a literature assessment of thyroid dysfunctions induced by TKI and ICPIs. We intend to define for these two classes the frequency of thyroid involvement, the potential mechanisms that result in this toxicity, the clinical-biological impact and the therapeutic management. Detection of thyroid dysfunction requires monitoring of TSH, in combination with free T4 if needed and, depending on the clinical impact and the kinetics of biological abnormalities, starting symptomatic treatment of hyperthyroidism and/or correcting hypothyroidism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

RCC as an immunogenic malignancy is supported by many theories and facts which include tumor richness of lymphocytes infiltrate, the occurrence of spontaneous tumor regression, and the proved effect of traditional immunotherapy (Finke et al. in J Immunother 11(1):1-11, 1992), all these factors support the potential therapeutic effect of the novel immunotherapeutic agents in RCC. Historically, complete tumor regression in metastatic RCC is achievable in a minority of patients through traditional immunotherapies such as high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) (Fyfe et al. in J Clin Oncol 13(3):688, 1995) and interferon-alfa (IFNa) (Negrier et al. in N Engl J Med 338(18):1272, 1998); however due to the significant rate of toxicities and low efficacy; accordingly the targeted therapy with  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and vascular endothelial growth factor-antibodies (VEGF) became the standard and prevalent treatment approach for advanced RCC both in front and subsequent lines of therapy (Escudier et al. in Ann Oncol. 25(Suppl 3):iii49-iii56, 2014). A new avenue of immunotherapy utilizing novel strategy to block   has emerged in a new era for RCC treatment (Ascierto et al. in J Transl Med 12:291, 2014). Results from clinical trials are encouraging in both front-line and second-line settings, in a phase III trial (CheckMate 025) nivolumab compared to everolimus improved overall survival in previously treated metastatic RCC who had progressed on prior treatment with targeting agents (Motzer et al. in N Engl J Med 373:1803, 2015).

It is categorized into various subtypes, with clear  RCC (ccRCC) representing about 85% of all RCC tumors. The lack of sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy prompted research efforts into novel treatment options. The development of targeted therapeutics, including multi-targeted  kinase inhibitors (TKI) and mTOR inhibitors, has been a major breakthrough in ccRCC therapy. More recently, other therapeutic strategies, including   inhibitors, have emerged as effective treatment options against advanced ccRCC. Furthermore, recent advances in disease biology, tumor microenvironment, and mechanisms of resistance formed the basis for attempts to combine targeted therapies with newer generation immunotherapies to take advantage of possible synergy.

Thereby   blockade (ICB) consolidated its major role in the treatment of NSCLC patients without genetic alterations and extended its use by showing impressive data on ICB combination therapies (mainly combined with chemotherapy). Furthermore the role of predictive biomarkers for ICB therapy (Programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression, tumor mutational burden [TMB] testing and others) have been further developed and blood-based tests were presented with promising data revealing the potential of this minimally invasive method for treatment monitoring and guidance in the future. Nevertheless the best biomarker is still elusive and future research is ongoing and might be a multimodal approach combining different modalities. No major studies concerning new genetic alterations or innovative targets were presented and the focus in genetic driven NSCLC was the evaluation of combinational approaches (e.g. in epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutation positve patients, EGFR  kinase inhibitor [TKI] plus anti-angiogenic agent or chemotherapy backbone). The presented results showed some benefit for the combinational approach; however toxicity might be an issue and further validation is necessary. Summarizing, ASCO 2018 showed that combinational approaches will be the future standard treatment in NSCLC and that biomarker identification is more heterogeneous and complex than anticipated, but presented next generation techniques may pave the way to a more personalized cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30353228>Osteonecrosis of the jaw related to non-antiresorptive medications: a systematic review.</a></h1><p>The reporting of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) related to anticancer agents without known antiresorptive properties (non-antiresorptives), such as antiangiogenics,  kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors,   inhibitors, and cytotoxic chemotherapy is increasing.To review characteristics of ONJ in cancer patients receiving non-antiresorptives.A systematic review of the literature between 2009 and 2017 was conducted by the Bone Study Group of MASCC/ISOO.Of 6249 articles reviewed and from personal communication, 42 ONJ cases related to non-antiresorptives were identified. No gender predilection was noted. Median age was 60 years and ONJ stage 2 was most common, with predilection for posterior mandible. Exposed bone, pain, and infection were common at diagnosis. In comparison to bone targeting agents (BTAs), radiology, histology, and management were similar, with medication often discontinued. Delayed diagnosis (median 8 weeks) was noted. Important differences included earlier time to ONJ onset (median 20 weeks), absence of trigger event (40%), and greater likelihood of healing and shorter healing time (median 8 weeks) as compared to BTA-related ONJ. Gastrointestinal cancers predominated, followed by renal  carcinomas compared to breast, followed by prostate cancers in BTA-related ONJ, reflecting different medications.Data about non-antiresorptive-related ONJ is sparse. This type of ONJ may have better prognosis compared to the BTA-related ONJ, suggested by greater likelihood of healing and shorter healing time.

Lenvatinib, a multi-targeted  kinase inhibitor, as well as  inhibitors targeting the programmed  death pathway, have proven effective in some patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Combination of these therapies is a potential means to boost effectiveness and minimize treatment resistance in ATC. We utilized our novel immunocompetent murine model of orthotopic ATC to demonstrate that lenvatinib led to significant tumor shrinkage and increased survival, while combination therapy led to dramatic improvements in both. Lenvatinib monotherapy increased tumor-infiltrating macrophages, CD8 T-cells, regulatory T-cells, and most notably, polymorphonuclear myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). While both combination therapies led to further increases in CD8 T-cells, only the lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 combination decreased PMN-MDSCs. PMN-MDSC expansion was also seen in the blood of mice and one patient receiving lenvatinib therapy for ATC. RNA-Seq of the ATC  line used in our mouse model demonstrated that lenvatinib has multifaceted effects on angiogenesis, response to hypoxia, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and on multiple pathways implicated in inflammation and host immunity. Combination of lenvatinib with anti-Gr-1 antibody ameliorated lenvatinib's expansion of MDSCs and significantly improved lenvatinib's anti-tumor effect. These data suggest that MDSCs play a negative role in ATC's response to lenvatinib and support future study of their role as a potential biomarker and treatment target.© 2018 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30018044>Response to   Inhibition in Two Patients with Alveolar Soft-Part Sarcoma.</a></h1><p>Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is a morphologically distinctive mesenchymal tumor characterized by a canonical ASPL-TFE3 fusion product.

The advent of targeted therapies for metastatic renal- carcinoma (mRCC) has underscored the need to subtype tumors according to tumor- expression profiles that may more reliably predict treatment outcomes. Over the past 2 decades, several vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and  kinase inhibitors have been the mainstay for first- and second-line treatment of mRCC. Very recently, immunotherapy  inhibitors have significantly changed the treatment landscape for patients with mRCC, particularly for first-line treatment of intermediate to poor risk mRCC patients. Now, combination immunotherapy as well as combinations of immunotherapy with targeted agents can significantly alter disease outcomes. The field of immuno-oncology for mRCC has unveiled a deeper understanding of the immunoreactivity inherent to these tumors, and as a result combination therapy is evolving as a first-line modality.

This is further complicated by clinical trials not commonly reporting adverse events by age. Thus, recommendations on treatment of older patients with mRCC are generally extrapolated from data on younger patients enrolled in these trials, which may not be ideal as many older patients are frail, have age-related organ dysfunction, or have multiple medical co-morbidities. In the last decade, the treatment landscape for mRCC has drastically changed with the approval of more than ten targeted therapies, as well as   inhibitors. Thus, treatment selection and sequencing of treatments can be especially challenging for clinicians. We begin this review by analyzing the available efficacy and toxicity data of these treatments in younger and older patients. We also discuss a network meta-analysis that compares the efficacy of these agents in older patients with mRCC. Utilizing this data, we suggest that nivolumab plus ipilimumab and cabozantinib may be favored for first-line treatment of specific populations of older patients. For salvage treatment, we suggest that cabozantinib may be the preferred agent for older patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30499814>Programmed Death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression in Thymic Epithelial Tumors.</a></h1><p>Thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) are uncommon neoplasms of the mediastinum. The gold standard treatment is complete surgical resection which can be followed by radio/chemotherapy in selected cases. Targeted  kinase inhibition can be considered in only a limited number of aggressive or metastatic tumors as EGFR, BRAF, or c-kit mutations are rare. However, previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of   inhibitors in epithelial neoplasias, such as in programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressing nonsmall  lung carcinoma. Because of their rare occurrence the data on PD-L1 distribution in thymic neoplasias are limited. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in tumor cells and tumor infiltrating  cells was determined in TETs according to criteria published for lung carcinomas. Comparison with major clinical, pathologic, and biological features was also done. In total, 36 TETs (29 thymomas and 7 thymic carcinomas) were analyzed. PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining (Ventana PD-L1 clone SP142) was performed in all cases. The percentage of the positive tumor cells (TC value), the percentage of tumor area occupied by positive  cells (IC value) was evaluated. Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells showed a good reproducibility (κ-value: 0.840; Spearman r=0.966; P<0.0001). About 69% of thymomas (20/29) and 43% of thymic carcinomas (3/7) showed high positivity rate (TC≥50% or IC ≥10%), which may indicate therapeutic advantage similar to nonsmall  lung cancers defined by the same conditions. PD-L1 expression is common in different epithelial tumors of the thymus, which suggests the potential effectiveness of drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interactions in these neoplasms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30723115>Immuno-oncological Efficacy of RXDX-106, a Novel TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER) Family Small-Molecule Kinase Inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Expression of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER) family of receptor  kinases (RTK) has been associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. In  cells, TAM RTKs can dampen inflammation in favor of homeostatic wound-healing responses, thus potentially contributing to the evasion of cancer cells from  surveillance. Here we characterize the small-molecule RXDX-106 as a selective and potent pan-TAM RTK inhibitor with slow dissociation kinetics and significant antitumor activity in multiple syngeneic tumor models. Expression of AXL and MER on both  and tumor cells increased during tumor progression. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) following treatment with RXDX-106 was observed in wild-type mice and was abrogated in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that the antitumor activity of RXDX-106 is, in part, due to the presence of  cells. RXDX-106-mediated TGI was associated with increased tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, M1-polarized intratumoral macrophages, and activation of natural killer cells. RXDX-106 proportionally increased intratumoral CD8 T cells and T- function as indicated by both IFNγ production and LCK phosphorylation (pY393). RXDX-106 exhibited its effects via direct actions on TAM RTKs expressed on intratumoral macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to indirect activation of other  cells in the tumor. RXDX-106 also potentiated the effects of an   inhibitor, α-PD-1 Ab, resulting in enhanced antitumor efficacy and survival. Collectively, these results demonstrate the capacity of RXDX-106 to inhibit tumor growth and progression and suggest it may serve as an effective therapy against multiple tumor types. SIGNIFICANCE: The pan-TAM small-molecule kinase inhibitor RXDX-106 activates both innate and adaptive immunity to inhibit tumor growth and progression, indicating its clinical potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454018>Systemic Therapy for Locally Advanced and Metastatic Non-Small  Lung Cancer: A Review.</a></h1><p>Non-small  lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Until the last decade, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer was less than 5%. Improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer has resulted in the development of new biomarker-targeted therapies and led to improvements in overall survival for patients with advanced or metastatic disease.Systemic therapy for metastatic non-small  lung cancer is selected according to the presence of specific biomarkers. Therefore, all patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer should undergo molecular testing for relevant mutations and expression of the protein PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1). Molecular alterations that predict response to treatment (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF V600E mutations) are present in approximately 30% of patients with non-small  lung cancer. Targeted therapy for these alterations improves progression-free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. For example, somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene are present in approximately 20% of patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer.  kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib improve progression-free survival in patients with susceptible EGFR mutations. In patients with overexpression of ALK protein, the response rate was significantly better with crizotinib (a  kinase inhibitor) than with the combination of pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-based chemotherapy) (74% vs 45%, respectively; P < .001) and progression-free survival (median, 10.9 months vs 7.0 months; P < .001). Subsequent generations of  kinase inhibitors have improved these agents. For patients without biomarkers indicating susceptibility to specific targeted treatments,   inhibitor-containing regimens either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are superior vs chemotherapy alone. These advances in biomarker-directed therapy have led to improvements in overall survival. For example, the 5-year overall survival rate currently exceeds 25% among patients whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of ≥50%) and 40% among patients with ALK-positive tumors.Improved understanding of the biology and molecular subtypes of non-small  lung cancer have led to more biomarker-directed therapies for patients with metastatic disease. These biomarker-directed therapies and newer empirical treatment regimens have improved overall survival for patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148248>Analysis of  Amplification: Next-Generation Sequencing of Patients With Diverse Malignancies.</a></h1><p> amplification can promote tumorigenesis directly or indirectly through p53 inhibition.  has increasing clinical relevance because inhibitors are under evaluation in clinical trials, and  amplification is a possible genomic correlate of accelerated progression, known as hyperprogression, after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to ascertain  amplification status across a large number of diverse cancers.We interrogated the molecular profiles of 102,878 patients with diverse malignancies for  amplification and co-altered genes using clinical-grade NGS (182 to 465 genes). amplification occurred in 3.5% of patients (3,650 of 102,878). The majority of tumor types had a small subset of patients with  amplification. Most of these patients (99.0% [3,613/3,650]) had co-alterations that accompanied  amplification. Various pathways, including those related to  kinase (37.9% [1,385 of 3,650]),  signaling (25.4% [926 of 3,650]),  (24.9% [910 of 3,650]), and  signaling (23.6% [863 of 3,650]), were involved. Although infrequent, mismatch repair genes and  amplification also were co-altered (2.2% [79 of 3,650]). Most patients (97.6% [3,563 of 3,650]) had one or more co-alterations potentially targetable with either a Food and Drug Administration-approved or investigational agent.  amplifications were less frequently associated with high tumor mutation burden compared with the  wild-type population (2.9%  6.5%;  < .001). An illustrative patient who harbored  amplification and experienced hyperprogression with an   inhibitor is presented. amplification was found in 3.5% of 102,878 patients, 97.6% of whom harbored genomic co-alterations that were potentially targetable. This study suggests that a small subset of most tumor types have  amplification as well as pharmacologically tractable co-alterations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848378>Current Status and Future Directions of Immunotherapy in Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Renal  carcinoma (RCC) was recognized as an immunologically sensitive cancer over 30 years ago. The first therapies to affect the course of RCC were cytokines (interferon alfa-2B and interleukin-2). Subsequently, drugs that inhibit HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling demonstrated overall survival advantages ( kinase inhibitors and mTor inhibitors).In the last 3 years, the   inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care treatments in the first and second lines for RCC. Emerging data show that combinations of ICI, HIF signaling inhibitors, and cytokines are potentially powerful regimens. How to combine and sequence these types of therapies and how to integrate new approaches into the management of RCC are now the key questions for the field. Treatment of RCC is likely to change dramatically in the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290997>  inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The position of immunotherapy as a pillar of systemic cancer treatment has been firmly established over the past decade.   inhibitors are a welcome option for patients with different malignancies. This is in part because they offer the possibility of durable benefit, even for patients who have failed other treatment modalities. The recent demonstration that immunotherapy is effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a milestone in the history of this recalcitrant disease. The treatment of HCC has been a challenge, and for many years was limited to the  kinase inhibitor sorafenib and to several novel  kinase inhibitors that have shown efficacy and have been approved. The current role of   inhibitors in the management of HCC, and how this role is likely to evolve in the years ahead, are key. Other than efforts evaluating single  inhibitors, potential combination strategies, including combinations with existing local and systemic approaches, including novel therapies are evolving. This is understandably of special interest considering the potential unique  system of the liver, which may impact the use of immunotherapy in patients with HCC going forward, and how can it be enhanced further.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29805657>Clinicopathological analysis of epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a distinctive neoplasm composed of myofibroblastic and fibroblastic spindle cells, accompanied by the inflammatory infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes and/or eosinophils. Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS), which primarily consists of cells with a round or epithelioid morphology, is associated with a poor prognosis and rapid development of local recurrence, and has been recognized to be a variant of IMT. Diagnosis of EIMS is difficult owing to its close resemblance to malignant mesothelioma, anaplastic large  lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor and other malignant diseases. In the present study, a case of this rare tumor was evaluated in a 26-year-old male who was admitted to hospital after experiencing abdominal pain for ~18 days and abdominal distention for 1 week. The patient's tumor was examined by imaging, gross examination, histology, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence  hybridization (FISH). The magnetic resonance imaging enhanced-scanning image revealed that the morphology of the tumor was irregular, and signal was medley consisting of high and low hybrid reinforcement. Tumors were located in the bladder and rectal pit, in the lower part of the lower abdomen, indicating the presence of malignancy and involvement of the small intestine and rectum. Enhanced-scanning imaging revealed notable inhomogeneous enhancement. Gross examination revealed that the tumor was solid and had a variegated appearance with alternating fleshy and mucoid areas in the cut surface. Microscopically, the tumors were dominated by sheets of epithelioid-to-round cells with a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. The majority of the stroma was myxoid. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells exhibited diffuse strong staining for ALK receptor  kinase (hereafter ALK), vimentin, tumor protein P53, desmin, Wilms' tumor 1 and programmed death-ligand 1. FISH analysis also revealed the existence of ALK rearrangement. The expression of PD-L1 in EIMS indicates that the   blockade could represent a novel therapy for the treatment of EIMS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214498>Overview of Targeted Drugs for Mature B- Non-hodgkin Lymphomas.</a></h1><p>The improved knowledge of pathogenetic mechanisms underlying lymphomagenesis and the discovery of the critical role of tumor microenvironments have enabled the design of new drugs against  targets and pathways. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for targeted therapy in hematology. This review focuses on the efficacy results of the currently available targeted agents and recaps the main ongoing trials in the setting of mature B- non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The objective is to summarize the different classes of novel agents approved for mature B- lymphomas, to describe in synoptic tables the results they achieved and, finally, to draw future scenarios as we glimpse through the ongoing clinical trials. Characteristics and therapeutic efficacy are summarized for the currently approved mAbs [i.e., anti-Cluster of differentiation (CD) mAbs,   inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T- therapy, and bispecific antibodies] as well as for SMIs i.e., inhibitors of B- receptor signaling, proteasome, mTOR BCL-2 HDAC pathways. The biological disease profiling of B- lymphoma subtypes may foster the discovery of innovative drug strategies for improving survival outcome in lymphoid neoplasms, as well as the trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity. The hope for clinical advantages should carefully be coupled with mindful awareness of the potential pitfalls and the occurrence of uneven, sometimes severe, toxicities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753792>Investigational multitargeted kinase inhibitors in development for head and neck neoplasms.</a></h1><p>Despite advances in treatment, head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) survival rates remain stagnant. Current treatment is associated with significant toxicities and includes chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and few targeted treatments. Targeted treatments, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agent, cetuximab, and   inhibitors, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, show improved toxicity profiles and modestly improved survival in select patients. An urgent need remains to identify novel targeted treatments for single-agent or combined therapy use.Multitargeted kinase inhibitors are small molecule inhibitors with limited toxicity. This review will focus on early-stage investigations of multitargeted  kinase inhibitors (m-TKIs) (those that target at least two  kinases) for HNSCC. Preclinical and early trials investigating m-TKIs for various disease settings of HNSCC will be evaluated for efficacy, identification of significant biomarkers and potential for combination therapy.Few single agent m-TKIs have demonstrated efficacy in unselected HNSCC populations. The most promising clinical results have been obtained when m-TKIs are tested in combination with other therapies, including immunotherapy, or in mutation-defined subgroups of patients. The future success of m-TKIs will rely on identification, in preclinical models and clinical trials, of predictive biomarkers of response and mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428517> microenvironment profiling of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) shows gene expression patterns associated to   inhibitors response.</a></h1><p>Few studies were conducted investigating the immunological profiles in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Adaptive and innate  cells are present in the tumor microenvironment, indicating GIST as inflamed tumors. In addition, murine models suggested a potential interaction between  components and imatinib. In this retrospective study, the GIST immunological profile was investigated through  analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC), exploring the basis for immunotherapy approaches. Gene expression profiles (GEP) from 31 KIT/PDGFRA-mutant GIST were analyzed to evaluate the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy predictive signatures such as the expanded IFN-γ-induced  signature (EIIS) and the T--inflamed signature (TIS). GEP and IHC supported the presence of  infiltrate in GIST, with dominance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and M2 macrophages showing a remarkable similarity with melanoma microenvironment. The EIIS genes were expressed in most of GIST samples and positively correlated with PD-L1 abundance ( < .0001). Co-expression was also found between PD-L1 and CD8A ( < .0001) or CD8B ( = .0003). Moreover, the median TIS score for GIST was between the 65th and 70th percentile of the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, in the same range of tumors responding to anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus database GIST samples pre- and post-treatment confirmed that imatinib downregulates PD-L1 and IRF1 expression through the inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA, thus contributing to counteract the suppressed adaptive  response against GIST. The presence of a rich  infiltrate in GIST along with the presence of TIS and EIIS suggests that GIST may benefit from immunotherapy along with  kinase inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947670>Anti-tumor Drug Targets Analysis: Current Insight and Future Prospect.</a></h1><p>The incidence and mortality of malignant tumors are on the rise, which has become the second leading cause of death in the world. At present, anti-tumor drugs are one of the most common methods for treating cancer. In recent years, with the in-depth study of tumor biology and related disciplines, it has been gradually discovered that the essence of  carcinogenesis is the infinite proliferation of cells caused by the disorder of  signal transduction pathways, followed by a major shift in the concept of anti-tumor drugs research and development. The focus of research and development is shifting from traditional cytotoxic drugs to a new generation of anti-tumor drugs targeted at abnormal signaling system targets in tumor cells. In this review, we summarize the targets of anti-tumor drugs and analyse the molecular mechanisms of their effects, which lay a foundation for subsequent treatment, research and development.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438923>Nintedanib allows retreatment with atezolizumab of combined non-small  lung cancer/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after atezolizumab-induced pneumonitis: a case report.</a></h1><p>Nintedanib is a  kinase inhibitor that efficiently slows the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and has an acceptable tolerability profile. In contrast,   inhibitors (ICIs) such as programmed death 1 and programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors have shown clinical activity and marked efficacy in the treatment of non-small  lung cancer. However, it is unclear whether nintedanib reduces the risk of ICI-induced pneumonitis in IPF.A 78-year-old man with squamous  lung carcinoma in IPF underwent second-line treatment with pembrolizumab. He was diagnosed as having pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis after two cycles. He was administered prednisolone (PSL) and then improved immediately. Thereafter, his lung cancer lesion enlarged despite treatment with TS-1. Atezolizumab was then administered as 4th-line chemotherapy, but he immediately developed atezolizumab-induced pneumonitis after 1 . The re-escalated dosage of PSL improved the pneumonitis, and then nintedanib was started as additional therapy. Under careful observation with nintedanib, atezolizumab was re-administered on day 1 of an every-21-day . After three cycles, it remained stable without exacerbation of drug-induced pneumonitis.This case indicates the possibility that the addition of nintedanib to ICI therapy might prevent drug-induced pneumonitis or acute exacerbation of IPF. However, whether anti-fibrotic agents such as nintedanib are actually effective in preventing ICI-induced pneumonitis in ILD remains unknown and additional research is greatly needed to identify effective therapies for ILD combined with lung cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595195>Immunothérapie des cancers du rein.</a></h1><p>Clear  kidney cancer is a tumour type whose development and progression is driven by the HIF/VEGF angiogenesis pathway. Anti-angiogenic (AA) agents, particularly anti-VEGFR  kinase (TKI) inhibitors, have profoundly modified the prognosis of patients in the metastatic setting (mRCC) since their registration in 2006. At the same time, mTOR inhibitors have also brought significant benefit to patients. More recently, treatments restoring adaptive anti-tumor immunity, anti-program death 1 (anti-PD-1)  inhibitors (ICP), have in turn revolutionized the management of patients with mRCC. The multi-tumor efficacy of these ICPs proves the crucial role of anti-tumor immunity in tumor development and progression in a number of tumors including clear  kidney tumours (ccRCC). The tumor  microenvironment (TME) of ccRCC is known to be highly immunosuppressive. Thus ccRCCs are characterized by a strong infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes, frequently expressing immunological  molecules on their surface, giving them a poor prognostic feature. These characteristics partly explain the effectiveness of ICP in ccRCC and constitute a strong rationale for their further development, either at an earlier stage or in combination, particularly with AA or TKI. In this review are compiled the main clinical results of immunological  molecules alone or in combination in 1line or after TKI failure.© 2018 Société Française du Cancer.

TTD was calculated as date of randomization to date of discontinuation or death and compared to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) across all patients, as well as in treatment-defined subgroups [EGFR mutation-positive treated with  kinase inhibitor (TKI), EGFR wild-type treated with TKI, ALK-positive treated with TKI,   inhibitor (ICI), chemotherapy doublet with maintenance, chemotherapy monotherapy].Overall across 8947 patients, TTD was more closely associated with PFS (r = 0.87, 95% CI 0.86-0.87) than with OS (0.68, 95% CI 0.67-0.69). Early TTD (PFS-TTD ≥ 3 months) occurred in 7.7% of patients overall, and was more common with chemo monotherapy (15.0%) while late TTD (TTD-PFS ≥ 3 months) occurred in 6.0% of patients overall, and was more common in EGFR-positive and ALK-positive patients (12.4% and 22.9%). In oncogene-targeted subgroups (EGFR positive and ALK positive), median TTDs (13.4 and 14.1 months) exceeded median PFS (11.4 and 11.3 months).At the patient level, TTD is associated with PFS across therapeutic classes. Median TTD exceeds median PFS for biomarker-selected patients receiving oncogene-targeted therapies. TTD should be prospectively studied further as an end point for pragmatic randomized RWE trials only for continuously administered therapies.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology 2019.

Although high-dose chemotherapy remains the standard of care at first relapse for sufficiently young and fit patients, fewer than one-quarter of patients with relapsed/refractory disease are cured with this approach. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have emerged as an effective therapy in patients with multiple relapsed/refractory disease, capable of inducing durable remissions in patients with chemotherapy-refractory disease. Three anti-CD19 CAR T cells for aggressive B- lymphoma (axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel, and lisocabtagene ciloleucel) are either U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved or in late-stage development. All three CAR T cells produce durable remissions in 33%-40% of treated patients. Differences among these products include the specific CAR constructs, costimulatory domains, manufacturing process, dose, and eligibility criteria for their pivotal trials. Notable toxicities include cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, which are usually treatable and reversible, as well as cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia. Incidences of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity differ across CAR T- products, related in part to the type of costimulatory domain. Potential mechanisms of resistance include CAR T- exhaustion and  evasion, CD19 antigen loss, and a lack of persistence. Rational combination strategies with CAR T cells are under evaluation, including   inhibitors, immunomodulators, and  kinase inhibitors. Novel  products are also being developed and include CAR T cells that target multiple tumor antigens, cytokine-secreting CAR T cells, and gene-edited CAR T cells, among others.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30008296>A successful pembrolizumab treatment case of lung adenocarcinoma after becoming resistant to ALK-TKI treatment due to G1202R mutation.</a></h1><p>In current guidelines, the role of   inhibitors is not yet determined in the treatment strategy for NSCLC harboring ALK translocations.A 51-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma harboring ALK translocation was treated with alectinib until PD.

Renal  carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, and prostate adenocarcinoma are the most commonly encountered genitourinary malignancies and represent a heterogeneous population of cancers, in both histology and approach to treatment. However, all three cancers have undergone paradigm shifts in their respective therapeutic landscapes due to a greater understanding of their underlying molecular mechanisms and oncogenic drivers. The advance that has gained the most recent traction has been the advent of immunotherapies, particularly   inhibitors. Immunotherapy has increased overall survival and even provided durable responses in the metastatic setting in some patients. The early success of   inhibitors has led to further drug development with the emergence of novel agents which modulate the  system within the tumor microenvironment. Notwithstanding immunotherapy, investigators are also developing novel agents tailored to a variety of targets including small-molecule  kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and novel fusion proteins to name a few. Erdafitinib has become the first targeted therapy approved for metastatic bladder cancer. Moreover, the combination therapy of   inhibitors with targeted agents such as pembrolizumab or avelumab with axitinib has demonstrated both safety and efficacy and just received FDA approval for their use. We are in an era of rapid progression in drug development with multiple exciting trials and ongoing pre-clinical studies.

Unresponsive tumors are characterized as being immunologically "cold," indicating that these tumors lack tumor antigen-specific primed cytotoxic T cells. Sitravatinib is a spectrum-selective  kinase inhibitor targeting TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MerTK) and split -kinase domain-containing receptors (VEGFR and PDGFR families and KIT) plus RET and MET, targets that contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We report that sitravatinib has potent antitumor activity by targeting the tumor microenvironment, resulting in innate and adaptive   changes that augment   blockade. These results suggest that sitravatinib has the potential to combat resistance to   blockade and expand the number of cancer patients that are responsive to  therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616146>Second-line targeted therapies after nivolumab-ipilimumab failure in metastatic renal  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab-ipilimumab demonstrated a survival benefit over sunitinib in first-line setting for metastatic renal  carcinomas (mRCCs) and is becoming a new standard of care for naïve patients with intermediate or poor risk prognosis (International mRCC Database Consortium). The efficacy of subsequent vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after nivolumab-ipilimumab failure remains unclear.Medical records of mRCC patients treated with nivolumab-ipilimumab, who received subsequent TKI, as part of Checkmate 214 study were reviewed in 13 institutions. Baseline characteristics, outcome data including progression-free survival (PFS), response, overall survival (OS) and toxicities were retrospectively collected.Overall 33 patients received subsequent TKI after nivolumab-ipilimumab failure. Median follow-up from start of subsequent TKI is 22 months (19-NR). Best response was assessed in 30 patients: 12 partial responses (36%), 13 stable diseases (39%) and five progressive diseases (15%). Median PFS from start of TKI was 8 months [5-13]. Median PFS with first-generation (sunitinib/pazopanib) and second-generation TKI (axitinib/cabozantinib) was 8 months [5-16] and 7 months (5-NA), respectively. PFS in second line was significantly longer in patients with a long first-line duration of response to the double   blockade (≥6 months) with 8 versus 5 months for short responder (<6 months) (p = 0.03). OS rate was 54% at 12 months. Toxicity was as expected: 42% developed at least one toxicity grade ≥3.This is the first report of outcomes with TKI, after first-line nivolumab-ipilimumab failure. Median PFS suggests a sustained benefit of TKI and supports trials investigating the optimal sequence.Copyright © 2018.

Currently, however, the effect is not universal, with objective response rates (ORR) of about 15-25%, and even lower for some cancers. Abnormal vasculature is a hallmark of most solid tumors and plays a role in  evasion. Growing body of evidence suggests that vascular normalization and  reprogramming could operate synergistic effect, resulting in an enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, the benefit of antitumor efficacy must be weighed against the risk of added toxicity. In this systematic review, we summarize severe toxicity observed in such a kind of combination regimen.  PubMed and Embase were searched for English references published up to May 31, 2019, with MeSH and keywords search terms of   inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic agents approved for using in solid tumors. Studies performing concomitant use of ICIs and antiangiogenic agents, and also reporting severe treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) (≥grade 3), were included for further analysis.  A total of 32 studies including a total of 2,324 participants were analyzed. Limited available data suggests that both antiangiogenic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) show potential risk of increasing treatment-related toxicity when combined with ICIs. Overall, the total incidence of severe adverse events (AEs) associated with ICIs plus mAbs (44.5%) is lower than that of ICIs plus TKIs (60.1%). However, the trAEs observed in combination therapy are mostly consistent with the known safety profiles of corresponding monotherapy, and they seem to be largely related to antiangiogenic agents, rather than a true -related adverse event (irAE) predominantly due to ICIs. The majority of trAEs are intervened by holding ICI treatment and adding corticosteroids, as well as reducing dose or adjusting administration frequency of the antiangiogenic drugs.  Concurrent use of ICIs and antiangiogenic agents shows potential treatment-related toxicity. Further research is required to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen and corresponding monotherapy and identify predictive biomarkers, as well as explore dose, duration, and sequencing schedules of drugs.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Yang, Yi and Zhu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30039640>Review article: systemic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The approval of the  kinase inhibitor sorafenib in 2007 marked a milestone in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, as sorafenib was the first systemic therapy to show a survival benefit in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Since then many drugs failed in the first- and second-line setting and it took almost another decade until further  kinase inhibitors succeeded in phase III trials.To summarise the evolving field of systemic therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.We reviewed recently published studies identified from PubMed and data presented at recent meetings. Main search terms included hepatocellular carcinoma,  kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy,   inhibitors, sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, and nivolumab.We discuss the evolution of targeted therapies since the approval of sorafenib including failures and recent advances. We also elaborate the unmet need of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and discuss the emerging field of immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.The  kinase inhibitors sorafenib (first line) and regorafenib (second line) have been approved for hepatocellular carcinoma, and the   inhibitor nivolumab obtained conditional approval for sorafenib-experienced patients in the United States. With lenvatinib in the first line, and cabozantinib and ramucirumab in sorafenib-experienced patients, three more targeted therapies reached their primary endpoint in phase III trials and may soon be added to the treatment armamentarium.© 2018 The Authors.

Alveolar soft-part sarcoma often affects young adults and is characterized by indolent behavior but early evidence of metastatic spread. After recognition of ASPS as a specific entity in 1952, retrospective data indicated prolonged survival in patients with metastases, despite inherent resistance to conventional doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.  kinase inhibitors and   inhibitors have provided unexpected new treatment strategies for ASPS.This review includes articles published between 1952 and March 1, 2018. With the introduction of new molecular diagnostic tools and therapies, the distinctive features of ASPS have become more evident. The identification and better understanding of molecular pathways activated by the characteristic t(X;17)(p11;q25) translocation and its correspondent chimeric ASPSCR1-transcription factor E3 (TFE3) fusion protein open new paths to drug development. The associations of TFE3 and facilitation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment provide a rationale for exploring treatments that affect the balance between T-effector cells and T-regulatory cells.  kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib, cediranib, and pazopanib, show activity with either tumor responses or disease stabilization in more than 50% of the cases. Given the association of new agents with patient outcomes, it is too early to say whether metastatic ASPS should still be considered incurable in all patients.The biologic outcomes of the canonical genomic event in ASPS remain under investigation; a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the multiple pathways activated in this sarcoma, including unusual bioenergetics, MET signaling, and angiogenesis, should lead to more rational therapy. Basket trials and related prospective studies focusing on the intersection of specific signaling pathways and diseases with unique genomic features, such as ASPS, will provide an understanding of new options for care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051213>Management of  related adverse events induced by   inhibition.</a></h1><p>In recent years,   inhibitors (ICIs) were successfully introduced to cancer therapy and these drugs have already become essential for the treatment of various non-curable tumors. Compared to conventional chemotherapy or  kinase inhibitors, ICIs generally exhibit a favorable side effect profile further promoting their increasing prescription rate. However, increasing use of these substance made clear that ICI induced activation of the  system may also lead to -related adverse events (irAEs). Common irAEs are dermatological, gastrointestinal, or endocrine side effects but further tissue types and organ systems may also be affected. A detailed knowledge of these potential side effects is important as early recognition is the key to successful treatment, reversibility of organ dysfunction and in some cases even prevention of fatal outcome. In more severe irAEs, immunosuppression may be necessary to cope with these side effects. To increase awareness of irAEs and support immediate and successful management, we provide a comprehensive review on most common irAEs of ICIs, their diagnosis, and treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Among patients who undergo surgery for these cancers, 30-35% will eventually develop potentially fatal metachronous distant metastases. Effective adjuvant treatments are urgently needed to reduce the risk of recurrence of kidney cancer and of dying of metastatic disease. To date, almost all of the tested adjuvant agents have failed to demonstrate any benefit. Only two trials of an autologous renal tumour  vaccine and of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)  kinase inhibitor sunitinib have shown positive results, but these have been criticized for methodological reasons and conflicting data, respectively. The results of two additional trials of targeted agents as adjuvant therapies have not yet been published. Novel   inhibitors are promising approaches to adjuvant therapy in kidney cancer, and a number of trials are now underway. An important component of the management of patients with kidney cancer, particularly those who undergo radical resection for localized renal  carcinoma, is the preservation of kidney function to reduce morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of these patients therefore requires a multidisciplinary approach involving nephrologists, oncologists, urologists and pathologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30350129>[Risk-adapted (immuno)therapy for renal  carcinoma].</a></h1><p>The introduction of immunotherapy into the therapeutic algorithm of metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) represents the most recent expansion of the therapy landscape.

Cabozantinib and tivozanib are two new first-line options that redefine the existing therapy algorithm. The importance of the  blockade in the first line is clinically undisputed; however, approval of the  combination ipilimumab + nivolumab has not yet been granted.

At the time of this study, there was limited published data on the combination of  kinase inhibitors and   inhibitors in patients who were heavily pretreated. At our institution, providers have used these combinations in heavily pretreated patients.We conducted a retrospective review of patients receiving this combination with the primary objectives of assessing duration of therapy and toxicities and a secondary objective of disease progression at six months. We included adult patients with confirmed mRCC receiving combination therapy (  inhibitors/ kinase inhibitors) any time after January 2015. Electronic medical records were reviewed for pertinent data and follow-up descriptive statistics were performed.Fifteen patients were on combination   inhibitors/ kinase inhibitors, with a median of three lines of previous therapy. The median duration of combination therapy was 7.2 months (range: 0.2 to 39.8) with 126 incidences of toxicities. The most frequent toxicity was fatigue (n = 15), followed by diarrhea (n = 8), anorexia (n = 7) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (n = 7). Overall, 9 (60%) patients experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Eight of 15 (53%) patients remained on therapy at the six-month mark and did not have progression confirmed by an oncologist. Of the 15 patients, 10 discontinued therapy due to progression, 2 due to intolerable side effects, 2 transitioned to end of life care, and 1 patient was still ongoing at the time of data collection.Based on this review, it appears that combination  kinase inhibitors/  inhibitors therapy in pre-treated patients with mRCC is tolerable and beneficial.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348216>Safety and efficacy of nivolumab in combination with sunitinib or pazopanib in advanced or metastatic renal  carcinoma: the CheckMate 016 study.</a></h1><p>Combination treatment with   inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs has shown encouraging preliminary antitumor activity across various tumor types including advanced or metastatic renal  carcinoma (aRCC). The open-label, parallel-cohort, dose-escalation, phase I CheckMate 016 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in combination with antiangiogenic  kinase inhibitors or ipilimumab. Long-term outcomes from this study for the combination of nivolumab plus sunitinib or pazopanib in aRCC are presented.Patients with aRCC received nivolumab plus either sunitinib (50 mg/day, 4 weeks on/2 weeks off; N + S) or pazopanib (800 mg/day; N + P) until progression/unacceptable toxicity. The nivolumab starting dose was 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, with planned escalation to 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability; antitumor activity was a secondary endpoint.Arm N + S enrolled 33 patients, 19 of whom were treatment-naïve; this arm advanced to the expansion phase. Median follow-up was 50.0 months. Patients experienced high frequencies of adverse events (AEs) including treatment-related AEs (100%), grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs (82%), and treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation (39%). Investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) was 55% (18/33) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.7 months. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Arm N + P enrolled 20 patients, all had ≥1 prior systemic therapy; this arm was closed due to dose-limiting toxicities and did not proceed to expansion. Median follow-up was 27.1 months. Patients treated with N + P experienced high frequencies of AEs including treatment-related AEs (100%), grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs (70%), and treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation (25%). Investigator-assessed ORR was 45% (9/20) and median PFS was 7.2 months. Median OS was 27.9 months.The addition of standard doses of sunitinib or pazopanib to nivolumab resulted in a high incidence of high-grade toxicities limiting future development of either combination regimen. While there was no adverse impact on response and the OS outcome was notable, the findings suggest that the success of combination regimens based on   inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs may be dependent on careful selection of the antiangiogenic component and dose.Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:  .

Through the depletion of Trp and the generation of kynurenines, IDO1 represents a key regulator of the  responses involved in physiologic homeostasis as well as in neoplastic and autoimmune pathologies. The IDO1 enzyme has been described as an important   to be targeted by catalytic inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. In contrast, a defective expression/activity of the enzyme has been demonstrated in autoimmune diseases. Beside its catalytic activity, the IDO1 protein is endowed with an additional function associated with the presence of two immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which, once phosphorylated, bind SHP phosphatases and mediate a long-term immunoregulatory activity of IDO1. Herein, we report the screening of a focused library of molecules bearing a propanol core by a protocol combining microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis and a cellular assay. As a result, the combined screening identified a 2-propanolol analogue, VIS351, as the first potent activator of the ITIM-mediated function of the IDO1 enzyme. VIS351 displayed a good dissociation constant (Kd = 1.90 μM) for IDO1 and a moderate cellular inhibitor activity (IC = 11.463 μM), although it did not show any catalytic inhibition of the recombinant IDO1 enzyme. Because we previously demonstrated that the enzymatic and non-enzymatic (i.e., ITIM-mediated) functions of IDO1 reside in different conformations of the protein, we hypothesized that in the cellular system VIS351 may shift the dynamic conformational balance towards the ITIM-favoring folding of IDO1, resulting in the activation of the signaling rather than catalytic activity of IDO1. We demonstrated that VIS351 activated the ITIM-mediated signaling of IDO1 also in mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conferring those cells an immunosuppressive phenotype detectable in vivo. Thus the manuscript describes for the first time a small molecule as a positive modulator of IDO1 signaling function, paving the basis for an innovative approach to develop first-in-class drugs acting on the IDO1 target.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In the realm of adjuvant therapy, the results of adjuvant therapy phase III randomized clinical trials have been mixed and contradictory; nevertheless, the findings of the landmark Sunitinib Treatment of Renal Adjuvant Cancer study have led to approval of sunitinib as an adjuvant agent in the USA. In the realm of neoadjuvant therapy, presurgical tumor reduction has been shown in a number of phase II studies utilizing targeted molecular agents and in a recently published small randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, and an expanding body of literature suggests benefit in select patients. Thus, large randomized clinical trial data are not present to support this approach, and guidelines for use of presurgical therapy have not been promulgated.

The overall incidence of renal  carcinoma appears to be increasing but death rates have been declining. Patients with poor risk, advanced disease have a two-year survival rate of approximately 7%. Prior to the advent of  kinase inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and  inhibitors, IFN-α and high-dose IL-2, were standard of care treatment options but, conversely, their use is now limited to select patients. Immunotherapies have played a significant role in the treatment of various cancers and have continued to expand. It is of utmost importance that practitioners include  inhibitors as treatment options for renal  carcinoma as they mark a new era in the treatment of advanced or relapsed setting. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, ipilimumab, and atezolizumab all play a role in management of disease as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Ongoing clinical trials are ongoing to further assess the benefits of inducing cellular immunity in the treatment of renal  carcinoma.

Objective 1 is to which treatment option is immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or the combination of immunotherapy with targeted therapy the best for patients? Objective 2 is to study which regimens with the highest chance of cure/durable response and what is the optimal sequence in advanced RCC.Between 2016 and 2018, 6 adult patients admitted to our institute with RCC were reviewed. Clinical information, treatment and outcomes were retrieved for further analysis. This applies to all risk groups as determined by the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium criteria. We have intended to provide the reader with a comprehensive and authoritative review of the broad subject of RCC.Immunotherapy-based regimens and the functioning of various growth-and survival-promoting kinases, specifically, receptor-associated  kinases have dramatically changed the treatment landscape of advanced RCC. Recent phase III trials have demonstrated a survival benefit for front-line ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy, and   inhibition plus anti-vascular endothelial growth factor combination therapy in metastatic clear- RCC.In renal  carcinoma, rapid and successful drug development has resulted in multiple treatment options, requiring careful decision making for individual patients and have emphasized how newly developed therapies work.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089619>  inhibitor-related myositis and myocarditis in patients with cancer.</a></h1><p>To report the clinicopathologic features and outcome of myositis in patients treated with   inhibitors (ICIs) (irMyositis).We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with irMyositis in tertiary centers in Paris, France, and Berlin, Germany, from January 2015 to July 2017. The main outcomes were clinical manifestations and muscle histology, which included major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), C5b-9, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L) 1, and programmed  death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2).Ten patients with metastatic cancer were included; median age was 73 (range 56-87) years.

Six patients developed myositis during nivolumab therapy, 1 patient during pembrolizumab, 1 patient during durvalumab, and 2 patients during combined nivolumab and ipilimumab. Median delay between ICI initiation and myositis onset was 25 (range 5-87) days. Clinical manifestations were dominated by acute or subacute myalgia (8 patients) and limb-girdle (7), axial (7), and oculomotor (7) weakness. Four patients had evidence of myocarditis. In all patients, creatine kinase levels were elevated (median 2,668, range 1,059-16,620 U/L), while anti-acetylcholine receptor and myositis-associated antibodies were negative. Electrodiagnostic studies showed myopathic process without decrement in all patients. Muscle biopsy constantly showed multifocal necrotic myofibers, sarcolemmal MHC-I, and endomysial inflammation, consisting mainly of CD68+ cells expressing PD-L1 and CD8+ cells expressing PD-1. ICI treatment was withdrawn in all patients; 9 patients received immunosuppressive therapy, which consistently led to marked clinical improvement.irMyositis presents with remarkably homogeneous and unique clinicopathologic features, expanding the nosologic spectrum of inflammatory myopathies in patients with cancer.

However, along with the clinical benefit provided by these new treatments, new adverse effects have also appeared. Dermatological toxicities such as papulopustular eruptions, xerosis, and pruritus are common with EGFR inhibitors. Other adverse effects have also been described with PDGFR, BCR-ABL, and MAPK  kinase inhibitors, antiangiogenic drugs, and inhibitors at   such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. Onset of these adverse effects often causes dose reductions and/or delays in administering the prescribed therapy, which can affect patient survival and quality of life. It is, therefore, important to prevent the occurrence of these adverse effects, or to treat unavoidable ones as soon as possible.

Most had undergone radical nephrectomy; five had clear- carcinoma and acquired cystic disease-associated carcinoma. The patients were finally diagnosed with progressive disease during nivolumab treatment. Immediately after nivolumab treatment failure, one patient receiving pazopanib had an adverse event soon after, and subsequently received axitinib, which the others received. The size of the metastatic tumors treated with axitinib after nivolumab was on average 33.9% smaller. Following treatment, three patients experienced partial response with remarkable tumor shrinkage and three had stable disease (SD), of which most maintained for >5 months. One patient with SD died from gradual tumor progression after axitinib treatment.

Furthermore, clinical indications and reimbursement criteria can vary across Europe. The aim of the present online survey was to assess the knowledge, views and challenges facing the European respiratory community in this rapidly changing field. A 15-question web survey was sent to all European Respiratory Society members through the Society's monthly electronic communication. A total of 315 questionnaires were completed. Most of the respondents were male (59.1%), were above 40 years of age (52.9%) and were working in university/academic hospitals (74.8%), the majority as pulmonologists (90%).

There are still no effective targeted therapies in SCLC despite improved understanding of the molecular steps leading to SCLC development and progression these last years. After four decades, the only modest improvement in OS of patients suffering from ES-SCLC has recently been shown in a trial combining atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1   inhibitor, with carboplatin and etoposide, chemotherapy agents. This highlights the need to pursue research efforts in this field. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor protein  kinase that is overexpressed and activated in several cancers, including SCLC, and contributing to cancer progression and metastasis through its important role in  proliferation, survival, adhesion, spreading, migration, and invasion. FAK also plays a role in tumor  evasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA damage repair, radioresistance, and regulation of cancer stem cells. FAK is of particular interest in SCLC, being known for its aggressiveness. The inhibition of FAK in SCLC  lines demonstrated significative decrease in  proliferation, invasion, and migration, and induced   arrest and apoptosis. In this review, we will focus on the role of FAK in cancer cells and their microenvironment, and its potential as a therapeutic target in SCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834050>Pretreatment Lung  Prognostic Index Is a Prognostic Marker of Chemotherapy and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor  Kinase Inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Lung  prognostic index (LIPI) was recently developed on the basis of the combination of baseline derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This index was demonstrated as a specific biomarker of   inhibitors for non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to show that LIPI may be a useful biomarker of cytotoxic chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitor (TKI) for NSCLC.We retrospectively collected 175 wild-type EGFR adenocarcinomas, 131 NSCLCs harboring mutant EGFR and 110 squamous  carcinomas. All patients initiated first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI monotherapy between July 2007 and August 2017 at our hospital. These patients were divided into good, intermediate and poor LIPI groups. We compared their overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analyses detected prognostic and predictive factors of OS and PFS.The good LIPI group survived longer than the intermediate and poor LIPI groups in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (good, intermediate and poor LIPI groups: median 19.6, 11.5 and 3.3 months, P < 0.01, respectively) and mutant EGFR NSCLC (45.4, 25.6 and 15.7 months, P < 0.01). The PFS of good LIPI group was significantly longer that those of the other two groups in mutant EGFR NSCLC (16.6, 12.6 and 8.3 months, P < 0.01). The intermediate group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.49, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.03 - 2.15, P = 0.04) of wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma, intermediate (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.33 - 3.99, P < 0.01) and poor (HR 2.76, 95% CI 1.03 - 7.42, P = 0.04) groups of mutant EGFR NSCLC were independent prognostic factors of poor OS. The intermediate (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01 - 2.44, P = 0.04) and poor (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.14 - 6.07, P = 0.02) groups were significant prognostic factors of PFS of mutant EGFR NSCLC.LIPI was an independent prognostic factor of chemotherapy for adenocarcinoma with wild-type EGFR and of EGFR-TKI for NSCLC harboring mutant EGFR. Thus, LIPI was not a specific biomarker for ICI therapy, but a useful biomarker for chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI therapy in specific subsets of NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30187355>  Inhibitors: Toward New Paradigms in Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h1><p> modulatory treatment regimens, led by   inhibitors, have transformed the treatment of clear- renal  carcinoma. First-in-class, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab improved overall survival in advanced renal  carcinoma following prior anti-angiogenic therapy, an important shift in the management of clear- renal  carcinoma. Further improvements of long-term outcomes will be driven by combinations in the first-line setting, including PD-1/PD-L1 associated with antiangiogenic therapies, or PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors with other   inhibitors such as anti-CTLA-4, anti-LAG-3 or TIM-3 targeted therapies. The first two randomized Phase 3 trials assessing these combinations have now challenged sunitinib in first-line setting. First, the CheckMate 214 trial demonstrated an objective response rate and overall survival benefit for the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the intermediate- and poor-risk patients. Second, the IMMotion 151 study demonstrated a progression-free survival benefit for the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination by investigator assessment. Further Phase 3 trials are awaited with  kinase and   inhibitor combinations. Clinical trials of   inhibitors are also actively investigated in the localized adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. Nevertheless, the search for biomarkers along with new clinical trial designs will be crucial to better select the patients that may derive the greatest benefit from these advances. The continuing improvement of antitumor immunity comprehension and the emergence of new  modulatory treatments will deeply change the management of renal  carcinoma for the years to come.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423172>Introduction of novel agents in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma.</a></h1><p>Novel insights into the pathophysiology of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) have identified the B- receptor and Toll-like receptor pathway as well as  evasion and suppressed tumor  microenvironment as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of PCNSL. Small molecules and novel agents targeting these aberrant pathways have been introduced into clinical trials targeting the recurrent or refractory PCNSL patient population. Agents like the Bruton  kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib or immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like pomalidomide and lenalidomide have shown promising high response rates in the salvage setting. Here, we give an overview about the recent, exciting developments in PCNSL and summarize the results of clinical trials using novel agents in the recurrent and refractory salvage setting, which include   inhibitors, IMiDs, as well as BTK, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors.© The Author(s) 2018.

Pembrolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody to the programmed  death 1 (PD-1) receptor, has also shown survival benefit in lung SCC. Concurrent inhibition of the PD-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways represents a rational approach to improve responses and delay the onset of treatment resistance in lung SCC.This phase II, open-label, single-arm study () is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with stage IIIB/IV lung SCC that has progressed during/after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligible patients must have ≥1 target lesion (as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) and must have not received previous   inhibitor/EGFR-targeted therapy. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile will be determined during a safety run-in with oral afatinib (starting dose, 40 mg/d) with intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks). In the main study, all patients will receive afatinib at the RP2D with pembrolizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 35 cycles. The primary end point is objective response (complete + partial response). Other end points include disease control, duration of objective response, progression-free survival, overall survival, tumor shrinkage, RP2D, and pharmacokinetics. Exploratory biomarker analysis will be performed. This study is being conducted in the United States, Spain, France, South Korea, and Turkey.

However, other biological and genetic peculiarities contribute to differentiate this malignancy from other solid tumors, including its immunogenicity. Areas covered: This review focuses on the present and future role of antiangiogenic drugs, administered either alone (as it has been in the past few years), or in combination with other agents (e.g.   inhibitors), in the treatment of metastatic RCC. Expert commentary: Due to its peculiar pathogenesis, it is unrealistic to expect to be able to get rid of antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of this disease; however, we do expect that combinations of VEGF/VEGFRs-targeting agents with   inhibitors will gradually replace antiangiogenic monotherapies as the standard of care, at least in the first line setting of metastatic RCC patients. Biomarkers discovery remains the highest priority in order to further improve the percentage of patients benefitting of our treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200752>p65BTK is a novel potential actionable target in KRAS-mutated/EGFR-wild type lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer is still the main cause of cancer death worldwide despite the availability of targeted therapies and - inhibitors combined with chemotherapy. Cancer  heterogeneity and primary or acquired resistance mechanisms cause the elusive behaviour of this cancer and new biomarkers and active drugs are urgently needed to overcome these limitations. p65BTK, a novel isoform of the Bruton  Kinase may represent a new actionable target in non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC).p65BTK expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 382 NSCLC patients with complete clinico-pathological records including smoking habit, ALK and EGFR status, and in metastatic lymph nodes of 30 NSCLC patients. NSCLC  lines mutated for p53 and/or a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and primary lung cancer-derived cells from Kras/Trp53 null mice were used as a preclinical model. The effects of p65BTK inhibition by BTK  Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) (Ibrutinib, AVL-292, RN486) and first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib, Erlotinib) on  viability were evaluated by MTT. The effects of BTK-TKIs on  growth and clonogenicity were assessed by crystal violet and colony assays, respectively.  toxicity assays were performed to study the effect of the combination of non-toxic concentrations of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs and standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Gemcitabine, Pemetrexed).p65BTK was significantly over-expressed in EGFR-wild type (wt) adenocarcinomas (AdC) from non-smoker patients and its expression was also preserved at the metastatic site. p65BTK was also over-expressed in  lines mutated for KRAS or for a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and in tumors from Kras/Trp53 null mice. BTK-TKIs were more effective than EGFR-TKIs in decreasing cancer  viability and significantly impaired  proliferation and clonogenicity. Moreover, non-toxic doses of BTK-TKIs re-sensitized drug-resistant NSCLC  lines to both target- and SOC therapy, independently from EGFR/KRAS status.p65BTK results as an emerging actionable target in non-smoking EGFR-wt AdC, also at advanced stages of disease. Notably, these patients are not eligible for EGFR-TKIs-based therapy due to a lack of EGFR mutation. The combination of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs is cytotoxic for EGFR-wt/KRAS-mutant/p53-null tumors and BTK-TKIs re-sensitizes drug-resistant NSCLC to SOC chemotherapy. Therefore, our data suggest that adding BTK-TKIs to SOC chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted therapy may open new avenues for clinical trials in currently untreatable NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30370177>Prevalence of Hepatocyte Growth Factor and Autoantibodies to α-HGF as a New Etiology for Bilateral Diffuse Uveal Melanocytic Proliferation Masquerading as Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.</a></h1><p>The goal was to test the hypothesis that high serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and retinal autoantibodies against α-HGF contribute to the pathology of bilateral diffuse melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP).Case report of an elderly diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (n-AMD) treated with bilateral Bevacizumab injections. Examination included comprehensive ophthalmic examination and images obtained by fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and B-scan ultrasonography. The levels of HGF and circulating HGF receptor (c-MET) were measured in the serum by ELISA and anti-retinal autoantibodies by western blotting.Patient received Bevacizumab injections for presumed n-AMD and had a history of papillary renal  carcinoma stage 4 with a tumor containing gene mutation Y1230C in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET). Visual acuity was 20/200 OD and CF OS. Multimodal imaging was consistent with BDUMP. Plasma exchange therapy was recommended but could not be started until 10 months later due to deterioration in his medical condition. Pre- and post-plasma exchange sera demonstrated anti-retinal autoantibodies against 69-kDa protein of the same molecular weight as the α-HGF. Serum autoantibodies reacted with purified recombinant α-HGF on the blot.BDUMP can mimic n-AMD, which can delay treatment. Plasma exchange resulted in resolved inflammation, resolution of exudative detachments and improved vision after cataract surgery. Consideration of the tumor genetics led to the recognition of elevated HGF levels and autoantibodies to α-HGF (anti-69-kDa), which suggested a new pathogenic mechanism of BDUMP. We believe that therapy with  kinase inhibitors and a  inhibitor may contribute to the high HGF levels and subsequent  response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378264>Tumour -intrinsic CTLA4 regulates PD-L1 expression in non-small  lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) are   proteins expressed in T cells. Although CTLA4 expression was found in multiple tumours including non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cells, its function in tumour cells is unknown. Recently, PD-1 was found to be expressed in melanoma cells and to promote tumorigenesis. We found that CTLA4 was expressed in a subset of NSCLC  lines and in a subgroup of cancer cells within the lung cancer tissues. We further found that in NSCLC cells, anti-CTLA4 antibody can induce PD-L1 expression, which is mediated by CTLA4 and the EGFR pathway involving phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. In CTLA4 knockout cells, EGFR knockout cells or in the presence of an EGFR  kinase inhibitor, anti-CTLA4 antibody was not able to induce PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. Moreover, anti-CTLA4 antibody promoted NSCLC  proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo in the absence of adaptive immunity. These results suggest that tumour -intrinsic CTLA4 can regulate PD-L1 expression and  proliferation, and that anti-CTLA4 antibody, by binding to the tumour -intrinsic CTLA4, may result in the activation of the EGFR pathway in cancer cells.© 2018 The Authors.

To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations (PTPN11, BRAF) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes as well as with differences in T  clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles. Our study shows that clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in GBM is associated with specific molecular alterations,  expression signatures, and  infiltration that reflect the tumor's clonal evolution during treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30101284>Translational insights into gastrointestinal stromal tumor and current clinical advances.</a></h1><p>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract and, in the vast majority of cases, is characterized by activating mutations in KIT or, less commonly, PDGFRA. Mutations in these type III receptor  kinases (RTKs) account for over 85% of GIST cases, and the majority of KIT primary mutations respond to treatment with the  kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. However, drug resistance develops over time, most commonly due to secondary kinase mutations. Sunitinib and regorafenib are approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant GIST in the second and third lines, respectively. However, resistance to these agents also develops and new therapeutic options are needed. In addition, a small number of GISTs harbor primary activating mutations that are resistant to currently available TKIs, highlighting an additional unmet medical need. Several novel and selective TKIs that overcome known mechanisms of resistance in GIST have been developed and show promise in early clinical trials. Additional emerging targeted therapies in GIST include modulation of cellular signaling pathways downstream of KIT, antibodies targeting KIT and PDGFRA and   inhibitors. These advancements highlight the rapid evolution in the understanding of this malignancy and provide perspective on the encouraging horizon of current and forthcoming therapeutic strategies for GIST.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158285>The Current and Evolving Landscape of First-Line Treatments for Advanced Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs), as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and   receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) signaling pathway have improved clinical outcomes for patients with advanced renal  carcinoma (RCC). The VEGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) pazopanib and sunitinib are FDA-approved first-line treatment options for advanced RCC; however, other treatment options in this setting are available, including the recently approved combination of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 [CTLA-4]) for patients with intermediate or poor risk. Unfortunately, treatment guideline recommendations provide little guidance to aid first-line treatment choice. In addition, several ongoing randomized phase III trials of investigational first-line regimens may complicate the RCC treatment paradigm if these agents gain approval. This article reviews clinical trial and real-world evidence for currently approved and investigational first-line treatment regimens for advanced RCC and provides clinical evidence to aid first-line treatment selection. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitors are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as first-line treatment options for advanced renal  carcinoma; however, the treatment paradigm is rapidly evolving. The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was recently approved for intermediate- and poor-risk patients, and other combination strategies and novel first-line agents will likely be introduced soon.© AlphaMed Press 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29764444>Molecular and clinical characterization of PTPN2 expression from RNA-seq data of 996 brain gliomas.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors have been shown to promote antitumor immunity and achieve durable tumor remissions. However, certain tumors are refractory to current immunotherapy. These negative results encouraged us to uncover other therapeutic targets and strategies. PTPN2 (protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 2) has been newly identified as an immunotherapy target. Loss of PTPN2 sensitizes the tumor to immunotherapy via IFNγ signaling.Here, we investigated the relationship between PTPN2 mRNA levels and clinical characteristics in gliomas. RNA-seq data of a cohort of 325 patients with glioma were available from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas and 671 from The Cancer Genome Atlas. R language, GraphPad Prism 5, and SPSS 22.0 were used to analyze data and draw figures.PTPN2 transcript levels increased significantly with higher grades of glioma and in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type and mesenchymal subtype gliomas. A comprehensive biological analysis was conducted, which indicated a crucial role of PTPN2 in the  and inflammation responses in gliomas. Specifically, PTPN2 was positively associated with HCK, LCK, MHC II, and STAT1 but negatively related to IgG and interferon. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis showed a positive correlation of PTPN2 with infiltrating  cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and CD8 T cells. Clinically, higher levels of PTPN2 were associated with a worse overall survival both in patients with gliomas and glioblastomas.PTPN2 expression level was increased in glioblastomas and associated with gliomas of the IDH wild-type and mesenchymal subtype. There was a close correlation between PTPN2 and the  response and inflammatory activity in gliomas. Our results show that PTPN2 is a promising immunotherapy target and may provide additional treatment strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377308>Sequencing and Combination of Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Introduction of additional new agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and   inhibitors (ICIs) has completely modified the systemic treatment of metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) during the last years.A comprehensive (nonsystematic) review to determine the suggested sequence or combinations for the systemic treatment of mRCC.PubMed and abstracts from main conferences up to December 2018 were reviewed to retrieve the current evidence for treatment of mRCC. Search terms included renal  carcinoma, systemic therapy, targeted therapy (TT), and immunotherapy.Marked advances in the treatment of mRCC have been made with novel VEGFR  kinase inhibitors and multiple ICIs that have been included in the current treatment paradigm of mRCC. Remarkable advance has been made with the combination of double  blockade. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab compared with sunitinib has shown to increase the overall survival in the intermediate- and poor-risk patients based on the International Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) model.Double  blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab has reported overall survival benefit in IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk patients, providing a durable response for a subset of patients. VEGF inhibitors remain the standard of care for favorable-risk patients in the first line. In the immediate future, more consolidated data on combination of VEGF-TT plus ICIs may show similar robust benefit with different safety profiles.Multiple drugs and sequences are now accepted as effective treatment for metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC). Combination of   inhibitors has shown to increase the overall survival in treatment-naïve mRCC patients. Combinations of immunotherapy and antiangiogenics may be another option in the near future.

In contrast, little is known of the subpopulation of patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations who exhibit clinical outcomes that require treatment with   inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, to identify eligible cases to treat with ICIs, we retrospectively analyzed the correlation between clinical features and the efficacy of ICIs in patients with EGFR mutations.We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations who were treated with ICIs after developing resistance to EGFR-TKIs between February 2016 and April 2018 at 6 institutions in Japan. The association between clinical outcomes and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated.We enrolled 27 patients who harbored EGFR-activating mutations. The objective response and disease control rates were higher in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations than in those with common EGFR mutations (71% vs 35.7% and 57% vs 7%, P = 0.14 and P < 0.01, respectively). Patients with uncommon EGFR mutations or without T790M mutations exhibited a significantly longer median progression-free survival than those with common EGFR mutations or with T790M mutations (P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively).Patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and without T790M mutations are associated with the best outcomes for treatment with immunotherapy among those with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis.

The prognosis for patients with untreated brain metastases is poor, with surgical resection and/or radiotherapy as classic therapeutic options. However, the value of systemic therapy in the management of CNS metastases from lung cancer is growing. Novel targeted agents for the treatment of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) have demonstrated activity in treating patients with CNS involvement, and are potential alternatives to radiation and surgery. These agents include anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors such as alectinib, crizotinib, ceritinib, lorlatinib, and others; epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitors, including the recently developed third-generation inhibitor osimertinib, and even   inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab.

However, pancreatic cancers are still intractable and difficult to treat once recurrence or metastasis occurs; thus, novel combined use of   blockade (ICB) with molecular targeted drugs is considered a therapeutic option. Previously, we developed a novel humanized MHC-double knockout (dKO) NOG mouse model and demonstrated that an anti-PD-1 antibody or a STAT3 inhibitor showed anti-tumor effects through an immunological mechanism. In the current study, using a humanized mouse model, we aimed to develop a combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 antibody and a STAT3 inhibitor (STX-0119) for use in vivo against pancreatic cancer. In an in vitro investigation, STX-0119 showed weak to moderate cytotoxic activity against several pancreatic cancer  lines, which exhibited activated pSTAT3 and weak PD-L1 expression. However, unexpectedly, an in vivo study indicated that the combination of the anti-PD-1 antibody with STX-0119 remarkably reduced the anti-tumor effect and TIL numbers despite the effective anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer was produced individually by STX-0119 and the anti-PD-1 antibody. These results suggested that the combination of an anti-PD-1 antibody with specific signal inhibiting drugs should be carefully evaluated to avoid unexpected side effects, and such studies might contribute to the development of an effective combination regimen of ICB with cancer-targeting drugs such as  kinase inhibitors (TKIs).Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, most patients eventually develop resistance. With the development of   inhibitors targeting the programmed  death receptor/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1), there is a growing interest in developing combination strategies. However, there are concerns that the combination of a PD-(L)1 inhibitor and EGFR-TKI may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis. Therefore, we utilized an established EGFR-driven tumor-bearing mouse model to investigate whether the combination would induce pneumonitis in mouse lung tissue.Mice were treated with monotherapy or combined therapy of PD-L1 antibody and EGFR-TKIs including first-generation gefitinib and third-generation osimertinib. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and lung tissues were collected for analysis at the end of treatment.The osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group had the highest inflammation scores in pathologic grades of H&E staining of lung tissue and had the highest percentages of myeloperoxidase positive cells. However, combining gefitinib and anti-PD-L1 treatment appeared to not increase the level of pneumonitis in mice. Total  counts, neutrophil counts and total protein concentration in BALFs were also significantly increased in the osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. We next evaluated proinflammatory factors in BALFs. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5, TNF-α and IL-12p70 were increased in osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. Comparison of different sequences of drug administration demonstrated that mice treated with osimertinib followed by PD-L1 antibody did not show evident lung inflammation. Our findings indicate that osimertinib, rather than gefitinib combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment could lead to lung injury in an EGFR mutated tumor-bearing mouse model.

Despite recent progress, results after treatment are durable in half of patients, and therapy can be associated with late neurotoxicity. Novel insights into the pathophysiology of PCNSL have identified the B- receptor (BCR) pathway as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of PCNSL. The use of novel agents targeting components of the BCR pathway, namely the Bruton  kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, and immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs) like lenalidomide and pomalidomide, has so far been limited to patients who have recurrent/refractory PCNSL with promising high response rates. Within the past 5 years, there has been a peak in clinical trials investigating small molecules and novel reagents in the recurrent/refractory setting, including   inhibitors, IMIDs, and BTK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810279>EGFR exon 21 L858R as an acquired resistance mechanism to nivolumab in a lung cancer patient originally driver gene-negative.</a></h1><p>The use of   inhibitors targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 in advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) has been one of the most significant improvements in recent years. However the resistance mechanisms of   inhibitors require further investigation. Herein we attempted to determine the possible resistance mechanism of nivolumab in a male smoker with advanced adenosquamous carcinoma. After experiencing disease progression on systematic chemotherapy, he was administered nivolumab as a result of high PD-L1 expression. Larger panel gene detection was performed after the failure of nivolumab treatment to investigate the possible resistance mechanism and a new EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation was detected. After a achieving a response with gefitinib, the patient suffered a rapid relapse and died of tumor progression. This case represents the first time EGFR exon 21 L858R has been detected as an acquired resistance mutation to nivolumab. Patients with high PD-L1 expression may exhibit a poor response to EGFR- kinase inhibitors. Large panel gene detection remains the optimal choice when confronted with drug resistance.© 2019 The Authors.

It is also reactivated in many solid tumors. In lung cancer, Hedgehog pathway is closely associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent works have shown that CSCs produced a full-length Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein, with paracrine activity and induction of tumor development. Hedgehog pathway is also involved in tumor drug resistance in lung cancer, as cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. This review proposes to describe the activation mechanisms of Hedgehog pathway in lung cancer, the clinical implications for overcoming drug resistance, and the perspectives for further research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373905>Genomic Profiling of Parathyroid Carcinoma Reveals Genomic Alterations Suggesting Benefit from Therapy.</a></h1><p>Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare endocrine malignancy that can cause life-threatening hypercalcemia. We queried whether comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of PC might identify genomic alterations (GAs), which would suggest benefit from rationally matched therapeutics.We performed hybrid-capture-based CGP to identify GAs and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in tumors from patients with this malignancy.There were 85 total GAs in 16 cases (5.3 GAs per case), and the median TMB was 1.7 mutations per megabase (m/Mb), with three cases having >20 m/Mb (18.7%). The genes most frequently harboring GA were  (38%),  (38%), and  (31%). All -mutated cases also had loss of heterozygosity at that locus, but in contrast all -mutated cases retained heterozygosity. GAs suggesting potential benefit from matched targeted therapy were identified in 11 patients (69%) and most frequently found in  (25%),  (12.5%),  (12.5%),  (12.5%), and  (12.5%). A patient whose tumor harbored  T668 K and who was treated with cabozantinib experienced a > 50% drop in parathyroid hormone level and radiographic partial response of 5.4 months with duration limited by toxicity.CGP identified GAs in PC that suggest benefit from targeted therapy, as supported by an index case of response to a matched  kinase inhibitor. Moreover, the unexpectedly high frequency of high TMB (>20 m/Mb) suggests a subset of PC may benefit from   inhibitors.Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare endocrine malignancy that can cause life-threatening hypercalcemia. However, its molecular characteristics remain unclear, with few systemic therapeutic options available for this tumor. Hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling of 16 primary cancers demonstrated presence of potentially actionable genomic alterations, including , , , , and  and a subset of hypermutated cancers with more than 20 mutations per megabase, the latter of which could benefit from   inhibitor therapy. A case benefiting from rationally matched targeted therapy for activating  mutation is also presented.

Currently,  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the first-line treatment for cases refractory to conventional therapies. However, the acquisition of somatic mutations can result in TKI resistance. Clinical evidence suggests that acquired immunity contributes to the suppression of tumor recurrence, indicating the potential of induced antitumor  reaction for the treatment of HCC. Recently,   inhibitors have become available for the treatment of malignancies. They are effective regardless of the response to prior therapies and a durable effect can be expected, which should be attributed to an adaptive immunity to HCC components. The results of phase I/II trials of nivolumab, an anti-programmed  death-1 antibody, showed that 20% of patients showed objective response and that nivolumab was effective regardless of prior sorafenib treatment and viral status. Nivolumab received expedited Food and Drug Administration approval in 2017 for the treatment of advanced HCC after failure or intolerance to sorafenib. However, the majority of the patients remain refractory, likely due to the solid  suppressive status, which involves many stromal cells, humoral mediators, and suppressive  molecules. Therefore, current clinical trials are focusing on how immunosuppressive conditions in HCC might be overcome using   inhibitors in combination with different types of   blockades, TKIs, and other conventional treatments. The development of   inhibitors is rapidly progressing and these inhibitors are likely to be key agents for HCC treatment in the near feature.© 2018 The Japan Society of Hepatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935402>Molecular pathogenic pathways in extranodal NK/T  lymphoma.</a></h1><p>Extranodal NK/T  lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) is an aggressive malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Although L-asparaginase-based chemotherapy has resulted in improved response rates, relapse occurs in up to 50% of patients with disseminated disease. There is hence an urgent need for effective targeted therapy, especially for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Novel insights gleaned from high-throughput molecular and genomic profiling studies in recent years have contributed significantly to the understanding of the molecular biology of ENKTL, which exemplifies many of the hallmarks of cancer. Deregulated pro-proliferative signaling pathways, such as the Janus-associated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Aurora kinase, MYC, and NF-κB, have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. The discovery of the non-canonical function of EZH2 as a pro-proliferative transcriptional co-activator has shed further light on the pathogenesis of ENKTL. Loss of key tumor suppressor genes located on chromosome 6q21 also plays an important role. The best-studied examples include PR domain zinc finger protein 1(PRDM1), protein  phosphatase kappa (PTPRK), and FOXO3. Promoter hypermethylation has been shown to result in the downregulation of other tumor suppressor genes in ENKTL, which may be potentially targeted through hypomethylating agents. Deregulation of apoptosis through p53 mutations and upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, survivin, may provide a further growth advantage to this tumor. A deranged DNA damage response as a result of the aberration of ataxia telangiectasia-related (ATR) kinases can lead to significant genomic instability and may contribute to chemoresistance of ENKTL. Recently,  evasion has emerged as a critical pathway for survival in ENKTL and may be a consequence of HLA dysregulation or STAT3-driven upregulation of programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Immunotherapy via inhibition of programmed  death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1  signaling holds great promise as a novel therapeutic option. In this review, we present an overview of the key molecular and pathogenic pathways in ENKTL, organized using the framework of the "hallmarks of cancer" as described by Hanahan and Weinberg, with a focus on those with the greatest translational potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830521>Immunotherapy: Current Status and Future Perspectives.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an increasing incidence and dismal prognosis, with few systemic treatments approved, including several small molecule  kinase inhibitors.

Beside radiotherapy and surgery, the current standard of care in systemic treatment involves the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). There are also other modalities being developed under the category of immunotherapy, but they are overshadowed by the recent advancements of   inhibitors.This systematic review covers recent advancements in 'patient-specific' treatment modalities, which can be only administered to a given patient.Currently, patient-specific treatment modalities in HNC mainly consist of active immunotherapy using adoptive  therapies and/or gene engineered vectors. Despite the slow pace of development, the interest continues in these treatment modalities. The future of HNC treatment is expected to be guided by biomarkers and personalized approaches with tailored combinations of local treatments (radiotherapy, surgery), systemic agents and  system modulation.

This new standard first-line approach opens a gap in standard second-line treatment, and older combinations may again become standard of care after progression during treatment with an ICI. The characterization of predictive biomarkers, patient selection, the definition of strategies with ICI combinations upon progression during treatment with ICIs, as well as prospective evaluation of the efficacy of ICIs in subpopulations (such as patients with poor performance status or brain metastases) represent upcoming challenges in advanced thoracic malignancies. In oncogene-addicted NSCLC three major steps were taken during 2018: next-generation  kinase inhibitors have overtaken more established agents as the new standard of care in EGFR and ALK receptor  kinase gene (ALK)-positive tumors. Mechanisms of acquired resistance have been reported among patients treated with next-generation EGFR  kinase inhibitors, reflecting the diversity of the landscape. One major step forward was the approval of personalized treatment in very uncommon genomic alterations, mainly fusions. This raises a new question about the challenge of implementation of next-generation sequencing in daily clinical practice to detect new and uncommon genomic alterations and to capture the heterogeneity of the mechanisms of acquired resistance during treatment, as well as the need to extend research into new therapeutic strategies to overcome them.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Here, we showed that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) dramatically upregulated TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK and their ligands [monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSC)>20-fold, polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSC)>15-fold] in tumor-bearing mice. MDSCs from tumor-bearing  , and  mice exhibited diminished suppressive enzymatic capabilities, displayed deficits in T- suppression, and migrated poorly to tumor-draining lymph nodes. In coimplantation experiments using TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK MDSCs, we showed the absence of these RTKs reversed the protumorigenic properties of MDSCs  Consistent with these findings,  pharmacologic TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK inhibition diminished MDSC suppressive capability, slowed tumor growth, increased CD8 T- infiltration, and augmented anti-PD-1  inhibitor immunotherapy. Mechanistically, MERTK regulated MDSC suppression and differentiation in part through regulation of STAT3 serine phosphorylation and nuclear localization. Analysis of metastatic melanoma patients demonstrated an enrichment of circulating MERTK and TYRO3 M-MDSCs, PMN-MDSCs, and early-stage MDSCs (e-MDSC) relative to these MDSC populations in healthy controls.

Combination treatments comprising angiogenesis inhibitors plus ICIs are promising options for improving clinical benefits in HCC patients, and clinical trials are ongoing. Here, we investigated the antitumor and immunomodulatory activities of lenvatinib (a multiple receptor  kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, KIT and RET) and the combined antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus anti-programmed  death 1 (PD-1) antibody in the Hepa1-6 mouse HCC syngeneic model. We found that the antitumor activities of lenvatinib and sorafenib were not different in immunodeficient mice, but lenvatinib showed more potent antitumor activity than sorafenib in immunocompetent mice. The antitumor activity of lenvatinib was greater in immunocompetent mice than in immunodeficient mice and was attenuated by CD8 T  depletion. Treatment with lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in more tumor regression and a higher response rate compared with either treatment alone in immunocompetent mice. Single- RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that treatment with lenvatinib with or without anti-PD-1 antibody decreased the proportion of monocytes and macrophages population and increased that of CD8 T  populations. These data suggest that lenvatinib has immunomodulatory activity that contributes to the antitumor activity of lenvatinib and enhances the antitumor activity in combination treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody. Combination treatment of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibody therefore warrants further investigation against advanced HCC.© 2018 The Authors.

More recently, combination strategies involving contemporary immunotherapy have emerged as key opportunities to further shift the treatment landscape.To review the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of standard therapeutic options in mccRCC as well as combination immunotherapy options on the horizon.PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to February 2018 and according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. A narrative review of studies was performed.Twenty-six studies were included regarding therapies for metastatic RCC including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-directed therapy (n=9), mTOR inhibitors (n=2), cytokines (n=3), vaccines (n=3), and   inhibitors (ICIs, n=9). VEGF  kinase inhibitor monotherapy had been the standard therapy, and its use is evolving in the front-line setting with ICIs; cabozantinib provides superior progression-free survival versus sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients, by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium criteria. The mTOR therapy is largely inferior to VEGF-directed therapy, although it has a role in combination strategies. Cytokines have largely been replaced in current practice throughout most regions, and vaccines have failed to show improved survival in phase III studies to date. ICIs have now become standard care in untreated patients with intermediate and poor risks, given overall survival benefit seen with CheckMate-214 study; survival data from IMmotion 151 are not yet mature. Several ongoing phase III combination trials, with promising early-phase data, are due to be read out.The treatment landscape for mccRCC has evolved since the introduction of VEGF inhibitors. Combination therapies involving  inhibitors could be the next standard of care.With the expanding role of   inhibitors in metastatic renal  carcinoma, the treatment paradigm has shifted to include combination therapy in the untreated setting.

Patients with NSCLC harboring driver mutations who received ICIs (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) were reviewed in Hirosaki University and Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. There were 139 patients who received molecular targeted drugs, including 24 patients treated with ICIs. Patient characteristics were as follows: Male/female, 5/19; median age 68 (range 39-82); smoking/non-smoking, 6/18; PS 0-1/2, 20/4; driver mutation status, EGFR/ALK/RET/ROS1: 21/1/1/1. The overall response rate was 16.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.0-37.1%] and the disease control rate was 33.4% (95% CI, 18.9-55.1%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 62 days (95% CI 52-81 days). In the patients who had been treated by the preceding  kinase inhibitor (TKI) for >1 year, the PFS time was 110 days. On the other hand, in the patients who had received a TKI for less than a year, the PFS time was 56 days, which was significantly shorter (P=0.012). To conclude, some of the patients with NSCLC harboring driver mutation could benefit from ICIs, and the duration of previous TKI treatment may be associated with the efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690953>[New Systemic Therapies for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma].</a></h1><p>Since the approval of sorafenib for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 2007, many drugs have failed in the first and second-line setting. Fortunately, during the recent 2 years, between 2017 and 2018, four drugs (regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab) were found to be effective and tolerable for patients with HCC as the first- or second-line therapy. Regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has a similar structure to sorafenib, and was shown to improve the survival of patients who progressed after sorafenib treatment compared to the placebo control. According to the phase III trial of regorafenib, it became the first approved systemic therapy for patients with progression after sorafenib. Lenvatinib is also a  kinase inhibitor (TKI), and in a phase III trial comparing sorafenib and lenvatinib, the primary end-point of non-inferior survival was met. Based on the trial results, lenvatinb has become another systemic therapy for treatment-na?ve patients with advanced HCC. Cabozantinib is a dual inhibitor of Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition factor/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor2, and was shown to prolong the overall survival in patients who progressed after sorafenib compared to the placebo. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody to inhibit a single target of VEGFR2. First, this drug failed to improve the survival of patients who progressed after sorafenib failure. On the other hand, it was effective in patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL, In a subsequent clinical trial that enrolled only patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL, ramucirumab was also found to improve the overall survival compared to placebo. Thus, ramucirumab became the first biomarker-driven systemic treatment.

The impact of TMB on outcomes with targeted therapies has not been explored.We identified all patients with metastatic  exon19del or L858R-mutant lung cancers treated with first/second-generation EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with pretreatment next-generation sequencing data (MSK-IMPACT assay). The effect of TMB on time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses.  wild-type lung adenocarcinoma samples were used for comparison.Among 153 patients with -mutant lung cancer, TMB was lower compared with EGFR wild-type ( = 1,849; median 3.77 vs. 6.12 mutations/Mb;  < 0.0001) with a broad range (0.82-17.9 mutations/Mb). Patients with -mutant lung cancer whose tumors had TMB in the high tertile had shorter TTD (HR, 0.46;  = 0.0008) and OS (HR, 0.40;  = 0.006) compared with patients with low/intermediate TMB. Evaluating by median TMB, there was significantly shorter TTD and OS for patients with higher TMB (TTD,  = 0.006; OS,  = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, TTD and OS remained significantly longer in the low/intermediate tertile compared with high TMB (HR = 0.57,  = 0.01; HR = 0.50,  = 0.02, respectively). In paired pretreatment and postprogression samples, TMB was increased at resistance (median 3.42 vs. 6.56 mutations/Mb;  = 0.008).TMB is negatively associated with clinical outcomes in metastatic patients with -mutant lung cancer treated with EGFR-TKI.

One of the main mechanisms for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to induce T  tolerance is through secretion of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which nitrates  residues in proteins involved in T  function. However, so far very few nitrated proteins have been identified. Here, using a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and a syngeneic  line model of lung cancer, we applied a nitroproteomic approach based on chemical derivation of 3-nitrotyrosine and identified that lymphocyte-specific protein  kinase (LCK), an initiating  kinase in the T  receptor signaling cascade, is nitrated at Tyr394 by MDSCs. LCK nitration inhibits T  activation, leading to reduced interleukin 2 (IL2) production and proliferation. In human T cells with defective endogenous LCK, wild type, but not nitrated LCK, rescues IL2 production. In the mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by prostate-specific deletion of , , and , CRPC is resistant to an ICB therapy composed of antiprogrammed  death 1 (PD1) and anticytotoxic-T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibodies. However, we showed that ICB elicits strong anti-CRPC efficacy when combined with an RNS neutralizing agent. Together, these data identify a previously unknown mechanism of T  inactivation by MDSC-induced protein nitration and illuminate a clinical path hypothesis for combining ICB with RNS-reducing agents in the treatment of CRPC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102038>Targeted Therapies for the Treatment of Glioblastoma in Adults.</a></h1><p>Targeted therapies are part of biomarker-driven strategies that exploit actionable molecular targets and have gained traction following survival benefits demonstrated in various systemic malignancies. In glioblastoma, where therapeutic options remain scarce and prognosis poor, targeted therapies offer an attractive treatment alternative and are actively examined in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the targeted therapies, including traditional small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies as well as immunotherapeutic approaches that are examined in clinical trials, and discuss the challenges of using them for the treatment of glioblastoma.Despite initial speculations, phase II/III trials of targeted therapies in adult patients with glioblastoma have largely failed. Recent trials have focused on improving patient stratification, drug-tissue penetration, and target and compensatory pathway inhibition to optimize treatment response. In contrast to traditional small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapies, cancer immunotherapy may target specific molecular or   target(s) to trigger  responses against glioblastoma.

However, many patients may have severe acute or late therapeutic side effects, and the survival rate in some groups (e.g., patients with MLL rearrangements, hypodiploidy, IKZF1 mutation or early precursor T  phenotype) is far behind the average. Innovative strategies in medical attendance provide better clinical outcomes for them: complete gene diagnostics, molecularly targeted anticancer treatment, immuno-oncology and   therapy. The number of genes with identified alterations in leukemic lymphoblasts is over thirty and their pathobiologic role is only partly clear. There are known patient groups where the use of specific drugs is based on gene expression profiling (e.g.,  kinase inhibitors in Philadelphia-like B- ALL). The continuous assessment of minimal residual disease became a routine due to the determination of a leukemia-associated immunophenotype by flow cytometry or a sensitive molecular marker by molecular genetics at diagnosis. Epitopes of cluster differentiation antigens on blast surface (primarily CD19, CD20 and CD22 on malignant B cells) can be attacked by monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, antitumor immunity can be strengthened utilizing either  surface markers (bispecific T  engagers, chimeric antigen receptor T  therapy) or tumor-specific  cells (  inhibitors).

To date, for aggressive PitNETs, temozolomide (TMZ) has been the most used therapeutic option, and has resulted in an improvement in the five-year survival rate in responders. However, given the fact that roughly only one third of patients showed a partial or complete radiological response on the first course of TMZ, and even fewer patients responded to a second course of TMZ, other treatment options are urgently needed. Emerging therapies consist predominantly of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (20 cases), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy (12 cases),  kinase inhibitors (10 cases), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (six cases), and more recently,   inhibitors (one case). Here, we present the available clinical cases published in the literature for each of these treatments. The therapies that currently show the most promise (based on the achievement of partial radiological response in a certain number of cases) are   inhibitors, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative locoregional therapy for patients with inoperable NSCLC. We report the role of RFA in a patient with metastasis from advanced stage NSCLC that was managed with  inhibitors. Therefore, this combination of RFA with subsequent immunotherapy can control NSCLC better than RFA or immunotherapy on their own.We report here a 61-year-old Chinese male who presented with postoperative recurrence squamous  lung cancer following the left upper lobectomy and 4 cycles of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy 6 months back.A newly occurring lesion was detected in the left lower lung. Based on computed tomography (CT) and percutaneous lung biopsy enhancement, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV nonsmall  lung cancer.The patient refused systemic chemotherapy. And there was no basis for using  kinase inhibitors. RFA was performed for 3 times at the left lower lung lesion, which was under control. Afterward, an enlargement of the lesion at left lower lung with involvement to chest wall, and new nodules in both lungs were revealed. After that, the patient received intravenous PD-L1   inhibitors Atezolizumab. Follow-up restaging CT scan showed disease progression in both lungs. However, by treated 4 months later, partial response was observed at the left lower lung lesion, and stable response was observed at the right upper lung lesion.The patient displayed a remarkable response to Atezolizumab in one lesion at left lower lung, where he received previous locoregional therapy of RFA. As a comparison, another lesion at right upper lung without RFA history showed little response to Atezolizumab.Our case suggests a significantly synergistic effect of sequential association of RFA and subsequent immunotherapy. Integrating locoregional therapy such as RFA into anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent regimens may help to release tumor-associated antigen and mediate T-  enhancement, and on the long run improve the ongoing efficacy of  inhibitors. The combination of locoregional therapy and immunotherapy represents a potential new treatment option in the management of metastatic NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462894> death-related molecules and biomarkers for renal  carcinoma targeted therapy.</a></h1><p>Renal  carcinoma (RCC) is not sensitive to conventional radio- and chemotherapies and is at least partially resistant to impairments in  death-related signaling pathways. The hallmarks of RCC formation include diverse signaling pathways, such as maintenance of proliferation,  death resistance, angiogenesis induction,  destruction avoidance, and DNA repair. RCC diagnosed during the early stage has the possibility of cure with surgery. For metastatic RCC (mRCC), molecular targeted therapy, especially antiangiogenic therapy (e.g.,  kinase inhibitors, TKIs, such as sunitinib), is one of the main partially effective therapeutics. Various forms of  death that may be associated with the resistance to targeted therapy because of the crosstalk between targeted therapy and  death resistance pathways were originally defined and differentiated into apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and autophagic  death based on cellular morphology. Particularly, as a new form of  death, T -induced  death by   inhibitors expands the treatment options beyond the current targeted therapy. Here, we provide an overview of  death-related molecules and biomarkers for the progression, prognosis and treatment of mRCC by targeted therapy, with a focus on apoptosis and T -induced  death, as well as other forms of  death.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048621>A  penetrating peptide from SOCS-1 prevents ocular damage in experimental autoimmune uveitis.</a></h1><p>We describe an immunosuppressive peptide corresponding to the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) of the intracellular  protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) that binds to the phospho- containing regions of the  kinases JAK2 and TYK2 and the adaptor protein MAL, and thereby inhibits signaling downstream from these signaling mediators. The peptide, SOCS1-KIR, is thus capable of downregulating overactive JAK/STAT or NF-kB signaling in somatic cells, including those in many compartments of the eye. Attachment of poly-arginine to this peptide (R9-SOCS1-KIR) allows it to penetrate the plasma membrane in aqueous media. R9-SOCS1-KIR was tested in ARPE-19 cells and was found to attenuate mediators of inflammation by blocking the inflammatory effects of IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-17A. R9-SOCS1-KIR and also protected against TNFα or IL-17A mediated damage to the barrier properties of ARPE-19 cells, as evidenced by immunostaining with the tight junction protein, zona occludin 1 (ZO-1), and measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was generated in B10. RIII mice using a peptide of interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP) as immunogen. Topical administration of R9-SOCS1-KIR, 2 days before (prophylactic), or 7 days after immunization (therapeutic) protected ocular structure and function as seen by fundoscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electroretinography (ERG). The ability R9-SOCS1-KIR to suppress ocular inflammation and preserve barrier properties of retinal pigment epithelium makes it a potential candidate for treatment of autoimmune uveitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

T-lymphocyte co-inhibitory pathways influence intensity, inflammation and duration of antitumor immunity. However, tumors and their immunosuppressive microenvironments exploit them to evade  destruction. Recent PD-1  inhibitors yielded unprecedented efficacies and durable responses across advanced-stage melanoma, showcasing potential to replace conventional radiotherapy regimens. Neverthless, many clinical problems remain in terms of efficacy, patient-to-patient variability, and undesirable outcomes and side effects. In this review, we evaluate recent advances in the immuno-oncology field and discuss ways forward. First, we give an overview of current immunotherapy modalities, involving mainy single agents, including inhibitor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting T-  of PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, neoantigen recognition alone cannot eliminate tumors effectively  given their inherent complex micro-environment, heterogeneous nature and stemness. Then, based mainly upon CTLA-4 and PD-1  inhibitors as a "backbone," we cover a range of emerging ("second-generation") therapies incorporating other immunotherapies or non- based strategies in synergistic combination. These include targeted therapies such as  kinase inhibitors, co-stimulatory mAbs, bifunctional agents, epigenetic modulators (such as inhibitors of histone deacetylases or DNA methyltransferase), vaccines, adoptive-T- therapy, nanoparticles, oncolytic viruses, and even synthetic "gene circuits." A number of novel immunotherapy co-targets in pre-clinical development are also introduced. The latter include metabolic components, exosomes and ion channels. We discuss in some detail of the personalization of immunotherapy essential for ultimate maximization of clinical outcomes. Finally, we outline possible future technical and conceptual developments including realistic  and  models and inputs from physics, engineering, and artificial intelligence. We conclude that the breadth and quality of immunotherapeutic approaches and the types of cancers that can be treated will increase significantly in the foreseeable future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031746>Potent Fc Receptor Signaling by IgA Leads to Superior Killing of Cancer Cells by Neutrophils Compared to IgG.</a></h1><p>Antibody therapy of cancer is increasingly used in the clinic and has improved patient's life expectancy. Except for   inhibition, the mode of action of many antibodies is to recognize overexpressed or specific tumor antigens and initiate either direct F(ab')-mediated tumor  killing, or Fc-mediated effects such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent -mediated cytotoxicity/phagocytosis (ADCC/P) after binding to activating Fc receptors. All antibodies used in the clinic are of the IgG isotype. The IgA isotype can, however, also elicit powerful anti-tumor responses through engagement of the activating Fc receptor for monomeric IgA (FcαRI). In addition to monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils as FcαRI expressing  cells, neutrophils are especially vigorous in eliminating IgA opsonized tumor cells. However, with IgG as single agent it appears almost impossible to activate neutrophils efficiently, as we have visualized by live  imaging of tumor  killing. In this study, we investigated Fc receptor expression, binding and signaling to clarify why triggering of neutrophils by IgA is more efficient than by IgG. FcαRI expression on neutrophils is ~2 times and ~20 times lower than that of Fcγ receptors FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb, but still, binding of neutrophils to IgA- or IgG-coated surfaces was similar. In addition, our data suggest that IgA-mediated binding of neutrophils is more stable compared to IgG. IgA engagement of neutrophils elicited stronger Fc receptor signaling than IgG as indicated by measuring the p-ERK signaling molecule. We propose that the higher stoichiometry of IgA to the FcαR/FcRγ-chain complex, activating four ITAMs (Immunoreceptor -based Activating Motifs) compared to a single ITAM for FcγRIIa, combined with a possible decoy role of the highly expressed FcγRIIIb, explains why IgA is much better than IgG at triggering tumor  killing by neutrophils. We anticipate that harnessing the vast population of neutrophils by the use of IgA monoclonal antibodies can be a valuable addition to the growing arsenal of antibody-based therapeutics for cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526368>Role of the dynamic tumor microenvironment in controversies regarding   inhibitors for the treatment of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations.</a></h1><p>Immunotherapy has been incorporated into the first- and second-line treatment strategies for non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC), profoundly ushering in a new treatment landscape. However, both adaptive signaling and oncogenic (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven) signaling may induce PD-L1 upregulation in NSCLC. Nevertheless, the superiority of   inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC is only moderate. ICIs appear to be well tolerated, but clinical activity for some advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients has only been observed in a small proportion of trials. Hence, there are still several open questions about PD-L1 axis inhibitors in patients with NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations, such as the effect of EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or EGFR mutations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Finding the answers to these questions requires ongoing trials and preclinical studies to identify the mechanisms explaining this possible increased susceptibility and to identify prognostic molecular and clinical markers that may predict benefits with PD-1 axis inhibition in this specific NSCLC subpopulation. The presence of multiple mechanisms, including dynamic  TME profiles, changes in PD-L1 expression and low tumor mutational burdens, may explain the conflicting data regarding the correlation between PD-L1 axis inhibitors and EGFR mutation status. We conducted a review of this currently controversial topic in an attempt to aid in the decision-making process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392436>Afatinib and Erlotinib in the treatment of squamous- lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Squamous- carcinoma (SCC) of the lung represents around 20% of non-small  lung cancers. Although activating mutations of EGFR are rare in this subtype, its overexpression occurs in more than half the cases. Consequently, many epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents have been investigated in patients with SCC.This review summarizes the potential roles of erlotinib and afatinib in SCC of the lung. The authors explore the rationale of targeting EGFR in SCC and the pharmacological properties of erlotinib and afatinib. Subsequently, they describe the most relevant clinical data involving each agent with regard to their safety profile and antineoplastic activity. Particular focus is given to the LUX-Lung 8 trial, which compared erlotinib and afatinib as a second-line treatment in a population of patients affected by advanced SCC of the lung.Despite being overcome by new therapeutic strategies - in particular   inhibitors - afatinib and erlotinib still represent potential treatment options down the line in lung SCC because they have a more manageable toxicity profile compared to chemotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669895>Developments in the use of  kinase inhibitors in the treatment of renal  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Renal  carcinoma (RCC) is among the most commonly diagnosed solid malignancies, but until recently there were few systemic treatment options for advanced disease. Since 2005, the treatment landscape has been transformed by the development of several novel systemic therapies. In particular,  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway have been instrumental in improving outcomes in patients with metastatic disease. Areas covered: The armamentarium of TKIs available for the treatment of RCC has expanded in recent years. The most active area of research at this time is the development of treatment regimens combining newer-generation TKIs and   inhibitors. Emerging data point to a role for combination therapy in the frontline management of advanced RCC. Other ongoing areas of research include the use of TKIs in the adjuvant setting and the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy within a changing treatment landscape. Expert opinion: Although TKIs and   inhibitors have incrementally improved outcomes for patients with advanced RCC, long-term survival remains poor. The development of regimens combining these agents represents the next step in the evolution of the field. For the clinician, this will offer exciting possibilities and novel challenges.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638402>Acalabrutinib for adults with mantle  lymphoma.</a></h1><p>Although advances in mantle  lymphoma (MCL) therapy have improved overall survival (OS), managing relapsed/refractory (R/R) cases remains a great challenge. Bruton  kinase (BTK) inhibitors have broadened therapeutic options in MCL and became the backbone of second-line strategies. Areas covered: Ibrutinib, the first-in-class BTK inhibitor registered for MCL therapy, is efficient, with clear benefits of its use. However, ibrutinib-related adverse events due to off-target inhibition of other kinases led to the development of more selective molecules with comparable efficacy and better safety profiles. Expert commentary: Acalabrutinib, a new BTK inhibitor, currently being evaluated in numerous clinical studies is approved by FDA in relapsing/refractory MCL. Its role will evolve over the next few years. Efficacy and good tolerability of acalabrutinib gives even greater opportunity for potential upfront use and new therapeutic combinations, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates,   inhibitors, bcl-2 (B- lymphoma-2) or IP3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170190>Therapeutic implication of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) targeting in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment by competitive and non-competitive inhibitors.</a></h1><p>The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) is a  kinase receptor for VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor (PlGF) ligands that is expressed in endothelial, myelomonocytic and tumor cells. VEGF-B and PlGF exclusively bind to VEGFR-1, whereas VEGF-A also binds to VEGFR-2. At variance with VEGFR-2, VEGFR-1 does not play a relevant role in physiological angiogenesis in the adult, while it is important in tumor-associated angiogenesis. VEGFR-1 and PlGF are expressed in a variety of tumors, promote invasiveness and contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF-A therapy. The currently approved antiangiogenic therapies for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors hamper VEGF-A signaling mediated by both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1 [i.e., the monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-VEGF-A bevacizumab, the chimeric molecule aflibercept and several small molecule  kinase inhibitors] or exclusively by VEGFR-2 (i.e., the mAb anti-VEGFR-2 ramucirumab). However, molecules that interfere with VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling determine severe adverse effects due to inhibition of physiological angiogenesis and their efficacy is hampered by tumor infiltration of protumoral myeloid cells. Blockade of VEGFR-1 may exert anti-tumor activity by multiple mechanisms: a) inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis; b) reduction of myeloid progenitor mobilization and tumor infiltration by VEGFR-1 expressing M2 macrophages, which contribute to tumor progression and spreading; c) inhibition of invasiveness, vasculogenic mimicry and survival of VEGFR-1 positive tumor cells. As a consequence of these properties, molecules targeting VEGFR-1 are expected to produce less adverse effects and to counteract resistance towards anti-VEGF-A therapies. More interestingly, selective VEGFR-1 inhibition might enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy with   inhibitors. In this review, we will examine the experimental evidence available so far that supports targeting VEGFR-1 signal transduction pathway for cancer treatment by competitive inhibitors that prevent growth factor interaction with the receptor and non-competitive inhibitors that hamper receptor activation without affecting ligand binding.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody, a type of   inhibitor, was approved for use against metastatic renal  carcinoma. In the present report, two cases of TKI-refractory metastatic renal  carcinoma which regained sensitivity to TKI after immunotherapy with nivolumab were described. In one case, a third challenge with axitinib after nivolumab treatment resulted in tumor shrinkage, although the second challenge with axitinib immediately before nivolumab treatment had no effect. In another case, a second challenge with pazopanib after nivolumab slightly reduced lung metastasis, which was refractory to pazopanib before nivolumab treatment. These cases suggest that nivolumab can influence the response to subsequent TKI treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30069629>Ibrutinib.</a></h1><p>Abnormal B- receptor (BCR) signalling is a key mechanism of disease progression in B- malignancy. Bruton's  kinase (BTK) has a pivotal role in BCR signalling. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is a small molecule which serves as a covalent irreversible inhibitor of BTK. It is characterized by high selectivity for BTK and high potency. Ibrutinib is currently approved by the FDA and EMA for use in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in any line of treatment, for treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia in patients who have received previous treatments or are not suitable to receive immunochemotherapy as well as for second line treatment of mantle  lymphoma and for patients with marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. In addition, there is emerging clinical data on its efficacy in ABC subtype diffuse large B- lymphoma, multiple myeloma and primary central nervous system lymphoma. Ibrutinib has opened new options for treatment of those patients that have relapsed or have been refractory to more classical modes of treatment. Moreover, Ibrutinib has been shown to be effective in patients that have been known to have little sensitivity to classical immunochemotherapy. Having a favourable risk profile, the substance is, unlike conventional immunochemotherapy, also suitable for the less physical fit patients. Cases of primary and secondary resistance to Ibrutinib have emerged and there is an ongoing effort to identify their mechanism and develop strategies to overcome them. Beyond its direct effects on survival and apoptosis of malignant B-cells, there is increasing evidence that Ibrutinib is able to modulate the tumour microenvironment to overcome mechanisms of  evasion. This has sparked interest in use of the substance beyond lymphoid malignancy. This chapter discusses structure, mechanism of action and toxicities of Ibrutinib and also presents important preclinical and clinical data as well as mechanisms of Ibrutinib resistance. Combination strategies with immunotherapeutic strategies such as   blockade and CAR T- therapy may be synergistic and are currently under investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435659>  inhibitor-based combinations: is dose escalation mandatory for phase 1 trials?</a></h1><p>Numerous phase 1 trials testing  -inhibitors (CPI)-based combinations are currently being conducted to improve response rates observed with single agents. However, methodology varies across studies, especially regarding the use of dose escalation.A literature search was conducted in Pubmed and major oncology meetings libraries for phase 1 trials reported between 2011 and 2018, containing at least one CPI (CLTA-4 blocking antibody or a PD(L)1 blocking antibody) plus at least one second agent (e.g.  kinase inhibitor, chemotherapy). Dose escalation schemes, target doses and recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) were captured in our database for each study. Combination RP2D (combo-RP2D) was compared to target dose.We identified 113 different studies comprising a total of 120 individual cohorts. The backbone was an anti-CTLA-4 in 40 cohorts and an anti-PD(L)1 in 80 cohorts. Dose escalation was used for the CPI in 29 (24%) cohorts (11% for anti-PD(L)1 and 50% for anti CTLA-4) and for the second agent in 55 cohorts (46%). For 31 second agents (26%), the combo-RP2D was significantly lower than the expected target dose. Failure to reach the target dose was explained by the type of second agent form (e.g. small molecules versus monoclonal antibodies) (p < 0.001) and the choice of trial design for the second agent by investigators.Design of studies investigating new CPI-based combinations must consider the type of second agent. Dose escalation is required for combinations with small molecules but is unnecessary with vaccine/virus/dendritic therapies and monoclonal antibodies.© The Author 2019.

However, the clinical activity of nivolumab in non-clear  RCC (nccRCC) is unknown, as these patients were excluded from the trials.We reviewed the records of patients who received nivolumab for nccRCC and ccRCC with >20% rhabdoid with the primary endpoint to assess the objective response rate (ORR). We assessed radiographic response using RECIST, v1.1. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We also reviewed the literature to identify studies reporting on the clinical activity of   inhibitors in nccRCC, and performed a meta-analysis of proportions for ORR and disease control rate (DCR).Twelve patients (30%) had papillary histology, 11 (27.5%) had unclassified, 8 (20%) had ccRCC with rhabdoid component, 5 (12.5%) had chromophobe, 3 (7.5%) had translocation, and 1 (2.5%) had mucinous tubular and spindle  carcinoma. Overall, seven patients (21.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7%-37.9%) had an objective response, including three patients (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9%-23.7%) who achieved a complete remission. At a median follow-up of 24.5 monoths (95% CI, 17.7-32.6), median PFS was 4.9 monoths (95% CI, 3.53-10.27) and median OS was 21.7 monoths (95% CI, 7.83 mo to not reached). There were no treatment-related deaths. We also identified two retrospective studies reporting best ORR in patients with nccRCC receiving PD-1/PD-L1  blockade.

Although a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program are critical, molecular mechanisms underlying the Axl-driven cancer progression have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to identify molecules up-regulated by Axl kinase in lung adenocarcinomas. Through the global gene expression analysis and the functional annotation clustering, we found that AXL expression positively correlated with mRNA expressions of   molecules and chemokine receptors in non-small- lung cancers. Validation cohorts including our biobank confirmed that the AXL expression significantly correlated with expression of genes encoding programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1) and CXC chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) in lung adenocarcinoma, especially in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive adenocarcinoma. Pharmacological inhibition of Axl kinase activity decreased mRNA expressions of PD-L1 and CXCR6 in EGFR mutation-positive  lines. Our data indicates the novel role of Axl kinase as a driver of   molecules and chemokine signalling pathways in the progression of lung adenocarcinomas. This study also highlights the necessity of clinical trials in order to test the efficacy of Axl kinase inhibition in the Axl-highly expressing subset of lung adenocarcinomas. .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451693>Liquid biopsy-based single- metabolic phenotyping of lung cancer patients for informative diagnostics.</a></h1><p>Accurate prediction of chemo- or targeted therapy responses for patients with similar driver oncogenes through a simple and least-invasive assay represents an unmet need in the clinical diagnosis of non-small  lung cancer. Using a single- on-chip metabolic cytometry and fluorescent metabolic probes, we show metabolic phenotyping on the rare disseminated tumor cells in pleural effusions across a panel of 32 lung adenocarcinoma patients. Our results reveal extensive metabolic heterogeneity of tumor cells that differentially engage in glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation. The  number ratio of the two metabolic phenotypes is found to be predictive for patient therapy response, physiological performance, and survival. Transcriptome analysis reveals that the glycolytic phenotype is associated with mesenchymal-like  state with elevated expression of the resistant-leading receptor  kinase AXL and   ligands.

Therapeutic modalities have usually been limited, but clinical trials with new drugs are now being implemented. The aims of this study were to analyse the clinical presentation, therapeutic modalities and independent prognostic factors for survival. We also reviewed the most recent literature on novel ATC therapies. We performed a retrospective analysis of 79 patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2018. Variables with impact on survival were identified using the Cox proportional-hazard regression model. At presentation, 6.3% had thyroid-confined disease, 30.4% evidenced extrathyroidal extension and 60.8% were already metastatic. Surgery was feasible in 41.8% and radiotherapy was applied to 35.4%, with those receiving >45 Gy having longer estimated survival ( = 0.020). Chemotherapy, either conventional or with  kinase inhibitors, was performed in 17.7% and 7.6%, respectively. Multimodality therapy with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy/ kinase inhibitors (TKI) had the greatest impact on disease specific survival (DSS), providing a risk reduction of death of 96.9% (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.031, 0.005-0.210,  < 0.001).

The generation of drug-induced aneuploid/polyploid (DIAP) cells is a common effect of anti-DLBCL therapies (e.g. vincristine, doxorubicin). DIAP cells are thought to be responsible for treatment resistance, as they are capable of re-entering the   during off-therapy periods. Previously we have shown that combination of alisertib plus ibrutinib plus rituximab can partially abrogate DIAP cells and induce  death. Here, we provide evidence that DIAP cells can re-enter the   and escape  death during anti-DLBCL treatment. We also discuss MYC/BCL2 mediated molecular mechanism that underlie treatment resistance. We isolated aneuploid/polyploid populations of DH/DE-DLBCL cells after treatment with the aurora kinase (AK) inhibitor alisertib. Time-lapse microscopy of single polyploid cells revealed that following drug removal, a subset of these DIAP cells divide and proliferate by reductive  divisions, including multipolar mitosis, meiosis-like nuclear fission and budding. Genomic, proteomic, and kinomic profiling demonstrated that alisertib-induced aneuploid/polyploid cells up-regulate DNA damage, DNA replication and  evasion pathways. In addition, we identified amplified receptor  kinase and T- receptor signaling, as well as MYC-mediated dysregulation of the spindle assembly  . We infer that these factors contribute to treatment resistance of DIAP cells. These findings provide opportunities to develop novel DH/DE-DLBCL therapies, specifically targeting DIAP cells.● MYC mediated upregulation of TPX2, KPNA2 and RanGAP1 dysregulate the spindle assembly  in drug-induced polyploid cells.● Drug-induced polyploid cells re-enter the   via multipolar mitosis, fission or budding, a mechanism of disease relapse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866992>Recent advances on anti-angiogenesis receptor  kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy.</a></h1><p>Angiogenesis has always been the topic of major scientific interest in the field of malignant tumors. Nowadays, targeting angiogenesis has achieved success in various carcinomas by several mechanisms, including the use of anti-angiogenic small molecule receptor  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The development of TKIs targeting pro-angiogenic receptors, mainly vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family, have significantly improved the outcome of certain types of cancers, like renal  carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. However, the general response rate is not very satisfactory. The particular toxicity profile and resistance to anti-angiogenic targeted agents are unavoidable, and no specific marker is available to screen responsive patients to TKIs for precision therapy. To date, about 11 anti-angiogenic TKIs with different binding capacities to angiogenic receptor  kinase have been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers. This review presents all approved anti-angiogenic small molecule receptor TKIs so far with an emphasis on their indications and clinical efficacy. We also discuss the combination between TKIs and   blockade inhibitors based on the most recent exciting outcome in immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819439>Adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix: Pathologic features, treatment options, clinical outcome and prognostic variables.</a></h1><p>Adenocarcinoma accounts for 10-25% of all cervical cancers, and its relative and absolute rate has raised over the past decades. Most, but not all the authors, reported that adenocarcinoma has a greater propensity to lymph node, ovarian and distant metastases and a worse prognosis compared with squamous  carcinoma. However, whether histologic type is an independent prognostic factor is still a debated issue. Moreover, adenocarcinoma is a very heterogenous disease, including different histological subtypes. Whereas radical hysterectomy and definitive radiotherapy achieve the same clinical outcome in early stage squamous  carcinoma, surgery seems to obtain better survival compared with definitive radiotherapy in early stage adenocarcinoma. Chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer regardless of histologic type, although several retrospective studies showed that patients with adenocarcinoma were more likely to die than those with squamous  carcinoma both before and after concurrent chemoradiation era. The prognostic relevance of biological variables, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p53, cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2],  surface -kinases and programmed death-ligand [PD-L1], is still under investigation. Palliative chemotherapy is the only treatment option for persistent or recurrent cervical adenocarcinoma not amenable with surgery and radiotherapy. The use of   inhibitors as well as a therapeutic strategy targeting  surface  kinases should be adequately explored in this clinical setting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The main concept of this strategy is to cross-link tumor cells and T cells by simultaneously binding to  surface tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and the CD3ƹ chain. However,   programmed  death ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells or other myeloid cells upreglulated remarkablely after the treatment of CD3-binding BsAbs, leads to the generation of suppressed microenvironment for  evasion and tumor progression. Although this resistance could be partially reversed by anti-PD-L1 treatment, targeting two pathways through one antibody-based molecule may provide a strategic advantage over the combination of BsAbs and   inhibitors. Methods We developed two novel BsAbs PD-1/c-Met DVD-Ig and IgG-scFv both targeting PD-1 to restore the  effector function of T cells and engaging them to tumor cells via binding to cellular-mesenchymal to epithelial transition factor (c-Met). Binding activities, T  activation and proliferation were analyzed by flow cytometry.  Cytotoxicity and cytokine release were measured using LDH release assay and ELISA, respectively. Anti-tumor response in vivo was evaluated by generate xenograft models in NOD-SCID mice. Results These bispecific antibodies exhibited effective antitumor activity against high- and low- c-Met-expressing gastric cancer  lines in vitro and mediated strong tumor growth inhibition in human gastric cancer xenograft models. Conclusion The engagement of the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to c-Met-overexpressing cancer cells is a promising strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer and potentially other malignancies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805831>The Changing Landscape of Systemic Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: New Targeted Agents and Immunotherapies.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide with a rising incidence in the Western world. HCCs are characterized by high resistance to systemic therapies induced by phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. For almost 10 years, the  kinase inhibitor sorafenib was the only approved treatment for advanced HCCs in patients with preserved liver function, and until 2016, no new compounds tested in large phase III studies have led to a survival benefit. The  kinase inhibitor regorafenib, a fluorinated sorafenib analog, was the first substance that showed a significant improvement in overall survival after failure of sorafenib treatment, which subsequently led to its regulatory approval in a second-line setting in 2017. In addition, the non-inferiority of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib opened another therapeutic first-line option in the same year. Furthermore, several other compounds showed promising results in recent phase III studies, including ramucirumab in patients with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels as well as cabozantinib in second- and third-line settings. In addition, promising early reports of the   inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab, with objective response rates of 15-20%, paved the way for immuno-oncological interventions for HCC and these will probably gain increasing attention as mono- and combination therapies. In summary, following the approval of sorafenib in 2007 and almost 10 years of therapeutic stagnation, results from recent clinical trials in first- and further-line settings for the first time demonstrated efficacy of several active compounds in advanced HCCs. Thus, a sequential approach should now be implemented in HCC treatment and will improve the survival of HCC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789418>Juxtacrine Signaling Inhibits Antitumor Immunity by Upregulating PD-L1 Expression.</a></h1><p>Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a well-known   protein that helps cancer cells evade  response. Anti-PD-L1  therapy has been approved for the treatment of several advanced human cancers. Therefore, further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 is critical to improve PD-L1-targeting immunotherapy. Recent studies indicated that contact-dependent pathways may regulate anticancer immunity, highlighting the importance of  contact-induced signaling in cancer immunity. Here, we show that tumor  contact upregulates PD-L1 expression and reduces T--mediated  killing through the membrane receptor  kinase ephrin receptor A10 (EphA10), which is not expressed in normal tissues except testis and is known to mediate  contact-dependent juxtacrine signaling. Knockout of EphA10 in tumor cells increased T--mediated antitumor immunity in syngeneic mouse models. EphA10 expression also correlated positively with PD-L1 in human breast tumor tissues. Together, our data reveal that in addition to paracrine/autocrine signaling,  contact-mediated juxtacrine signaling also promotes PD-L1 expression, implying that tumor cells may escape  surveillance via this mechanism and that targeting EphA10 to boost antitumor immunity may be a new   blockade strategy for female patients with breast cancer. Regulation of PD-L1 expression by  contact-mediated signaling promotes  escape in breast cancer and may lead to the development of an immunotherapy with less adverse effects in female patients. .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29741506>Recent advances in the cellular and molecular understanding of myelodysplastic syndromes: implications for new therapeutic approaches.</a></h1><p>It has been more than 10 years since any new disease-modifying therapies have received regulatory approval for indications related to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Advances in our collective biological understanding of MDS in the last decade, however, have made it possible to hope that effective therapeutics can be designed to improve MDS-associated cytopenias and patients' quality of life, and perhaps even delay clonal progression and extend survival. Classes of MDS-associated mutations and disordered biological pathways targeted by developmental therapeutics include the following: aberrant messenger RNA splicing, neomorphic enzymes in the citric acid  with oncogenic activity, overactivated  and serine-threonine kinases, epigenetic and chromatin remodeling alterations, abnormal telomere dynamics, and failed protection of DNA integrity. At present, treatments for MDS are usually administered as sequential monotherapy, but there is a trend toward clinical trials of combination therapies-in which new agents are added to a DNA hypomethylating agent backbone-for both upfront treatment and the treatment of relapsed/refractory disease. Agents in clinical trials for subsets of MDS include luspatercept, antibodies targeting CD33, isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors, deacetylase inhibitors, venetoclax, and immunotherapies designed to overcome   inhibition. These biologically based therapeutics, as well as the encouraging precedent of 7 new approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for the treatment of acute leukemia, offer the prospect that 10 more years will not elapse before another new therapy is approved for MDS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30074493>Cardiovascular oncology: exploring the effects of targeted cancer therapies on atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Targeted cancer therapies have revolutionized the treatment of cancer in the past decade, but cardiovascular toxicity is a rising problem in cancer patients. Here we discuss the effects of targeted cancer therapies on atherosclerosis. Increasing the awareness of these adverse effects will promote the development of evidence-based preventive strategies in the emerging field of cardiovascular oncology.Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, immunomodulatory imide drugs,  kinase inhibitors and   inhibitors are successfully used as treatment for many types of solid and hematologic malignancies. However, clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that these drugs can drive atherosclerosis, thereby causing adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral arterial occlusive diseases.In this review, we discuss how on-target and off-target effects of novel cancer drugs may affect atherosclerosis and we postulate how these cardiovascular adverse events can be prevented in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111678>Anti-angiogenic therapies for gastric cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumor angiogenesis plays an important role in cancer  proliferation and metastasis. In gastric cancer, among the numerous clinical trials investigating various anti-angiogenic therapies, such as antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 monoclonal antibodies, VEGF-Trap and VEGFR  kinase inhibitors, the anti-VEGFR-2 antibody ramucirumab was shown to prolong overall survival not only as a single agent but also in combination with paclitaxel as a second-line chemotherapy. Additionally, apatinib, a selective VEGFR-2  kinase inhibitor, prolonged survival as a third-line or later treatment option in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Preliminary results of studies investigating ramucirumab plus   inhibitors in gastric cancer were encouraging, and further investigations are ongoing. In China, apatinib in combination with cytotoxic agents is being investigated for systemic chemotherapy or maintenance therapy as an earlier treatment option. The clinical activity in gastric cancer of the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib was suggested in a randomized phase II study. A global phase III trial comparing regorafenib with placebo is currently ongoing. Further studies of anti-angiogenic therapy combined with not only chemotherapy but also   inhibitors are also being pursued, providing hope for improved survival in patients with gastric cancer.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333307>Hepatocellular carcinoma: Therapeutic advances in signaling, epigenetic and  targets.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global medical burden with rising incidence due to chronic viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Treatment of advanced disease stages is still unsatisfying. Besides first and second generation  kinase inhibitors,   inhibitors have become central for the treatment of HCC. New modalities like epigenetic therapy using histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and  therapy approaches with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) are currently under investigation in clinical trials. Development of such novel drugs is closely linked to the availability and improvement of novel preclinical and animal models and the identification of predictive biomarkers.

However, the treatment landscape has been also drastically overturned with the advent of targeted therapies in oncogenic-addicted advanced NSCLC patients. Despite ICIs represent an active and new treatment option for a wide range of advanced NSCLC patients, the efficacy and the optimal place of ICI in the treatment strategy algorithm of oncogenic-addicted tumors remains still controversial, as only a minority of trials with ICI enrol oncogenic-addicted NSCLC patients previously treated with standard therapy. Therefore, there are still several open questions about ICI in oncogenic-driven NSCLC, such as the efficacy and toxicities, which need to be addressed before considering treatment with ICI as a standard approach in this population. It is in this framework, we provide a thorough overview on this currently controversial topic.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The tumor microenvironment deploys various  escape mechanisms that neutralize CD8 T -mediated tumor rejection. Therefore, we hypothesized that modulation of the tumor microenvironment can augment CD8 T  activation and enhance therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines. To accomplish this, we aimed to eliminate  suppressive cells and block their inhibitory signaling. Combination of the  kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib with a nanoparticle-based cancer vaccine (nanovaccine) resulted in the reduction of -suppressive myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Blockade of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) using anti-PD-L1 antibody was used to reduce CD8 T  exhaustion. Combination of nanovaccine+sunitinib+PD-L1 antibody treatment reduced PD-L1 M2 macrophages and MDSCs and upregulated activation of CD8 T cells in the tumor. Nanovaccine+sunitinib+PD-L1 antibody treatment also stimulated antigen-specific CD8 T  response, which led to improved therapeutic efficacy in MB49 and B16F10 murine tumor models. These results suggest that modulation of tumor microenvironment using sunitinib and PD-L1 blockade can significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy of cancer nanovaccine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29966370>The Genomics and Molecular Biology of Natural Killer/T- Lymphoma: Opportunities for Translation.</a></h1><p>Extranodal NK/T- lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL), is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. While the introduction of L-asparaginase in the treatment of this disease has significantly improved the prognosis, the outcome of patients relapsing after asparaginase-based chemotherapy, which occurs in up to 50% of patients with disseminated disease, remains dismal. There is hence an urgent need for effective targeted therapy especially in the relapsed/refractory setting. Gene expression profiling studies have provided new perspectives on the molecular biology, ontogeny and classification of ENKTL and further identified dysregulated signaling pathways such as Janus associated kinase (/Signal Transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT), Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), Aurora Kinase and NF-κB, which are under evaluation as therapeutic targets. Copy number analyses have highlighted potential tumor suppressor genes such as PR Domain Zinc Finger Protein 1 (PRDM1) and protein  phosphatase kappa (PTPRK) while next generation sequencing studies have identified recurrently mutated genes in pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways. The discovery of epigenetic dysregulation and aberrant microRNA activity has broadened our understanding of the biology of ENKTL. Importantly, immunotherapy via Programmed  Death -1 (PD-1) and Programmed  Death Ligand1 (PD-L1)  signaling inhibition is emerging as an attractive therapeutic strategy in ENKTL. Herein, we present an overview of the molecular biology and genomic landscape of ENKTL with a focus on the most promising translational opportunities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205166>Increased Hepatotoxicity Associated with Sequential   Inhibitor and Crizotinib Therapy in Patients with Non-Small  Lung Cancer.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) are standard therapies in advanced NSCLC. Although genotype-directed  kinase inhibitors represent the standard of care for subsets of oncogene-driven NSCLC, patients may receive ICIs during their disease course. The impact of sequential ICI and  kinase inhibitor therapy on the risk of hepatotoxicity has not been described.Patients with advanced ALK receptor  kinase (ALK)-driven, ROS1-driven, or MET proto-oncogene, receptor  kinase (MET)-driven NSCLC treated with crizotinib, with or without preceding ICI therapy, were identified. The cumulative incidences of crizotinib-associated grade 3 or higher increases in transaminase level (per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) were compared.We identified 453 patients who had NSCLC with an oncogenic alteration in ALK receptor  kinase gene (ALK), ROS1, or MET proto-oncogene, receptor  kinase gene (MET) and were treated with crizotinib (11 with and 442 without prior ICI therapy). Among the 11 patients treated with an ICI followed by crizotinib, five (cumulative incidence 45.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 14.9-72.2]) experienced development of a grade 3 or 4 increase in alanine transaminase level and four (cumulative incidence 36.4% [95% CI: 10.0-64.2]) experienced development of a grade 3 or 4 increase in aspartate transaminase level. In comparison, among the 442 patients who received crizotinib only, a grade 3 or 4 increase in alanine transaminase level occurred in 34 patients (cumulative incidence 8.1% [95% CI: 5.7-11.0, p < 0.0001]) and a grade 3 or 4 increase in aspartate transaminase level occurred in 14 (cumulative incidence 3.4% [95% CI: 1.9-5.5, p < 0.0001]). There were no grade 5 transaminitis events. All cases of hepatotoxicity after sequential ICI and crizotinib use were reversible and nonfatal, and no case met the Hy's law criteria.Sequential ICI and crizotinib treatment is associated with a significantly increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Careful consideration and monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be warranted in patients treated with crizotinib after ICI therapy.Copyright © 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

It also contributes to tumor development and progression through diverse mechanisms. Using human cancer  lines, including Hs746T (-mutated/amplified), H596 (-mutated), and H1993 (-amplified) cells, as well as BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells, we investigated whether MET is involved in the regulation of   pathways. In a microarray analysis, MET suppression using a MET inhibitor or siRNAs up-regulated co-stimulatory molecules, including 4-1BBL, OX40L, and CD70, and down-regulated co-inhibitory molecules, especially PD-L1, as validated by measuring total/surface protein levels in Hs746T and H1993 cells. MET activation by HGF consistently increased PD-L1 expression in H596 and BEAS-2B cells. Co-culture of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Hs746T cells suppressed interferon-γ production by the  cells, which was restored by MET inhibition or PD-L1 blockade. A significant positive correlation between MET and PD-L1 expression in lung cancer was determined in an analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and in an immunohistochemistry study. The former also showed an association of MET overexpression in a PD-L1 tumor with the decreased expressions of T- effector molecules. In summary, our results point to a role for MET overexpression/activation in the  escape of tumors by PD-L1 up-regulation. MET-targeted-therapy combined with immunotherapy may therefore be an effective treatment strategy in patients with MET-dependent cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599771>Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of nonsmall  lung cancer.</a></h1><p>The purpose of the review is to summarize the current and future role of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with nonsmall  lung cancer (NSCLC).Chemotherapy has been established in early-stage, locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC.
