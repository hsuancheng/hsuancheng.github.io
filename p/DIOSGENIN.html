In addition, microRNA microarray analysis determined which microRNAs were affected by dioscin. The mechanisms underlying the actions of dioscin against pancreatic cancer were elucidated in terms of Akt1 and other proteins related to aopoptosis.Dioscin markedly induced apoptosis and significantly suppressed the tumour growth of ASPC-1 and PANC-1 cell xenografts, in nude mice. Total of 107 microRNAs with differential changes were found, in which miR-149-3P targeted with Akt1 was markedly up-regulated by dioscin. Further studies showed that dioscin significantly down-regulated Akt1 levels, and thus induced cell apoptosis by increasing the levels of Bax, Apaf-1, cleaved caspase-3/9, cleaved PARP, suppressing Bcl-2 levels, and causing cytochrome c release. The effects of an inhibitor of miR-149-3P and of siRNA of testicular Akt1 suggested that dioscin showed excellent activity against pancreatic cancer via miR- 149-3P-mediated inhibition of Akt1 signalling pathway.Collectively, these findings confirmed the potent effects of dioscin against pancreatic cancer and also provided novel insights into the mechanisms of the compound as a potential candidate for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744854>Effect of citronella essential oil fumigation on sprout suppression and quality of potato tubers during storage.</a></h2><p>Effect of citronella essential oil (CEO) fumigation on sprout suppression and quality of potato tubers during storage was investigated. Potato tubers were treated under conditions of single-phase (30 μL L, 0-10 d) and dual-phase (30 μL L, 0-10 d; 30 μL L, 35-90 d) fumigation. Changes in germination rate,  loss, starch, reducing sugar, gibberellins (GA), and α-solanine were measured. The results showed that CEO fumigation could control sprouting and improve the quality of potato tubers during storage compared to the non-treated tubers. CEO treatments inhibited the degradation of starch and the increase of reducing sugar content. The production of gibberellins (GA) was suppressed, and the levels of α-solanine in the skin and flesh of potato tubers were decreased by CEO fumigation. Dual-phase CEO fumigation had a better effect on sprout suppression than single-phase fumigation, and possesses potential for postharvest application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional Chinese medicine reported that dioscin plays a role in expectorant, relaxing the muscles and stimulating the blood circulation, aiding digestion and diuresis. With the development of science and technology in recent years, some new extraction and separation techniques and methods have been applied to the study of dioscin, and more and more pharmacological effects were found. Modern pharmacology studies have confirmed that dioscin had some activities on desensitization, anti-inflammatory, -lowering, anti-tumor, hepatoprotection and anti-viral. After oral administration, dioscin is metabolized to , which is the true active ingredient and is an important raw material to synthesize steroid hormone drugs. Therefore, the studies on dioscin are valueable and promising.

In this study, (3β, 25R)‑spirost‑5‑en‑3‑oxyl (2‑((2((2‑aminoethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)ethyl) carbamate (DGP), a new synthetic  derivative incorporating primary amine was used to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of action in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Pretreatment with DGP resulted in significant inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and down-regulation of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. In addition, DGP decreased the production of reactive  species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The inhibitory effects of DGP on these inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells were regulated by NF-κB signaling through blocking p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB p65/DNA binding activity. DGP also blocked the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). The NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23 and JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 significantly decreased NO production and IL-6 release in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, respectively. The overall results demonstrate that DGP has anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated BV2 cells via inhibition of NF-κB and JNK activation, suggesting that DGP is a potential prophylactic agent in various neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2018.

Specifically, p-type Pdots (p-Pdots) and n-type CdS QDs (n-CdS) were utilized to form organic-inorganic nanoparticles p-n heterojunction to enhance signal response, and their specific  levels (VB/CB or HOMO/LUMO) were calculated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis application. At the same time, the combination of molecular imprinting technology and photoelectrochemistry overcomes the defeats of photoelectrochemistry which is the absence of selectivity, offers a new MIP-PEC sensor with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity based heterojunction enhanced strategy. In short, this study proposes the semiconducting organic-inorganic nanoparticles p-n heterojunction for molecularly imprinted polymer photoelectrochemcal bioanalysis application, and the MIP-PEC sensor was successfully fabricated based on these materials and methods. In the phosphate buffer solution (PBS), it was clearly observed that the photocurrent has a significant change between elution in acetic acid-ethanol mixture and incubation in template molecular solution because of the faster electron transfer speed, this phenomenon fully showed that the MIP-PEC sensor can specifically detect the target. Thus, the work typically offers a linear range from 0.01 to 1000 ng mL with a detection limit of 6.5 pg mL for α-Solanine.

Therefore, the laxative effects of five candidates derived from L. platyphylla:  (DG), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), adenosine (AD), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and uridine (UD) were investigated by examining the alteration of G protein α (Gα) expression, protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation and inositol triphosphate (IP3) concentration levels in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5‑HT; serotonin) receptor signaling pathway. Primary rat intestine smooth muscle cells (pRISMCs), intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)‑18 and B35 cells were cotreated with Lop and the five compounds in order to screen the candidates. AEtLP, prucalopride (PCP) and bisacodyl (BS) served as positive controls. In pRISMCs, Gα expression levels were recovered in the majority of candidate‑treated groups, whereas PKC phosphorylation recovery was observed only in the DG, 5‑HMF and AD treatment groups. In IEC‑18 cells, the AD treatment group mimicked the effects of PCP on PKC phosphorylation levels, whereas the DG, 5‑HMF, HPC and UD treatment groups mimicked the effects of AEtLP and BS. In B35 cells, a greater upregulation of PKC phosphorylation levels were observed in the UD treatment group compared with the PCP and BS treatment groups, whereas DG, 5‑HMF and AD treatment reduced the PKC phosphorylation levels to a greater extent than AEtLP treatment. However, effects similar to AEtLP, PCP and BS on Gα expression levels were not detected in any treatment groups in IEC‑18 and B35 cells. Furthermore, the level of IP3 was enhanced only in pRISMCs, in which all five candidates were effective, while the greatest concentration was observed in the UD treatment group. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that UD may be considered the compound with the greatest laxative activity, which may regulate the 5‑HT receptor signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641001>Elucidation of the mass fragmentation pathways of potato glycoalkaloids and aglycons using Orbitrap mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The mass fragmentation of potato glycoalkaloids, α-solanine and α-chaconine, and the aglycons, demissidine and solasodine were studied using the Orbitrap Fourier transform (FT) mass spectrometer.

Thus, exploration of effective lead compounds against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is necessary. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of dioscin against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The in vitro model of DOX- treated H9C2 cells and the in vivo models of DOX-treated rats and mice were used in this study. The results showed that discoin markedly increased H9C2 cell viability, decreased the levels of CK, LDH, and improved histopathological and electrocardio- gram changes in rats and mice to protect DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, dioscin significantly inhibited myocardial oxidative insult through adjusting the levels of intracellular ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px in vitro and in vivo. Our data also indicated that dioscin activated Nrf2 and Sirt2 signaling , and thereby affected the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, Gst, GCLM, Keap1 and FOXO3a through decreasing miR-140-5p expression level. In addition, the level of intracellular ROS was significantly increased in H9C2 cells treated by DOX after miR-140-5p mimic transfection, as well as the down-regulated expression levels of Nrf2 and Sirt2, which were markedly reversed by dioscin. In conclusion, our data suggested that dioscin alleviated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through modulating miR-140-5p-mediated myocardial oxidative stress.

Moreover, we observed that S100P expression was downregulated by α-solanine. Overexpression of S100P partially reversed the α-solanine-induced growth inhibition of CRC cells. Conversely, knockdown of S100P by lentiviral-mediated RNAi resulted in significantly promoting the α-solanine-induced growth inhibition.These findings suggest that α-solanine is a potential agent for the treatment of CRC, and the anti-tumor effect of α-solanine in the CRC cells may be mediated at least partly by the downregulation of S100P.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315966>Dioscin: A diverse acting natural compound with therapeutic potential in metabolic diseases, cancer, inflammation and infections.</a></h2><p>Currently, the numbers of patients with cancer, fibrosis, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke and osteoporosis are increasing fast and fast.

Initially, dioscin was purified and identified from Polygonatum sibiricum by HPLC, MS, and NMR analysis, respectively. Dioscin inhibited the cell multiplication at IC of 8.34 μM, altered the cell morphology, arrested the cell cycle in G2/M phase and led to considerable programmed cell death. Furthermore, it has efficiently promoted the mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway. The inhibition of Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 proteins in these pathways abolished the dioscin induced apoptosis significantly; while dioscin inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

The underlying mechanisms for the effects is that MPD inhibits the transcription of SREBP1c and SREBP2, and decreases levels of microRNA 33a/b hosted in the introns of SREBPs, which leads to reciprocally increase ABCA1 levels. In HepG2 cells, MPD shows the same effects as these observed in THP-1 macrophages. MPD also decreases the gene expressions of HMGCR, FAS and ACC for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.

Many patients with osteosarcoma always develop drug resistance to current chemotherapy regimens, which induces a poor prognosis. And cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported to possess the properties to self-renew and maintain the phenotype of tumor, which may lead to clinical treatment failure. Thus, it is an urgent task to develop several potentially useful therapeutic agents, which could target CSCs in osteosarcoma. This study aims to clarify the in vitro and in vivo anti-osteosarcoma effects of dioscin, the primary component derived from Discorea nipponica Makino, and its molecular mechanism of action. In this study, all the ten human osteosarcoma cell lines were sensitive to dioscin treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Dioscin inhibits proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest as well as apoptotic cell death in osteosarcoma cells. More importantly, oral administration of dioscin (60 mg/kg) showed significant therapeutic effect on osteosarcoma growth without obvious side effects in vivo. In addition, dioscin possesses the ability to suppress stem-cell-like phenotype of osteosarcoma cells. Mechanistically, dioscin inhibits osteosarcoma stem-cell-like properties and tumor growth through repression of Akt/GSK3/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, β-catenin expression in osteosarcoma patients was associated with clinical prognosis. Conclusively, the present study provides comprehensive evidence for the inhibition of dioscin on osteosarcoma stem-cell-like properties and tumor growth through repression of Akt/GSK3/β-catenin pathway, which suggests dioscin as a promising therapeutic regimen. And β-catenin may be a potential therapeutic target as well as a significant prognostic marker for osteosarcoma patients in clinic.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26526742>Bivalent ligands incorporating curcumin and  as multifunctional compounds against Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>In an effort to combat the multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, a series of multifunctional, bivalent compounds containing curcumin and  were designed, synthesized, and biologically characterized. Screening results in MC65 neuroblastoma cells established that compound 38 with a spacer length of 17 atoms exhibited the highest protective potency with an EC50 of 111.7 ± 9.0 nM. A reduction in protective activity was observed as spacer length was increased up to 28 atoms and there is a clear structural preference for attachment to the methylene carbon between the two carbonyl moieties of curcumin. Further study suggested that antioxidative ability and inhibitory effects on amyloid-β oligomer (AβO) formation may contribute to the neuroprotective outcomes. Additionally, compound 38 was found to bind directly to Aβ, similar to curcumin, but did not form complexes with the common biometals Cu, Fe, and Zn. Altogether, these results give strong evidence to support the bivalent design strategy in developing novel compounds with multifunctional ability for the treatment of AD.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To clarify the differences and homologies, the antimuscarinic and anti-inflammatory effects of five BM species were firstly tested and compared at cellular level. With an integrated strategy combining UPLC-Q/TOF MS, PCA and ANN analysis, the active ingredients among 28 different chemical markers were predicted and identified. SB and QB extracts showed the best antimuscarinic effects and several steroidal alkaloids, such as solanidine, contributed to this effects. However, ZB was superior to reduce the inflammatory response. Another five components were responsible by decreasing the expression of NF-κB, including puqiedine, zhepeiresinol, 2-monopalmitin, N-demethylpuqietinone, and isoverticine. More novelty, a new cluster of five BM species based on active ingredients as potential quality markers was depicted to illustrate their functions. These results of the study could make a reference for the medicinal application of BM species in clinic; and the integrated strategy provided an effective method to obtain the quality markers from medical herbs, which was helpful for the quality control of traditional medicinal products.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The  at two dose levels, namely 100 and 200mgkg(-1), was intragastrically administrated once daily for 7-day period prior to the surgery. Then, the rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal thread for 90min. After 24h reperfusion, several diagnostic indicators were evaluated and all animals were sacrificed to harvest their brains and blood for subsequent biochemical analyses. The results indicated that  treatment significantly inhibited the death rate and improved the impaired neurological functions along with neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct size as compared with the rats exposed to I/R insult without agents administration. The increase in the number of apoptotic cells determined by TUNEL in the hippocampus CA1 and cortex was also apparently attenuated in the  treatment group, which was closely correlated with suppression of Caspase-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition the elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in blood serum of the I/R treated rats were reduced almost to their normal level. Further results obtained from the Western blotting analysis revealed that the protein expression of IκBα in the injured brain was up-regulated, while the p65 subunit of NF-κB was down-regulated in nucleus after the treatment. Collectively, this neuroprotection of  against I/R injury may be attained through its anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation and intervening the NF-κB signal pathway properties.

Polygonatum kingianum has been used in the treatment of diabetes and related diseases in China for centuries. Total saponins (TSPK) and total polysaccharides (PSPK) were reported to be major types of active constituents of P. kingianum. This research aims at investigation of their therapeutical mechanisms on diabetes based on the regulation of gut microbiota.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) rats were induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin-injection from male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The blood biochemical indicators were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota and the contents of the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were discussed.T2D rats were treated with TSPK (0.025 and 0.1g/kg) and PSPK (0.1g/kg) for 56 days. Major biochemical indexes, such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota were discussed based on the sequencing results on V4 region of 16S rDNA. Moreover, the contents of the SCFAs in faeces, which were fermentation products produced from gut microbiota were determined by gas chromatography (GC).Oral administration of TSPK and PSPK prevented the increase of FBG. TSPK (0.025g/kg) enhancing the content of FINS at the end of research. Furthermore, TSPK and PSPK improved the intestinal microecology by decreasing the abundances of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and increasing that of Firmicutes. However, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H displayed discrepant regulation roles on Firmicutes. TSPK.L and PSPK significantly increased the abundance of Ruminococcaceae family and Ruminococcus genus in Firmicutes phylum, however, TSPK.H increased the abundances of Veillonellaceae family and Anaerovibrio genus. 57 Key variables, altered after treated by TSPK and PSPK, correlated to the alternations of FBG, FINS, LPS and  were identified. In addition, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H showed different adjustment on the contents of SCFAs.These results suggested that, compared to the normal rats, the structure of gut microbiota was significantly changed in diabetic rats. Oral administration with TSPK and PSPK could prevent T2D by its regulation role on the gut microbiota.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed for glioma therapy. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a bioactive constituent extracted from Paris polyphylla, was reported to have anti-tumor activity. However, the detailed mechanism for this activity remains unclear. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of PPI on glioma cells and its mechanisms in vitro. U251 cells were treated with various concentrations of PPI (2-9 μM) for 24 to 72 h. The inhibition of U251 cell proliferation by PPI was assessed by MTT assay. The effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry with PI and annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining, and the cell mitochondrial membrane potential level was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy with JC-1 staining. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and JNK signal pathway proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. Results showed that PPI significantly inhibited the proliferation of U251 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. PPI induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, and it upregulated the expressions of Bax, cytochrome c, and p-JNK, but downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in U251 cells. Moreover, PPI provoked the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, apoptosis induced by the PPI was remarkably suppressed by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Our data provide evidence that PPI inhibits proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death in U251 cells. This effect may be associated with the JNK pathway. These results suggest that PPI is an activator of the JNK signaling pathway with a potential anti-glioma effect.© The Author 2017.

The miR-19b levels were markedly down-regulated in Dgn-treated THP-1 macrophages/MPM-derived foam cells. Cholesterol transport assays revealed that treatment with Dgn alone or together with miR-19b inhibitor notably enhanced ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, resulting in the reduced levels of total cholesterol, free cholesterol and cholesterol ester as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The fecal 3H-sterol originating from cholesterol-laden MPMs was increased in apolipoprotein E knockout mice treated with Dgn or both Dgn and antagomiR-19b. Treatment with Dgn alone or together with antagomiR-19b elevated plasma high-density lipoprotein levels, but reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein levels.

We found that Dios suppressed the synthesis of molecules that promote inflammation (M1 markers, such as NO, IL-6, and TNF-α) in rat microglia and BV-2 cells induced with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In contrast, Dios had no effects on the cellular production of anti-inflammatory factors (M2 markers, such as IL-10, IL-1Rα and CD206) in LPS and IL-4 treated microglia. Dios repressed IκB-α, ERK MAPK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, but did not affect JNK in LPS-activated microglia. We also found that conditioned medium obtained from cultures of BV-2 cells incubated with Dios plus LPS was markedly less neurotoxic than conditioned medium obtained from cultures of BV-2 cells incubated with LPS alone. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Dios can selectively suppress the production/expression of pro-inflammatory M1 markers by activated microglia, without affecting M2 markers, and might provide neuroprotection by regulating microglial M1 polarization. Our results suggest that Dios can be used in treatment of various neuroinflammatory diseases mediated by microglia.Copyright © 2017.

However, the specific mechanism by which this is achieved is not clear. This study investigated the protective effects of  on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS Healthy adult male SD rats,  (b.w.) 250-280 g, were used to model ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and were administered  (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg b.w.) intragastrically for 4 consecutive weeks before surgery. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated to induce myocardial ischemia for 30 min and reperfusion for 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min while relevant indicators were detected. RESULTS Both 50 mg and 100 mg  oral administration increased left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and maximum changing rate of ventricular pressure (±dp/dtmax), decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and myocardial enzyme markers. TTC staining suggested that  reduced myocardial infarct size in the rat model. Pathological results showed that myocardial ischemia and inflammation were alleviated by . In addition, the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in serum, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in myocardium were significantly suppressed by  administration.  further inhibited the phosphorylation of transcription factor NF-κB and modulated the expression of downstream inflammatory cytokines by regulating the activation of p38-MAPK and JNK pathways.

In the present study, the antitumor activity of PPI in prostate cancer (PC) cells was evaluated. At low doses, PPI decreased proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PC cells. PPI decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), an enzyme that is critical for tumor metastasis. PPI also decreased the expression of Snail and vimentin, which are EMT-associated factors. Additionally, PPI suppressed AP-1 transcriptional activity and AP-1 binding to the MMP7 and vimentin promoters. The results demonstrated that PPI downregulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signaling‑related kinase (ERK), which is upstream modulator of AP-1. The results of the present study demonstrated that PPI may inhibit the cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A)/protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/ERK axis, downregulate the expression of MMP7, vimentin, and Snail, and suppress tumor invasion and EMT.

In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of action of dioscin, a glucosides saponin isolated from Polygonatum zanlanscianense pump, in human myeloblast leukemia HL-60 cells. Dioscin suppressed HL-60 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was due to the induction of apoptosis as revealed by the externalization of phosphatidylserine, and cleavages of lamin A/C and PARP-1. Treatment with dioscin induced apoptosis through activation of caspases 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK contributed to dioscin-induced apoptosis upstream of caspase activation. Using various inhibitors and antioxidant agents, we found that mitochondrial derived reactive  species and depletion of mitochondrial transmembrane potential lead to the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK.

The effects of dioscin against human gastric carcinoma in vivo were accomplished by the xenografts of MGC-803 cells in BALB/c nude mice.AO/EB and DAPI staining, TEM, single cell gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry assays were used in cell experiments. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach, DNA and siRNA transfection experiments were carried out for mechanism investigation.In MGC-803 cells, dioscin caused DNA damage and mitochondrial change, induced ROS generation, Ca(2+) release and cell apoptosis, and blocked cell cycle at S phase. In vivo results showed that dioscin significantly suppressed the tumor growth of MGC-803 cell xenografts in nude mice. In addition, dioscin markedly inhibited cell migration, caused Cytochrome c release and adjusted mitochondrial signal pathway. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach was carried out and 121 differentially expressed proteins were found, in which five biomarkers associated with cell cycle, apoptosis and migration were evaluated. Dioscin significantly up-regulated the levels of GALR-2 and RBM-3, and down-regulated CAP-1, Tribbles-2 and CliC-3.

Dioscin, an herbal steroidal saponin, exerts anti-tumor effects while the underlying mechanism is unclear. Using WB, FACS, and immunofluorescence methodologies, we found dioscin significantly activated the transcription and translation of Cx43 via the retinoid acid signaling pathway and simultaneously enhanced the transporting function of Cx43. Through stimulating Cx43, dioscin remarkably suppressed the migratory and invasive capacities of B16 cells, and notably decreased pluripotency markers of cancer stem cells and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in B16 cells and animal tumor tissues. Conversely, dioscin improved the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β), and the phagocytic capacity of tumor-associated macrophages by increasing M2-to-M1 phenotype transition. More strikingly, even in Cx43 functional deficient B16 and RAW264.7 cells, dioscin still dramatically reversed the aggravated tumor malignancy and reduced macrophage phagocytic activity. Two classical metastasis animal models were utilized in vivo and results showed that dioscin showed significant anti-metastatic effects, which is closely related to the expression of Cx43 either in in situ tumor or metastatic lung nodes.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) expression was measured by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blot analysis was performed to determine the protein expression levels of MUC1, p65, and p50. Silencing of HOTAIR was evaluated using the siRNA procedure. The promoter activity of the MUC1 gene was determined using Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit. Exogenous expression of HOTAIR, p65, and MUC1 was conducted by transient transfection assay. A xenograft tumor model in nude mice was used to further evaluate the effect of the combination of PPI and enzalutamide in vivo.We showed that PPI significantly inhibited growth and induced cell cycle arrest in CRPC cells. PPI also decreased p65 and MUC1 protein expression and reduced HOTAIR expression. Exogenously expressed p65 resisted the PPI-inhibited expression of HOTAIR, whereas silenced HOTAIR reduced MUC1 protein but exerted no effect on the expression of p65 and p50 proteins. Conversely, exogenously expressed HOTAIR resisted the PPI-inhibited MUC1 protein expression, and excessive expression of MUC1 antagonized the PPI-inhibited cell growth. Notably, PPI combined with enzalutamide exerted a synergistic effect. Consistent with this finding, PPI inhibited tumor growth, HOTAIR expression, as well as p65 and MUC1 protein expressions in vivo.Our results indicate that PPI inhibits the growth of CRPC cells by inhibiting p65 protein and concomitantly reducing HOTAIR expression, thereby suppressing MUC1 gene expression. The novel regulatory interaction of p65 and HOTAIR converge in the inhibition of MUC1 expression and overall PPI response. The combination of PPI and enzalutamide exhibits synergy.

Traditionally,  is mainly produced by acid hydrolysis of Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright (DZW) tubers. This method yields numerous byproducts that can cause serious pollution. In this study,  was obtained by biotransformation of steroidal saponins in DZW afforded by Trichoderma harzianum CGMCC 2979. The medium was optimized for maximum  production. The addition of phosphate buffer, surfactant Tween-85, and Fe(2+) increased the yield of  by 50.28%, 33.35%, and 22.07%, respectively. The optimum medium obtained by response surface methodology was composed of 60 mmol l(-1) phosphate buffer, 0.07% (w/v) Tween-85, and 0.93 mmol l(-1) Fe(2+). Under these conditions, a maximum  yield of 30.05 +/- 0.59 mg g(-1) was achieved, which was slightly higher than that obtained from traditional acid hydrolysis. By hydrolyzing the un-transformed steroidal saponins after biotransformation, the total  yield increased by 35% compared to traditional method.

However, the activity of it against dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced acute liver injury remained unknown. In the present study, dioscin markedly decreased serum ALT and AST levels, significantly increased the levels of SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and decreased the levels of MDA, iNOS and NO. Mechanism study showed that dioscin significantly decreased the expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IκBα, p50 and p65 through regulating TLR4/MyD88 pathway to rehabilitate inflammation. In addition, dioscin markedly up-regulated the expression levels of SIRT1, HO-1, NQO1, GST and GCLM through increasing nuclear translocation of Nrf2 against oxidative stress. Furthermore, dioscin significantly decreased the expression levels of FasL, Fas, p53, Bak, Caspase-3/9, and upregulated Bcl-2 level through decreasing IRF9 level against apoptosis. In conclusion, dioscin showed protective effect against DMN-induced acute liver injury via ameliorating apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation, which should be developed as a new candidate for the treatment of acute liver injury in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the study is to investigate whether effects of dioscin on ANIT-induced cholestasis are related to changes in expression of hepatic transporters in rats. Effects of dioscin on cholestasis were examined by histology and biochemical marker levels. The functional changes of hepatic transporters were determined by in vitro, in situ and in vivo. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to assess the expression of hepatic transporters in cholestatic rats.

There are few effective drugs that can delay the progression of this disease; thus, patients with silicosis are usually only offered supportive care. Dioscin, a steroidal saponin, exhibits many biological activities and health benefits including its protective effects against hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of dioscin on silicosis is unknown.We employed experimental mouse mode of silicosis. Different doses of dioscin were gavaged to the animals 1 day after crystalline silica instillation to see the effect of dioscin on crystalline silica induced pulmonary fibrosis. Also, we used RAW264.7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines to explore dioscin effects on macrophages and fibroblasts. Dioscin was also oral treatment but 10 days after crystalline silica instillation to see its effect on established pulmonary fibrosis.Dioscin treatment reduced pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. It also reduced the recruitment of fibrocytes, protected epithelial cells from crystalline silica injury, inhibited transforming growth factor beta/Smad3 signaling and fibroblast activation. Together, these effects delayed the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism by which dioscin treatment alleviated CS-induced inflammation appeared to be via the reduction of macrophage, B lymphocyte, and T lymphocte infiltration into lung. Dioscin inhibits macrophages and fibroblasts from secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and may also function as a modulator of T helper cells responses, concurrent with attenuated phosphorylation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Also, dioscin could block the phosphorylation of Smad3 in fibroblast. Oral treatment of dioscin could also effectively postpone the progression of established silicosis.Oral treatment dioscin delays crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and exerts pulmonary protective effects in mice.

Candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of  in fenugreek were identified. Detailed mechanism of  synthesis was proposed. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) is a valuable medicinal and crop plant. It belongs to Fabaceae family and has a unique potential to synthesize valuable steroidal saponins, e.g., . Elicitation (methyl jasmonate) and precursor feeding (cholesterol and squalene) were used to enhance the content of sterols and steroidal sapogenins in in vitro grown plants for representational difference analysis of cDNA (cDNA-RDA). To identify candidate genes involved in  biosynthesis, differential, factor-specific libraries were subject to the next-generation sequencing. Approximately 9.9 million reads were obtained, trimmed, and assembled into 31,491 unigenes with an average length of 291 bp. Then, functional annotation and gene ontogeny enrichment analysis was performed by aligning all-unigenes with public databases. Within the transcripts related to sterol and steroidal saponin biosynthesis, we discovered novel candidate genes of  biosynthesis and validated their expression using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Based on these findings, we supported the idea that  is biosynthesized from cycloartenol via cholesterol. This is the first report on the next-generation sequencing of cDNA-RDA products.

Cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular reactive  species (ROS) generation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were measured on a flow cytometry. Caspase activation, ER stress, and MMP-dependent apoptosis proteins in cervical cancer cells in response to PD were determined by Western blot analysis. The ability of ATF4 binding to ChIP promoter was measured using the ChIP assay.We demonstrated that PD inhibits cell viability, causes a loss of mitochondrial function, and induces apoptosis, as evidenced by up-regulation of caspase-8, -3, -9, -PARP, and Bax activation, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression. PD was shown to induce ROS and the ER stress pathway, including GRP78, p-eIF-2α, ATF4, and CHOP. Pre-treatment with NAC, a ROS production inhibitor, significantly reduced ER stress and apoptosis-related proteins induced by PD. Transfection of GRP78/CHOP-siRNA effectively inhibited PD-induced ER stress-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with PD significantly increased p38 and JNK activation. Co-administration of a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or p38 inhibitor (SB203580) abolished cell death and ER stress effects during PD treatment. In addition, PD induced the expression of nuclear ATF4 and CHOP, as well as the binding ability of ATF4 to the CHOP promoter.Our results suggest that PD is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human cervical cancer.© 2018 The Author(s).

Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of dioscin against human colon cancer cells and evaluated the molecular mechanism involved in this process. The cell cytotoxicity was studied by the MTT assay and BrdU incorporation. The proapoptotic mechanism of dioscin was characterized by flow cytometry analysis. A western blot and an immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate how dioscin induces apoptosis in vitro. In our study, dioscin could significantly inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Dioscin induces apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, promoting the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax translocation to the , cytochrome C release to cytosol, activations of caspase-9/3, PARP cleavage, and subsequent apoptosis. Dioscin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by sustained phosphorylation of JNK, p38-MAPK. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a scavenger of ROS, significantly reversed dioscin-induced cell death and activation of JNK and p38.

Pooled results showed fenugreek significantly decreased the levels of FBG (MD -0.84mmol/L; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.31; p=0.002), 2hBG (MD -1.30mmol/L; 95% CI -1.78 to -0.83; p<0.0001), HbA1c (MD -1.16; 95% CI -1.23 to -1.09; p<0.00001) and TC (MD -0.30mmol/L; 95% CI-0.56 to -0.03; p=0.03).

However, its effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory liver injury remains unknown. In the present work, liver injury in mice and rats was induced by LPS, and dioscin was intragastrically administered for 7days. In vitro, the AML-12 cells and HepG-2 cells were treated with LPS after dioscin treatment. The results showed that dioscin not only markedly reduced serum ALT, AST levels and relative liver weights, but also restored cell injury caused by LPS. In mechanism study, dioscin significantly attenuated inflammation through down-regulating the levels of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (p-IKK), phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor κB alpha (p-IκBα), phosphorylated nuclear factor κB p65 (p-NF-κB p65), high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB-1), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). TLR4 overexpression was also decreased by dioscin, leading to the markedly decreased levels of MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, p-IKK, p-IκBα, p-NF-κB p65 and HMGB-1. Suppression of MyD88 by ST2825 eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on the levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, p-IKK, p-IκBα, p-NF-κB p65, HMGB-1, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Our results suggested that dioscin exhibited protective effect against LPS-induced liver injury via altering TLR4/MyD88 pathway, which should be developed as one potent candidate for the treatment of acute inflammatory liver injury in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Dioscin is a polyphenolic component isolated from Phyllanthus amarus, which exhibits a wide range of pharmacological and physiological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-, anti-fungal, and anti-viral activities. However, the possible role of dioscin in the EMT is unclear. We investigated the suppressive effect of dioscin on the EMT. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is known to induce EMT in a number of cancer cell types and promote lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion. To verify the inhibitory role of dioscin in lung cancer migration and invasion, we investigated the use of dioscin as inhibitors of TGF-β1-induced EMT in A549 lung cancer cells in vitro. Here, we found that dioscin prominently increased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and expression of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and Snail during the TGF-β1-induced EMT. In addition, dioscin inhibited the TGF-β1-induced increase in cell migration and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells. Also, dioscin remarkably inhibited TGF-β1-regulated activation of MMP-2/9, Smad2, and p38.

Dioscin 0.5-32 µmol · L(-1) exposed to HepG2 cells for 12 h, cell viability was examined by CCK-8 assay and the release rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was to evaluate cell membrane damage. HepG2 cells morphologic changes were quantified by inverted Microscope, and the effect on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of CYP1A and AhR was evaluated by RT-RCR. The protein expression of CYP1A1 was detected by western blot. The cell viability was significantly inhibited after HepG2 cells were exposed to dioscin 0.5-32 µmol · L(-1). Compared with the control, the LDH release rate and ROS were significantly increased. The expression of CYPlA and AhR mRNA was increased. The expression of CYP1Al protein was increased after dioscin treatment, and resveratrol, an AhR antagonist, could downregulate the expression of CYP1A1.

Because current acne medications have various side effects, it is necessary to explore alternative medications possessing anti-inflammatory activity against P. acnes. We investigated the inhibitory effects of polyphyllin I (PPI) on P. acnes-induced inflammation in vitro. In this study, we examined the effects of PPI on the production of inflammatory cytokines in HaCaT keratinocytes treated with heat-killed P. acnes. These treated HaCaT keratinocytes showed increased expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and production of inflammatory cytokines. PPI significantly suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and the expression of TLR2 in P. acnes-treated cells. Moreover, we studied the influence of PPI on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling  in P. acnes-treated keratinocytes. PPI diminished the activation of NF-κB. Phosphorylated p38 levels were markedly increased after treatment with heat-killed P. acnes but were decreased after treatment with PPI, while the effect of PPI on ERK phosphorylation was not significant. Heat-killed P. acnes and PPI did not have any effect on JNK phosphorylation. Furthermore, we confirmed that NF-κB p65 inhibitor (BAY11-7082), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), and PPI blocked the expression of IL-8 in heat-killed P. acnes-treated cells.

The rats were preconditioned with protodioscin at the doses of 25 and 50mgkg(-1) prior to surgery. Then the animals were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using an intraluminal method by inserting a thread (90min surgery). After the blood flow was restored in 24h via withdrawing the thread, some representative indicators for the cerebral injury were evaluated by various methods including TTC-staining, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. As compared with the operated rats without drug intervening, treatment with protodioscin apparently lowered the death rate and improved motor coordination abilities through reducing the deficit scores and cerebral infarct volume. What's more, an apparent decrease in neuron apoptosis detected in hippocampus CA1 and cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere might attribute to alleviate the increase in Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Meanwhile, concentrations of several main pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) in the serum were also significantly suppressed. Finally, the NF-κB and IκBa protein expressions in the cytoplasm of right injured brain were remarkably up-regulated, while NF-κB in nucleus was down-regulated. Therefore, these observed findings demonstrated that protodioscin appeared to reveal potential neuroprotection against the I/R injury due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties.

Renal glucose transporter-9 (GLUT-9) and organic anion transporter-1 (OAT-1) expressions were analyzed by western blotting method. Renal uric acid excretion was evaluated using stably urate transporter-1 (URAT-1) transfected human epithelial kidney cell line. Intestinal uric acid excretion was evaluated by measuring the transcellular transport of uric acid in HCT116 cells.In hyperuricemia rats, both 25 and 50mg/kg of oral Dioscin decreased serum uric acid levels over 4h.

In the present work, the activity and mechanism of dioscin, a natural product, against PCa were investigated. The results showed that dioscin markedly inhibited cell viability, colony formation, motility and induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. Moreover, dioscin disrupted the formation of PC3 cell-derived mammospheres and reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) level and the CD133/CD44 cells, indicating that dioscin had a potent inhibitory activity on prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). In vivo results also showed that dioscin significantly suppressed the tumor growth of PC3 cell xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, mechanism investigation showed that dioscin markedly upregulated ERβ expression level, subsequently increased prolyl hydroxylase 2 level, decreased the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor A and BMI-1, and thus induced cell apoptosis by regulating the expression levels of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 family proteins. In addition, transfection experiment of ERβ-siRNA further indicated that diosicn showed excellent activity against PCa in vitro and in vivo by increasing ERβ expression level. The co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results further suggested that dioscin promoted the interaction of c-ABL and ERβ, but did not change c-ABL expression. Moreover, the molecular docking assay showed that dioscin processed powerful affinity toward to ERβ mainly through the strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects, and the actions of dioscin on ERβ activation and tumor cells inhibition were significantly weakened in the mutational (Phe-336, Phe-468) PC3 cells.

At low concentrations in potato tubers, SGAs are distasteful; however, at high concentrations, SGAs are harmful to humans and animals. Here, we show that POTATO GLYCOALKALOID BIOSYNTHESIS1 (PGA1) and PGA2, two genes that encode cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP72A208 and CYP72A188), are involved in the SGA biosynthetic pathway, respectively. The knockdown plants of either PGA1 or PGA2 contained very little SGA, yet vegetative growth and tuber production were not affected. Analyzing metabolites that accumulated in the plants and produced by in vitro enzyme assays revealed that PGA1 and PGA2 catalyzed the 26- and 22-hydroxylation steps, respectively, in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. The PGA-knockdown plants had two unique phenotypic characteristics: The plants were sterile and tubers of these knockdown plants did not sprout during storage.

In this study, the influence of nutritional status on the absorption of PPI in rats was explored after oral administration.PCM rats, namely mal-nourished (MN) rats, were induced from well-nourished (WN) rats by caloric restriction protocol. Intestinal absorption of PPI in WN and MN rats was evaluated by pharmacokinetic and intestinal perfusion methods. The potential mechanisms between two groups were investigated on the basis of intestinal permeability, intestinal efflux and PPI's depletions in vivo. The intestinal permeability was analyzed by determining the concentration of paracellular marker transport in serum and the expression of  proteins in intestine. The intestinal efflux was evaluated through comparing the protein level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in intestine, and the depletions of PPI and/or generation of its metabolites in liver and intestines were analyzed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.Compared to WN rats, the oral systemic exposure of PPI was significantly increased in MN rats, evidenced by significant enhancement of maximum plasma concentration (C) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by more than 2.51- and 3.71-folds as well as terminal elimination half-life (t) prolonged from to 7.3 to 14.1 h. Further studies revealed that the potential mechanism might be associated with combined contribution of improved intestinal absorption and depressed deglycosylation of PPI in MN rats. Furthermore, enhanced intestinal absorption of PPI was benefited from increased intestinal permeability and decreased intestinal efflux in MN rats. Meanwhile, the former manifested as increased transport of paracellular marker and decreased  proteins levels, while the later evidenced by reduced P-gp expression.The oral exposure of PPI was enhanced in MN rats, which suggested that nutritional status alters the absorption of PPI, and thus the dosage of PPI should be modified during the treatment of cancer patient with PCM.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism', 'tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351216>In Silico and In Vitro Study of the Bromelain-Phytochemical Complex Inhibition of Phospholipase A2 (Pla2).</a></h2><p>Phospholipase A2 (Pla2) is an enzyme that induces inflammation, making Pla2 activity an effective approach to reduce inflammation.

The proposed mechanisms of SGA toxicity are sterol-mediated disruption of membranes and inhibition of cholinesterase activity in neurons. It has been suggested that phytopathogenic microorganisms can overcome SGA toxicity by enzymatic deglycosylation of SGAs. Here, we have explored SGA-mediated toxicity toward the invasive oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of the late blight disease in potato and tomato, as well as the potential for SGA deglycosylation by this species. Our growth studies indicate that solanidine, the nonglycosylated precursor of the potato SGAs α-chaconine and α-solanine, has a greater physiological impact than its glycosylated forms. All of these compounds were incorporated into the mycelium, but only solanidine could strongly inhibit the growth of P. infestans in liquid culture. Genes encoding several glycoside hydrolases with potential activity on SGAs were identified in the genome of P. infestans and were shown to be expressed. However, we found no indication that deglycosylation of SGAs takes place.

Moreover, both DP particle types, particularly 50 mesh DP, significantly activated AMPK (5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) and deactivated ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), as demonstrated by the increased levels of both enzymes in their phosphorylated form.

It is not clear whether the primary step in this process is flopping of cholesterol from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane, with desorption by mixed micelles, or decreasing of the activation  required for cholesterol desorption from the outer membrane leaflet. In this study, we investigated these mechanisms by infusing Abcg8(+/+), Abcg8(+/-), and Abcg8(-/-) mice with hydrophilic and hydrophobic bile salts. In Abcg8(-/-) mice, this failed to substantially stimulate biliary cholesterol secretion. Infusion of the hydrophobic bile salt taurodeoxycholate also resulted in cholestasis, which was induced in Abcg8(-/-) mice at a much lower infusion rate compared with Abc8(-/-) and Abcg8(+/-) mice, suggesting a reduced cholesterol content in the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane. Indeed, isolation of canalicular membranes revealed a reduction of 45% in cholesterol content under these conditions in Abcg8(-/-) mice.

However, numerous cases of toxicity outbreaks in livestock have raised concerns on safety of using these plants, especially B. decumbens. In this study, chemometric analysis of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-QTOF-MS) data has for the first time uncovered qualitative and quantitative differences between metabolomes of toxic B. decumbens and nontoxic B. brizantha. The steroidal saponin protoneodioscin was established as the main biomarker for B. decumbens when compared to B. brizantha, and therefore the key explanation for their phytochemical differentiation. Quantification of protodioscin in both plants showed no significant differences; consequently, the idea that this compound is solely responsible for toxicity outbreaks must be discarded. Instead, we propose that the added occurrence of its stereoisomer, protoneodioscin, in B. decumbens, can be considered as the probable cause of these events. Interestingly, the greatest concentrations of saponins for both species were reached during winter (B. decumbens = 53.6 ± 5.1 mg·g(-1) dry  (D.W.); B. brizantha = 25.0 ± 1.9 mg·g(-1) D.W.) and spring (B. decumbens = 49.4 ± 5.0 mg·g(-1) D.W.; B. brizantha = 27.9 ± 1.4 mg·g(-1) D.W.), although in the case of B. decumbens these values do not vary significantly among seasons.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27104314>Polyphyllin D induces apoptosis and differentiation in K562 human leukemia cells.</a></h2><p>Polyphyllin D, a compound derived from Paris polyphylla rhizoma, demonstrated strong anticancer activities in a previous study.

However, the mechanism of solanine-suppressing prostate cancer cell growth remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the inhibition mechanism of solanine on cancer development in vivo and in cultured human prostate cancer cell DU145 in vitro. Results show that solanine injection significantly suppresses the tumor cell growth in xenograft athymic nude mice. Solanine regulates the protein levels of cell cycle proteins, including Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, and P21 in vivo and in vitro. Also, in cultured DU145 cell, solanine significantly inhibits cell growth. Moreover, the administration of NAC, an active oxygen scavenger, markedly reduces solanine-induced cell death. Blockade of P38 MAPK kinase cannot suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS), but can suppress solanine-induced cell apoptosis. Also, inhibition of ROS by NAC inactivates P38 pathway. Taken together, the data suggest that inhibition of prostate cancer growth by solanine may be through blocking the expression of cell cycle proteins and inducing apoptosis via ROS and activation of P38 pathway. These findings indicate an attractive therapeutic potential of solanine for suppression of prostate cancer.© 2016 The Authors.

The development of therapeutic agents promoting both cytotoxicity and cell differentiation may provide opportunities to improve the clinical outcome. Dioscin-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells was identified through death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The formation of Bak and tBid, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were induced by dioscin suggesting the activation of intrinsic apoptotsis pathway. A functional analysis of transcription factors using transcription factor-DNA interaction array and IPA analysis demonstrated that dioscin induced a profound increase of protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), a critical factor for myeloid differentiation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay confirmed the increase of C/EBPα expression. Dioscin-induced differentiation was substantiated by an increase of CD11b protein expression and the induction of differentiation toward myelomonocytic/granulocytic lineages using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Moreover, both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay and IPA network enrichment analysis were proposed to dioscin action. In conclusion, the data suggest that dioscin exerts its antileukemic effect through the upregulation of both death ligands and death receptors and a crosstalk activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway with the collaboration of tBid and Bak formation. In addition, proteomics approach reveals an altered metabolic signature of dioscin-treated cells and the induction of differentiation of promyelocytes to granulocytes and monocytes in which the C/EBPα plays a key role.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483735>Dioscin attenuates high‑fat diet‑induced insulin resistance of adipose tissue through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance, as a common metabolic disorder, may be caused by diet‑induced obesity. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of dioscin on regulating insulin resistance of adipose tissue induced by a high‑fat diet (HFD). An animal model was established successfully using C57BL/6J mice with high‑fat feeding, followed by treatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dioscin through gavage for 18 weeks, and randomly divided into a control group, a HFD model group and a dioscin group treated with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dioscin for 12 weeks. Histopathological changes in adipose tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical parameters of the serum were also monitored, including glucose, insulin, total triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) and adipose insulin resistance (Adipo‑IR) levels. Expression of the mRNA and associated proteins of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1)/phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values of mice fed with a HFD were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). However, dioscin administration significantly decreased HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.05), suggesting the effects of dioscin on attenuating insulin resistance. RT‑qPCR results indicated that the associated genes of the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway were significantly downregulated by HFD compared with the control group (P<0.05), while dioscin significantly increased the expression of those genes compared with the control group (P<0.05). Similarly, the significant increase in phosphorylated (p‑)IRS‑1/IRS‑1 (P<0.05) and p‑Akt/Akt (P<0.05) values were substantially reversed by dioscin treatment.

Protodioscin is a saponin whose steroidal moiety has some similarities to plant steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids. To test the possibility that protodioscin acts as an agonist or antagonist of brassinosteroids or other plant growth regulators, we compared responses of the weed species Bidens pilosa L. to treatment with protodioscin, brassinosteroids, auxins (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Seeds were germinated and grown in agar containing protodioscin, dioscin, brassinolides, IAA and ABA. Root apex respiratory activity was measured with an oxygen electrode. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes activities were assessed. Protodioscin at 48-240 μm inhibited growth of B. pilosa seedlings. The steroidal hormone 24-epibrassinolide (0.1-5 μm) also inhibited growth of primary roots, but brassicasterol was inactive. IAA at higher concentrations (0.5-10.0 μm) strongly inhibited primary root length and fresh weight of stems. ABA inhibited all parameters of seedling growth and also seed germination. Respiratory activity of primary roots (KCN-sensitive and KCN-insensitive) was activated by protodioscin. IAA and ABA reduced KCN-insensitive respiration. The content of MDA in primary roots increased only after protodioscin treatment. All assayed compounds increased APx and POD activity, with 24-epibrassinolide being most active. The activity of CAT was stimulated by protodioscin and 24-epibrassinolide. The results revealed that protodioscin was toxic to B. pilosa through a mechanism not related to plant growth regulator signalling. Protodioscin caused a disturbance in mitochondrial respiratory activity, which could be related to overproduction of ROS and consequent cell membrane damage.© 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612829>Use Chou's 5-steps rule to reveal active compound and mechanism of Shuangshen Pingfei San on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Shuangshen Pingfei San (SPS) is the derivative from the classic formula Renshen Pingfei San in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Due to the low UV absorbance of the spirostanes, a mass spectrometric method in positive ion mode was developed for unambiguous identification of laxogenin and closely related compounds. To show the utility of the developed method, twelve dietary supplements labeled to contain 5α-hydroxy laxogenin or laxogenin as 5α-hydroxy laxogenin were analyzed as a proof-of-concept. Five supplements did not contain any 5α-hydroxy laxogenin, whereas in the remaining seven samples, spirostane-type contaminants were identified along with the labeled 5α-hydroxy laxogenin. The identity of some of these contaminants was established based on reference standards along with mass fragmentation patterns. One of the unlabeled contaminants was identified as the phytosteroid saponin, , a common starting precursor of several steroidal drugs. Several synthetic derivatives of  were identified in the eight products. These findings indicate that the labeled 5α-hydroxy laxogenin along with other spirostanes found in supplements are synthetic and signify a lack of quality controls. Additionally, an unlabeled, anabolic androgenic steroid, arimistane, an aromatase inhibitor, was also identified in one product. Laxogenin, was not detected in any of the samples analyzed during this investigation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Enhancing creatine (CRE) stability in aqueous solutions, such as with microencapsulation, represents innovation potential. Ten physically active male volunteers were randomly assigned in a double-blind design to either placebo (PLA) (3-g maltodextrin; n = 5) or microencapsulated CRE (3-g creatine monohydrate; n = 5) conditions. Experimental conditions involved ingestion of the samples in a 70-mL ready-to-drink format. CRE was delivered in a novel microencapsulation matrix material consisting entirely of hydrolyzed milk protein. Three hours after ingestion, plasma creatine concentrations were unchanged during PLA, and averaged ∼45 μM. During CRE, plasma creatine concentration peaked after 30 min at 101.6 ± 14.9 μM (p < 0.05), representing a 2.3-fold increase over PLA. Thereafter, plasma creatine concentration gradually trended downwards but remained significantly elevated (∼50% above resting levels) 3 hr after ingestion. These results demonstrate that the microencapsulated form of creatine monohydrate reported herein remains bioavailable when delivered in aqueous conditions, and has potential utility in ready-to-drink formulations for creatine supplementation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246240> inhibits superoxide generation in FMLP-activated mouse neutrophils via multiple pathways.</a></h2><p> possesses anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties.

However, the effect of it on glioblastoma is unclear. In this study, dioscin significantly inhibited proliferation of C6 glioma cells and caused reactive  species (ROS) generation and Ca²⁺ release. ROS accumulation affected levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, glutathione disulfide and glutathione, and caused cell apoptosis. In addition, ROS generation caused mitochondrial damage including structural changes, increased mitochondrial permeability transition and decreased mitochondria membrane potential, which led to the release of cytochrome C, nuclear translation of programmed cell death-5 and increased activities of caspase-3,9. Simultaneously, dioscin down-regulated protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, up-regulated expression of Bak, Bax, Bid and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Also,  stress induced S-phase arrest of cancer cells by way of regulating expression of DNA Topo I, p53, CDK2 and Cyclin A and caused DNA damage. In a rat allograft model, dioscin significantly inhibited tumor size and extended the life cycle of the rats. In conclusion, dioscin shows noteworthy anti-cancer activity on glioblastoma cells by promoting ROS accumulation, inducing DNA damage and activating mitochondrial signal pathways.

To evaluate the anticonvulsant action of protodioscin (PDSN) in experiments with animals with pilocarpine-induced convulsions. We assessed the activity of PDSN in pilocarpine induced seizures in combination with different agents which are acting via diverse receptors, such as atropine, memantine, nimodipine, diazepam, and flumazenil, to determine the exact receptors responsible for the action of PDSN. Furthermore, the level of antioxidant markers was investigated in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex in mice to define the antioxidant action of PDSN. The effects of PDSN on proapoptotic markers (i.e., Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3) was investigated via western blot analysis. PDSN significantly enhanced latency to the first convulsion and survival compared to the group treated with pilocarpine alone. Moreover, PDSN improved animal survival, and subjects experiencing no convulsions. Striatal glutamate and aspartate levels were not modified, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) levels increased, as a result of treatment with PDSN. The results suggest that the anticonvulsive action of PDSN is dependent on inhibitory amino acids. PDSN treatment also significantly decreased nitrite levels in the blood and brain cortex compared to the normal control. In the western blot analysis, PDSN exerted its neuroprotective effect via the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax and caspase-3.

In 2016, 25,700 persons suffered from coronary heart disease (CHD) and 25% of these died within 28 days. The present study investigated whether dioscin may exert protective effects against CHD‑induced heart apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in a pig model and the potential underlying mechanisms. Adult pigs were used to establish a CHD model group and 80 mg/kg dioscin was administered for 4 weeks. Histological analysis and measurement of serum levels of heart injury markers demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin markedly alleviated CHD, while left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular systolic internal diameter measurements indicated that 80 mg/kg dioscin also increased heart function in the CHD pig model. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin significantly reduced protein levels of apoptosis markers in the heart of CHD model pigs, including Bcl‑2‑associated X and caspase‑3, potentially via the suppression of poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP)/p53 expression. Additionally, the results of ELISA and western blotting demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in CHD model pigs through the promotion of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression and the suppression of PARP/p53 and p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression.

In the present paper, ethanol-induced acute and chronic  damage rat models were used, and the results showed that dioscin significantly alleviated  steatosis, reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol and malondialdehyde, and increased the levels of high-density lipoprotein, superoxide dismutase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. Transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assays showed that dioscin prevented mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations and apoptosis caused by ethanol. In addition, dioscin significantly inhibited ethanol-induced cytochrome P450 2E1 activation, down-regulated the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases phosphorylation, inhibited the expressions of nuclear factor kappa B, glucose regulated protein 78, activating transcription factor 6 and alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 to attenuate oxidative damage, decreased the expressions of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6, and down-regulated the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins including p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, poly (ADP-ribose)-polymerase and cytokeratin-18. Further investigation indicated that dioscin markedly increased the expressions of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α and its target genes including medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I and acyl-CoA oxidase to advance  acid β-oxidation, up-regulated the expressions of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 5, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to promote  acid metabolism, and down-regulated the expressions of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 to accelerate TG synthesis.

This anticontractile effect of PVAT is lost under conditions of obesity. The central mechanism underlying this PVAT dysfunction in obesity is likely to be an 'obesity triad' (consisting of PVAT hypoxia, inflammation and oxidative stress) that leads to the impairment of PVAT-derived vasoregulators. The production of hydrogen sulfide, NO and adiponectin by PVAT is reduced in obesity, whereas the vasodilator response to leptin is impaired (vascular leptin resistance). Strikingly, the vasodilator response to acetylcholine is reduced only in PVAT-containing, but not in PVAT-free thoracic aorta isolated from diet-induced obese mice, indicating a unique role for PVAT in obesity-induced vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, PVAT dysfunction has also been observed in small arteries isolated from the gluteal/visceral fat biopsy samples of obese individuals. Therefore, PVAT may represent a new therapeutic target for vascular complications in obesity. A number of approaches are currently being tested under experimental conditions. Potential therapeutic strategies improving PVAT function include  reduction, enhancing PVAT hydrogen sulfide release (e.g. rosiglitazone, atorvastatin and cannabinoid CB receptor agonists) and NO production (e.g. arginase inhibitors), inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inhibition of inflammation with melatonin or cytokine antagonists, activators of AMP-activated kinase (e.g. metformin, resveratrol and ) and adiponectin releasers or expression enhancers.This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

For the prediction of polyphyllin I, II, VI, and VII, the quantitative results are satisfactory, with a high value for the determination coefficient (R ) and low values for the root-mean-square error of estimation (RMSEE), root-mean-square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), and root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP). In conclusion, FT-IR combined with chemometrics is a promising method to accurately discriminate samples of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis harvested in different years and determine the content of polyphyllin I, II, VI, and VII in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087904>[Protective effect of  on chondrocytes mediated by JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in mice with osteoarthritis].</a></h2><p> To investigate the effect of  (Dgn) on chondrocytes and its relation to JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in mice with osteoarthritis (OA).

After 4 weeks of treatment, the histopathological changes of cartilage tissue were observed by toluidine blue staining under light microscopy and the ultrastructure of chondrocytes was observed under electron microscopy. The primarily cultured chondrocytes of OA mice were randomly divided into 4 groups:(1) OA group, (2) Dgn group, (3) Dgn+AG490 group, (4) AG490 group. The expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) were detected by Western blotting, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was detected using colorimetric method.  The morphological observation showed that the chondrocytes of OA group presented considerable pathological changes, while the chondrocytes in OA+Dgn group maintained intact membrane. Electron microscopy observation found obvious injury in cartilage tissues of OA group, while that in OA+Dgn group remained smooth.

Western blot analysis was used to assay the expression of PRDX1 and apoptotic proteins in the cells. Reactive  species (ROS) formation was measured by 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA).Dioscin considerably inhibited the proliferation of MiaPaCa-2 cells in vitro. The inhibitory action was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of intracellular ROS detected with DCFH-DA were highly increased after dioscin treatment. The flow cytometry analysis using annexin V-PI staining showed that compared with the apoptotic rate of control group [(3.5 ± 0.7)%], 2.5 µmol/L and 5 µmol/L dioscin induced apoptosis in (28.4 ± 0.9)% and (49.6 ± 2.7)% MiaPaCa-2 cells, and Western blot analysis showed that apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expressions were increased and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression was decreased. In addition, these effects could be blocked by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration, and the apoptotic rates decreased to (10.8 ± 2.3)% and (18.8 ± 3.0)%, respectively. We further observed the decrease of PRDX1 expression after dioscin treatment. Moreover, after PRDX1 overexpression, dioscin treatment no longer induced high levels of ROS and apoptosis, and the apoptotic rate was decreased to (21.3 ± 5.9)%.Dioscin can down-regulate the PRDX1 expression, and then induces ROS-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15914274>Methyl protodioscin induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis in K562 cells with the hyperpolarization of mitochondria.</a></h2><p>Methyl protodioscin is a furostanol bisglycoside with antitumor properties. The present study investigated its effects on human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that methyl protodioscin caused distinct G2/M arrest, with the appearance of polyploidy population. The levels of cyclin B1 decreased, whereas Cdc2 kept at a steady level. Subsequent apoptosis after G2/M blockage was demonstrated through DNA fragmentation and the annexin V staining assay.

We explored the possibility of using Paris saponin I as an agent to sensitize gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, and examined the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Growth inhibition was detected by MTT assay. The cell cycle and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry and Annexin V/PI staining. The P21waf1/cip1, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 protein expression were detected using Western blot analysis. RESULTS The results revealed that PSI sensitized gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, with low toxicity. The IC50 value of cisplatin in SGC-7901 cell lines was decreased when combined with PSI. PSI promoted cisplatin-induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in a cisplatin concentration-dependent manner. Bcl-2 protein expression decreased, but Bax, caspase-3, and P21waf1/cip1 protein expression increased with PSI treatment.

However, the low efficiency of the gene transfer technique can limit its application. Our preliminary data showed that dioscin, a glucoside saponin, could upregulate the expression of connexins Cx26 and Cx43, major components of gap junctions, in melanoma cells. We hypothesized that dioscin may increase the bystander effect of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) through increasing the formation of gap junctions. Further analysis showed that dioscin indeed could increase the gap junctional intercellular communication in B16 melanoma cells, resulting in more efficient GCV-induced bystander killing in B16tk cells. By contrast, overexpression of dominant negative Cx43 impaired the cell-cell communication of B16 cells and subsequently weakened the bystander effect of HSV-tk/GCV gene therapy. In vivo, combination treatment with dioscin and GCV of tumor-bearing mice with 30% positive B16tk cells and 70% wild-type B16 cells caused a significant reduction in tumor volume and  compared to treatment with GCV or dioscin alone.

Aberrant expression of tumor suppressor genes is closely associated with susceptibility to PAH. We hypothesized that α-solanine, a glycoalkaloid found in members of the nightshade family known to have antitumor activity in different cancers, reverses experimental PAH by activating the tumor suppressor-axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2).We investigated the effects of α-solanine on PASMC proliferation and apoptosis by using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine proliferation assay, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 staining, TUNEL and Anexine V assays. Scratch wound healing and tube formation assays were also used to study migration of endothelial cells. In vitro, we demonstrated, using cultured human PASMC from PAH patients, that α-solanine reversed dysfunctional AXIN2, β-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2 signaling, whereas restored [Ca]i, IL-6 and IL-8, contributing to the decrease of PAH-PASMC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.

Although external beam radiation and enucleation are effective to control retinoblastoma, eye salvage and vision preservation are still significant challenges. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a natural compound extracted from Paris polyphylla rhizomes, has a wide range of activities against many types of cancers. However, the potential effect of this herbal compound on retinoblastoma has not yet been investigated.In the present study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of PPI on human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results indicated that PPI treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase and induced cell apoptosis of Y79 cells through the mitochondrial- dependent intrinsic pathway. Moreover, p53 is involved in PPI-induced cytotoxicity in human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells. Exposure to 10 μM PPI for 48 h dramatically induced the expression levels of p53, phosphorylated- p53 and acetylated-p53. Furthermore, blockade of p53 expression effectively attenuated PPI-induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in Y-79 cells.These results demonstrated that PPI exhibits anti-proliferation effect on human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells through modulating p53 expression, stabilization and activation.

EMT, a crucial cellular process that occurs during cancer progression and metastasis, has been reported to promote drug resistance in several previous studies. Consequently, ongoing research has been focused on exploring therapeutic options for preventing EMT to delay or reverse drug resistance. Polyphyllin I (PPI) is a natural component extracted from Paris polyphylla that displays anti-cancer properties. In the present study, we investigated whether PPI can be used in the cisplatin (DDP)-resistant human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/DDP. The results demonstrated that PPI treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and EMT. TGF-β1 is known to promote EMT-induced metastasis in numerous tumor types. PPI inhibited the invasion of TGFβ1-induced SGC7901/DDP cells in vitro. PPI also increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of E-cadherin but decreased the expression levels of vimentin. Further examination of the mechanism revealed that the CIP2A/PP2A/Akt pathway is partially involved in this regulation of EMT-related biomarkers and invasion. Furthermore, xenograft tests also confirmed the antitumor effects of PPI in vivo. We propose that PPI could be developed as a candidate drug for treating cancer invasion and migration.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Monolayers were apically exposed for 60 min to the dietary surfactants solanine and chaconine (SC, potato glycoalkaloids, 0-0.25 mM), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, industrial contaminant, 0-0.8 mM), and sucrose monolaurate (SML, food emulsifier E 473, 0-2.0 mM) separately and as a mixture. Dose-response modelling of TEER EC showed that SC were 2.7- and 12-fold more potent than PFOS and SML, respectively. The mixture was composed of 1 molar unit SC, 2.7 units PFOS and 12 units SML ("SC TEER equivalent" proportions 1:1:1).

In response to DSG stimulation, ERβ bound with RXRα and dissociated RXRα from PPARγ, leading to the reduction of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of DSG on adipocyte differentiation and demonstrate that ERβ-exerted regulation of PPARγ expression and activity is critical for DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study is aimed to explore the interaction of fenugreek seed extract (FSE) and HPT (hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid) axis in context of leptin secretion which have important role in normal and type-1 diabetic subjects. FSE (confirmed to contain trigonelline, , 4 hydroxyisoleucine) was gavaged (0.25 gm/kg /day) to normal and alloxan-induced type-1 diabetic rats for 4 weeks. Expression of hypothalamic prepro-TRH (Thyrotropin releasing hormone) mRNA, serum levels of TRH, TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone), fT, fT, insulin, leptin, glucose; thyroperoxidase activity and growth of thyroid gland, food intake, adiposity index were also studied FSE significantly down regulated prepro-TRH mRNA expression; decreased serum TRH, TSH, fT, fT levels, and regressed thyroid gland in FSE-fed normal and diabetic rats than those observed in normal diet-fed control and diabetic rats. FSE decreased (p<0.005-0.001) adiposity index and leptin secretion, increased food intake and  in all FSE-fed rats. FSE improved insulin secretion, decreased glucose level but impaired HPT axis in diabetic rats, indicating insulin-independent central hypothyroidism. Results suggested that the dominant signal to hypothalamus suppressing HPT axis is the fall in leptin level which i resulted from decreased adiposity index following FSE feeding. Fenugreek simultaneously having hypoglycaemic and hypothyroidal actions raises questions whether it can be safely used to treat diabetes and/or hyperthyroidism as was suggested by many workers.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463020>Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Identifies Putative Genes Involved in Dioscin Biosynthesis in Dioscorea zingiberensis.</a></h2><p>Dioscorea zingiberensis is a perennial herb native to China. The rhizome of D. zingiberensis has long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat rheumatic arthritis. Dioscin is the major bioactive ingredient conferring the medicinal property described in Chinese pharmacopoeia. Several previous studies have suggested cholesterol as the intermediate to the biosynthesis of dioscin, however, the biosynthetic steps to dioscin after cholesterol remain unknown. In this study, a comprehensive D. zingiberensis transcriptome derived from its leaf and rhizome was constructed. Based on the annotation using various public databases, all possible enzymes in the biosynthetic steps to cholesterol were identified. In the late steps beyond cholesterol, cholesterol undergoes site-specific oxidation by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and glycosylation by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) to yield dioscin. From the D. zingiberensis transcriptome, a total of 485 unigenes were annotated as CYPs and 195 unigenes with a sequence length above 1000 bp were annotated as UGTs. Transcriptomic comparison revealed 165 CYP annotated unigenes correlating to dioscin biosynthesis in the plant. Further phylogenetic analysis suggested that among those CYP candidates four of them would be the most likely candidates involved in the biosynthetic steps from cholesterol to dioscin. Additionally, from the UGT annotated unigenes, six of them were annotated as 3-O-UGTs and two of them were annotated as rhamnosyltransferases, which consisted of potential UGT candidates involved in dioscin biosynthesis. To further explore the function of the UGT candidates, two 3-O-UGT candidates, named Dz3GT1 and Dz3GT2, were cloned and functionally characterized. Both Dz3GT1 and Dz3GT2 were able to catalyze a C3-glucosylation activity on . In conclusion, this study will facilitate our understanding of dioscin biosynthesis pathway and provides a basis for further mining the genes involved in dioscin biosynthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913072>α-Chaconine isolated from a Solanum tuberosum L. cv Jayoung suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory mediators via AP-1 inactivation in RAW 264.7 macrophages and protects mice from endotoxin shock.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of α-chaconine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and in LPS-induced septic mice. α-Chaconine inhibited the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at the transcriptional level, and attenuated the transcriptional activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) by reducing the translocation and phosphorylation of c-Jun. α-Chaconine also suppressed the phosphorylation of TGF-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which lies upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7)/Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. JNK knockdown using siRNA prevented the α-chaconine-mediated inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators. In a sepsis model, pretreatment with α-chaconine reduced the LPS-induced lethality and the mRNA and production levels of pro-inflammatory mediators by inhibiting c-Jun activation. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of α-chaconine are associated with the suppression of AP-1, and support its possible therapeutic role for the treatment of sepsis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although multiple therapeutic approaches are available, the prognosis of patients with HCC remains poor. Dioscin is a natural steroid saponin that presents in various plants. The anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic effects have been extensively reported. However, the effect of dioscin on HCC remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the anti-HCC properties of dioscin in vitro and in vivo.MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay was used to analyze the growth inhibition activity of Dioscin in human cell lines, Bel-7402, HepG2, Lovo, and EAhy926. Antitumor activity through induction of apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) analysis with Hochest33342 and PI labeling, and DNA fragmentation analysis. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins tumor protein p53 (TP53), BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and Caspase 3 (CASP3) was measured by Western blot. Nude mice bearing Bel-7402 were administered intraperitoneally at different doses of dioscin and 5-FU (5-Fluorouracil) treatment was used as a control. Tumor volume and tumor  of each mouse were then measured.We demonstrated that Dioscin inhibited proliferation of HCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Dioscin also significantly induced morphological changes during death by apoptosis and increased DNA damage of Bel-7402 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that Dioscin displayed anticancer activity via up-regulating expression of TP53, BAX and CASP3 protein, as well as down-regulating BCL2 in Bel-7402 cells. Notably, the in vivo anticancer activity of Dioscin was further assessed and achieved greater inhibition efficiency at the concentration increased to 24mg/kg/day than 5-FU at dose of 10mg/kg/day in nude mice bearing Bel-7402 cells.Dioscin inhibited tumor growth via inducing apoptosis, which was accompanied by altered expression of apoptotic pathway proteins, such as TP53, BAX, BCL2 and CASP3.

However, the underling mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, it was identified that dioscin (0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 25 µg/ml) promoted MC3T3‑E1 cell proliferation and differentiation in a dose‑dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that dioscin regulated autophagy‑associated protein expression in MC3T3‑E1 cells; it promoted the expression of apoptosis stimulated protein of p53‑2 (ASPP2), and inhibited the expression of nuclear factor (NF)‑κβ and microtubule‑associated protein 1 light chain 3β, in a concentration‑dependent manner. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) was used to inhibit the activation of NF‑κB and examine the effect of the ASPP2/NF‑κβ pathway on osteoblastic cell differentiation, proliferation and autophagy. It was identified that CAPE reversed the regulation of dioscin on osteoblastic cell differentiation, proliferation and autophagy.

It was primarily reported to have toxic effects in humans. However, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of α-solanine. Most of these studies have shown activation of apoptosis as the underlying mechanism in antitumor activity of α-solanine. In this study, we report α-solanine as a potential inducer of autophagy, which may act synergistically or in parallel with apoptosis to exert its cytotoxic effect. Induction of autophagy was demonstrated by several assays including electron microscopy, immunoblotting of autophagy markers and immunofluorescence for LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1) light chain-3) puncta. α-Solanine-induced autophagic flux was demonstrated by additionally enhanced--turnover of LC3-II and--accumulation of LC3-specific puncta after co-incubation of cells with either of the autophagolysosome inhibitors--chloroquine and--bafilomycin A1. We also demonstrated α-solanine-induced oxidative damage in regulating autophagy where pre-incubation of cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger resulted in suppression of CM-H2DCFDA (5 (and 6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester) fluorescence as well as decrease in LC3-II turnover. α-Solanine treatment caused an increase in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (BiP, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), X-box-binding protein 1, PERK, inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease 1, ATF4 and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-homologous protein) suggesting activation of unfolded protein response pathway. Moreover, we found downregulation of phosphorylated Akt (Thr308 and Ser473), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448 and Ser2481) and 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) by α-solanine implying suppression of the Akt/mTOR pathway.

The studies reported here have attempted to further characterize the anti-cancer activity of a mixture of steroidal saponins: balanitin-6 (28%) and balanitin-7 (72%) isolated from Balanites aegyptiaca kernels. The balanitin-6 and -7 mixture (henceforth referred to as bal6/7) has demonstrated appreciable anti-cancer effects in human cancer cell lines in vitro. Bal6/7 displayed higher anti-proliferative activity than etoposide and oxaliplatin, although the mixture was appreciably less active than SN38 and markedly less active than taxol. Bal6/7 demonstrated highest activity against A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (IC(50), 0.3 microM) and U373 glioblastoma (IC(50), 0.5 microM) cell lines. The current study has further indicated that bal6/7 is more a cytotoxic compound than a cytostatic one. However, Bal6/7 does not appear to mediate its anti-proliferative effects by inducing apoptotic cell death. Computer-assisted cellular imaging has revealed that bal6/7 does not induce detergent-like effects in A549 NSCLC and U373 glioblastoma unlike certain saponins. Furthermore there is indication that its in vitro anti-cancer activities result at least partly from depletion of [ATP]i, leading in turn to major disorganization of actin cytoskeleton, ultimately resulting in the impairment of cancer cell proliferation and migration. In contrast to a number of natural products acting as anti-cancer agents, bal6/7 does not induce an increase in intra-cellular reactive  species.

This overview comprehensively surveys and consolidates worldwide efforts to define the following aspects of these natural compounds: (a) their prevalence in the three foods; (b) their chemistry and structure-activity relationships; (c) the reported factors (biomarkers, signaling pathways) associated with apoptosis of bone, breast, cervical, , gastric, glioblastoma, leukemia, liver, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, pancreas, prostate, and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines in vitro and the in vivo inhibition of tumor formation and growth in fish and mice and in human skin cancers; and (d) future research needs. The described results may make it possible to better relate the structures of the active compounds to their health-promoting function, individually, in combination, and in food, and allow the consumer to select glycoalkaloid-containing food with the optimal content of nontoxic beneficial compounds. The described findings are expected to be a valuable record and resource for further investigation of the health benefits of food-related natural compounds.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085554>Biotransformation of  by Rat Intestinal Microflora and Cardioprotective Effects of .</a></h2><p>Studying the biotransformation of natural products by intestinal microflora is an important approach to understanding how and why some medicines-particularly natural medicines-work. In many cases, the active components are generated by metabolic activation. This is critical for drug research and development. As a means to explore the therapeutic mechanism of  (DN), a medicinal plant used to treat myocardial ischemia (MI), metabolites generated by intestinal microflora from DN were identified, and the cardioprotective efficacy of these metabolites was evaluated. Our results demonstrate that  is the main metabolite produced by rat intestinal microflora from DN. Further, our results show that  protects the myocardium against ischemic insult through increasing enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels  and by decreasing oxidative stress damage.

The results showed that dioscin significantly restored fructose-induced renal injury by decreasing the levels of Cr, BUN, and rehabilitating histopathological changes. In addition, dioscin markedly adjusted the levels of MDA, SOD and GSH-Px, reduced ROS level in renal tissue, and decreased the levels of TG, FFA, α-SMA and COL1A. Mechanistic study showed that dioscin significantly up-regulated the expression levels of Sirt3, SOD2, and then suppressed inflammation by decreasing the expression levels of NF-kB, HMGB1, c-Jun, c-Fos, COX2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Furthermore, dioscin-caused high levels of Sirt3 and SOD2 attenuated oxidative stress by regulating the expression levels of Nrf2, GST, Keap1, regulated lipid  by controlling the expression levels of SREBP-1c, SCD-1, FASn, ACC, CPT1, and adjusted TGF-β1/Smad signal to inhibit renal fibrosis. In summary, dioscin showed protective effects against fructose-induced renal damage via adjusting Sirt3-mediated oxidative stress, renal fibrosis, lipid  and inflammation, which should be considered as one candidate to treat renal injury in the future. We also suggest that the patients with renal injury can take more Shanyao for the therapy and treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Additional tests assessed the relationship between leaf position and the concentration of saponins (plant compounds which can provide protection from insect herbivores) and examined the effect of defoliation on switchgrass dry mass. Survival to adulthood was similar when larvae were reared on field-grown leaves of switchgrass and corn. However, lower larval mass (10 d) and delayed development of M. unipuncta (to pupation, adult emergence) suggest switchgrass is an inferior host relative to corn. When fed field-grown miscanthus, no larvae survived 10 d. Few differences were noted between switchgrass and corn grown under controlled (laboratory) conditions, but M. unipuncta survival seemed to decline rapidly when larvae were fed the fourth and fifth leaves of switchgrass. Switchgrass leaf samples collected from different leaf positions and stages of tiller maturity showed up to 10-fold differences in the concentration of the saponin protodioscin, with the greatest concentrations in the fourth and fifth leaves. However, other saponins showed an opposite pattern, indicating the role of protodioscin on insect development should be tested in isolation (e.g., by addition of the purified compound to an artificial diet). Defoliation trials indicated that extremely high M. unipuncta populations may be necessary to cause any significant reduction in switchgrass biomass. Collectively, results suggest M. unipuncta may not present a significant risk to biomass production in switchgrass, but that the spring emergence of switchgrass provides an alternate host for M. unipuncta before colonizing annual food and feed crops.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671458>Role of the Death Receptor and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Signaling  in Polyphyllin I-Regulated Apoptosis of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Polyphyllin has been reported to exhibit anticancer effects against various types of cancer via the proapoptotic signaling pathway. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the endoplasmic reticulum stress and death receptor signaling  in PPI-induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Analysis demonstrated that PPI could significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Investigation into the molecular mechanism of PPI indicated that PPI notably mediated ER stress activation via IRE-1 overexpression and activation of the caspase-12 to protect HepG2 cells against apoptosis. In addition, PPI markedly induced the expression of death receptors signaling -associated factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1/TNF- and FAS/FASL. Additionally, suppression of the death receptor signaling  with a caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, revealed an increase in the death rate and apoptotic rate of HepG2 cells. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that the ER stress and death receptor signaling  were associated with PPI-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis; however, endoplasmic reticulum stress may serve a protective role in this process. The combination of PPI and Z-IETD-FMK may activate necroptosis, which enhances apoptosis.

The product was said to be obtained from adrenal glands collected in a huge amount in Argentina and transported by U-boats to Germany. The U. S. and the U. K. exerted their war efforts by setting up urgent research projects to produce similar products. The war ended in 1945, however, before the goal was achieved. The German rumor turned out to be groundless. Cortisone acquired fame in 1949 as "a miracle drug" for the relief of rheumatic pain. Its therapeutic discovery was an outcome of the untenable assumption that rheumatoid arthritis patients must have suffered from adrenal insufficiency and hormone deficiency. The war efforts have led to successful syntheses of cortisone after the war, and its industrial production has reduced its cost drastically from $200.00 per gram in 1949 to $10.00 in 1951. To overcome the cumbersome synthetic routes for cortisone, natural product sources were sought as possible starting materials, but without much success. A microbiological transformation of steroidal compounds was developed in 1952 to introduce an  function into the molecular position 11 by a microorganism found at a window of a laboratory. The fermentation process required progesterone which found its timely supply in Mexico. The cost of progesterone went down from $2.00 per gram to $0.15 and that of cortisone further from $10.00 to $3.50 in 1955. An ample supply of cortisone at an affordable price was admirably achieved by the combination of progesterone derived from  of the Mexican yam and a microbiological oxidation process developed by a chance discovery of suitable organisms.

Lanosterol synthase (LAS) and cycloartenol synthase (CAS) are phylogenetically related enzymes. Cycloartenol is the accepted precursor leading to cholesterol and phytosterols, and in potato, to steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) biosynthesis. LAS was also shown to synthesize some plant sterols, albeit at trace amounts, questioning its role in sterol homeostasis. Presently, a potato LAS-related gene (StLAS-like) was identified and its activity verified in a yeast complementation assay. A transgenic approach with targeted gene expression and  profiling of sterols and SGAs was used. Analyses of StLAS-like transcript levels and StLAS-like-promoter::GUS reporter assays indicated specific expression in tuber flesh tissue. Overexpression of Arabidopsis AtLAS in leaves where the endogenic StLAS-like is not expressed, resulted with increased SGA level and reduced phytosterol level, while in the tuber flesh SGA level was reduced. StLAS-like expression only in tuber flesh may explain the differential accumulation of SGAs in commercial cultivars-low in tubers, high in leaves.

Black tea contains a large amount of the flavonoids catechins especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative capacity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of DT intake on inflammatory cytokines, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and  biomarkers in T2DM.The study included 50 patients with T2DM. The patients had received 3 cups (600ml) of DT extract or placebo (PL) extract per day during a period of 12 weeks. Intracellular cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) as well as the glycemic and lipid profiles were measured at baseline and after the treatment period. The active constituents of the medicinal plants included in DT were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).Ingestion of DT suppressed CD4+ T cell expression of IL-1β and Il-8 (p<0.05) and up-regulated the expression of IL-10 and the Treg/IL-17 ratio (p<0.05) which was not shown in PL. A significant decrease in HbA1c and LDL was observed at the end of the study period (p<0.05) in DT. The GC/MS analyses of DT indicated the presence of lupeol, β-Amyrin and β-sitosterol. Also analyses of individual herbs showed the presence of higher levels of lupeol and β-Amyrin in Nuga Ficus bengalensis and β-sitosterol in the Attikka Ficus racemosa, indicating that the active ingredients of DT are concentrated in these two herbs.The present study provides evidence that DT has hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic properties. Interestingly, DT has anti-inflammatory effects. These properties are attributed to the flavonoids, triterpenes and phytosterol contents of the tea.

Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial dynamics are closely implicated in carcinogenesis including CRC. Paris Saponin II (PSII), a major steroidal saponin extracted from Rhizoma Paris polyphylla, has emerged as a potential anticancer agent. However, the effects of PSII on CRC and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we found PSII induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in HT 29 and HCT 116 cells, and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. PSII inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and mitochondrial translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) by dephosphorylating Drp1 at Ser616, leading to the suppression of mitochondrial fission. PSII also suppressed NF-κB activation as a result of the inhibition of IKKβ and p65 translocation. Drp1 knockdown remarkably downregulated the nuclear expression of p65 and its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc in HCT 116 cell, confirming the link between mitochondrial fission and NF-κB pathway. Silencing of Drp 1 enhanced the inhibitory effects of PSII on p65 phosphorylation and the expressions of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, revealing that the inhibitory effects of PSII on cyclin D1 and c-Myc were relevant in the suppression of Drp1 and NF-κB activation. An in vivo study demonstrated PSII remarkably decreased the xenograft tumor size and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Drp1 at Ser616.

Furthermore, a full scan of all the possible locations of the diosgenyl moiety in relation to the sugar ring in the target compounds was done. The PM3 optimization results indicate that diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside exists as a mixture of many rotamers. Of these, ccw conformers as well as the -ac orientation of the aglycone (ca -100° for torsion angle φ) are preferred. In the case of the N-protonated glucoside one rotamer is dominant in the mixture (population>60%). Only the cw arrangement is stable in the protonated form, because of steric and electronic repulsion between the charged ammonium group and the hydrogen atom of the neighbouring 3-OH group. The gauche-trans (gt) orientation of the CH2OH group is favourable to both neutral and protonated forms of diosgenyl glucosides at the PM3 level. DFT studies also predict conformational mixtures for both neutral and protonated forms of simplified diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosides. These investigations showed unequivocally the preference for the ccw arrangement over cw, and that values of angle φ concur with the exo-anomeric effect. The B3LYP functional predicts the greater stability of the gt and tg orientations for the neutral and protonated analogues respectively.

The cell proliferation profiles and the cytotoxicity studies were performed by Real-Time Cell Analyzer (xCELLigence) and compared with Sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay. The effects of α-chaconine (2.5, 5, 10 µM), α-solanine (20, 30, 50 µM), API-1 (25 µM) and MPP (20 µM) effects on Akt (Ser473) and ERα (Ser167) expressions evaluated by Western blot and qPCR method. Their IC values were as α-chaconine (4.72 µM) < MPP (20.01 µM) < α-solanine (26.27 µM) < API-1 (56.67 µM). 10 μM α-chaconine and 20, 30 and 50 μM α-solanine were effective in decreasing p-Akt(Ser473)/Akt ratio compared to positive control API-1. When the p-ERα/ERα ratios were evaluated, it was observed that α-chaconine (2.5, 5, 10 μM) and α-solanine (50 μM) were as effective as the specific ERα inhibitor MPP in reducing the ratio of p-ERα/ERα compared to the control group. In conclusion, it has been shown that the proliferation of α-chaconine and α-solanine in human endometrial carcinoma cells reduces the expression and activity of the Akt and ERα signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871063>Dioscorea esculenta-induced increase in muscle sex steroid hormones is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity in a type 2 diabetes rat model.</a></h2><p>The effects of chronic Dioscorea esculenta administration and exercise training on muscle sex steroid hormone levels and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes rats was assessed. Twenty-week-old male Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were assigned randomly to the control, D. esculenta treatment, D. esculenta with 5α-reductase inhibitor treatment, or the exercise training groups (running at 25 m/min for 1 h, 5 d/wk; n = 10 each group). Eight weeks of D. esculenta treatment or exercise training significantly attenuated the increase in plasma insulin and fasting glucose levels. Plasma and muscle concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the expression of 5α-reductase increased significantly in the D. esculenta-treated and exercise training groups, and both treatments led to the upregulation of glucose transporter-4 translocation with concomitant increases in PKB and PKC-ζ/λ phosphorylation. Furthermore, the glucose  clearance rate, which represents insulin sensitivity, increased significantly in both the D. esculenta-treated and exercise training groups. These effects were suppressed by administration of the DHT synthetic inhibitor.

In the present study, in vivo test of Dox-induced nephrotoxicity in rats and in vitro model in NRK-52E cells were developed. The results showed that dioscin significantly attenuated cell injury, obviously reduced ROS level in vitro, and markedly decreased the levels of BUN, Cr, MDA, and notably increased the levels of SOD, GSH and GSH-Px in rats. Mechanistic studies showed that dioscin significantly increased the levels of p-AMPKα, Nrf2, HO-1 and GST by activation of FXR against oxidative stress. In addition, dioscin suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and HMGB1, and subsequently decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α against inflammation. These results were further validated by knockdown of FXR using siRNA silencing, and abrogation of FXR using NDB (a FXR inhibitor) in NRK-52E cells, and the results suggested that the protective effect of dioscin against Dox- induced nephrotoxicity via adjusting FXR-mediated signal to suppress oxidative stress and inflammation.

In spite of aggressive treatment, osteosarcoma has a high mortality rate with minimal improvements in survival over past few decades. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a component in the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Paris polyphylla Smith, has been shown to have anti-tumor properties. However, its mechanism as an anti-osteosarcoma agent has not been well elucidated. In this study, we found that PPI suppressed osteosarcoma cell viability, arrested cell cycle in G/M phase, induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion and migration of osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, PPI significantly suppressed intratibial primary tumor growth in xenograft orthotopic mouse model without any obvious side effects. These therapeutic efficacies were associated with inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, as PPI treatment decreased the amount of p-GSK-3β, leading to down-regulated levels of active β-catenin. PPI induced inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability was abolished upon addition of GSK-3β specific inhibitor, CHIR99021, while PPI induced inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability and migration were potentiated by β-catenin silencing. These findings suggested that, in vitro and in vivo, PPI treatment inhibited osteosarcoma, at least in part, via the inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

With the aim of obtaining more hydroxylated steroid precursors it is necessary to probe the steroidal substrate diversity of these BM3 variants. Here, three purified BM3 variants were first incubated with eight steroids, including testosterone (TES), methyltestosterone (MT), cholesterol, β-sitosterol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), , pregnenolone and ergosterol.

Much work has linked the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to the emergence of drug resistance, consequently, ongoing research has been focused on exploring the therapeutic options to reverse EMT for delaying or preventing drug resistance. Polyphyllin I (PPI) is a natural compound isolated from Paris polyphylla rhizomes and displayed anti-cancer properties. In the current work, we aimed to testify whether PPI could reverse EMT and overcome acquired EGFR-TKI resistance. We exposed HCC827 lung adenocarcinoma cells to erlotinib which resulted in acquired resistance with strong features of EMT. PPI effectively restored drug sensitivity of cells that obtained acquired resistance. PPI reversed EMT and decreased interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/STAT3) signaling pathway activation in erlotinib-resistant cells. Moreover, addition of IL-6 partially abolished the sensitization response of PPI. Furthermore, co-treatment of erlotinib and PPI completed abrogation of tumor growth in xenografts, which was associated with EMT reversal. In conclusion, PPI serves as a novel solution to conquer the EGFR-TKI resistance of NSCLC via reversing EMT by modulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Based on these observations, we conclude that upregulation of Mul1 in rat brain contributes to cerebral I/R injury via suppression of SOD2 and that MPD protects rat brain from I/R injury through a mechanism involving regulation of Mul1/SOD2 pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, its activity on colorectal cancer is still unknown. The present work showed that dioscin significantly inhibited cell proliferation on human HCT-116 colon cancer cells, and affected Ca(2+) release and ROS generation. The content of nitric oxide (NO) and its producer inducible NO synthase (iNOS) associated with DNA damage and aberrant cell signaling were assayed using the kits. DNA damage and cell apoptosis caused by dioscin were also analyzed through single-cell gel electrophoresis and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays. The results showed that dioscin increased the levels of NO and inducible NO synthase. The comet length in dioscin-treated groups was much longer than that of the control group, and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling positive cells (apoptotic cells) was significantly increased by the compound (p < 0.01). Furthermore, dioscin caused mitochondrial damage and G2/M cell cycle arrest through transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. To study the cytotoxic mechanism of dioscin, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach was used. There were 288 significantly different proteins expressed in response to dioscin, which were connected with each other and were involved in different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Then, some differentially expressed proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, Wnt, p53, and calcium signaling pathways were validated by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR assays. Our work elucidates the molecular mechanism of dioscin-induced cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells, and the identified targets may be useful for treatment of colorectal cancer in future.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We found that α-solanine (10 μM) disturbed meiotic resumption and increased abnormal spindle formation and altered the cortical granule (CG) distribution compared with the untreated group. α-Solanine triggered autophagy and apoptosis by increasing the expressions of autophagy-related genes (LC3, ATG7, and LAMP2) and apoptotic related genes (BAX and CASP3). Exposure of porcine oocytes to α-solanine significantly increased the levels of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3. Moreover, α-solanine significantly reduced the cleavage and blastocyst formation rates, decreased the total and inner cell mass cells numbers, and increased apoptosis in these porcine embryos.

Despite inconclusive evidence for use of tribulus as a T booster, it may provide advantageous effects on sperm parameters in men with idiopathic infertility. Nutraceutical strategies and some phytotherapics may also be effective to promote prostate health.

Traditionally the seeds are used as macerate for the treatment of diabetes, cough, and flatulence, to increase breast milk secretion, and for anti-inflammatory and aphrodisiac effects. The use is limited by its unpleasant smell and bitter taste which can be modified by adding mint leaves to the macerate. Antidiabetic properties are attributed mainly to galactomannan, 4-hydroxyisoleucin (4-OH-Ile),  and trigonelline. These substances demonstrate direct antidiabetic properties in clinical studies by increasing insulin secretion (4-OH-Ile), decreasing insulin resistance and glucose resorption from the GIT (galactomannan) and improvement in B-cells regeneration (trigonelline). Besides this main effect, the herb improves blood lipid spectre (4-OH-Ile, ), and has reno-protective (4-OH-Ile, trigonelline), neuroprotective (trigonelline) and antioxidant (, trigonelline) effects. Antidiabetic efficacy of trigonelline is comparable to glibenclamide treatment and more effective than sitagliptine therapy.

However, its detailed molecular mechanisms have not been clearly clarified.In this study, we demonstrate that dioscin induces apoptosis in cancer cells through the induction of oxidative stress. Treatment with cancer cells in vitro with dioscin resulted in rapid generation of reactive  species (ROS) and the induction of mitochondrial pathway apoptosis in human esophageal cancer cell line Kyse510. Inhibition of oxidative stress by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked the induction of apoptosis by dioscin, indicating that ROS generation is the primary mechanism responsible for the proapoptotic activity of dioscin. Proteomic analysis and protein gel blotting further revealed peroxiredoxins 1 and 6 (PRDX 1 and 6), which are implicated in ROS metabolism and apoptosis, were associated with the anticancer effects of dioscin. Meanwhile, overexpression of PRDX 1 and 6 significantly blocked the elevated ROS and apoptosis induced by dioscin.

Thus, the aim of the present work was to investigate the protective effect and possible mechanisms of dioscin against gastric I/R.The hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model in GES-1 cells and the celiac artery occlusion model in rats were carried out in the study.Dioscin markedly attenuated H/R insult in GES-1 cells and gastric I/R injury in rats. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that dioscin-induced gastric protection was accompanied by inhibiting the levels of PKCα, PKCβ2 and phosphorylation via decreasing Raf-1 level. Blockade of PKC/ERK1/2 signaling pathway by dioscin decreased MEK1/2 level, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation, NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional activities, pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and up-regulated PPAR-γ level. Moreover, the results of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpression of PKCα and PKCβ2 confirmed that dioscin attenuated gastric I/R injury through inhibiting PKC/ERK1/2 signaling by down-regulating PKCα and PKCβ2.These data confirmed the protective effect of dioscin against gastric I/R injury, which should be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute gastric mucosal lesions in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Polyphyllin I (PPI), one of the main components in the Rhizoma of Paris polyphyllin, displays a selective inhibitory effect on various tumor cells. Here we sought to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects and mechanisms of PPI on macrophages  and .  , primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and peritoneal elucidated macrophages (PEMs) were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon (IFN)-γ and then treated with PPI. We determined the degree of activation of IKKα/β and p65, two key mediators of the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway, by measuring their phosphorylated forms by Western blot. The p65 nuclear localization was detected by immunofluorescent staining. Further, a NF-κB-linked luciferase reporter plasmid, as well as those expressing key mediators of the Toll-like receptor 4 pathway, such as myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) associated kinase (IRAK)-1, TNF receptor associated factors (TRAF)-6, Transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and p65, were used to identify the mechanism by which PPI achieves its inhibitory effects on macrophage-mediated inflammation. Moreover, a NF-κB inhibitor, p65-targeted siRNAs, and a p65 plasmid were further used to validate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPI. , PPI (1 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically one time a day for 7 weeks starting on the 42nd day after the first immunization with collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Micro-computed Tomography scanning, histological examination, F4/80 and iNOS double immunofluorescent staining and CD4 immunohistochemical staining were performed to determine the effect of PPI treatment on joint structure and inflammation in this model.  PPI reduced the inflammatory cytokines production of PEMs stimulated by LPS/IFN-γ, inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and p65, and prevented p65 nuclear localization. The NF-κB luciferase assay showed that the target of PPI was closely related to the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, NF-κB inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p65, and p65 overexpression eliminated PPI's inhibitory effect. In addition, PPI attenuated the bone erosion and synovitis, as well as M1-like macrophage and T cell infiltration, in the ankle joint of the CIA model.  PPI demonstrated effective amelioration of synovial inflammation in the ankle joint of CIA mice while suppressing NF-κB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory effectors in activated macrophages.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408964>Complex formation equilibria between cholesterol and  analogues in monolayers determined by the Langmuir method.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between  analogues [DioA:  acetate (DAc) and (25)-5α,6β-dihydroxyspirostan-3β-ol acetate (DSol)] and cholesterol (Ch) monolayers at the air/water interface.

Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner.

The present work investigated the activities of dioscin against liver fibrosis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Dioscin effectively inhibited the cell viabilities of HSC-T6, LX-2 and primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), but not hepatocytes. Furthermore, dioscin markedly increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) expression and significantly reduced a-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), collagen α1 (I) (COL1A1) and collagen α1 (III) (COL3A1) levels in vitro. Notably, dioscin inhibited HSCs activation and induced apoptosis in activated HSCs. In vivo, dioscin significantly improved  and hydroxylproline, laminin, α-SMA, TGF-β1, COL1A1 and COL3A1 levels, which were confirmed by histopathological assays. Dioscin facilitated matrix degradation, and exhibited hepatoprotective effects through the attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, in addition to exerting anti-fibrotic effects through the modulation of the TGF-β1/Smad, Wnt/β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitochondrial signaling pathways, which triggered the senescence of activated HSCs.

Female Wistar rats underwent a sham operation (SHAM group) or ovariectomy. OVX rats were treated using vehicle (OVX group), DIO (DIO group) or estradiol valerate (EV group) for 12 weeks. After treatment, the biomarkers of bone turnover in plasma and the microstructure of alveolar bone were assessed. lncRNA microarrays were applied to assess lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in alveolar bone in the OVX and DIO group rats. Subsequently, the differentially expressed mRNAs associated with the comprehensive bone metabolism pathway in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were identified and regarded as key mRNAs. Based on some of the key mRNAs and all the differentially expressed lncRNAs, a coexpression network was established and this network was further analyzed to identify the top 6 lncRNAs with the highest closeness scores (pivotal lncRNAs). Finally, 6 modules showing interactions between pivotal lncRNAs and key mRNAs were constructed. All of the pivotal lncRNAs and key mRNAs were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The present findings demonstrated that DIO suppressed the loss of alveolar bone in OVX rats, and the changes to the expression of some lncRNAs or mRNAs occurred in the alveolar bone of the rats in the DIO group. Twenty-four key mRNAs were identified during pathway analysis. Furthermore, 8/24 key mRNAs ( and ) were used to establish a coexpression network, which included 1,656 nodes and 5,341 edges.

Morroniside (Mor) of  and  (Dio) of  formed an innovative formula named M + D. The aims of the present study were to investigate myocardial protective effect of M + D on diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) through the inhibition of expression levels of caspase-3 protein, and identify the advantage of M + D compared with Mor, Dio, and the positive drug metformin (Met). We detected cell viability, cell apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 protein in rat cardiomyocytes. In result, Mor, Dio, and M + D increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and decreased ROS levels. Additionally, the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 protein was modulated and the expression levels of caspase-3 protein were markedly decreased. Among the treatment groups, M + D produced the most prominent effects. In conclusion, our data showed for the first time that Mor, Dio, and M + D prevented high glucose (HG)-induced myocardial injury by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes. Among all the groups, M + D produced the strongest effect, while Mor and Dio produced weaker effects.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487001>Phytochemicals as potential IKK-β inhibitor for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in plant preservation: terpenoids, alkaloids, and quinones.</a></h2><p>Modulation of inhibitor kappa B kinase-beta (IKK-β) kinase activity could be useful for preventing  that serves an efficient role in protection against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

Among the drying techniques used, air drying had the highest effect on steroidal alkaloid contents, followed by freeze drying and vacuum oven drying. There was no significant difference between the freeze dried and vacuum oven dried samples in their α-chaconine contents. However, freeze dried potato shoots and berries had significantly higher α-solanine contents (825 µg/g dry  (DW) in shoots and 2453 µg/g DW in berries) than the vacuum oven dried ones (325 µg/g dry  (DW) in shoots and 2080 µg/g DW in berries). The kinetics of steroidal alkaloid contents of potato shoots during air drying were monitored over a period of 21 days. Both α-solanine and α-chaconine content increased to their maximum values, 875 µg/g DW and 3385 µg/g DW, respectively, after 7 days of drying. The steroidal alkaloid contents of the shoots decreased significantly at day 9, and then remained unchanged until day 21. In line with the potato shoots, air dried potato tuber peels also had higher steroidal alkaloid content than the freeze dried and vacuum oven dried samples. However, a significant decrease of steroidal alkaloid content was observed in air dried potato berries, possibly due to degradation during slicing of the whole berries prior to air drying. Remarkable variation in steroidal alkaloid contents among different tissue types of potato plants was observed with the potato flowers having the highest content.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26387656>Improving Bone Microarchitecture in Aging with  Treatment: A Study in Senescence-Accelerated OXYS Rats.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis is a major disease associated with aging.

Dioscin exerts protective effects against tumor growth and ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, whether and how dioscin attenuates angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiac hypertrophy is still unknown. In the current study, we found that dioscin attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and restored the impaired cardiac function induced by AngII infusion in vivo. In addition, dioscin blocked the activation of the MAPK and Akt/GSK3β/mTOR  and nuclear accumulation of p-Akt1 in AngII-infused mice. In vitro, dioscin inhibited the activation of the MAPK and Akt/GSK3β/mTOR  and nuclear translocation of p-Akt1 and thus alleviated the hypertrophic growth.

TKI resistance caused by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations at T790M and c-Met amplification occurs through persistent activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. We therefore expected that dual inhibitors of both signaling pathways could overcome TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Here, dioscin was selected from a product library of Chinese naturally occurring compounds and overcame TKI resistance in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mechanistically, dioscin may down-regulate the expression of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) at the transcription level by increasing p53 binding to the SHP2 promoter due to reactive  species (ROS). Simultaneous inhibition of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT activation via decreased SHP2 expression and its interaction with GAB1 may be responsible for dioscin-mediated TKI sensitivity. A higher unfavorable response to TKI therapy occurred more commonly in patients with high SHP2 mRNA expression than in patients with low SHP2 mRNA expression. Therefore, we suggest that dioscin may act as a dual inhibitor of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways to overcome TKI resistance via dysregulation of SHP2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334779>Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Dioscorea bulbifera tuber extract and evaluation of its synergistic potential in combination with antimicrobial agents.</a></h2><p>Development of an environmentally benign process for the synthesis of silver nanomaterials is an important aspect of current nanotechnology research. Among the 600 species of the genus Dioscorea, Dioscorea bulbifera has profound therapeutic applications due to its unique phytochemistry. In this paper, we report on the rapid synthesis of silver nanoparticles by reduction of aqueous Ag(+) ions using D. bulbifera tuber extract.Phytochemical analysis revealed that D. bulbifera tuber extract is rich in flavonoid, phenolics, reducing sugars, starch, , ascorbic acid, and citric acid. The biosynthesis process was quite fast, and silver nanoparticles were formed within 5 hours. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,  dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction confirmed reduction of the Ag(+) ions. Varied morphology of the bioreduced silver nanoparticles included spheres, triangles, and hexagons. Optimization studies revealed that the maximum rate of synthesis could be achieved with 0.7 mM AgNO(3) solution at 50°C in 5 hours. The resulting silver nanoparticles were found to possess potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Beta-lactam (piperacillin) and macrolide (eryth-romycin) antibiotics showed a 3.6-fold and 3-fold increase, respectively, in combination with silver nanoparticles selectively against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Notable synergy was seen between silver nanoparticles and chloramphenicol or vancomycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was supported by a 4.9-fold and 4.2-fold increase in zone diameter, respectively.

In the present study, the activities and underlying mechanisms of dioscin in the inhibition of ischemic stroke in rats were investigated. Inflammatory responses wer analyzed using ELISA kits and caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 activity was analyzed using Caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 activity kits. Western blot analysis was used to measure Toll‑like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB), transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1), high‑mobility group protein 1 (HMGB‑1), interleukin‑1 receptor‑associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor‑associated factor 6 (TRAF6) protein expression.

This study investigated the anti-Saprolegnia activity of a total of 108 plants on Saprolegnia parasitica in vitro and Dioscorea collettii was selected for further studies. By loading on an open silica gel column and eluting with petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-methanol, dioscin (C45H72O16) was isolated from D. collettii. Saprolegnia parasitica growth was inhibited significantly when dioscin concentration was more than 2.0 mg L(-1). When compared with formalin and hydrogen peroxide, dioscin showed a higher inhibitory effect. As potential inhibition mechanisms, dioscin could cause the S. parasitica mycelium morphologic damage, dense folds, or disheveled protuberances observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and the influx of Propidium iodide. The structural changes in the treated mycelium were indicative of an efficient anti-Saprolegnia activity of dioscin. The oxidative stress results showed that dioscin also accumulated reactive oxygen species excessively and increased total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase activity. These situations could render S. parasitica more vulnerable to oxidative damage. Additionally, when dioscin concentration was less than 2.0 mg L(-1), the survival rate of embryos was more than 70%. Therefore, the use of dioscin could be a viable way of preventing and controlling saprolegniasis.© FEMS 2015. All rights reserved.

The expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) mRNA was measured by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blot analysis was performed to examine the phosphorylation and protein expression of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), p65, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and EZH2. Exogenous expression of p65, DNMT1, and EZH2 were carried out by transient transfection assays. Promoter activity of EZH2 gene was determined using Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit. A xenografted tumor model in nude mice and bioluminescent imaging system were used to further test the effect of PPI in vivo.We showed that PPI significantly inhibited growth and induced cell cycle arrest of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that PPI increased the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, reduced protein expression of p65 and DNMT1. The inhibitor of SAPK/JNK (SP600125) blocked the PPI-inhibited p65 and DNMT1 protein expression. Interestingly, exogenously expressed p65 overcame PPI-inhibited protein expression of DNMT1. Moreover, PPI reduced EZH2 protein, mRNA, and promoter activity; overexpression of EZH2 resisted the PPI-inhibited cell growth, and intriguingly, negative feedback regulation of SAPK/JNK signaling. Finally, exogenous expression of DNMT1 antagonized the PPI-suppressed EZH2 protein expression. Consistent with this, PPI inhibited tumor growth, protein expression levels of p65, DNMT1 and EZH2, and increased phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK in vivo.Our results show that PPI inhibits growth of NSCLC cells through SAPK/JNK-mediated inhibition of p65 and DNMT1 protein levels, subsequently; this results in the reduction of EZH2 gene expression. The interactions among p65, DNMT1 and EZH2, and feedback regulation of SAPK/JNK by EZH2 converge on the overall responses of PPI.

A total of 32 Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into groups as follows: Control; TT, treated with TT extracts, E, high intensity exercise; E+TT, high intensity exercise plus TT treatment. The rats of the E and E+TT groups underwent high intensity exercise with a progressively increasing load for 5 weeks, and TT extracts were intragastrically administered in the TT and E+TT rats 30 min prior to training. TT extract composition was analyzed using ultra‑high performance liquid chromatography‑quadrupole‑time of flight mass spectrometry. Testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels and AR, IGF‑1R and myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein levels in muscles were determined by ELISA and western blotting, respectively. The saponins tigogenin and  comprised ~71.35% of the total peak area. Compared with the E group, TT extracts increased the testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels, and AR, IGF‑1R and MHC protein levels in the gastrocnemius of rats undergoing high intensity exercise, accompanied with increased  and gastrocnemius . In conclusion, the effect of TT extracts on the performance of high intensity exercise rats may be attributed to increased levels of circulating testosterone and IGF‑1 and increased AR and IGF‑1R protein expression levels in the gastrocnemius, resulting in increased muscle  and increased MHC in the gastrocnemius. The present study provided preliminary evidence supporting the use of TT extracts as a dietary supplement for the promotion of skeletal muscle mass increase and the enhancement of athletic performance in humans performing high intensity exercise.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174784>Development of a new certified reference material of  using mass balance approach and Coulometric titration method.</a></h2><p>Certified reference materials (CRMs) can be used as a valuable tool to validate the trueness of measurement methods and to establish metrological traceability of analytical results.  has been selected as a candidate reference material.

And its mechanism of action was investigated using primary cultured fibroblasts.Hairless mice were fed a low protein diet with Dios for 8weeks and the contents of collagen in skin were determined by measuring the content of hydroxyproline (Hyp). In primary cultured fibroblasts, the numbers of fibroblast were determined by incubating with Dios for 120h; the contents of Hyp were determined by incubating with Dios for 24 or 72h using fibroblasts of confluent state; the expressions of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were determined by incubating with Dios for 24h.Oral ingestion of Dios in the diet for 8weeks led to a dose-dependent increase in the Hyp content as collagen content of skin. In proliferating of primary cultured fibroblasts, Dios treatment led to a decrease of adenosine 5'-triphosphate content indicating decrease of the cell number. In the cells reached to confluent, although increase of Hyp content in the control indicating progress of fibroblasts differentiation were observed, the content of Hyp remained unchanged with Dios treatment. Finally, addition of Dios led to a decrease the α-tubulin and c-fos mRNA expressions relating to the cell cycle.It is concluded that Dios can improve skin collagen content by shifting the dynamics of the fibroblasts from proliferation to differentiation via cell cycle arrest.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Dioscin shows anti-inflammatory effects in our previous works. However, the action of the compound on SIRS still remained unknown. In the present paper, zymosan induced generalized inflammation (ZIGI) models in mice and rats, and PMA-differentiated THP‑1 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam3-Cys-Ser-Lys4 (Pam3CSK4) were used. The results showed that dioscin significantly inhibited the proliferation of THP‑1 cells stimulated by LPS and Pam3CSK4, obviously reduced the soakage of inflammatory cells and necrosis in liver, kidney and intestine of rats and mice, and reduced peritoneal ascites fluid compared with ZIGI model groups. In addition, dioscin significantly declined the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rats and mice. The migration of macrophages in tissues was also suppressed by dioscin. Mechanism investigation showed that dioscin significantly inhibited the expression levels of TLR2, MyD88, NF‑κb, HMGB‑1, increased the expression levels of IKBα, and decreased the mRNA levels of interleukin‑1 beta (IL‑1β), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6) and tumor necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α) in liver, kidney, intestine tissues of rats and mice, and in PMA-differentiated THP‑1 cells, which were further confirmed by TLR2 siRNA silencing in vitro. In conclusion, our data confirmed that dioscin exhibited protective effects against SIRS via adjusting TLR2/MyD88 signal pathway, which should be developed as one potent candidate to treat SIRS in the future.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms of  (DG) that promote cholesterol homeostasis and alleviate hypercholesterolemia remain elusive. To investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of the promotion of cholesterol metabolism by DG, a rat model of hypercholesterolemia was induced by providing a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the rats were intragastrically administered high-dose DG (0.3 g/kg/d), low-dose DG (0.15 g/kg/d) or simvastatin (4 mg/kg/d) once a day for 8 weeks. The serum and hepatic cholesterol were tested, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and the ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) transporters were measured. The results indicate that DG could reduce , decrease the serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, liver total cholesterol and free cholesterol levels compared to those in the controls. Simultaneously, liver tissue pathological morphology analyses revealed that DG could attenuate hepatic steatosis compared to that in the high-fat diet group. Further investigation demonstrated that DG significantly decreased the expression of NPC1L1 and LXR-α in the intestine and markedly increased the expression of ABCG5/G8 in the liver and intestine. Compared to the high-fat diet group, the rats in the DG-treated groups ameliorated hypercholesterolemia in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest that DG may not only inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption by downregulating NPC1L1 but also enhance cholesterol excretion by increasing the expression of ABCG5/G8. DG could be a new candidate for the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The dual luciferase reporter assay was used to demonstrate modulation, by dioscin, of the targeting of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) by microRNA (miR)-34a. Molecular docking assays were used to analyse the effects of dioscin with Sirt1, Keap1 and NF-κB.Dioscin attenuated cell damage in vitro and decreased renal injury in rats and mice, treated with CDDP. In terms of mechanisms, dioscin reversed CDDP-induced up-regulation of miR-34a and thus up-regulated Sirt1 levels. In addition, dioscin altered levels of haem oxygenase 1, glutathione-cysteine ligase subunits (GCLC, GCLM) and Keap1, along with increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2, thus decreasing oxidative stress. Also, dioscin affected levels of AP-1, COX-2, HMGB1, IκB-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α and decreased the ratio of acetylated NF-κB and normal NF-κB, to suppress inflammation.

In this study, worms were cultured with cholesterol (Cho) and cholesterol-free (Cho) medium with DG (5, 10 and 50μg/mL) at 20°C. It was observed that worms cultured in (Cho) exhibits late egg production, reduced  level and short lifespan, while addition of DG overcomes all defective facts. Combinations of both cholesterol and DG further extend the lifespan (20.8%), hinder  level and resistance to oxidative, thermal and high glucose stress. The intracellular ROS quantification was done by flouroscenic probe H2DCF-DA and confirmed that DG had significantly reduced ROS level (35.85%). Increased lifespan of worms were observed in the medium treated with DG which activates the nuclear translocation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, followed by downstream antioxidant gene sod-3 as evidenced by GFP tagged strain.

Mechanistic studies demonstrated that dioscin markedly up- regulated the level of the microRNA let-7i, resulting in significant inhibition of TLR4 expression. Dioscin significantly down-regulated the levels of MyD88, NOX1 and cleaved caspase-8/3; inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB; inhibited PI3K and Akt phosphorylation; increased the levels of SOD2; and decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, Fas and FasL. In vitro, transfection of microRNA let-7i inhibitor and TLR4 DNA were applied, and the results further confirmed the nephroprotective effect of dioscin in suppressing TLR4/MyD88 signaling and subsequently inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, the abrogation of cellular MyD88 expression by ST2825 eliminated the inhibitory effect of dioscin on the levels of nuclear NF-κB, cleaved caspase-3, SOD2 and ROS. These data indicated that dioscin exerted a nephroprotective effect against LPS-induced inflammatory renal injury by adjusting the microRNA let-7i/TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway, which provided novel insights into the mechanisms of this therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammatory kidney injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have indicated that  may inhibit high glucose‑induced renal tubular fibrosis; however, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have focused on the effects of  on cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the effects of  on angiotensin II (Ang II)‑induced ECM remodeling, and its possible mechanism in rat CFs. CFs were pre‑incubated with  (1, 5 and 10 µM) for 24 h and were then stimulated with Ang II (100 nM) for 24 h. Cell proliferation was estimated using the MTS assay. The expression levels of α‑SMA, fibronectin, collagen I, TGF‑β1, in addition to phosphorylation of Smad3 were detected by western blotting. The results demonstrated that  inhibited Ang II‑induced CF proliferation and the differentiation of CFs to myofibroblasts. In addition,  was able to inhibit Ang II‑induced ECM expression in rat CFs. Furthermore,  inhibited Ang II‑induced expression of transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1) and Smad3 phosphorylation in CFs. Taken together, these results suggest that  may inhibit Ang II‑induced ECM remodeling by suppressing the TGF‑β1/Smad3 signaling pathway in rat CFs. Therefore,  may possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263633>Comparative Physicochemical Evaluation of Kharekhasak ( Linn.) Before and After Mudabbar Process.</a></h2><p>Mudabbar/ is referred to the processes performed on the drugs to detoxify, purify, and enhance therapeutic action and to reduce its doses before making the formulations in Unani medicine. It improves quality of drugs either by optimizing its desirable characteristics or minimizing the undesirable ones; it makes drug effective, safe, and specific. There is a need of comparative evaluation to understand its significance. Tadbeer of Kharekhasak (KK) khurd ( Linn. fruit) is described by Rabban Al-Tabari in Firdausul Hikmat, Akbar Arzani in Qarabadeene Qadri, etc., during the compounding of aphrodisiac formulations. Mudabbar Kharekhasak (MKK) used in  mentioned in Al-Qarabadeene was evaluated in this work.Mudabbar/Tadbeer process was carried out by blending fresh KK. Juice with powdered dry KK and drying it under the sun. Juice used for process is thrice the  of dry KK powder. The KK before and after the process was evaluated using physicochemical tests: powder characterization, extractive value, alcohol and water soluble matter, ash value, loss on drying (LOD) at 105°C, pH, high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) fingerprinting, and  content.Powder characterizations were set in. Increase in successive and nonsuccessive extractive values in various solvents, water/alcohol-soluble content, total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-soluble ash, and sulfated ash of MKK was noted in comparison with KK. Decrease in LOD at 105°C and pH of MKK powder was observed. HPTLC fingerprinting data were developed for the identification and evaluation. Quantification of  content increased to 432.1 g/g in MKK as compared to 144.5 g/g in KK, suggesting significant increase in saponin content.Data obtained clearly indicated changes in MKK validating the classical Mudabbar process, probably to enhance/modify the action of drug. Standards for crude and MKK were established for future reference.Mudabbar process on  Linn (KK) havebeen validated.Physicochemical data for Mudabbar and non mudabbar Kharekhasak (KK) powder have been set in. content was increased significantly in mudabbar KK.  KK: Kharekhasak, TT: , MKK: mudabbar Kharekhasak, SK: , LOD: loss of  on drying, HPTLC: High performance thin layer chromatography, BSS: British standard sieve, μl: microliter, SEM: Standard error of mean, nm: nanometer, g: gram.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p></html>
