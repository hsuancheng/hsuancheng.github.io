Untrained, university students (N = ) completed two graded exercise tests in counterbalanced, randomised order. One test was preceded by restful viewing of a documentary video (control); the other by a stop-signal task. Cardiorespiratory functions and perceived exertion were monitored during exercise. Peak power output (W) was lower following the stop-signal task (M = 240.03, SD = 53.37) compared to control (M = 246.03, SD = 52.60), P = .002, η = .493, as was [Formula: see text] (P = .042, Cohen's d = .55). Perceived exertion was significantly higher at 50% (d = .77) and 75% (d = .83) of iso-time following the cognitive task ( ≤ .01). Results are consistent with research showing negative carryover effects of cognitively demanding tasks on whole-body endurance performance. Results also support the psychobiological model of exercise as performance of the cognitive task did not affect perceived exertion when exercise task demands were lower, but lead to greater perceived exertion and earlier withdrawal of effort at higher levels of exercise task demand.

We evaluated the effect of rehydrated and ensiled corn (REC), , and ST on intake, lactation performance, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation profile, and chewing behavior of dairy cows. Kernels from an 84% vitreousness hybrid were finely (FN) or coarsely (CS) ground, yielding geometric mean particle sizes of 1,591 and 2,185 µm, respectively. Ground kernels were rehydrated [60% dry matter (DM)] and ensiled in 200-L buckets for ≥205 d. The grinding rate (t/h) was 3.9 for FN and 11.7 for CS. The  did not affect DM loss (11.3% of ensiled) or silage pH (3.8). Samples of each bucket (n = /) before and after silage fermentation were incubated in situ for , 3, 6, 18, and 48 h in 4 rumen-cannulated lactating cows. Ensiling increased the effective ruminal in situ DM degradation (63.7 vs. 34.1%), regardless of . Sixteen Holstein cows (152 ± 96 d in milk) in 4 × 4 Latin squares (21-d periods) were individually fed a 2 × 2 factorial combination of low (LO) or high (HI) starch diets with FN or CS. Cows were fed the same REC incubated in situ. Varied concentration of starch in the diet (29.2 vs. 23.5% of DM) was achieved by partial replacement of REC (22. vs. 14.2% of DM) with citrus pulp ( vs. 8.2% of DM). Milk, protein, fat, and lactose yields did not differ. Milk fat percentage was reduced and protein percentage was increased by HI. Treatment FN increased feed efficiency (-corrected milk/digestible organic matter intake) when fed with HI. Total-tract starch digestibility tended to be reduced by CS (96.4 vs. 97.2% of starch intake). Serum β-hydroxybutyrate was increased by LO. High-starch diet reduced the molar proportions of acetate and butyrate in ruminal fluid and increased propionate and isoacids. Particle size did not affect ruminal fermentation profile. Coarse grinding reduced plasma d-lactate concentration with HI. Diet HI reduced the proportion of daily intake from 1900 to 0700 h and induced preferential intake of feed particles <8 mm and greater refusal of particles >19 mm in the morning. Fine REC reduced rumination time per day and increased eating time per DM intake. Milk and plasma urea-N did not differ. Ensiling of mature flint corn for >200 d largely eliminated the effect of the  of REC on the studied outcomes. The proportion of REC in the diet affected ruminal fermentation profile and milk solids concentration, but did not affect short-term performance and digestibility. Coarse grinding of REC may allow increasing the grinding rate and thus save labor and  during ensiling.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, an SAFL driven anoxic denitrification sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was established, the mechanism of organics utilization was characterized and the refractory dissolved organic matters (rDOM) was identified. Denitrification could rapidly proceed with the presence of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) initially, while the denitrification rate largely decreased after the VFAs depleted. A great deal of rDOM, which was hard to be utilized by denitrifying microorganism, was found in the effluent. A prolonged hydraulic retention time (HRT) led to the further transformation of particles and colloids to smaller colloids and soluble organics. Extended HRT promoted the degradation of soluble microbial by-product (SMP), but had minor effect on the removal of humic-like, and fulvic acid-like substances. The characterization of the effluent demonstrated the building blocks, were dominated in the rDOM (43.79%-48.78%), followed by high molecular  protein (HMW-PN) (13.37%-17.39%), HMW polysaccharide (HMW-) (12.84%-.9%), low molecular  (LMW) neutrals (11.28%-13.65%), and hydrophobic dissolved organic carbon (HO-DOC) (8.%-12.62%). Moreover, it was found that the building blocks were relatively easy to be degraded with the extension of HRTs, followed by LMW-, LMW-PN, LMW neutrals, HMW-PN, and HMW-. However, further extended HRT >24 h could not improve the removal of building blocks, LMW- and LMW neutrals. This study, for the first time, provided insights into the transformation of organic matters produced by SAFL in a denitrification system and acted as a guide for the subsequent advanced treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagnostic criteria for cancer-associated  loss grading (WLG) (Grades  to 4) [1] have been validated and are recommended in oncology nutrition clinical practice guidelines [2-3]. The aim was to determine the prevalence using WLG in HNC patients and determine the extent to which reduced dietary intake (DI) explained variation of WLG.A population-based cohort of HNC patients (N = 1756) in northern Alberta, Canada included consecutive new patients, 2004-2016. At referral to the regional cancer center  history and DI categories were collected. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) identified predictors of  loss (WL) severity. Overall survival (OS) in relation to WL Grade and DI was determined by multivariable Cox proportional hazard.WL was absent in 42.9% and the remainder had Grade 1 (18%), Grade 2 (14.7%), Grade 3 (.9%) and Grade 4 (8.5%) WL. Independent predictors of WLG in adjusted MLR model, included stage (P < .000), performance status () (P < .000) and DI categories (P < .000); sex, age and disease site were not significant. Compared to "normal food in normal amount" adjusted Odds Ratio for WL Grade 4 was 4.

How to obtain the high efficiency of singlet oxygen generation under low 980 nm radiation dosage still remains a challenge. A highly efficient nanophotosensitizer, denoted as UCNPs-ZnPc, was constructed for photodynamic therapy, which is based on near infrared (NIR) light upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) and Zn(II)-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) photosensitizer (). The high (1)O2 production efficiency came from the enhancement of the 660 nm upconversion emission of NaYF4:Yb(3+), Er(3+) UCNP with 25% Yb(3+) doping, covalent assemblage of UCNP and ZnPc which significantly shortened the distance and enhanced the energy transfer between the two. The high (1)O2 production led to a secure and efficient PDT treatment, as evidenced by the in vivo test where UCNPs-ZnPc of 50 mg per kg body  was locally injected into the liver tumor in mice, a low 980 nm radiation dose of 351 J/cm(2) (.39 W/cm(2)) and short irradiation duration of  min were sufficient to perform image-guided PDT and caused the liver tumor inhibitory ratio of approximately 80.1%.

To minimize the cost and complexity of a system's back-end architecture and data acquisition, many analog signals are often multiplexed to fewer channels using techniques that encode timing, , and position information. With progress in the development SiPMs having lower dark noise, after pulsing, and cross talk along with higher photodetection efficiency, a coincidence timing resolution (CTR) well below 200  FWHM is now easily achievable in single pixel, bench-top setups using 20-mm length, lutetium-based inorganic scintillators. However, multiplexing the output of many SiPMs to a single channel will significantly degrade CTR without appropriate signal processing. We test the performance of a PET detector readout concept that multiplexes 16 SiPMs to two channels. One channel provides timing information with fast comparators, and the second channel encodes both position and  information in a time-over-threshold-based pulse sequence. This multiplexing readout concept was constructed with discrete components to process signals from a [Formula: see text] array of SensL MicroFC-30035 SiPMs coupled to [Formula: see text] LuGdSiO (LGSO):Ce (.025 mol. %) scintillators.

In this study, we demonstrate that glucose-induced Cl(-) efflux from β-cells is mediated by the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel anoctamin 1 (Ano1). Ano1 expression in rat β-cells is demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Typical Ano1 currents are observed in whole-cell and inside-out patches in the presence of intracellular Ca(++): at 1 μM, the Cl(-) current is outwardly rectifying, and at 2 μM, it becomes almost linear. The relative permeabilities of monovalent anions are NO3 (-) (1.83 ± .10) > Br(-) (1.42 ± .07) > Cl(-) (1.). A linear single-channel current-voltage relationship shows a conductance of 8.37 . These currents are nearly abolished by blocking Ano1 antibodies or by the inhibitors 2-(5-ethyl-4-hydroxy-6-methylpyrimidin-2-ylthio)-N-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (T-AO1) and tannic acid (TA). These inhibitors induce a strong decrease of 16.7-mM glucose-stimulated action potential rate (at least 87 % on dispersed cells) and a partial membrane repolarization with T-AO1. They abolish or strongly inhibit the GSIS increment at 8.3 mM and at 16.7 mM glucose. Blocking Ano1 antibodies also abolish the 16.7-mM GSIS increment. Combined treatment with bumetanide and acetazolamide in low Cl(-) and HCO3 (-) media provokes a 65 % reduction in action potential (AP) amplitude and a -mV AP peak repolarization. Although the mechanism triggering Ano1 opening remains to be established, the present data demonstrate that Ano1 is required to sustain glucose-stimulated membrane potential oscillations and insulin secretion.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964293>Enhanced biogas production by anaerobic co-digestion from a trinary mix substrate over a binary mix substrate.</a></h2><p>The synergetic enhancement of mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of trinary and binary mix of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) + primary sludge () + thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) as substrates was investigated through batch biological methane potential (BMP) and semi-continuous flow reactor tests.

The formulations were composed by poloxamer 407 [., 17.5, or 20.% (w/w)], Carbopol 934P [., .20, or .25% (w/w)], and MB [.25, .50, or .75% (w/w)]. The sol-gel transition temperature, flow rheometry, in vitro MB release, and ex vivo study of MB cutaneous permeation and retention were investigated. Moreover, the evaluation of photodynamic activity was also analyzed by in vitro degradation of tryptophan by singlet  and using Artemia salina. The determination of the gelation temperature displayed values within the range of 25-37 °C, and the systems with better characteristics were subjected to rheological analysis and in vitro release profiling. The 20/./.25 formulation showed the best release profile (42.57% at 24 h). This system displayed no significant skin permeation (.38% at 24 h), and the photooxidation of tryptophan test showed the production of reactive species of . The toxicity test using A. salina revealed that the MB associated with the light increased the mortality rate by 61.29%. Therefore, investigating the PDT efficacy of the functional polymeric system containing MB will be necessary in the future.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15068030>Comparative study of photodynamic properties of 13,-N-cycloimide derivatives of chlorin p6.</a></h2><p>Comparative study of 13,-[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)]cycloimide chlorin p6 (2), 13,-(N-acetoxy)cycloimide chlorin p6 (3), 13,-(N-hydroxy)cycloimide chlorin p6 methyl ester (4) and 13,-(N-methoxy)cycloimide chlorin p6 methyl ester (5) together with the previously investigated 13,-[N-(3-hydroxypropyl)]cycloimide chlorin p6 (1) was performed. The dependence of the key photodynamic properties of 1-5 on the introduced substituents was analyzed. The photoinduced cell-killing activity of 4 is 100- and 280-fold higher than that of chlorin p6 and Photogem, respectively, as estimated on A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The activity is reduced eight times in the order 4 > 5 > 1 > 2 > 3. The intracellular accumulation of 1-5 occurs in cytoplasm in a monomeric form bound to the lipids of cellular membranes. This form of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is characterized by the high quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation, which depends on the introduced substituents, .66, .59, .35, .51 and .73, respectively. The photostability is two-fold less for 1 and four-fold less for 2, 3 and 5 than for 4. The rates of cellular uptake and efflux of 1-5 vary widely, thus providing the way to optimize the pharmacological properties of the photosensitizer () using the respective substituents. Modifying the substituents, 1-5 were targeted to different cellular organelles. The enhanced accumulation in the Golgi apparatus and  complemented with diffuse staining of intracellular membranous structures is a property of 1-4. Compound 5 accumulates selectively in the lipid droplets and stains weakly perinuclear structures. Temperature-sensitive mechanisms of transport are responsible for the 1-4 uptake. Diffusion can play a role in the internalization of 5 but not of 1-4. Endocytosis via caveolae, clathrin-dependent and adenosine triphosphate-dependent pathways are not noticeably involved in the 1-5 internalization. Independently from their intracellular localization 1, 4 and 5 are highly efficient near-IR , which induce predominantly an apoptotic type of cell death under conditions providing ca 50% level of phototoxicity and necrosis at the 100% level of phototoxicity.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610685>The "overweight paradox" in the prognosis of acute coronary syndrome for patients with heart failure-A truth for all?

To what extent this is irrespective of other characteristics remains inconclusive. The role of body mass index (BMI) in ACS prognosis (fatal/recurrent non-fatal cardiac episodes) and background potential interactions were evaluated.In 2006-2009, 1000 consecutive patients, hospitalized at First Cardiology Clinic of Athens with a diagnosis of ACS were enrolled in the study. All patients were classified according to heart failure phenotypes. One-month, 1-, 2- and 10-year follow-up examinations were performed (75% participation rate).Overweight was defined as 25≤BMI≤29.9kg/m2 and obesity as BMI >29.9kg/m2.BMI status and 10-year ACS prognosis followed a J-shape association (p=.009). Overweight patients had significantly better ACS prognosis than their normal- counterparts (OR=.45, 95% CI (.23, .90)).

In this paper, sulfamethazine (SMT) sorption onto six types of microplastics, including polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was investigated by experimental and molecular dynamics simulation methods. The experimental results indicated that SMX sorption reached equilibrium within 16 h. The kinetics of SMT sorption by PA, PVC, PE, and PP could be fitted by pseudo first-order model, while SMT sorption by PA and PET could be described by pseudo second-order model. The partition coefficient K values were 38.7, 23.5, 21., 22.6, 18.6 and .1 L·kg for PA, PE, , PET, PVC and PP, respectively. SMT sorption onto microplastics decreased when pH and salinity increased.

In order to optimize the cytometric sex-sorting procedure, effects of Hoechst33342 staining on the viability and cytometric sorting efficiency of frozen-thawed ram sperm were evaluated. The frozen-thawed sperm were stained with Hoechst33342 at various dye concentrations (80 μM, 120 μM, 160 μM, 200 μM, 240 μM, or 320 μM) for 45 min to evaluate effects of dye dose. The frozen-thawed sperm were stained with 160 μM Hoechst33342 for various durations ( min,  min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 75 min, or 90 min) to evaluate effects of staining duration. Sperm motility and moving velocity were analyzed using a computer-assisted sperm analysis system (CASAS). Acrosome status, membrane integrity, and distribution of phosphatidylserine () in Hoechst33342-stained sperm were analyzed using flow cytometry after staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled lectin from pisum sativum (FITC-PSA), Annexin V, or propidium iodide (PI). The fertility of Hoechst33342-stained sperm was analyzed by in vitro fertilization (IVF). A high-speed cell sorter was used to evaluate effects of Hoechst33342 staining on cytometric sex-sorting of frozen-thawed sperm. The motility, moving velocity, membrane integrity, and  distribution of Hoechst33342-stained sperm were significantly different from that of immediately thawed sperm (P<.05). However, there is no significant difference existing among the Hoechst33342-stained groups with respect to the above evaluated parameters. Additionally, along with the staining durations, the adverse effects of the staining procedure on sperm showed a steady increase. However, Hoechst33342 staining did not damage acrosome and in vitro fertilizing capability of frozen-thawed ram sperm. Results of cytometric sorting indicated that frozen-thawed sperm can be efficiently sorted into two sperm populations with X and Y chromosome when the Hoechst33342 concentration was 160 μM. Moreover, when the staining duration was equal to or longer than 45 min, the frozen-thawed sperm can be successfully sorted in the presence of 160μM Hoechst33342. In conclusion, Hoechst33342 staining can detrimentally influence viability of frozen-thawed ram sperm except acrosome and in vitro fertilizing capability. Accordingly, the minimum values of Hoechst33342 concentration and staining duration can be set at 160 μM and 45 min respectively. However, the maximum values of Hoechst33342 concentration and staining duration were not determined based on the current study. Further research on how to reduce injuries caused by freezing, thawing, and Hoechst33342 staining on frozen-thawed ram sperm is needed.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In utero tobacco smoke exposure produces somatic growth deficits like intrauterine growth restriction and low birth  in offspring, but it can also negatively influence neurodevelopmental outcomes in later stages of life, such as an increased incidence of obesity and drug abuse. Animal models demonstrate that prenatal nicotine (PN) alters the development of the mesocorticolimbic system, which is important for organizing goal-directed behavior. In the present study, we determined whether intravenous (IV) PN altered the initiation and/or expression of methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor sensitization as a measure of mesocorticolimbic function in adult rat offspring. We also determined whether PN and/or METH exposure altered protein levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the nucleus accumbens, the dorsal striatum, and the prefrontal cortex of adult offspring. BDNF was of interest because of its role in the development and maintenance of the mesocorticolimbic pathway and its ability to modulate neural processes that contribute to drug abuse, such as sensitization of the dopamine system. Dams were injected with IV nicotine (.05 mg/kg/injection) or saline, 3×/day on gestational days 8-21. Testing was conducted when offspring reached adulthood (around postnatal day 90). Following 3 once daily habituation sessions the animals received a saline injection and baseline locomotor activity was measured. PN and prenatal saline ()-exposed offspring then received 10 once daily injections of METH (.3 mg/kg) to induce locomotor sensitization. The animals received a METH injection (.3 mg/kg) to assess the expression of sensitization following a 14-day period of no injections. A day later, all animals were injected with saline and conditioned hyperactivity was assessed. Brain tissue was harvested 24 h later. PN animals habituated more slowly to the activity chambers compared to  controls. PN rats treated with METH showed significant enhancement of locomotor behavior compared to  rats following acute and repeated injections; however, PN did not produce differential initiation or expression of behavioral sensitization. METH produced conditioned hyperactivity, and PN rats exhibited a greater conditioned response of hyperactivity relative to controls. PN and METH exposure produced changes in BDNF protein levels in all three regions, and complex interactions were observed between these two factors. Logistic regression revealed that BDNF protein levels, throughout the mesocorticolimbic system, significantly predicted the difference in the conditioned hyperactive response of the animals: both correlations were significant, but the predicted relationship between BDNF and context-elicited activity was stronger in the PN (r = .67) compared to the  rats (r = .42). These findings indicate that low-dose PN exposure produces long-term changes in activity and enhanced sensitivity to the locomotor effects of METH. The enhanced METH-induced contextual conditioning shown by the PN animals suggests that offspring of in utero tobacco smoke exposure have greater susceptibility to learn about drug-related conditional stimuli, such as the context. The PN-induced alterations in mesocorticolimbic BDNF protein lend further support for the hypothesis that maternal smoking during pregnancy produces alterations in neuronal plasticity that contribute to drug abuse vulnerability. The current findings demonstrate that these changes are persistent into adulthood.© 2016 S.

The simulations are performed at collision energies Ei of 5., 13.5, 22.5, 30.00, and 70 eV, and incident angles ° (normal) and 45° (grazing). Excellent agreement with experiment (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, 9703-9714) is found for both the average fraction and distribution of the collision  transferred to the ala2-H(+) internal degrees of freedom. The dominant pathway for this  transfer is to ala2-H(+) vibration, but for Ei = 5. eV ∼20% of the  transfer is to ala2-H(+) rotation.  transfer to ala2-H(+) rotation decreases with increase in Ei and becomes negligible at high Ei. Three types of collisions are observed in the simulations: i.e. those for which ala2-H(+) (1) directly scatters off the F-SAM surface; (2) sticks/physisorbs on/in the surface, but desorbs within the 10  numerical integration of the simulations; and (3) remains trapped (i.e. soft-landed) on/in the surface when the simulations are terminated. Penetration of the F-SAM by ala2-H(+) is important for the latter two types of events. The trapped trajectories are expected to have relatively long residence times on the surface, since a previous molecular dynamics simulation (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2014, 118, 5577-5588) shows that thermally accommodated ala2-H(+) ions have an binding  with the F-SAM surface of at least ∼ kcal mol(-1).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310128>Temperature Dependence of the  Transfer in LHCII Studied by Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>We measured two-dimensional electronic spectra of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) at various temperatures (77, 110, 150, 230, and 295 K) under conditions free from singlet-singlet annihilation.

This Phase I study was performed to establish the safety, tolerability, recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and preliminary clinical activity of ganetespib in previously treated patients with advanced HCC.Patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, progression on or intolerance to sorafenib, and ECOG  ≤ 1 were enrolled in a standard 3x3 dose escalation study at doses of 100 mg/m(2), 150 mg/m(2), and 200 mg/m(2) IV given on days 1, 8, and  of each 28-day cycle. Objective response by RECIST version 1.1 criteria was evaluated by CT/MRI every 8 weeks.Fourteen patients were enrolled in this trial and received at least one dose of the study drug. Of the 14 patients: median age, 57 years old; male 71 %; Asian 36 %; HCC etiology (HBV 36 %, HCV 43 %, Hemachromatosis 7 %, unknown 21 %); Child Pugh Class (A 93 %, B 7 %); median number of prior treatments 2; median baseline AFP 70.1 ng/mL. The RP2D was determined to be 200 mg/m(2). The most commonly seen AEs were diarrhea (93 %), fatigue (71 %), AST elevation (64 %), and hyperglycemia (64 %). The most common Gr 3/4 AEs were hyperglycemia (21 %) and lipasemia (21 %). One (7 %) patient had a fatal AE, septic shock, within 30 days of receiving the study drug. One dose-limiting toxicity, grade 3 lipasemia, was observed at the 100 mg/m(2) dose. Pharmacokinetics studies showed a t1/2, CL, Tmax, and Vss of 6.45 h, 48.28 L/h (25.56 L/h/m(2)), .76 h, and 191 L (100.4 L/m(2)), respectively. No objective responses were seen; one patient (7 %) had stable disease at 16 weeks. Median time to progression was 1.8 months, and median overall survival was 7.2 months.Ganetespib had a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced HCC who had progressed on at least one line of systemic therapy. The pharmacokinetic profile showed that ganetespib exposure in patients with mild hepatic dysfunction is similar to that seen in patients with normal liver function.

Desflurane FA and consumption during the first 40 min were compared using repeated measures one-way ANOVA.Age and  did not differ between the groups (P > .05), but patients in the Zeus group were taller (P = .04). In the Zeus group, the desflurane FA was lower during the first 3 min (P < .05), identical at 4 min (P > .05), and slightly higher after 4 min (P < .05). Desflurane consumption was higher in the Zeus group at all times, a difference that persisted after correcting for the small difference in FA between the two groups.Agent consumption with an automated closed-circuit anesthesia machine is higher than with a conventional anesthesia machine when the latter is used with a specific vaporizer-FGF sequence. Agent consumption during automated delivery might be further reduced by optimizing the algorithm(s) that manages the initial FGF or by tolerating some N₂ in the circuit to minimize the need for intermittent flushing.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406049>Prevalence and correlates of physical activity among children and adolescents: a cross-sectional population-based study of a rural city in Japan.</a></h2><p>Although moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has multiple health benefits, current participation in recommended MVPA level and its determinants among Japanese children and adolescents remain unclear.

The PLR and prognostic score () were calculated according to the following formulae: PLR (%) = 100*Graft  (g)/standard liver volume of the donor (mL);  = -84.6 + .933*PLR (%) +1.11*ICGR15 (%) +.999*age (years); Standard liver volume (mL) = 706.2*body surface area (m2) + 2.39. No serious complications occurred after the donor operations. Maximal bilirubin ranged from 1.9 to 10.9 mg/dL. There were no mortalities, although there were two morbidities, bile leakage and prolonged liver dysfunction.

Each diet was fed to 120 conventionally caged Lohmann LSL lite hens in groups of 12, from 27 to 46 wk of age, and its effects on performance and feather covering were assessed. Data were analyzed by regression analysis, and the significance level was chosen at P ≤ .05. Hen-day egg production (HDP) was high (97.05%) and unaffected by  concentration for  to 10 wk of the trial, followed by a quadratic-shaped HDP, with an estimated maximum at 67%  concentration, for the 10 to 20 wk period of the trial. Overall ( to 20 wk), HDP increased linearly with . No effect on egg weight was found (average weight = 59.6±2.1 g), but eggshells were thickest at the 55%  concentration. Body weight gain was affected by  concentration and maximized at 49% . Body weight uniformity and mortality were not affected by dietary treatment. Feed intake increased linearly with  from 102 to 109 g/hen/d, while feed: egg mass ratio was minimal at 26% . Using a scale from 1 to 4 per body part (neck, wings, back, vent and breast), only neck feather cover increased linearly with , from 3. (% ) to 3.2/4 (100% ). However, back and total feather coverage showed a trend (P = .054 and P = .079 respectively) to increase linearly with  as well (from 3.7 to 3.9/4 and .6 to 16.6/20, respectively). In summary, feeding  at low to intermediate concentrations improved laying hen performance. Further research should focus on the mechanisms involved in this effect.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25641780>Protamine sulfate precipitation method depletes abundant plant seed-storage proteins: A case study on legume plants.</a></h2><p>Depletion of abundant proteins is one of the effective ways to improve detection and identification of low-abundance proteins. Our previous study showed that protamine sulfate precipitation (PSP) method can deplete abundant ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) from leaf proteins and is suitable for their in-depth proteome investigation. In this study, we provide evidence that the PSP method can also be effectively used for depletion of abundant seed-storage proteins (SSPs) from the total seed proteins of diverse legume plants including soybean, broad bean, pea, wild soybean, and peanut. The .05% protamine sulfate () was sufficient to deplete major SSPs from all legumes tested except for peanut where .1%  was required. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and 2DE analyses of -treated soybean and peanut seed proteins showed enriched spots in -supernatant than total proteins. Coefficient of variation percentage (%CV) and principal component analysis of 2DE spots support the reproducibility, suitability, and efficacy of the PSP method for quantitative and comparative seed proteome analysis. MALDI-TOF-TOF successfully identified some protein spots from soybean and peanut. Hence, this simple, reproducible, economical PSP method has a broader application in depleting plant abundant proteins including SSPs in addition to RuBisCO, allowing discussion for comprehensive proteome establishment and parallel comparative studies in plants.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We examined the association of 11 risk factors with adverse outcomes in a population-based prospective cohort observational study of Alaska Native/American Indian persons with chronic HCV infection.We collected data from a population-based cohort study of liver-related adverse outcomes of infection in American Indian/Alaska Native persons with chronic HCV living in Alaska, recruited from 1995 through 2012. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for end-stage liver disease (ESLD; presence of ascites, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, or coagulopathy), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related death using a Cox proportional hazards model.We enrolled 1080 participants followed up for 11,171 person-years (mean, 10.3 person-years); 66%, 19%, and 14% were infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On multivariate analysis, persons infected with HCV genotype 3 had a significantly increased risk of developing all 3 adverse outcomes. Their aHR for ESLD was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.5-3.), their aHR for HCC was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.4-6.6), and their aHR for liver-related death was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.5-4.) compared with genotype 1. Heavy alcohol use was an age-adjusted risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.2), and liver-related death (aHR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.8-4.6).  was a risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.-1.9), and diabetes was a risk factor for ESLD (aHR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2).

The macroscopic characteristics of HGM were documented. Biopsies were obtained and observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Helicobacter pylori  was examined by Whartin-Starry staining.HGM was observed in 420 Chinese patients, yielding a prevalence of .4%. The majority of patients had a single patch (300/420; 71.4%), while the remainder had two (84/420; 20%) or multiple patches (36/420; 8.6%). The size of the patches and the distance from the patch to the frontal incisor teeth varied significantly. The large majority of HGM patches were flat (393/420; 93.6%), whereas the remaining patches were slightly elevated. The primary histological characteristic was fundic-type (216/420; 51.4%) within the HGM patch, and antral- (43/420; 10.2%) and transitional-type (65/420; .5%) mucosa were also observed. The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia was 3.1% (13/420) and the prevalence of dysplasia was 1.4% (6/420), indicating the necessity for endoscopic follow-up in patients with HGM. Esophageal and extraesophageal complaints were also observed in patients with HGM. Dysphagia and epigastric discomfort (odds ratios: 6.836 and 115.826, respectively;  < .05) were independent risk factors for HGM.Clinical complaints should be considered to improve the detection rate of HMG.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies was undertaken to summarize the association between abdominal  and the risk of hip fracture. We searched online databases for relevant publications up to February 2017, using relevant keywords. In total, 14 studies were included in the systematic review and 9 studies, with a total sample size of 295,674 individuals (129,964 men and 165,703 women), were included in the meta-analysis. Participants were apparently healthy and aged ≥40 y. We found that abdominal  (defined by various waist-hip ratios) was positively associated with the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.46,  = .01). Combining 8 effect sizes from 6 studies, we noted a marginally significant positive association between abdominal  (defined by various waist circumferences) and the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.36; 95% CI: .97, 1.89,  = .07). This association became significant in a fixed-effects model (combined effect size: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.58,  < .001). Based on 5 effect sizes, we found that a .1-U increase in the waist-hip ratio was associated with a 16% increase in the risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.29,  = .007), whereas a 10-cm increase in waist circumference was not significantly associated with a higher risk of hip fracture (combined RR: 1.13, 95% CI: .94, 1.36,  = .19). This association became significant, however, when we applied a fixed-effects model (combined effect size: 1.21, 95% CI: 1., 1.27,  < .001).

Study participants included 145 obese adolescents (mean age = .3 years; 68% female; 46% black; mean BMI = 50.6) referred to pediatric  management programs. Participants completed generic (PedsQL) and -specific (Impact of  on Quality of Life-Kids (IWQOL-Kids)) HRQOL measures. Generic and -specific measures indicated global (e.g., all domains) HRQOL impairment and significant differences by race. Physical, emotional, and social scores of the PedsQL ( < .01) and the physical comfort and body esteem scores of the IWQOL-Kids ( < .001) were significantly higher for black compared to white adolescents with extreme obesity. Extremely obese adolescents pursuing bariatric surgery reported similar HRQOL to adolescents pursuing behavioral treatment (n = 30 matched pairs). HRQOL did not differ for extremely obese adolescents based on type of treatment sought, but race/ethnicity should be considered when characterizing these youth. Although racial differences in adolescent body image/esteem have been reported, it is unknown why black adolescents with extreme obesity would report less impact of  on their physical functioning.

Slight and insignificant change in blood volume was observed in most of the tissues and brain regions between vehicle- and PG-administered groups. TU for the three PG was markedly high in kidney and lung (2388-3952 ng/g), exceeding the blood concentration (2021-2320 ng/ml), but low (less than 10% of the blood concentration) in epididymis, epididymal , testis (59-163 ng/g), brain and spinal cord (33-67 ng/g). TU in brain were detected about .1% of the administered PG. Based on a two-compartment model, the  product for the three PG ranged from .75 to 4.16 microliters/g/sec in the latter tissues. The value of brain was 1.22 +/- .18 microliters/g/sec for PGD2, 1.69 +/- .05 for PGE2 and 1.33 +/- .13 for PGF2 alpha, indicating that PGE2 enters the brain more readily than PGD2 and PGF2 alpha. In various brain structures, the ranges of the  product were large and completely overlapped among the three PG (PGD2, .14-1.56 microliters/g/sec; PGE2, .05-1.78; PGF2 alpha, .05-1.82). The highest  product for the three PG was found in olfactory bulb and cerebellum (.96-1.82 microliters/g/sec) and the lowest was in septum (.05-.53).

Exclusion criteria were: left ventricular dysfunction, left-sided valvular heart disease, other right-sided structural heart disease, chronic hypertension, substance addiction, and incomplete follow-up. Pregnancies were divided into three groups: absent or mild PI, moderate PI, and severe PI. A generalized linear model with normal dependent variable distribution was built and the parameter estimation made with Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) to take into account repeated mother in data. Variables such as gestational age at birth, maternal age, smoking, and body mass index were tested with bivariate analyses to assess their effect on BW. Only gestational age remained in the adjusted model.A total of 45 patients were included (33 TOF and 12 ) and 97 pregnancies were reported: 22 miscarriages (22.7%) ( TOF, 7 ) and 75 successful pregnancies (57 TOF, 18 ). The patients were divided into three groups: 1) absent or mild PI, 2) moderate PI, and 3) severe PI groups, which comprised, respectively, 29 ( TOF, 4 ), 20 (10 TOF, 1 ), and 26 successful pregnancies (8 TOF, 7 ). Using three levels of PI (absent or mild, moderate, and severe), the unadjusted model showed a significant effect of level of PI on BW (p = .0118), as well as the adjusted model (p = .0263) with gestational age as a covariate. The estimated mean newborn's BW was 3055.8 g in the severe PI group, 3151. g in the moderate PI group, and 3376.4 g in the absent or mild group when adjusted for gestational age.

We studied the associations between multiple sources of appearance-related pressures, including pressure to be thin and pressure to increase muscularity, and emotional eating in 300 adolescents (M=.3, SD=1.4, 60% female). Controlling for age, race, puberty, body mass index (BMI) z-score, and sex, both pressure to be thin and pressure to be more muscular from same-sex peers were positively associated with emotional eating in response to feeling angry/frustrated and unsettled (<.05). Pressure from same-sex peers to be more muscular also was associated with eating when depressed (p<.05), and muscularity pressure from opposite-sex peers related to eating in response to anger/frustration (p<.05).

After challenge with either 30 microg/kg or 60 microg/kg BW PG-, TNF-alpha increased in the posterior vena cava. Concentrations of SAA and Hp in the jugular increased after challenge with 60 microg/kg BW PG-. Only half (5/10) of the ewes treated with 60 microg/kg BW PG- had ultrasonically visible embryos, and none of them had functional corpora lutea (CL) (<1 ng/mL of P(4)) on day 21. On the other hand, 8/9 (88.9%) control ewes had visible embryos and all had functional CL on day 21. Using logistic regression, pregnancy on day 21 was predicted to depend on concentrations of TNF-alpha and Hp on day 5 and concentration of P(4) on day 14. In summary, injection of PG- on day 5 after mating resulted in fever; increased concentrations of TNF-alpha, Hp, and SAA on the day of and the day after the PG- challenge; and decreased concentrations of P(4) on days 14 and 21. These factors were related to failure to establish pregnancy.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates whether the efficacy of optimal protein intake levels for protein retention in the elderly is influenced by protein quality.We investigated the effect of a 10-day adequate-protein (AP) or high-protein (HP) diet together with the protein source as caseins (CAS) or soluble milk proteins (PRO) on whole-body (WB) protein synthesis () and protein breakdown (PB) in 4 groups of healthy elderly men (mean ± SEM: 71.8 ± 24.4 yr). The study consisted of two periods of 4 h each: a post-absorptive period and a postprandial period. The fed state was defined by consumption every 20 min and for 4 h, of either  g or 30 g of PRO or CAS. Steady-state WB and splanchnic leucine kinetics were measured using a continuous infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine in the postabsorptive state and L-[1-13C]leucine infusion plus oral L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine in the postprandial state.WB  was stimulated by feeding only with HP diets, whereas WB PB corrected for splanchnic extraction showed a similar pattern of post-feeding decrease in all groups. Consequently, net leucine balance was greater in the postprandial state after HP meals than after AP meals, with PRO meals leading to a better postprandial leucine balance (3.63 ± .16 μmol kg FFM(-1) min(-1)vs. 2.77 ± .21 μmol kg FFM(-1) min(-1) for PRO HP and CAS HP, respectively; P = .005).Postprandial protein retention was better improved in elderly men by an increase in protein intake when the protein supplementation was provided as fast-digesting proteins that induce high leucine availability.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Meanwhile, serum lipid profiles and  enzymes were estimated using standard clinical laboratory methods. The SNP-SNP interactions were analyzed by performing multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR).The genotype and allele frequencies of the SAMM50 polymorphisms between the NAFLD group and the control group were significantly different (all  < .05). In the multivariate analysis adjusted for gender, age, and body mass index, the carriers of the rs738491 T allele, rs2143571 A allele, and rs3761472 G allele had significantly increased susceptibility to NAFLD (OR, 1.507; 95% CI, 1.035 to 2.195; P = .032; OR, 1.761; 95% CI, 1.232 to 2.517; P = .002; OR, 1.483; 95% CI, 1.039 to 2.115; P = .030, respectively). Moreover, the rs738491 T allele carriers had significantly higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P = .017) than did the noncarriers. However, differences in the levels of serum triglyceride (TG) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not statistically significant (P = .123; P = .107). The Rs2143571 A allele and the rs3761472 G allele were both deeply associated with increased levels of serum TG, ALT, and AST (all  < .05). Furthermore, the MDR and GMDR showed that a synergistic relationship might exist between rs738491, rs2143571, and rs3761472 in the SAMM50 gene and the pathophysiology and genetics of NAFLD.We first demonstrated that the rs738491 T allele, rs2143571 A allele, and rs3761472 G allele in the SAMM50 gene created susceptibility to NAFLD in a Chinese Han population.

The present study, which was part of the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS LOST) trial, investigated whether the fat and protein content of four different diets affected changes in specific food cravings in overweight and obese adults. A sample of 811 adults were recruited across two clinical sites, and each participant was randomly assigned to one of four macronutrient prescriptions: 1) low fat (20% of energy), average protein (% of energy); 2) moderate fat (40%), average protein (%); 3) low fat (20%), high protein (25%); 4) moderate fat (40%), high protein (25%). With few exceptions, the type of diet that participants were assigned did not differentially affect changes in specific food cravings. Participants assigned to the high-fat diets, however, had reduced cravings for carbohydrates at month 12 (p<.05) and fruits and vegetables at month 24. Also, participants assigned to high-protein diets had increased cravings for sweets at month 6 and month 12 (<.05). Participants in all four dietary conditions reported significant reductions in food cravings for specific types of foods (i.e., high fat foods, fast food fats, sweets, and carbohydrates/starches; all <.05). Cravings for fruits and vegetables, however, were increased at month 24 (p<.05).

In this study, we presented a novel low-cost DOI detector design with four crystals coupling to one SiPM, based on the method of rectangular light-sharing window (RLSW). A prototype detector was constructed, calibrated, and assessed using the methods of homogeneous radiation and flood map analysis.The DOI detector was constructed with a 4 × 4 array of lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystals (2.95 mm × 2.95 mm × 20 mm ), barium sulfate (BaSO ) reflectors, and optical glues. A RLSW 7 mm in height was deployed in the BaSO reflectors. A non-DOI detector with identical dimensions and without RLSW was also constructed for comparison. The light-output surface of the detector was air-coupled with a 4 × 4 array of SiPMs (3 mm × 3 mm ). The signals generated from the 16 SiPMs were read out by a custom-designed electronic system, and the signals from four adjacent 3 mm SiPMs were summed into one signal to emulate a 2 × 2 array of 6 mm SiPMs. The RLSW caused the DOI-related position shifts of the crystal spots in the flood map. A homogeneous radiation method was used to establish the transfer functions to convert the spot shifts measured from the flood map into DOI measurements. The accuracy of the DOI measurements was assessed with data acquired using the conventional collimated radiation method.All 16 crystals are distinctly separated from each other in the flood map. Twelve crystals, including four central crystals and eight edge crystals, have the DOI capability. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the DOI measurements of the central crystals and the edge crystals are 3.06 ± .08 and 3.79 ± . mm, respectively, for the configuration with four crystals coupling to one SiPM. By contrast, the FWHMs (3.98 ± .16 and 5.12 ± .38 mm, respectively) are slightly worse for the configuration with one crystal coupling to one SiPM. The average and standard deviation (STD) of the FWHM  resolutions of the DOI detector and non-DOI detector were 10.2% ± .7% and 10.7% ± 1.7%, respectively. Their FWHM coincidence timing resolutions were 197. ± 9.6 and 206.4 ± 13.3 , respectively. The RLSW had no significant impact on the  resolutions and timing resolutions of the DOI detector.The novel four-crystals-to-one-SiPM coupling technology is a cost-efficient approach to construct high-performance detector modules with DOI capability. The methods of homogeneous radiation and flood map analysis are easy to perform and of good performance. Those methods can be adapted in the clinic PET scanners to enable the capability of DOI measurements.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23863116>Educational outcome in adolescence following pyloric stenosis repair before 3 months of age: a nationwide cohort study.</a></h2><p>Immature animals exposed to anesthetics display apoptotic neurodegeneration with subsequent long-term cognitive dysfunctions.

This study investigated the association between exposure to surgery and anesthesia for pyloric stenosis () before 3 months of age and subsequent educational outcome in adolescence.This nationwide unselected register-based follow-up study of the Danish birth cohorts 1986-1990 compared the educational outcome of all children having undergone surgery for  before 3 months of age with a randomly selected, age-matched 5% sample of the same cohort. Primary analysis compared the average test scores at ninth grade adjusting for gender, birth , and parental age and education. Secondary analysis compared the proportions not attaining the test scores between the two groups.The exposure group comprised 779 and the control group consisted of 14 665 individuals. Although the exposure group performed lower than the control group (average score .17 lower, 95% CI: .08-.25), after adjusting for known confounders, no statistically significant difference (-.04, 95% CI: -.09 to .08) between the 2 groups could be demonstrated. However, we found an odds ratio (OR) for test score nonattainment-associated  repair of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.11-1.68).Children operated for  before 3 months of age have educational performance tests similar to the background population at age -16 years after adjusting for known confounders.

Herein we prepared a series of  microspheres via a simple dispersion polymerization and then used them as coating materials for paper spray mass spectrometry (MS) in high-sensitivity analysis of various therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrixes. In the preparation of -coated papers, the coating method was found playing a key role in determining the performance of the resulting paper substrate in addition to other parameters (e.g., starch type and amount,  coating amount, and spray solvent). We also found that as a solvent was applied on -coated paper for paper spray, the analytes of interest would be first extracted out and then moved to the tip of paper triangle for spray along with the applied solvent. In the process, the surface  of  particles had a strong impact on the desorption performance of analytes from -coated paper substrate, and the  with a high surface  favored the elution of analytes to allow a high MS sensitivity. When the prepared  coated paper was used as a substrate for paper spray, it gave high sensitivity in analysis of therapeutic drugs in various biological matrixes such as whole blood, serum, and urine with excellent repeatability and reproducibility. In contrast to uncoated filter paper, an improvement of 10-546-fold in sensitivity was achieved using -coated paper for paper spray, and an estimated lower limit of quantitation (LLOQs) in the range of .004-.084 ng mL was obtained.

Compared to typical ligand systems, the NHC ligands provide Fe complexes with longer-lived metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states. This increased lifetime is ascribed to strong ligand field splitting provided by the NHC ligands that raises the  levels of the metal centered (MC) states and therefore reduces the deactivation efficiency of MLCT states. Among currently known NHC systems, [Fe(btbip)] (btbip = 2,6-bis(3--butyl-imidazol-1-ylidene)pyridine) is a unique complex as it exhibits a short-lived MC state with a lifetime on the scale of a few hundreds of picoseconds. Hence, this complex allows for a detailed investigation, using 100  X-ray pulses from a synchrotron, of strong ligand field effects on the intermediate MC state in an NHC complex. Here, we use time-resolved wide angle X-ray scattering (TRWAXS) aided by density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the molecular structure, energetics and lifetime of the high- MC state in the Fe-NHC complex [Fe(btbip)] after excitation to the MLCT manifold. We identify it as a 260  metal-centered quintet (MC) state, and we refine the molecular structure of the excited-state complex verifying the DFT results. Using information about the hydrodynamic state of the solvent, we also determine, for the first time, the  of the MC state as .75 ± . eV. Our results demonstrate that due to the increased ligand field strength caused by NHC ligands, upon transition from the ground state to the MC state, the metal to ligand bonds extend by unusually large values: by .29 Å in the axial and .21 Å in the equatorial direction. These results imply that the transition in the photochemical properties from typical Fe complexes to novel NHC compounds is manifested not only in the destabilization of the MC states, but also in structural distortion of these states.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8640202>Effects of weight cycling on the resting energy expenditure and body composition of obese women.</a></h2><p>Numerous reports have suggested that cycles of weight loss and regain (i.e., weight cycling) are associated with adverse health consequences, a concern that may lead some obese individuals to forgo weight control efforts.

Essentially the same lifetimes were obtained after excess energy excitation at 400 nm, but S1-Sn becomes broader, indicating a larger conformation disorder in the S1 state after 400 nm excitation compared to excitation into the - band of the S2 state.

Crystal structures of arginine kinase in an open, substrate-free form and closed, transition state analog (TSA) complex indicate that the enzyme undergoes substantial domain and loop rearrangements required for substrate binding, catalysis, and product release. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has shown that substrate-free arginine kinase is rigid on the -ns timescale (average S=.84±.08) yet quite dynamic on the µs-ms timescale (35 residues with R, 12%), and that movements of the N-terminal domain and the loop comprising residues I182-G209 are rate-limiting on catalysis. Here, NMR of the TSA-bound enzyme shows similar rigidity on the -ns timescale (average S=.91±.05) and substantially increased μs-ms timescale dynamics (77 residues; 22%). Many of the residues displaying μs-ms dynamics in NMR Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) N backbone relaxation dispersion experiments of the TSA complex are also dynamic in substrate-free enzyme. However, the presence of additional dynamic residues in the TSA-bound form suggests that dynamics extend through much of the C-terminal domain, which indicates that in the closed form, a larger fraction of the protein takes part in conformational transitions to the excited state(s). Conformational exchange rate constants (k) of the TSA complex are all approximately 2500s, higher than any observed in the substrate-free enzyme (800-1900s). Elevated μs-ms timescale protein dynamics in the TSA-bound enzyme is more consistent with recently postulated catalytic networks involving multiple interconnected states at each step of the reaction, rather than a classical single stabilized transition state.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The primary endpoint was the risk of a composite cardiovascular (CV) outcome (hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization). We estimated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for >100 baseline characteristics.Patient characteristics were well balanced after -matching. The mean age was 55 years and mean follow-up was .8 years. Linagliptin conferred a similar risk of the composite CV outcome compared to other DPP-4 inhibitors (HR .91, 95% CI .79-1.05) and pioglitazone (HR .98, 95% CI .84-1.), and showed a reduced risk of CV outcomes compared to second-generation sulphonylureas (HR .76, 95% CI .64--.92). Key findings were signalled at the first interim analysis in June 2013 and solidified during ongoing monitoring until 2015.Analyses from a large monitoring programme in routine care of patients with T2D, showed that linagliptin had similar CV safety compared to other DPP-4 inhibitors and pioglitazone, and a reduced CV risk compared to sulphonylureas.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29343077>Delayed Onset of Sleep in Adolescents With PAX6 Haploinsufficiency.</a></h2><p>PAX6 haploinsufficiency ( +/-) can occur due to mutations involving only PAX6 in patients with isolated aniridia or as contiguous gene deletions in patients with Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and range of developmental and intellectual disabilities syndrome.

However, this remains controversial in deceased donor renal transplantation (DDRT) maintained on tacrolimus (TAC)/mycophenolic acid (MPA) with or without steroids.We studied the United Network for Organ Sharing Registry for patients receiving DDRT from 2000 to 2012 maintained on TAC/MPA at transplantation hospital discharge (n=74,627) to compare outcomes of IL2-RA and other induction agents. We initially divided the cohort into two groups on the basis of steroid use at the time of discharge: steroid (n=59,010) versus no steroid (n=,617). Each group was stratified into induction categories: IL2-RA, rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG), alemtuzumab, and no induction. The main outcomes were incidence of acute rejection within the first year and overall graft failure (defined as graft failure and/or death) post-transplantation. Propensity score (), specifically inverse probability of treatment , analysis was used to minimize selection bias caused by nonrandom assignment of induction therapies.Median (25th, 75th percentiles) follow-up times were 3.9 (1.1, 5.9) and 3.2 (1.1, 4.9) years for steroid and no steroid groups, respectively. Acute rejection within the first year and overall graft failure within 5 years of transplantation were more common in the no induction category (13.3%; P<.001 and 28%; P=.01, respectively) in the steroid group and the IL2-RA category (11.1%; P=.16 and 27.4%; P<.001, respectively) in the no steroid group. Compared with IL2-RA, -weighted and covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic and Cox analyses showed that outcomes in the steroid group were similar among induction categories, except that acute rejection was significantly lower with r-ATG (odds ratio [OR], .68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], .62 to .74). In the no steroid group, compared with IL2-RA, odds of acute rejection with r-ATG (OR, .80; 95% CI, .60 to 1.00) and alemtuzumab (OR, .68; 95% CI, .53 to .88) were lower, and r-ATG was associated with better graft survival (hazard ratio, .86; 95% CI, .75 to .99).In DDRT, compared with IL2-RA induction, no induction was associated with similar outcomes when TAC/MPA/steroids were used. r-ATG seems to offer better graft survival over IL2-RA in steroid avoidance protocols.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252031>The Impact of Vaccination and Prior Exposure on Stool Shedding of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi in 6 Controlled Human Infection Studies.</a></h2><p>Shedding of Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi in the stool or urine leads to contamination of food or water, which is a prerequisite for transmission of enteric fever. Currently, there are limited data on the effect of vaccination or prior exposure on stool shedding.Six Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi human challenge studies were conducted between 2011 and 2017. Participants were either unvaccinated or vaccinated with 1 of 4 vaccines: Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-), Vi-tetanus-toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT), live oral Ty21a vaccine, or an experimental vaccine (M01ZH09). Daily stool cultures were collected for 14 days after challenge.There were 4934 stool samples collected from 430 volunteers. Participants who received Vi- or Vi-TT shed less than unvaccinated participants (odds ratio [OR], .34; 95% confidence interval [CI], .-.77; P = .010 and OR, .41; 95% CI, .19-.91, P = .029 for Vi- and Vi-TT, respectively). Higher anti-Vi immunoglobulin G titers were associated with less shedding of S. Typhi (P < .0001). A nonsignificant reduction in shedding was associated with Ty21a vaccine (OR, .57; 95% CI, .27-1.20; P = .140). Individuals previously exposed to S.

In those -bearing activities, postural stability () plays an important role. Correlations among foot type, , and other musculoskeletal problems that increase sport injury risk are known. However, long-term associations among the foot type, the , and body  (BW) distribution are lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to longitudinally identify changes in foot morphology, , and symmetry in BW distribution during adolescence among elite male soccer players.Thirty-five Czech elite male soccer players (age, .49 ± .61 years; BW, 64.11 ± 6.16 kg; body height, 174.62 ± 5.71 cm) underwent foot type, , and BW distribution measurements during 3 consecutive years (T1, T2, T3). The Chippaux-Smirak index (CSI), BW distribution, and centre of pressure (COP) displacement (total traveled way [TTW]) of each player for the preferred (PL) and non-preferred leg (NL) were acquired. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA), Bonferroni´s post hoc tests, and partial eta-squared (ηp2) coefficient were used for investigating the effect of time on selected variables and effect size evaluation.Statistically significant effect of time on CSI values (PL: F2,68 = 5.08, p < .01, ηp2 = .13 and NL: F2,68 = 10.87, p < .01, ηp2 = .24) and COP displacement values (PL: F2,68 = 5.07, p <.01, ηp2 = .13; NL: F2,68 = 3.53, p <.05, ηp2 = .09) for both legs over 3-years period was identified. Furthermore, the Bonferroni´s post hoc analysis revealed a significant improvement of  values in the PL (TTWT1 = 1617.11 ± 520.22 mm vs. TTWT2 = 1405.29 ± 462.76, p < .05; and between TTWT1 = 1617.11 ± 520.22 mm vs. TTWT3 = 1370.46 ± 373.94, p < .05). Only BW distribution parameter showed no significant differences, although slightly improved over time.We observed changes in foot typology, , and BW distribution in young elite male soccer players during 3 consecutive years. Results demonstrated that changes in  and body  distribution under the high-load sport conditions during adolescence may improve with aging, except for foot morphology. Therefore, foot morphology should be carefully monitored to minimize sport injury risk in professional young soccer players during adolescence.

MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) plays an oncogenic role and is associated with BRAF mutation and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. EZH2 is functionally considered to suppress miR-31 expression in human cancers; however, no study has reported its relationship with colon cancer. We therefore evaluated EZH2 expression using immunohistochemistry and assessed miR-31 and epigenetic alterations using 301 colorectal carcinomas and 207 premalignant lesions. Functional analysis was performed to identify the association between EZH2 and miR-31 using cancer cell lines. In the current study, negative, weak, moderate, and strong EZH2 expressions were observed in %, 19%, 25%, and 41% of colorectal cancers, respectively. EZH2 was inversely associated with miR-31 (P < .0001), independent of clinicopathological and molecular features. In a multivariate stage-stratified analysis, high EZH2 expression was related to favorable prognosis (P = .0022). Regarding premalignant lesions, negative EZH2 expression was frequently detected in sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/) (76%; P < .0001) compared with hyperplastic polyps, traditional serrated adenomas, and non-serrated adenomas (25-36%). Functional analysis demonstrated that the knockdown of EZH2 increased miR-31 expression. In conclusion, an inverse association was identified between EZH2 and miR-31 in colorectal cancers. Our data also showed that upregulation of EZH2 expression may be rare in SSA/. These results suggest that EZH2 suppresses miR-31 in colorectal cancer and may correlate with differentiation and evolution of serrated pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169656>Altered Bile Transporter Expression and Cholesterol Metabolism in Children With Cholesterol and Pigment Gallstones.</a></h2><p>We elucidated pathophysiology of pediatric gallstone disease by assessing liver expression of bile transporters in relation to bile acids and surrogates of cholesterol absorption and synthesis in serum and gallstones.RNA expression of canalicular bile transporters in liver biopsies from 32 pediatric gallstone patients and from 6 liver donors (controls) was measured by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction).

First, the "passivation" of the silicon substrates toward polymer adsorption was performed by the deposition of an alkyne functionalized self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Then, three tailor-made omega-azido linear brush precursors, i.e., PEG-N3, PMMA-N3, and -N3 (Mn approximately 20,000 g/mol), were grafted to alkyne-functionalized SAMs via click chemistry in tetrahydrofuran. The SAM, PEG, PMMA, and  layers were characterized by ellipsometry, scanning probe microscopy, and water contact angle measurements. Results have shown that the grafting process follows the scaling laws developed for polymer brushes, with a significant dependence over the  fraction of polymer in the grafting solution and the grafting time. The chemical nature of the brushes has only a weak influence on the click chemistry grafting reaction and morphologies observed, yielding polymer brushes with thickness of ca. 6 nm and grafting densities of ca. .2 chains/nm2. The examples developed herein have shown that this highly versatile and tunable approach can be extended to the grafting of a wide range of polymer (pseudo-) brushes to silicon substrates without changing the tethering strategy.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964751>Combination of a novel photosensitizer DTPP with 650 nm laser results in efficient apoptosis, arresting cell cycle and cytoskeleton protein changes in lung cancer A549 cells.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using photosensitized reaction to produce cytotoxicity was used for cancer therapy in recent years.

Phospholipid (PL) was assayed in lung homogenate, BAL fluid, and subfractions, and PL composition was determined on the largest BAL subfraction (P4). On the sixth day the pleural gas volume was 19.7 +/- 2.7 (SD) ml/kg, and PaO2 and FRC were significantly decreased.

Dominant populations in small flocs, e.g., Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, and Acinetobacter spp., were also the major initial colonizers on membranes. In Phase II (2-4 d), fouling layer structure, EPS composition, and bacterial community went through significant changes. Initial colonizers were replaced by fast-growing and metabolically versatile heterotrophs (e.g., unclassified Sphingobacteria). The declining EPS polysaccharide to protein (:PN) ratios could be correlated well with the increase in microbial community diversity. In Phase III (5-14 d), heterotrophs comprised over 90% of the community, whereas biofilm structure and EPS composition remained relatively stable. In all phases, AOB and NOB were constantly found within the top 40% of the fouling layer, with the maximum concentrations around % from the top. The overall microbial succession pattern from autotrophic colonization to heterotrophic domination implied that MBR biofouling could be alleviated by forming larger bacterial flocs in bioreactor suspension (reducing autotrophic colonization), and by designing more specific cleaning procedures targeting dominant heterotrophs during typical filtration cycles.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Several functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with CYP1B1 expression and activity. The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the correlation of CYP1B1 SNPs with the outcome of NSCLC patients treated with docetaxel in second or third line.Associations between CYP1B1 4326C>G and 4390A>G polymorphisms with response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Pearson χ(2) test, Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test; a multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling.A total of 65 advanced NSCLC patients were enrolled into the analysis. Median age was 66 years (range 46-81). Forty-nine patients were male; only five were never smokers. Performance status () was  in 25 patients, 1 in 28 and 2 in 12.

The functional characterization of MscCG is therefore, of great significance to understand its conductive properties for different amino acids. Here we report the first successful giant spheroplast preparation of C. glutamicum amenable to the patch clamp technique, which enabled us to investigate mechanosensitive channel activities of MscCG in the native membrane of this bacterium. Single channel recordings from these spheroplasts revealed the presence of three types of mechanosensitive channels, MscCG, MscCG2, and CgMscL, which differ largely from each other in their conductance and mechanosensitivity. MscCG has a relatively small conductance of ~340  followed by an intermediate MscCG2 conductance of ~1. nS and comparably very large conductance of 3.7 nS exhibited by CgMscL. By applying Laplace's law, we determined that very moderate membrane tension of ~5.5 mN/m was required for half activation of MscCG compared to ~12 mN/m required for half activation of both MscCG2 and CgMscL. Furthermore, by combining the micropipette aspiration technique with molecular dynamics simulations we measured mechanical properties of the C. glutamicum membrane, whose area elasticity module of K ≈  mN/m is characteristic of a very soft membrane compared to the three times larger area expansion modulus of K ≈ 44 mN/m of the more elastic E. coli membrane. Moreover, we demonstrate that the "soft" properties of the C. glutamicum membrane have a significant impact on the MscCG gating characterized by a strong voltage-dependent hysteresis in the membrane of C. glutamicum compared to a complete absence of the hysteresis in the E. coli cell membrane. We thus propose that MscCG has evolved and adapted as an MscS-like channel to the mechanical properties of the C. glutamicum membrane enabling the channel to specialize in transport of amino acids such as glutamate, which are major osmolytes helping the bacterial cells survive extreme osmotic stress.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29296060>Short-term outcomes of transcatheter closure of secundum atrial septal defect in children and adolescents: An experience of two centers in Upper Egypt.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute and short-term outcomes of transcatheter closure of secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) in children and adolescents in the first 4-year experience in two institutional centers in Upper Egypt.This was a retrospective cohort study including 135 children and adolescents who underwent ASD closure between April 2012 and May 2016. A review of the acute and short-term outcomes and adverse events was performed.The patients had a median age of 5 years (interquartile range: 3-9 years), 71% of patients were ≤5 years, and median  was 17 kg (interquartile range: 13-30 kg). Single defects were observed in 113 patients (84%). The remainder had multiple or multifenestrated defects that were closed by a single device. The mean defect size of single defects and the mean interatrial septum length were .24 ± 5.16 mm and 38.13 ± 6.3 mm, respectively. The ratio of device to TEE (Transoesophageal echocardiography) size of ASD was 1.19 ± .12. The devices were implanted successfully in 98.5% of patients. Six cases had concordant  (Pulmonary stenosis), patent ductus arteriosus or perimembranous ventricular septal defect and were treated with balloon dilation, or closure. No residual flow was seen after device placement except in one patient with multiple fenestrations. There were five high-severity adverse events (3.7%) with no mortality. Device erosion was confirmed in one of two patients with massive haemopericardium; embolization of the device with retrieval in one patient; and heart block was detected in two cases. No cardiac perforation, device erosion, embolization, thrombus formation, or clinical evidence of bacterial endocarditis was observed during follow-up.Transcatheter closure of ASDs in children and adolescents was feasible and safe in the first 4 years experience in our centers, with good short-term outcome. Balloon sizing is not necessary for transcatheter closure of secundum ASD.

The reaction follows the Criegee mechanism with an initial addition of O to the [double bond splayed left]C[double bond, length as m-dash]C[double bond splayed right] bond, followed by a chain of unimolecular isomerizations, as 3-carene + O→ POZs (primary ozonides) → CIs (Criegee intermediates, 4 conformers) →  (products). In the course of the reaction, a large excess of  retained in the POZs* lead to the prompt unimolecular processes in POZs*, CIs*, and *, and only ∼4% of CIs* could be stabilized by collision at 298 K and 760 Torr. From RRKM-ME calculations, the VHPs* could further dissociate to vinoxy-type radical and OH radical, the SOZs* could isomerize to 3-caronic acid, and DIOs* could be stabilized via collision.

Hyaluronic acid having a molecular  of approximately 800 kDa was supplemented into the medium so that the concentration became .01, .1, or 1. mg/mL. The cultured cells were evaluated using immunocytochemistry for type-2 collagen and real time PCR for gene expression of type-2 collagen, aggrecan, and Sox9 at 7 and 21 days of culture.The cells cultured on the DN gel formed nodules and were stained with an anti-type-2 collagen antibody, and expression of type-2 collagen and aggrecan mRNA was significantly greater on the DN gel than on the  dish surface (p < .05) in the hyaluronic acid-free maintenance medium. Hyaluronic acid supplementation of a high concentration (1. mg/mL) significantly enhanced expression of type-2 collagen and aggrecan mRNA in comparison with culture without hyaluronic acid at 21 days (p < .05).The DN gel induced chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells without insulin.

When a rubrene microcrystal was excited to higher  levels than that of the lowest singlet excited (S) state with a 397 nm femtosecond laser pulse, a triplet excited state was formed through two pathways of the singlet fission, i.e. the direct fission from higher vibrational levels of the S state with a time constant of 2.2  and the thermally activated fission from the S state in a few tens of . The time constant of the thermally activated fission changed from 35 to 17  for increasing of the laser fluence from .65 to 18 mJ cm per pulse, although that of the direct fission was constant with the excitation laser intensity. On the other hand, the yield of the triplet formation was independent of the intensity. We also examined the temperature dependence of the singlet fission and demonstrated the activation  of the thermally activated fission to be .21 eV. Based on the experimental results, we considered the excitation intensity dependence of the singlet fission of the rubrene crystal in terms of the effect of transient local heating on a  time scale after femtosecond laser excitation owing to the nonradiative vibrational relaxation from the higher vibrational level to the lower one in the S state.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090246>Anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies prevent the De-activation of platelets and sustain their phagocytic clearance.</a></h2><p>Exposure to phosphatidylserine () tags dying and senescent cells for removal and identifies activated platelets.

Each macrophage internalized an average of 3.16+/-.2 platelets after 60 min at 37 degrees C. Phagocytosis did not increase after longer incubations (4.65+/-.26 platelets internalized by each macrophage after 300 min).

Circulating microparticles (cMPs) are membrane vesicles that are shed from many cell types in response to cell activation and cell apoptosis. Several studies reported that cMPs may play a role in the hypercoagulable state that can be observed in patients with AF. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of total cMPs and characterize their cellular origins in AF patients.Atotal of 66 AF patients and 33 healthy controls were enrolled. This study investigated total cMP levels and their cellular origin in AF patients using polychromatic flow cytometry.AF patients had significantly higher levels of total cMPs (median 36.38, interquartile range [IQR] 21.16-68.50 × 10 counts/mL vs median .21, IQR 9.91-30.86 × 10 counts/mL; P = .004), platelet-derived MPs (PMPs) (median 10.61, IQR 6.55-18.04 × 10 counts/mL vs median 7.83, IQR 4.44-10.26 × 10/mL; P = .009), and endothelial-derived MPs (EMPs CD31+ CD41-) (median 2.94, IQR 1.78-.60 × 10 counts/mL vs median 1.16, IQR .71-2.30 × 10 counts/mL; P = .001) than healthy controls after adjusting for potential confounders. Phosphatidylserine positive MP ( + MP) levels were similar compared between AF patients and healthy controls.The results of this study revealed a marked increase in total cMP levels, and evidence of elevated endothelial damage and platelet activation, as demonstrated by increased PMP and EMP levels, in AF patients.

This inter-organ correlation between the GIT and the pancreas was assessed through a rat model. Separate local irradiation to the abdomen and the pelvis was applied concurrently for 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Abdominal irradiation was categorized into pancreatic shield () and non-pancreatic shield (NPS) irradiation. After 5 Gy and  Gy irradiation, the rectal mucosa was analyzed at the first week (early phase, Ep) and the 14th week (late phase, Lp). A slow gain in body  was observed initially, particularly in the NPS group receiving a  Gy dose (P < .001). The large number of apoptotic bodies after  Gy at Ep decreased at Lp. At Ep for the 5-Gy group, the NPS group revealed more fibrotic change than the  group (P = .002). Cleaved caspase-3 (CCP3) expression was greater at Lp, and the Ep-Lp increase was prominent in the NPS--Gy group (P = .010). At Lp, for  Gy irradiation, CCP3 was expressed more in the NPS group than in the  group (P = .032). Despite no direct toxicity difference between the  and NPS groups, small changes in parameters such as fibrosis or CCP3 expression suggest that pancreatic shielding does have an effect on the radiation response in the rectal mucosa, which suggests a need for a multi-organ effect-based approach in GIT radiotoxicity assessment.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459138>Haemodialysis in patients treated with oral anticoagulant: should we heparinize?</a></h2><p>Anticoagulation for the haemodialysis circuit in patients treated with oral anticoagulation poses additional haemorrhagic risk.

Each patient had four haemodialysis sessions with two different membranes [HeprAN or polysulphone ()] and with or without enoxaparin. Clinical coagulation was evaluated by the need for premature ending and by a visual score (Janssen scale). Coagulation activation markers were also measured: d-dimers, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, tissue factor pathway inhibitor and platelet factor-4.Ten patients were included (M/F = 4/6, mean age 63 ±  years). None of the 40 sessions ended prematurely. The clotting scores were similar with or without enoxaparin (dialyser: 1.49 ± .19 versus 1.53 ± .17, P = .97; bubble trap: .75 ± .19 versus .78 ± .22, P = .62) and with the polysulphone or the HeprAN membrane (dialyser: 1.54 ± .20 versus 1.47 ± .16, P = .65; bubble trap: .74 ± .22 versus .79 ± .19, P = .58). There was no significant difference in coagulation activation markers between dialysis modalities; however, dialysis efficacy was significantly greater with the  membrane (1.58 ± .07 versus 1.43 ± .06, P = .02).These results suggest that haemodialysis without additional anticoagulation is possible in patients with oral anticoagulation.

Liquid methanol is excited with vacuum UV (9.3 eV) pump pulses, and the subsequent electron dynamics are probed with UV pulses. The photoelectron signal exhibits a short-lived component (τ = 85 fs) without spectral evolution followed by a long-lived component with continuous spectral evolution over tens of picoseconds. We ascribe the former to a superexcited state, most likely the Wannier exciton, and the latter to the ground electronic state of e . In order to extract accurate energetics from the observed photoelectron spectra, we employ a spectral retrieval method to account for spectral broadening and shifting due to inelastic scattering of photoelectrons in the liquid.

The effect of various operating parameters such as pH, concentration of the catalyst and reducing agent (NaBH4), and recycling of the catalyst on dechlorination were studied. Nearly complete dechlorination of all the chloroaromatics were achieved in the presence of Cu() nanoparticles (2.5 g L(-1)) and NaBH4 (1. g L(-1)) within 12 h. On the contrary, approximately 70% of dechlorination was observed in the presence of 5% acidified alcohol at similar experimental conditions. The dechlorination mechanism highlighted the importance of Cu() nanoparticles as a surface mediator. The kinetics of the dechlorination of chloroaromatics was investigated and compared with chloroaliphatics. The dechlorination rate differed from .23 h(-1) (Cl-B) to . h(-1) (Cl-BPh) in the presence of Cu() nanoparticles and NaBH4. The effectiveness of Cu() nanoparticles with NaBH4 (1 g L(-1)) and 5% acidified alcohol as electron donors were studied by oxidation-reduction potential and observed to be -1016 mV and -670 mV, respectively. Final products of the dechlorination were benzene, toluene, pyridine and biphenyl, as identified by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, alternative treatment options are urgently needed. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive, local therapy with proven clinical efficacy for a variety of tumor types. PDT is cytotoxic, provokes anti-vascular effects and stimulates tumor cell targeting mechanisms of the immune system and, consequently, has potential as a novel therapy for osteosarcoma patients. This study investigated the uptake and the dark- and phototoxicity and cytotoxic mechanisms of the photosensitizer () 5,10,,20-tetrakis(meta-hydroxyphenyl) chlorine (mTHPC, Foscan) and a liposomal mTHPC formulation (Foslip) in the human 143B and a mouse K7M2-derived osteosaroma cell line (K7M2L2) in vitro. Second, the tumor- and metastasis-suppressive efficacies of mTHPC formulations based PDT and associated mechanisms in intratibial, metastasizing osteosarcoma mouse models (143B/SCID and syngeneic K7M2L2/BALB/c) were studied. The uptake of Foscan and Foslip in vitro was time- and dose-dependent and resulted in mTHPC and light dose-dependent phototoxicity associated with apoptosis. In vivo, the uptake of both i.v. administered mTHPC formulations was higher in tumor than in healthy control tissue. PDT caused significant (Foscan p < .05, Foslip p < .001) tumor growth inhibition in both models. A significant (Foscan p < .001, Foslip p < .001) immune system-dependent suppression of lung metastasis was only observed in the K7M2L2/BALB/c model and was associated with a marked infiltration of T-lymphocytes at the primary tumor site. In conclusion, mTHPC-based PDT is effective in clinically relevant experimental osteosarcoma and suppresses lung metastasis in immunocompetent mice with beneficial effects of the liposomal mTHPC formulation Foslip.© 2016 UICC.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27581229>Lipidomic Perturbations in Lung, Kidney, and Liver Tissues of p53 Knockout Mice Analyzed by Nanoflow UPLC-ESI-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>Lipids are important signaling molecules regulating biological processes under normal and diseased conditions. Although p53 mutation is well-known for causing cancer, the relationship between p53-related tumorigenesis and altered lipid profile is unclear. We profiled differences in lipid expressions in liver, lung, and kidney in p53 knockout (KO) mice by high-speed quantitative analysis of 320 lipids (399 species identified) using nanoflow ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nUPLC-MS/MS). Lung tissues were most severely affected by the lack of p53 gene, as shown by significant reduction (24-44%, P < .05) in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), diacylglycerol (DG), and triacylglycerol (TG), and significant increases (30-50%) in phosphatidylserine (), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and monohexosylceramide (MHC). MHC levels increased in all tissues. Dihexosylceramide (DHC) level decreased only in kidney tissue. Most PI, , and phosphatidic acid (PA) species showing significant increases contained a saturated acyl chain (18:) in lung and liver tissues. Neutral glycerolipids (16:/22:-DG and most TGs with saturated and monounsaturated acyl chains) decreased 2-4-fold in the liver tissue. Our results suggest that the lack of p53 and altered lipid profiles are closely related, but as their changes vary from one tissue to another, the lipid alterations are tissue-specific.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836214>Comparison of high and low molecular weight chitosan as in-vitro boosting agent for photodynamic therapy against Helicobacter pylori using methylene blue and endoscopic light.</a></h2><p>We reported in a previous study that photodynamic therapy (PDT) of Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) could potentiate bactericidal effect by adding chitosan.

We evaluated bacterial removal rate and its membrane damage by ethidium bromide monoazide PCR method (EMA q-PCR). 8-oxo-2'-dexoyguanosine by ELISA was measured for oxidative stress.At a chitosan concentration of ≤.05%, the killing effect did not differ between the two molecular weights, and 100% bacterial removal rate was observed at a light energy ≥ 6.23 mJ/cm powers under .02% MB.

L. monocytogenes 568 (Lm568, serotype 1/2a), its isogenic sigB mutant (ΔsigB) and the back-complemented ΔsigB were desiccated in BHI, TSB with 1% glucose (TSB-glu), peptone physiological saline (PPS) and minimal media (MM) for 21 days at 43% relative humidity (RH) and  °C on SS. The effect of food related osmolytes (proline, betaine and carnitine) on desiccation survival was studied by (a) pre-culturing strains in MM with an osmolyte followed by desiccation in MM and (b) by desiccating strains in MM with an osmolyte. Desiccation survival of L. monocytogenes was positively correlated to the nutrient and osmolyte concentrations in the desiccation substrates. Initial Lm568 levels of 8 Log(CFU/cm(2)) decreased by .9 Log(CFU/cm(2)) in BHI and 1.1-2.9 Log(CFU/cm(2)) in TSB-glu, PPS and MM after 21 days. Comparatively, the initial survival of ΔsigB was reduced in  and MM, while no differences were observed among the three strains in BHI and TSB-glu. Pre-culture in osmolyte containing MM enhanced (p < .05) desiccation survival of all strains. Desiccation in osmolyte-containing MM improved desiccation survival of all strains, albeit the protection was less than that observed after pre-culture with the osmolytes. Complementation of the ΔsigB mutant restored the wildtype phenotype. In conclusion, this work shows the protective effect of osmolytes in desiccation survival of L. monocytogenes, while the σ(B) regulon only improved the initial survival in nutrient and osmolyte poor environments.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Internal motion is usually ignored, and NOESY cross-peak intensities are interpreted in terms of internuclear distances only. Off-resonance ROESY experiments measure a weighted average of NOE and ROE. The  can be described and experimentally set by an angle theta;. For large enough molecules, NOE and ROE have opposite signs. Therefore, each cross-peak intensity becomes zero for an angle theta;(). For any sample, the maximum angle theta;() is determined by the overall motion of the molecule. Smaller theta;() values reflect the angular component of internal motions. Because individual cross-peaks are analyzed, the method evaluates internal motions of individual H,H vectors. The reduction of theta;() is largest for internal motions on a time scale of 100-300 . The sensitivity of theta;() for internal motions decreases with increasing molecular . We estimate that detecting internal motions will be practicable for molecules up to about  kDa. We describe a protocol to measure theta;() from a series of off-resonance ROESY spectra. For such a series, we describe the choice of experimental parameters, a procedure to extract theta;() from the raw data, and the interpretation of theta;() in terms of internal motions. In the small protein BPTI, we analyzed 75 cross-peaks. The precision of theta;() was .25 degrees, as compared to typical reductions of theta;() of 3 degrees. We found a well-defined maximum theta;() for cross-peaks in rigid parts of the molecule, which reflects the overall motion of the molecule. For BPTI, also many structurally important long-range cross-peaks appear rigid. The lower theta;() values of long-range contacts involving methyl groups are consistent with methyl rotation on the 25- time scale. The lower theta;() values of the flexible C-terminus and of flexible side chains translate into upper limits for the angular order parameter of .4 and .5-.8, respectively. Off-resonance ROESY can monitor internal motions of H,H contacts that are used in a structure calculation.

These effects were generally greater in the second than in the first year.A combined amendment of crop straw biochar with manure compost plus pyroligneous solution could help combat salinity stress to maize and improve productivity in saline croplands in arid/semi-arid regions threatened increasingly by global climate change.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12639680>Intravesical protamine sulfate and potassium chloride as a model for bladder hyperactivity.</a></h2><p>An acute animal model for hyperactive bladder in rats was developed using intravesical infusion of protamine sulfate (), an agent thought to break down urothelial  , and physiologic concentrations of potassium chloride (KCl).Continuous cystometrograms (CMGs) were performed in urethane-anesthetized female rats by filling the bladder (.04 mL/min) with normal saline followed by intravesical infusion of a test solution consisting of either KCl (100 or 500 mM) or  (10 or 30 mg/mL) for 60 minutes. Subsequently, the 10 mg/mL -treated animals were infused intravesically with 100, 300, or 500 mM KCl. Some animals were pretreated with capsaicin (125 mg/kg subcutaneously) 4 days before the experiments.Unlike KCl (100 or 500 mM) or a low concentration of  (10 mg/mL) alone, the intravesical administration of a high concentration of  (30 mg/mL) produced irritative effects with a decreased intercontraction interval (by 80.6%). After infusion of a low concentration of , infusion of 300 or 500 mM KCl produced irritative effects (intercontraction interval decreased by 76.9% or 82.9%, respectively). The onset of irritation occurred more rapidly after 500 mM KCl (10 to  minutes) than after 300 mM KCl (20 to 30 minutes). Capsaicin pretreatment delayed the onset (approximately 60 minutes) and reduced the magnitude (intercontraction interval decreased by 35.5%) of irritative effects.Intravesical administration of KCl after  treatment activates capsaicin-sensitive afferents and detrusor muscle and presumably capsaicin-resistant afferents. Modest, noncytotoxic affronts to urothelial   can result in dramatic irritative responses.

Recently, however, we have found that spontaneous hyaline cartilage regeneration can be induced in vivo by implanting a synthetic double-network (DN) hydrogel, which is composed of poly-(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) and poly-(N,N'-dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMAAm). However, the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been clarified. Recently, we have found that single-network PAMPS and PDMAAm gels can induce chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells in vitro even in a maintenance medium. In the in vivo condition, there is a strong possibility that the induction effect of the gel itself is enhanced by some molecules which exist in the joint. We have noticed that the joint fluid naturally contains hyaluronic acid (HA). The purpose of this study is to clarify in vitro effects of supplementation of HA on the differentiation effect of the PAMPS and PDMAAm gels.We cultured the ATDC5 cells on the PAMPS gel, the PDMAAm gel, and the polystyrene () dish surface with the maintenance medium without insulin for 7 days. HA having a molecular  of approximately 800 kDa was supplemented into the medium so that the concentration became .00, .01, .10, or 1.00 mg/mL. We evaluated the cultured cells with phase-contrast microscopy and PCR analyses.On the PAMPS gel, supplementation with HA of .01 and .10 mg/mL significantly increased expression of type-2 collagen mRNA (p = .0008 and p = .0413) and aggrecan mRNA (p = .0073 and p = .0196) than that without HA. On the PDMAAm gel, supplementation with HA of 1.00 mg/mL significantly reduced expression of these genes in comparison with the culture without HA (p = .0426 and p = .0218).The in vitro induction effects of the PAMPS and PDMAAm gels on chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells are significantly affected by HA, depending on the level of concentration. These results suggested that there is a high possibility that HA plays an important role in the in vivo spontaneous hyaline cartilage regeneration phenomenon induced by the PAMPS/PDMAAm DN gel.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914242>Molecular lipid species in urinary exosomes as potential prostate cancer biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Exosomes have recently appeared as a novel source of noninvasive cancer biomarkers, since these nanovesicles contain molecules from cancer cells and can be detected in biofluids. We have here investigated the potential use of lipids in urinary exosomes as prostate cancer biomarkers.A high-throughput mass spectrometry quantitative lipidomic analysis was performed to reveal the lipid composition of urinary exosomes in prostate cancer patients and healthy controls.Control samples were first analysed to characterise the lipidome of urinary exosomes and test the reproducibility of the method. In total, 107 lipid species were quantified in urinary exosomes. Several differences, for example, in cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, were found between urinary exosomes and exosomes derived from cell lines, thus showing the importance of in vivo studies for biomarker analysis. The 36 most abundant lipid species in urinary exosomes were then quantified in  prostate cancer patients and 13 healthy controls. Interestingly, the levels of nine lipids species were found to be significantly different when the two groups were compared. The highest significance was shown for phosphatidylserine () 18:1/18:1 and lactosylceramide (d18:1/16:), the latter also showed the highest patient-to-control ratio. Furthermore, combinations of these lipid species and  18:-18:2 distinguished the two groups with 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Finally, in agreement with the reported dysregulation of sphingolipid  in cancer cells, alteration in specific sphingolipid lipid classes were observed.This study shows for the first time the potential use of exosomal lipid species in urine as prostate cancer biomarkers.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

PFCs are difficult to be eliminated from the body. We investigated the influence of different dialysis membranes on the concentrations of PFCs in patients under hemodialysis. : We enrolled 98 patients. Of these, 58 patients used hydrophobic polysulfone () dialysis membranes, and the other 40 had hydrophilic membranes made by poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) or cellulose triacetate (CTA). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry coupled was used with isotope dilution to quantify PFOA and PFOS. : The predialysis concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in patients with hydrophobic  dialysis membranes were .50 and .77 ng/mL, respectively, lower than the concentrations of .81 and 22.70 ng/mL, respectively, in those who used hydrophilic membranes (such as CTA or PMMA). Older patients have higher PFOS and poorer body function, with lower Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPSS) scores. The demographic data of the two groups were similar. However, patients with hydrophobic  dialysis membranes had lower predialysis aspartate transaminase (AST) ( = .036), lower glucose levels ( = .017), and better body function (nonsignificantly higher KPSS scores,  = .091) compared with patients who used other membranes.

They were then cultured with immature dendritic cells (DCs) derived from rat bone marrow hematopoietic cells (BMHCs). After treatment with bioactive NR- with a degree of polymerization (DP) value of 359.8, we found that the DCs underwent morphological changes indicative of activation. CD80/86 (87.16% ± 8.49%) and MHC class II (52.01% ± 10.11%) expression levels were significantly up-regulated by this treatment compared to the controls (65.45% ± .97% and 34.87% ± 1.96%). In parallel, endocytosis was also reduced (167.94% ± 60.59%) after treatment with 25 μg/mL of NR- as measured by the medium fluorescence intensity compared to the control (261.67% ± 47.26%). Furthermore, the DCs after treatment with 25 μg/mL NR- showed increased IL-12 (102.09 ± 10.16 to 258.78 ± 25.26 pg/mL) and IFN-γ (11.76 ± .11 to .51 ± 1.66 pg/mL) secretion together with reduced IL-10 secretion (30.75 ± 3.35 to .37 ± 2.35 pg/mL), which indicates a T(H)1 immune response.

At the end of the entire period, half of each group was injected intramuscularly with either 10 μg of chicken gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (cGnRH-1) or phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) as the vehicle. Blood was collected before and 30 min after cGnRH-1 challenge by jugular venipuncture and decapitation, respectively. The results indicated that testosterone concentrations were low (P < .05) before (800 mg/kg BW) and after GnRH challenge in -treated quails compared with controls (P < .001). However, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were not different among the groups before cGnRH-1 challenge.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold standard measure of exercise capacity; however this laboratory test has limitations for use in research and clinical practice. Alternative field walking tests are the six-minute walk test (6MWT), incremental-shuttle walk test (ISWT) and endurance-shuttle walk test (ESWT); however there is limited information about their clinimetric properties in NSCLC.In NSCLC to determine the 1) criterion validity of the 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT against CPET; 2) construct validity of the 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT against measures of function, strength, respiratory function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and 3) clinical applicability of the tests.Twenty participants (40 % male, mean ± SD age 66.1 ± 6.5 years) with stage I-IIIb NSCLC completed the 6MWT, ISWT, ESWT and CPET within six months of treatment. Testing order was randomised. Additional measures included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance-Status (ECOG-, function), respiratory function, hand-grip dynamometry and HRQoL. Correlations and regression analyses were used to assess relationships.The ISWT demonstrated criterion validity with a moderate relationship between ISWT distance and CPET peak  consumption (r = .61, p = .007). Relationships between CPET and six minute walk distance (6MWD) (r = .24, p = .329) or ESWT time (r = .02, p = .942) were poor. Moderate construct validity existed for the 6MWD and respiratory function (forced vital capacity % predicted r = .53, p = .019; forced expiratory volume in the first second % predicted r = .55, p = .015). There were no relationships between the walking tests and measures of function, strength or HRQoL. The ESWT had a ceiling effect with 18 % reaching maximum time. No floor effects were seen in the tests. The mean ± SD time required to perform the individual 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT was 12.8 ± 2.5, 14.7 ± 3.7 and 16.3 ± 5. min respectively; in comparison to CPET which was 51.2 ± 12.7 min.

Exocytosis of LDCVs, detected by carbon fiber amperometry of serotonin, correlated strongly (approximately 80%) with ATP release. The increase in membrane capacitance per ATP release event was 3.4 fF, close to the expected capacitance of an individual LDCV with a diameter of .3 microm. ATP and GABA were coreleased with serotonin with the same probability. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that approximately % of the LDCVs contain GABA. Prespike "pedestals," reflecting exit of granule constituents via the fusion pore, were less frequently observed for ATP than for serotonin or GABA and the relative amplitude (amplitude of foot compared to spike) was smaller: in some cases the ATP-dependent pedestal was missing entirely. An inward tonic current, not dependent on glucose and inhibited by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist SR95531, was observed in beta cells in clusters of islet cells. Noise analysis indicated that it was due to the activity of individual channels with a conductance of 30 , the same as expected for individual GABA(A) Cl- channels with the ionic gradients used. We conclude that (a) LDCVs accumulate ATP and serotonin; (b) regulated release of GABA can be accounted for by exocytosis of a subset of insulin-containing LDCVs; (c) the fusion pore of LDCVs exhibits selectivity and compounds are differentially released depending on their chemical properties (including size); and (d) a glucose-independent nonvesicular form of GABA release exists in beta cells.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16040982>Protection by natural human immunoglobulin M antibody to meningococcal serogroup B capsular polysaccharide in the infant rat protection assay is independent of complement-mediated bacterial lysis.</a></h2><p>Neisseria meningitidis, an important cause of bacterial meningitis and septicemia worldwide, is associated with high mortality and serious sequelae.

It consists primarily of microvascular endothelial cells surrounded by astrocytic endfeet, pericytes, and microglia. Understanding the make-up of transporters in rat BBB is essential to the translation of pharmacological and toxicological observations into humans. In this study, experimental workflows are presented in which the optimization of (a) isolation of rat brain microvessels (b) enrichment of endothelial cells, and (c) extraction and digestion of proteins were evaluated, followed by identification and quantification of BBB proteins. Optimization of microvessel isolation was indicated by -fold enrichment of endothelial cell marker Glut1 mRNA, whereas markers for other cell types were not enriched.

Treatment goals were assessed via a validated best-worst scaling instrument, where participants evaluated subsets of 13 possible treatment goals identified using a balanced incomplete block design. Participants identified the most and least important goals within each task. Data were also collected on current treatment and preference for daily oral versus long-acting injectable (LAI) treatment. Hierarchical Bayes was used to identify preference weights for the goals, and latent class analysis was used to identify segments of people with similar goals. The segments were compared with the current treatment and preference for oral versus LAI treatment.Across 100 participants, the average age was 26 years, 75% were male and 50% were diagnosed within 2 years ago. Overall, preferences were most favorable for reduced disease symptoms, think clearly, reduced hospitalizations, reduced anxiety, and take care of self. A total of 61% preferred oral medication and 39% LAI. Two groups were identified with different treatment goals; 50% of participants emphasized clinical goals, including reduced disease symptoms (preference  =19.7%), reduced hospitalizations (.5%), and reduced anxiety (10.5%). The other 50% emphasized functional goals, including improved relationships with family/friends (11.4%), increased interest in work (10.6%), experiencing a fuller range of emotions (8.4%), and ability to socialize (7.5%). Those emphasizing functional goals were more likely to be on LAI (44% versus 26%; =.059) and preferred LAI (46% versus 32%; =.151).People with recent-onset schizophrenia may focus more on clinical goals or functional goals, a discussion of which may help facilitate patient engagement.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29680435>Comparison of two exhaled biomarkers in children with and without sleep disordered breathing.</a></h2><p>Airway oxidative stress and inflammation are likely to be involved in sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children. We aimed to measure concentrations of 8-isoprostane (8-IsoP) in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and exhaled nitric oxide (FE) in patients with SBD and healthy children, in order to assess the relationship between these two biomarkers, disease severity, and overnight changes.Patients with SDB (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 20) aged 4.5-.1 years (M/F: 36/30) underwent exhaled measurements. Patients with SDB underwent standard polysomnography to define primary snoring (: AHI < 1) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Upon awakening the following morning, FE was measured and EBC was collected for the measurement of EBC 8-IsoP.OSA patients yielded higher awakening levels of 8-IsoP in EBC than  patients and control subjects. The 8-IsoP levels, though not FE, correlated with AHI (r = .40, p = .003) and SaO2 (r = -.50, p = .001). Cut-off levels of 8-IsoP predicted OSA with a high AUC value (.84, p = .000). Sensitivity and specificity for 8-IsoP levels above the percentile 50 (33.3 pg/mL) were 76.5% and 78.1%, respectively. 8-IsoP levels did not change from the evening to morning session, whereas morning FE levels rose significantly only in patients with mild OSA (p = .03).Levels of 8-IsoP, though not FE, distinguish children with OSA from those with  or healthy, correlate with disease severity and closely predict OSA in the whole sample.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The women were divided in two groups: 20 women consumed the -enriched beverage and the other 20 women consumed a placebo (without ) beverage for 6 weeks. After a four-week washout period, the type of beverage was exchanged and consumed for another 6 weeks. Feces were collected at the start ( and 10 weeks) and end of each intervention period (6 and 16 weeks), and fecal sterols were determined by capillary gas chromatography with mass spectrometry.The intake of the -enriched beverage modified the fecal sterol excretion profile. A significant increase mainly in  and their metabolites versus the placebo intervention period was observed. Although the same effect was not observed in the case of AS, a tendency towards increased cholesterol and decreased coprostanol (the main metabolite of cholesterol) was recorded after -enriched beverage intake versus placebo. Furthermore, the -enriched beverage also modified the microbial conversion of sterols. In this context, an important decrease in the conversion percentage of cholesterol in 16 women (between 11% and 50%) and of sitosterol in 24 women (between % and 61%) was observed.The results obtained suggest that the  could preferably use  as a substrate, when present in a greater proportion compared with cholesterol. Besides, a lower sitosterol and cholesterol conversion trend would mean that intake of the -enriched beverage could modulate the metabolic activity of the gut . Therefore, further studies on the impact of -enriched foods upon gut  modulation are needed. Clinical Trial Registry Number:  listed on the NIH website: ClinicalTrials.gov.

Few published evaluations exist that compare the dentin cutting efficiency of endodontic ultrasonic tips. Furthermore, previous comparison studies often did not take into account 2 critical factors: clinically relevant downward forces and linear movement during use.Four different round-tipped ultrasonic tips were compared (n = 5 per tip group): BUC-1 (Obtura Spartan, Fenton, MO), BL-2 (B&L Biotech, Bala Cynwyd, PA), BL-3 (B&L Biotech), and START-X #2 (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). The tips were attached to a testing apparatus that applied a -g axial force and a linear movement during instrumentation of a human dentin specimen. Instrumentation was completed at the manufacturers' recommended power settings, and 3 of the tips were also compared at an equal power setting. Instrumentation consisted of 20-second cycles for a total of 6 minutes. Dentin specimens were weighed at baseline and after 2, 4, and 6 minutes of instrumentation. The dentin cutting efficiency was measured by the change in  of dentin specimens to the nearest .1 mg.A 1-factor analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc analysis of cumulative dentin removal (after 6 minutes of instrumentation) revealed a statistically significant difference among the 4 ultrasonic tips (P ≤ .0001) at the recommended , with the BUC-1 tip removing significantly more dentin across time. At an equal power setting, the BUC-1 was significantly more efficient than the BL-3; no difference was found between the BUC-1 and the BL-2.Within the limits of this study, the BUC-1 showed the greatest dentin removal.

Comparative evaluation with commercial carbons (C- and C-ZJ15) and long-term performance evaluation of C-XHIT were conducted in small-scale system-A (S-A) and pilot-scale system-B (S-B-1 and S-B-2 in series), respectively, for treating water from Songhua River. The cumulative uptake of micropollutants varied with KBV (water volume fed to columns divided by the mass of carbons, m(3) H2O/kg carbon) was employed in the performance evaluation. The results identified that mesoporous and microporous volumes were simultaneously well-developed in C-XHIT. Higher mesoporosity (63.94 %) and average pore width (37.91 Å) of C-XHIT ensured a higher adsorption capacity for humic acid compared to C- and C-ZJ15. When the KBV of S-A reached 12.58 m(3) H2O/kg carbon, cumulative uptake of organic pollutants achieved by C-XHIT increased by 32.82 and 156.29 % for DOC (QC) and 22.53 and 112.48 % for UV254 (QUV) compared to C- and C-ZJ15, respectively; in contrast, the adsorption capacity of NH4 (+)-N did not improve significantly. C-XHIT achieved high average removal efficiencies for DOC (77.43 ± 16.54 %) and UV254 (83.18 ± 13.88 %) in S-B over 253 days of operation (KBV = 62 m(3) H2O/kg carbon). Adsorption dominated the removal of DOC and UV254 in the initial phases of KBV (- m(3) H2O/kg carbon), and simultaneous biodegradation and adsorption were identified as the mechanisms for organic pollutant uptake at KBV above 25 m(3) H2O/kg carbon.

Unpublished studies were identified via direct contact with participating investigators.Prospective diagnostic accuracy studies that compared coronary CTA with coronary angiography as the reference standard, using at least a 50% diameter reduction as a cutoff value for obstructive CAD. All patients needed to have a clinical indication for coronary angiography due to suspected CAD, and both tests had to be performed in all patients. Results had to be provided using 2×2 or 3×2 cross tabulations for the comparison of CTA with coronary angiography. Primary outcomes were the positive and negative predictive values of CTA as a function of clinical pretest probability of obstructive CAD, analysed by a generalised linear mixed model; calculations were performed including and excluding non-diagnostic CTA results. The no-treat/treat threshold model was used to determine the range of appropriate pretest probabilities for CTA. The threshold model was based on obtained post-test probabilities of less than % in case of negative CTA and above 50% in case of positive CTA. Sex, angina pectoris type, age, and number of computed tomography detector rows were used as clinical variables to analyse the diagnostic performance in relevant subgroups.Individual patient data from 5332 patients from 65 prospective diagnostic accuracy studies were retrieved. For a pretest probability range of 7-67%, the treat threshold of more than 50% and the no-treat threshold of less than % post-test probability were obtained using CTA. At a pretest probability of 7%, the positive predictive value of CTA was 50.9% (95% confidence interval 43.3% to 57.7%) and the negative predictive value of CTA was 97.8% (96.4% to 98.7%); corresponding values at a pretest probability of 67% were 82.7% (78.3% to 86.2%) and 85.% (80.2% to 88.9%), respectively. The overall sensitivity of CTA was 95.2% (92.6% to 96.9%) and the specificity was 79.2% (74.9% to 82.9%). CTA using more than 64 detector rows was associated with a higher empirical sensitivity than CTA using up to 64 rows (93.4%  86.5%, P=.002) and specificity (84.4%  72.6%, P<.001). The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for CTA was .897 (.889 to .906), and the diagnostic performance of CTA was slightly lower in women than in with men (area under the curve .874 (.858 to .890)  .907 (.897 to .916), P<.001). The diagnostic performance of CTA was slightly lower in patients older than 75 (.864 (.834 to .894), P=.018  all other age groups) and was not significantly influenced by angina pectoris type (typical angina .895 (.873 to .917), atypical angina .898 (.884 to .913), non-anginal chest pain .884 (.870 to .899), other chest discomfort .915 (.897 to .934)).In a no-treat/treat threshold model, the diagnosis of obstructive CAD using coronary CTA in patients with stable chest pain was most accurate when the clinical pretest probability was between 7% and 67%.

No group differences were found for nonverbal memory (p=.27). Our results may suggest an interactive negative effect of metabolic and structural temporal lobe abnormalities on verbal memory. Still, our results are preliminary and need further validation by studies involving larger patient groups and up-to date quantitative imaging analysis methods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To measure DOI information from a mono-layer array of scintillation crystals with a single-ended readout, our group has previously proposed and developed a new method based on light spread using triangular reflectors. Since this method relies on measurement of the light distribution, dSiPM, which has a fully digital interface, has several merits for our DOI measurement. The DOI PET detector comprised of a dSiPM sensor (DPC-3200-22-44) coupled with a 14   ×   14 array of 2 mm  ×  2 mm  ×  20 mm unpolished LGSO crystals. All crystals were covered with triangular reflectors. To obtain a good performance of the DOI PET detector, several parameters of detector were selected as a preliminary experiment. Detector performance was evaluated with the selected parameters and the optimal experimental setup, and a DOI measurement was conducted by irradiating the crystal block at five DOI positions spaced at intervals of 4 mm. Maximum-likelihood estimation was employed for DOI positioning and the optimal DOI estimation scheme was also investigated in this study. As a result, the DOI PET detector showed clear crystal identification. The  resolution (full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)) averaged over all depths was 10.21%  ±  .% at 511 keV, and time resolution averaged over all depths was 1198.61   ±   39.70  FWHM. The average DOI positioning accuracy for all depths was 74.22%  ±  6.77%, which equates to DOI resolution of 4.67 mm.  and DOI resolutions were uniform over all crystal positions except for the back parts of the array. Furthermore, additional simulation studies were conducted to verify the results of our DOI measurement method that is combined with dSiPM technology. In conclusion, our continuous DOI PET detector coupled with dSiPM is a promising PET/MRI detector with DOI-encoding capability.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20197195>Impact of dietary fat type within the context of altered cholesterol homeostasis on cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in the F1B hamster.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol status and dietary fat alter several metabolic pathways reflected in lipoprotein profiles. To assess plasma lipoprotein response and mechanisms by which cholesterol and dietary fat type regulate expression of genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism, we developed an experimental model system using F1B hamsters fed diets (12 weeks) enriched in 10% (wt/wt) coconut, olive, or safflower oil with either high cholesterol (.1%; cholesterol supplemented) or low cholesterol coupled with cholesterol-lowering drugs 10 days before killing (.01% cholesterol, .% lovastatin, 2% cholestyramine; cholesterol depleted). Irrespective of dietary fat, cholesterol depletion, relative to supplementation, resulted in lower plasma non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations (all  < .05). In the , these differences were associated with higher sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, low-density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and 7α-hydroxylase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels; higher scavenger receptor B1 and apolipoprotein A-I mRNA and protein levels; lower apolipoprotein E protein levels; and in intestine, modestly lower sterol transporters adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) A1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA levels. Irrespective of cholesterol status, coconut oil, relative to olive and safflower oils, resulted in higher non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations (both  < .05) and modestly higher sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 mRNA levels. These data suggest that, in F1B hamsters, differences in plasma lipoprotein profiles in response to cholesterol depletion are associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, whereas the effect of dietary fat type on gene expression was modest, which limits the usefulness of the experimental animal model.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We measured this variable in 87 subjects classified into five study groups: 19 controls (C), 18 alcoholics (E),  patients diagnosed as liver cirrhosis (CH), 11 chronic liver disease (HC) and 24 pregnant women (EMB). In our environment, the serum level of P-III-P in the healthy population was 9.12-12.8 ng/ml. In 27.77% of the alcoholics studied (5 cases) the mean value exceeded this level, 19.35 +/- 3.05 ng/ml. Forty percent of the cirrhotics (6 cases) presented the highest values, 26.54 +/- 11.45 ng/ml, while 83.33% of the patients with chronic active hepatitis presented a mean value of 18.53 +/- 3.8 ng/ml. Of the 24 pregnant women, 95.83% (23 cases) had higher than normal values, and concentrations roses in the last trimester of gestation with respect to the previous trimesters. Analysis of the correlations of all the biochemical parameters of liver function with P-III- disclosed a relationship between P-III- and alkaline phosphatase in the groups of cirrhotics and chronic persistent hepatitis (p less than .05).

To test this hypothesis, we measured the diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed in the mitochondrial matrix of fibroblast, liver, skeletal muscle, and epithelial cell lines. Spot photobleaching of GFP with a 100x objective (.8-micron spot diam) gave half-times for fluorescence recovery of -19 ms with >90% of the GFP mobile. As predicted for aqueous-phase diffusion in a confined compartment, fluorescence recovery was slowed or abolished by increased laser spot size or bleach time, and by paraformaldehyde fixation. Quantitative analysis of bleach data using a mathematical model of matrix diffusion gave GFP diffusion coefficients of 2-3 x 10(-7) cm2/s, only three to fourfold less than that for GFP diffusion in water. In contrast, little recovery was found for bleaching of GFP in fusion with subunits of the fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex that are normally present in the matrix. Measurement of the rotation of unconjugated GFP by time-resolved anisotropy gave a rotational correlation time of 23.3 +/- 1 ns, similar to that of 20 ns for GFP rotation in water. A rapid rotational correlation time of 325  was also found for a small fluorescent probe (BCECF, approximately .5 kD) in the matrix of isolated liver . The rapid and unrestricted diffusion of solutes in the mitochondrial matrix suggests that metabolite channeling may not be required to overcome diffusive barriers.

The dependencies of the total half band widths and the global relaxation times, on the DNA molecular subgroup structure and on the type of genomic DNA, are reported. In our study, the full widths at half-maximum (FWHMs) for the SERS bands of genomic DNAs from different leaf tissues are typically in the wavenumber range from  to 55 cm(-1). Besides, it can be observed that molecular relaxation processes studied in this work have a global relaxation time smaller than .71  and larger than .19 . A comparison between different ranges of FT-Raman and SERS band parameters, respectively, corresponding to DNA extracted from leaf tissues is given. It is shown that the interaction between DNA and a metallic surface has the potential to lead to a shortening of the global relaxation times, as compared with molecular dynamics in solution. We have found that the surface dynamics of molecular subgroups in plant DNA is, in some cases, about two times faster than the solution dynamics of nucleic acids. This can be rationalized in a qualitative manner by invoking the complex landscape of the interaction  between the molecule and the silver surface.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8960409>Enhancement of the  antagonistic effect of porcine somatotropin in swine using a monoclonal antibody.</a></h2><p>A monoclonal antibody (mAb), -7.6, to porcine somatotropin (pST) significantly enhanced the growth responses to pST injections in hypophysectomized (hypox) rats but could not be tested in pigs because of the large quantity of antibody required for a growth trial. Because pST inhibits the hypoglycemic effects of , an  tolerance test procedure was established to measure pST activity in jugular-catheterized pigs. Doses of , 30, 100, and 300 micrograms/kg per day of pST were split and administered subcutaneously (sc) in equal portions twice daily for 2 d. After a 17-hr fast, plasma samples were obtained at 10-min intervals for 30 min before an intravenous injection of  (.08 IU/kg) and then for an additional 50 min. Because pST increased fasting plasma glucose concentrations, preinsulin glucose values were used as a covariate to adjust the postinsulin concentrations. pST caused a dose-dependent increase in  to the  injection in these pigs. The areas under the curves (AUC), for plasma glucose were 22.1, 29., 39., and 47.2 mg/dl per min for the , 30, 100, and 300 micrograms/kg pST doses, respectively. Because different doses of pST could be detected, the -7.6 enhancement of pST treatment was evaluated. In the first experiment, five pigs/group each received sc injections of either vehicle, pST (75 micrograms/kg; approximately 3. mg/d), pST (75 micrograms/kg) + -7.6 at 3.75 mg/kg, or pST (75 micrograms/kg) + -7.6 at  mg/kg for 2 d before the  test. The pST and -7.6 were combined and incubated for at least 1 hr at room temperature before being injected. The injection of pST alone did not significantly change  tolerance activity (23.1 vs. 21.1, AUC), but   was enhanced when this dose of pST also included -7.6 (27.4 and 29.5, AUC, respectively; P < .05).

Low glycaemic index (GI) diets benefit both maternal and neonatal gestational outcomes. We hypothesize that maternal dietary GI or glycaemic load (GL) changes during pregnancy impact placental DNA methylation, especially in insulin resistance-related genes.From a clinical trial of overweight pregnant women, 12 subjects who successfully reduced their GI and another 12 whose GI increased despite the intervention were selected. A genome-wide differential methylation analysis of placental tissue DNA was conducted, followed by bioinformatic annotation and validation analysis. The distribution of genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and CpG sites was described. Six CpG sites in regulatory regions of four insulin-related genes (, , , and ) were selectively validated by pyrosequencing. Pairwise Spearman correlation analysis was performed to test methylation-phenotype association in an additional 153 subjects from the same trial. Correlation between methylation of significant sites and placental mRNA expression of  was also analysed.Dietary GI decreased by 24.3 (26.2-20.1) in the group who responded appropriately to the intervention and increased by 19.6 (.2-29.1) in the comparison group. Epigenome-wide analysis identified 108 DMRs and 365 CpG sites with  < .05 adjusted by false discovery rate, distributed over all chromosomes. The methylation level of cg05009389 in the 3' UTR of  was negatively correlated with maternal  gain ( = - .21,  = .027) and increase in insulin levels ( = - .24,  = .015) during gestation. Methylation levels of cg17586860 and cg18197392 in the 5' UTR region of  were negatively correlated with changes in dietary carbohydrate intake ( = - .24, s ≤ .006) and GL across gestation ( = - .23, s ≤ .008). This correlation survived the adjustment for maternal factors such as dietary GI, body mass index, and gestational diabetes. Up to 89% of cg18197392 methylation was explained by GL change.

Subjects were studied with primed continuous infusions of L-[(2)H5]phenylalanine and L-[(2)H2]tyrosine on day 4 following 3 days of diet habituation. Whole body protein kinetics [protein synthesis (), breakdown, and net balance (NB)] were expressed as changes from the fasted to the fed states. Positive NB was achieved at both protein levels, but NB was greater in 2RDA vs. 1RDA (94.8 ± 6. vs. 58.9 ± 4.9 g protein/750 min; P = .0001), without effects of distribution on NB.

Systematic studies of time-resolved fluorescence quenching dependent on the donor concentration in the concentration range of .01-2 M and finally in neat donor solvents broadly enabled us to determine the electron transfer dynamics in three regimes of electron transfer: stationary or diffusion-controlled electron transfer, non-stationary electron transfer and intrinsic or ultrafast electron transfer. Depending upon the electron-donating ability of the studied donors, intrinsic electron transfer was found to occur in the time domain of ∼1-9  and diffusion-controlled ET dynamics was observed in the time domain of 200-500 , whereas the maximum limit of non-stationary electron transfer could be observed in the time domain of -50 . Femtosecond transient absorption studies together with global and target analysis helped to identify the spectral signature of the (HFTPP˙) radical anion as the product of ET. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever evidence that shows the spectra of an anion as the product of ET for any porphyrin-based electron transfer dynamics. However, transient absorption measurements confirm that intrinsic ET occurs in the Q state, whereas diffusion-controlled ET occurs in the hot Q as well as in the thermal equilibrium Q state. The most remarkable fact derived from the measurements of transient absorption was that the rate of the forward electron transfer (CS) is exactly the same as the rate of the backward electron transfer (CR) for all three regimes of ET. The thermodynamic driving force for CR was found to lie in the range of the total reorganization  for the studied systems and hence falls in the Marcus optimal region, and the CR process is barrierless. The dependence on the driving force of the combination of forward and reverse electron transfer exhibited a bell-shaped curve for all three regimes of electron transfer, even though the rate of intrinsic ET is higher by a factor of ∼10 than that of diffusion-controlled ET. These results unambiguously favour the Marcus theory, in particular the controversial Marcus inverted region, of outer-sphere electron transfer.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25981526>Visual perceptions of male obesity: a cross-cultural study examining male and female lay perceptions of obesity in Caucasian males.</a></h2><p>Obesity is now common and this may have altered visual perceptions of what constitutes a 'normal' and therefore healthy .

The semi-monolithic scintillator PET detector has the advantage of measuring the depth of interaction with single-ended readout as compared to the traditional pixelated scintillator detector, and significantly reducing the edge effect that deteriorates the spatial resolution at edges of the detector as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector if a long rectangular semi-monolithic detector is used. In this work, depth-encoding PET detector modules were built by using long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillators and single-ended readout by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays. The performance of the detector modules was measured.The rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator detector has an outside dimension of 11.6 × 37.6 × 10 mm and consists of 11 polished lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) slices measuring 1 × 37.6 × 10 mm . The enhanced specular reflector (ESR) was glued on both cross-sectional surfaces of each crystal slice. For the face opposite to the SiPM array and the two end faces of the detectors, surface treatments with and without black paint were implemented for performance comparison. The bottom face of the semi-monolithic detector was coupled to a 4 × 12 SiPM array that was grouped along rows and columns separately into 16 signals. The four row signals were used to identify the slices, and the 12 column signals were used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth direction) interaction positions. The detector was irradiated at multiple positions with a collimated 511 keV gamma beam. The collimated beam was obtained with electronic collimation by using a  Na point source and a reference detector. The estimated width of the gamma beam is around .5 mm. The flood histogram for crystal slices was measured by using the center of gravity (COG) method. The COG method and the squared COG method were used for y position estimation. The standard deviation of the column signals, the ratio of maximum to the sum of the column signals, and the sum of squared column signals were used for z position estimation.All slices were clearly resolved from the measured flood histograms for both detectors with different crystal surface treatments. The estimated y positions roughly linearly change with the true positions at the middle of the detector until ~5 mm from both ends of the detector. The y and z spatial resolutions of the detectors were estimated for all middle positions located more than 5 mm from both ends of the detector. The squared COG method provides better y position resolution than the COG method. The three z estimation methods provide similar depth of interaction (DOI) resolution. Surface treatment with black paint significantly improves both y and z position resolution but degrades the  and timing resolution of the detectors. The average full width half maxima (FWHM) spatial resolution is improved from 1.77 to 1.07 mm in the y direction by using the squared COG method and from 2.71 to 1.55 mm in the z direction by using the standard deviation method. The slice-based average  resolution degrades from .8% to 24.9%. The timing resolution of the entire detector module degrades from 596 to 788 .The performance of rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors with two different crystal surface treatments was measured. The detectors provide superior spatial resolution and depth-encoding capability and can be used to develop small animal and dedicated breast and brain PET scanners that can simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and low cost.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12208752>Proteasome inhibitor -341 inhibits human myeloma cell growth in vivo and prolongs survival in a murine model.</a></h2><p>The proteasome is a ubiquitous and essential intracellular enzyme that degrades many proteins regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, cell adhesion,angiogenesis, and antigen presentation.

Metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin), daily insulin requirement, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal were unchanged after the HFD.A HFD downregulates postabsorptive protein turnover in men with T1DM, by decreasing both protein degradation and synthesis, possibly due to a subtle decrease and/or delay in amino acid absorption. It does not significantly affect the insulin (and amino acid sensitivity) to protein turnover, glucose disposal, and metabolic control.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30852091>Thirty-Day Unplanned Reintubation Following Pleurodesis: A Retrospective National Registry Analysis.</a></h2><p>To examine risk factors associated with 30-day unplanned reintubation after pleurodesis.A retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical outcomes registry.United States hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.The study comprised 2,358 patients who underwent video-assisted thorascopic surgery for pleurodesis from 2007 to 2016.None.The final sample included 2,358 cases, of which 93 (3.9%) required 30-day unplanned reintubation.

Self-closure of these defects in patients with defects less than 8 mm has been reported in several studies. In children, transcatheter closure of the ASD is suggested for asymptomatic patients older than two years and with  >  kg. The purpose of this study was to show that transcatheter closure of ASD in small children with body  less than 10 kg is an effective and safe method.Between July 2016 and September 2018, 35 children with body  less than 10 kg underwent percutaneous closure of ASD using amplatzer. All patients had minimum defect size of 6 mm, pulmonary blood flow (Qp) to systemic blood flow (Qs) ratio above 1.5, right atrial and ventricular dilation, symptoms of delayed growth, and recurrent respiratory infections in their evaluation and had acceptable rims for intervention. Follow-up evaluations were done 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and yearly after discharge with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and electrocardiography (ECG).The mean age of patients at procedure was 12.06 ± 4.47 months (range: 6 to 14 months), mean  was 8.32 ± .72 kg (range: 7.5 to 9.8 kg).

All participants performed maximum reach in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral directions of the SEBT; as well as, the -Bearing Lunge Test (WBLT) to measure DFROM. Dependent variables included maximal DFROM (cm) and normalized SEBT reach distances (%). Independent t-tests were used for group comparisons (a priori p ≤ .05). Simple-linear regression examined the relationship between the WBLT and each SEBT direction.Significant differences were detected between groups for the WBLT (CAI: 10.73 ± 3.44 cm, healthy: 12.47 ± 2.51 cm; p=.03) and anterior reach distance (CAI: 76.05 ± 6.25%, healthy: 80.12 ± 5.88%; p=.01). No differences were identified in posteromedial or posterolateral (>.70) reach. The WBLT had a significant moderate correlation to anterior reach in both groups (<.05) but was not significantly correlated to posteromedial or posterolateral reach distance (>.70).The results indicate that participants with CAI demonstrated less DFROM and anterior SEBT reach distance compared to health controls. Additionally, both groups demonstrated similar correlations between WBLT and SEBT performance. These findings suggest that participants with CAI have alterations in ankle motion which may negatively influence dynamic postural control; however, the relationship between WBLT and SEBT performance is consistent in those with and without CAI.Copyright © 2012 Sports Medicine Australia.

Total egg production was similar between CPl and CPh birds during phase 1 and 2 but was reduced by 2.8 eggs for CPl birds during phase 3. For the overall laying period, CPl birds tended (P = .075) to produce 4.7 fewer total eggs. Hatchability of set eggs was similar between CPl and CPh birds during phases 1 and 2 but tended (P = .064) to be lower for CPl birds in phase 3. PSe birds showed an advanced age at sexual maturity and age at peak production of 4.6 and 5.3 d, respectively, resulting in 2.5 more total eggs during phase 1.

However, because both the top and bottom SiPM arrays are reading the same pixels, this creates information redundancy. We propose a dichotomous orthogonal symmetric (DOS) dual-end readout block detector design, which removes this redundancy by reducing the number of SiPMs and still achieves XY and DOI (Z) decoding for positron emission tomography (PET) block detector. Reflecting films are used within the block detector to channel photons going to the top of the block to go only in the X direction, and photons going to the bottom are channeled along the Y direction. Despite the unidirectional channeling on each end, the top readout provides both X and Y information using two one-dimensional SiPM arrays instead of a two-dimensional SiPM array; similarly, the bottom readout also provides both X and Y information with just two one-dimensional SiPM arrays. Thus, a total of four one-dimensional SiPM arrays (4  ×  N SiPMs) are used to decode the XYZ positions of the firing pixels instead of two two-dimensional SiPM arrays (2  ×  N  ×  N SiPMs), reducing the number of SiPM arrays per block from 2N(2) to 4 N for PET/MR or PET/CT systems. Moreover, the SiPM arrays on one end can be replaced by two regular photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), so that a block needs only 2 N SiPMs  +  2 half-PMTs; this hybrid-DOS DOI block detector can be used in PET/CT systems. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to study the performance of our DOS DOI block detector design, including the XY-decoding quality,  resolution, and DOI resolution. Both BGO and LSO scintillators were studied. We found that 4 mm pixels were well decoded for 5  ×  5 BGO and 9  ×  9 LSO arrays with 4 to 5 mm DOI resolution and 16-20%  resolution. By adding light-channel decoding, we modified the DOS design to a high-resolution design, which resolved scintillator pixels smaller than the SiPM dimensions. Detector pixels of 2.4 mm were decoded for 8  ×  8 BGO and   ×   LSO arrays with 5 mm DOI resolution and 20-23%  resolution. Time performance was also studied for the 8  ×  8 BGO and   ×   LSO HR-DOS arrays. The timing resolution for the corner and central crystals is 986  ±  122  and 1.89  ±  .17 μs respectively with BGO, 137  ±  42  and 458  ±  67  respectively with LSO. Monte Carlo simulations with GATE/Geant4 demonstrated the feasibility of our DOS DOI block detector design. In conclusion, our novel design achieved good performance except the time performance while using fewer SiPMs and supporting electronic channels than the current non-DOI PET detectors. This novel design can significantly reduce the cost, heat, and readout complexity of DOI block detectors for PET/MR/CT systems that don't require the time-of-flight capability.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22692091>Child mortality levels and trends by HIV status in Blantyre, Malawi: 1989-2009.</a></h2><p>Continuous evaluation of child survival is needed in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV prevalence among women of reproductive age continues to be high.

One method utilizes a 2.4 L/min/m CI and nadir Hct of 28% (PS1) and the other a 3. L/min/m CI with a nadir Hct of 25% (PS2).Cardiopulmonary bypass cases during which the PS1 or PS2 strategies were applied were retrospectively examined, finding no significant difference in pre-CPB lactate, maximum lactate on CPB or maximum change in lactate on CPB.While the post-CPB lactate was statistically significantly higher in the PS2 group (p=.024), the magnitude of difference (. mmol/L) was small.This study illustrates that, when  delivery or tissue perfusion is suspected as the primary cause of lactate production during CPB, increasing the CI to a 3. rather than a 2.4 CI may be more advantageous than packed red blood cell administration.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18534487>In vivo comparison of knee kinematics for subjects having either a posterior stabilized or cruciate retaining high-flexion total knee arthroplasty.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo kinematics for subjects having either a fixed posterior stabilized () or cruciate retaining (CR) high-flexion total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Six randomly assigned participants received  (whey protein = 36-37 g) in split doses immediately before and after exercise sessions. Others consumed a matched protein dose 24 h postexercise. Measurements of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength for six different resistance exercises, arm peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and arm anaerobic power (Wingate) were obtained 3 months before (-3mo), at the beginning (0mo), 3 months into (3mo), and 6 months after (6mo) the beginning of CRT.One-repetition maximum increased by 8%-11% ± 6%-12% for each successive 3-month period (P ≤ .001-.012), independent of  group (P = .105).

Capillary permeability surface area product for glucose ((glu)) (capillary recruitment), FGU, and interstitial  concentrations increased significantly over time (P < .001) in both forearms. Compared with -sensitive, the IR subjects exhibited lower (glu) (P < .001) and FGU (P < .01) in the Ctrl arm, whereas this difference was insignificant in the MCh arm despite the blunted forearm blood flow increase. Moreover, in IR individuals MCh significantly (P < .05) ameliorated the delayed onset of  action, i.e. the FGU response to hyperinsulinemia. Finally, we found (glu) to be a strong and independent predictor of FGU response (adjusted R(2) .72; P < .0001).MCh-induced vasodilation may improve the microvascular and metabolic responses to physiological hyperinsulinemia in obese, IR individuals.

All binding events ended with a rapid (<10 ) lock-in of the fatty acid due to formation of a hydrogen bond with Tyr401. The kinetics and energetics of the penetration process both depended linearly on the positional shift of the fatty acid, with an average insertion time and free  reduction of, respectively, 32 ± 20  and .70 ± . kcal/mol per methylene group absorbed. Binding events of longer duration (tbind>1 ns) were characterized by a slow exploration of the pocket entry and, frequently, of a nearby protein crevice corresponding to a metastable state along the route to the binding site. Taken all together, these findings reconstruct the following pathway for the binding process of stearic acid: (i) contact with the protein surface, possibly facilitated by the presence of an intermediate location, (ii) probing of the site entry, (iii) insertion into the protein, and (iv) lock-in at the final position. This general description may also apply to other long-chain fatty acids binding into any of the high-affinity sites of albumin, or to specific sites of other lipid-binding proteins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The structural similarity in respect of the aromatic ring between the dispersed phase, styrene, and the surfactants facilitates solubilization of styrene up to four times the  of LEP and 11 times that of LET. We propose that the solubilization site varies between core in the LEP and shell in the LET micelles. LET affords double emulsions, water in oil in water (w/o/w) over a narrow phase composition, for example at R=7., where R represents ratio of  of styrene to LET. A schematic model depicting the solubilization site of styrene at different regions in LET and LEP micelles has been proposed. On polymerization, the emulsions with LET and LEP micelles generated high molecular  polymer nanoparticles of size 12-49 nm with low polydispersity index (P(d)). This demonstrates that micellar assemblies act as templating controlled reactors for the polymerization reaction. We demonstrate that  nanoparticle dispersion of size 49 nm with polymer  fraction as high as 42.80% could be produced from emulsions with the LET surfactant, in contrast to LEP that is 50% less efficient. Polymerization of these emulsions occurs predominantly through a micellar nucleation mechanism.

Common reasons for "screen failure" (RFSF) are well documented; however, their effect on subsequent standard therapy (SST) and outcomes is unclear.This retrospective study evaluated patients aged ≥18 years with solid malignancy who were listed as ineligible on a screening log between February 2011 and March 2018. Patients screen-failed for biomarker results or incorrect  stage/prior treatment profile were excluded. Data were collected from electronic hospital records, including demographics,  history, RFSF, subsequent therapy, and outcomes.Overall, 217 patients were eligible. The most common histologies were lung (28%), melanoma, , and pancreatic (all 11%); 90% were metastatic. The most common RFSF were rapid disease progression (PD; 16%), performance status () ≥2 (12%), and abnormal liver function tests (aLFT; 12%). After screen failure, 129/217 (59%) had SST; 9 were dose-reduced. Treatment-naïve or phase III trial-ineligible patients were more likely to receive SST than those pre-treated or phase I trial-ineligible (72/104 vs. 52/113, p = .0006; 71/109 vs. /42, p = .00013), respectively. RFSF stabilised/improved in 104/217 (48%); the main RFSF was co-morbidity (19/104). The most common RFSF to deteriorate were rapid PD (27/72),  ≥2 (20/72), and aLFT with liver metastases (LM; 13/72).RFSF related to organ function rarely deteriorate unless directly involved with underlying malignancy. Most RFSF do not prevent patients from having SST, nor increase dose reductions, especially in treatment-naïve/phase III trial-ineligible patients. Those with RFSF of poor , rapid PD, and aLFT from LM are less suitable for SST. Careful broadening of trial eligibility is warranted.© 2019 S.

In the present study, PNU-214565, a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the Fab of the monoclonal antibody C242 and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), was used in an escalating repeat dose Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies. A prior single-dose Phase I clinical trial had demonstrated safety at doses of 1.5 ng/kg with toxicities of fever and hypotension that were not dose related. Twenty-seven patients (age range, 36-75 years; median, 62; 14 males and 13 females; 23 colorectal and 4 pancreatic) were treated in the present study with one cycle of four consecutive daily 3-h infusions of PNU-214565 at doses of . ng/kg (n = 3); .5 ng/kg (n = 3), 1.5 ng/kg (n = 4), 2.75 ng/kg (n = 12), and 3.5 ng/kg (n = 5). All patients had a good performance status [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group:  =  (n = ),  = 1 (n = 12)]. As in the single-dose trial, fever and hypotension were the most common toxicities. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), consisting of transient hypotension responsive to dopamine, was experienced by one patient treated at the 2.75 ng/kg dose level. One patient with pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver experienced a partial response of hepatic metastases with stable pancreatic head abnormalities by computed tomography scan. Further dose escalation was suspended when two patients treated in a companion repeat dose Phase I study experienced DLT at the 4 ng/kg dose level. Multiparameter analyses on all patients treated in the two companion single-dose and two-repeated-dose Phase I trials revealed that the levels of patients' pretreatment anti-SEA antibodies protected against toxicity at a given drug dose. By jointly considering weight and the baseline anti-SEA concentration in a patient, it is possible to assign a PNU-214565 dose that will induce systemic cytokine release (a surrogate test to assess for the presence of uncomplexed drug and its ability to induce systemic cellular activation) without DLT.

Tonsillectomy may remove pathogen sources and reduce the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), limiting degalactosylated IgA1 (deGal-IgA1) production, which is considered to be the initiating pathogenetic event leading to IgA glomerular deposition. In the European network VALIGA, 62/1147 IgAN patients underwent tonsillectomy (TxIgAN). In a cross-sectional study  of these patients were tested and compared to 45 non-tonsillectomized IgAN (no-TxIgAN) and healthy controls (HC) regarding levels of deGal-IgA1, and markers of innate immunity and oxidative stress, including toll-like receptors (TLR)2, 3, 4 and 9 mRNAs, proteasome () and immunoproteasome (iPS) mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). Levels of deGal-IgA1 were lower in TxIgAN than in no-TxIgAN (p = .015), but higher than in HC (p = .003). TLR mRNAs were more expressed in TxIgAN than in HC (TLR4, p = .021; TLR9, p = .027), and higher in TxIgAN than in no-TxIgAN (p ≤ .001 for TLR2, 4, 9).

In contrast to the peripheral circulation, KRAS mutation- positive CTC thrive in the portal venous blood of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To analyze the essential interactions that contribute to carcinoma CTC growth and immune resistance, portal venous blood was collected during pancreatico-duodenectomy in 41 patients with peri-ampullary pathologies (PDAC = 11; ampullary adenocarcinoma (AA) = ; distal cholangiocarcinoma (CC) = 6; IPMN = 7; non-malignant pancreatitis = 2). FACS-isolated cell populations from the portal circulation were reconstituted ex vivo using mixed cell reaction cultures (MCR). During the first 48hr, PDAC, AA, and CC patient CTC were all highly proliferative (mean 1.7 hr/cell cycle, 61.5% ± 20% growing cells) and resistant to apoptosis (mean 39% ±  25% apoptotic cells). PDAC CTC proliferation and resistance to T cell cytotoxicity were decreased among patients who received pre-operative chemotherapy (p = .0019, p = .0191, respectively). After 7 days in culture, CTC from PDAC, CC, and AA patients recruited multiple immune cell types, including CD105 + CD14 + myeloid fibroblasts, to organize into spheroid-like clusters. It was only in PDAC and CC-derived MCR that cluster formation promoted CTC survival, growth, and fibroblast differentiation. FACS depletion of CTC or myeloid fibroblast cells eliminated cluster network formation, and re-introduction of these cell populations reconstituted such ability. Our findings suggest that PDAC and CC CTC survival within the portal venous circulation is supported by their interactions with immune cells within multi-cell type clusters that could represent vectors of local recurrence and metastatic progression.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551789>Metabolomics Analysis Reveals the Protection Mechanism of Huangqi-Danshen Decoction on Adenine-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease in Rats.</a></h2><p>Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD) is a commonly used drug pair for clinical treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in traditional Chinese medicine with good efficacy. However, the potential mechanisms of this action have not been well elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the metabolic profiling variations in response to HDD treatment in a CKD rat model. CKD rat model was induced by adding .75% adenine to the diet for 4 weeks. The rats in the treatment group received HDD extract orally at the dose of 4.7 g/kg/day during the experiment. At the end of the experiment, serum and kidney samples were collected for biochemical and pathological examination. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) was used to analyze metabolic profiling variations in the kidney. The results showed that treatment with HDD markedly attenuated kidney injury and improved renal function. A total of 28 metabolites contributing to CKD phenotype were found and identified in the kidney samples. The primary metabolic pathways disordered in the kidney of CKD rats were glycerophospholipid , glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis, and citrate cycle. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plot showed that the three groups of renal samples were obviously divided into three categories, and the metabolic trajectory of the HDD treatment group moved to the control group. (E)-Piperolein A, phosphatidylcholines (PC) (18:1/22:6), phosphatidylinositols (PI) (13:/18:1), PI (:/20:3), phosphatidylserines () (O-20:/12:), and triglyceride (TG) (22:4/24:/O-18:) represented potential biomarkers of the renoprotective effects of HDD against CKD.

In total, nine hundred 1-day-old mixed sex broilers (Ross-308) were randomly distributed over 6 (2 × 3) experimental diets comprising 5 replicates of 30 broilers each for 35 d. The experimental diets contain either soybean meal (SBM) or canola meal (CM) with 3 levels (100, 110, and 120% of NRC recommendation) of d-Thr. During the course of the trial ( to 35 D), interactions (P < .05) between  and d-Thr were observed for feed intake (FI), body  gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass, and gut health parameters. The broilers fed recommended level (100%) of d-Thr had 7 and 5% poorer FCR compared with those fed diets with 110 and 120% d-Thr, respectively. For villus height (VH), an interaction (P = .007) was found between  and d-Thr level. Broilers consuming SBM diets had 22% longer villi, 10% deeper crypts, and 30% greater VH to crypt depth ratio (VCR) compared to those fed CM. The broilers fed 110% d-Thr diets had 9% lower crypt depth (CD) and % greater VCR compared with those fed diets containing NRC recommended levels. CM resulted in 9% lower protein digestibility with lower (P < .05) of some AA, whereas it was improved by 7% in broilers fed 120% d-Thr supplemented diets.

The pulse length has been measured using a resonant 3 GHz deflecting cavity in TM mode. We have measured the pulse length in three ionization regimes. The first is direct two-photon photoionization using only a 480 nm femtosecond laser pulse, which results in short (∼ ) but hot (∼10K) electron bunches. The second regime is just-above-threshold femtosecond photoionization employing the combination of a continuous-wave 780 nm excitation laser and a tunable 480 nm femtosecond ionization laser which results in  ultracold (∼10 K)  ultrafast (∼25 ) electron bunches. These pulses typically contain ∼10 electrons and have a root-mean-square normalized transverse beam emittance of 1.5 ± .1 nm rad. The measured pulse lengths are limited by the  spread associated with the longitudinal size of the ionization volume, as expected. The third regime is just-below-threshold ionization which produces Rydberg states which slowly ionize on microsecond time scales.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150004>Whole body protein anabolism in COPD patients and healthy older adults is not enhanced by adding either carbohydrates or leucine to a serving of protein.</a></h2><p>Carbohydrates (CHO) and leucine (LEU) both have insulinotropic properties, and could therefore enhance the protein anabolic capacity of dietary proteins, which are important nutrients in preventing muscle loss in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

In our study, we evaluated the survival results and prognostic factors among T4 local advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) patients in a large heterogeneous group, in accordance with this new system.We retrospectively evaluated the files of 122 T4 N0-3 M0 LA-NSCLC patients, identified according to the new staging system, treated at two centers between November 2003 and June 2012. Variables correlating with univariate survival at p<.20 were later included in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Here, selection of relevant predictors of survival was carried out in accordance with the likelihood ratio formula with p<.05 regarded as significant.The median age was 60 and the median follow-up period was 17.4 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months, the 1 year overall survival (OS) rate was 72%, and the 5 year OS rate was 28%. Statistically significant predictors of survival were (p<.20) ECOG- (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status), age, T4 factor subgroup, stage and primary treatment in OS univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis for OS ECOG- (p=.001), diagnostic stage (p=.021), and primary treatment (p=.004) were significant. In the group receiving non-curative treatment, the median OS was 11. months, while it was 19. months in the definitive RT group and 26.6 months in the curative treatment group. There was a significant difference between the non-curative group and the groups which had definitive RT and curative operations (respectively p<.001 and p=.001) in terms of OS, but not between the groups which had definitive RT and curative operations. The median event free survival (EFS) rate was 9.9 months, with rates of 46% and 19% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. On univariate analysis of EFS rate with ECOG-,  loss and staging, statistical significance was found only for thorax computerized tomography (CT)+18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) use, stage and primary treatment (p<.20). In multivariate analysis with EFS, only the primary treatment was statistically significant (p=.001). In the group receiving non-curative treatment, the median EFS was 10.5 months while in the curative operation group it was 14.7 months. When all the primary treatment groups were taken into consideration, grade III/IV side effect was observed in 57 patients (46.6%). Esophagitis was most prominent among those that received definitive radiotherapy.Independent prognostic factors among these 122 heterogeneous LA-NSCLC T4 N0-3 M0 patients were age at diagnosis, ECOG-, stage and primary treatment, the last also being a significant prognostic indicator of EFS. Our findings point to the importance of appropriate staging and a multidisciplinary approach with modern imaging methods in this patient group.

The E. coli K-12 inactivation kinetics observed in batch experiments was well described with first-order reaction. The optimum inactivation rate (k = .47 log/min) attained at a NP dose of 1 g/L and a  dose of 1 mM, corresponding to total inactivation of 7 log cfu/mL cells within  min. Measured k increased > 2-fold when temperature increased from 20 to 50 °C; and > 4-fold when pH decreased from 9 to 3. Aerobic conditions were more beneficial to cell inactivation than anaerobic conditions due to more reactive  species (ROS) generated. ROS responsible for the inactivation were identified to be SO > OH > HO based on a positive scavenging test and in situ ROS determination. In situ characterization suggested that  effectively bind to NP surface was likely to form charge transfer complex (≡Fe(II)⋯OSOOSO), which mediated ROS generation and E. coli K-12 oxidation. The increased cell-envelope lesions consequently aggravated intracellular protein depletion and genome damage to cause definite bacterial death. The NP still maintained good physiochemical structure and stable activity even after 4 cycle. Moreover, NP/ system also exhibited good E. coli K-12 inactivation efficiency in authentic water matrices like surface water and effluents of secondary wastewater.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays have attracted attention for use as a fast TOF PET photosensor. Since numerous SiPM arrays are needed to construct a modern human PET, a multiplexing method providing both good timing performance and high channel reduction capability is required to develop a SiPM-based TOF PET. The purpose of this study was to develop a capacitive multiplexing circuit for the SiPM-based TOF PET. The proposed multiplexing circuit was evaluated by measuring the coincidence resolving time (CRT) and the  resolution as a function of the overvoltage using three different capacitor values of , 30, and 51 pF. A flood histogram was also obtained and quantitatively assessed. Experiments were performed using a [Formula: see text] array of [Formula: see text] mm SiPMs. Regarding the capacitor values, the multiplexing circuit using a smaller capacitor value showed the best timing performance. On the other hand, the  resolution and flood histogram quality of the multiplexing circuit deteriorated as the capacitor value became smaller. The proposed circuit was able to achieve a CRT of [Formula: see text]  FWHM and an  resolution of 17.1[Formula: see text] with a pair of [Formula: see text] mm LYSO crystals using a capacitor value of 30 pF at an overvoltage of 3. V.

EMA items assessed current activity (e.g., Watching TV/Movies, Reading/Computer, Physical Activity/Exercise). EMA responses were time-matched to minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary activity (SA) measured by accelerometer immediately before and after each EMA prompt.Unanswered EMA prompts had greater MVPA (± min) than answered EMA prompts (p = .029) for under/normal  participants, indicating that activity level might influence the likelihood of responding. The -min. intervals before versus after the EMA-reported physical activity (n = 296 occasions) did not differ in MVPA (p > .05), suggesting that prompting did not disrupt physical activity.

Methods A total of 24 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups. Group I received normal saline, Group II received  (20 mg/kg b.w.) by gavage, Group III was treated with DOX alone ( mg/kg b.w., i.p.) and Group IV received the combination of DOX and . Results After 8 weeks, the results displayed that DOX caused a decrease in testicular volume and index, epididymal sperm count, seminiferous tubule diameter and germinal epithelium. DOX also reduced the number of spermatogonia, spermatoctyes and Sertoli cells as well as increased the lumen diameter of seminiferous tubules (p<.05) and the incidence of histopathological changes of the testis. Moreover, elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and declined glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were observed (p<.05). On the contrary,  treatment significantly ameliorated nearly all of these abnormalities (p<.05). Conclusions  protects against DOX-induced testicular toxicity in rats, which is likely via the inhibition of oxidative stress and the increase of antioxidant enzyme activity.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29915669>Performance Comparison of Different Readouts for Position-Sensitive Solid-State Photomultiplier Arrays.</a></h2><p>A thorough comparison of five different readouts for reading out a 2 × 2 array of 5 mm × 5 mm position-sensitive solid-state photomultipliers (-SSPM) was undertaken. The five readouts include reading out the 20 signals (16 position and 4 timing) individually, two signal multiplexing readouts, and two position decoding readouts. Flood histogram quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and  resolution were compared at different bias voltage (27. V to 32. V, at .5 V intervals) and at a fixed temperature of  °C by coupling a 6 × 6 array of 1.3 mm × 1.3 mm × 20 mm polished LSO crystals to the center of the -SSPM array. The timing resolution was measured at a bias voltage of 31. V (optimal bias voltage in terms of flood histogram quality). The best flood histogram quality value and signal-to-noise were 7.3 ± 1.6 and 33.5 ± 3.1, respectively, and were obtained by shaping and digitizing the 16 position signals individually. The capacitive charge-division readout is the simplest readout among the five evaluated but still resulted in good performance with a flood histogram quality value of 3.3 ± .4 and a SNR of 18.3 ± 1.3. The average  resolution and the average timing resolution were .2 ± 1.2 % and 8.4 ± 1.6 ns for individual signal readout and .9 ± 1.2 % and 8.8 ± 1.3 ns by using the capacitive charge-division readout method. These studies show that for an ultra-high spatial resolution applications using the 2 × 2 -SSPM array, reading out the 20 signals individually is necessary; whilst the capacitive charge-division readout is a cost-effective readout for less demanding applications.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29530048>Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poorer satisfaction with -related treatment and quality of life in patients with type 2 : a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the possible association of vitamin D deficiency with self-reported treatment satisfaction and health-related quality of life in patients with type 2 .We performed a sub-analysis of a previous study and included a total of 292 type 2 diabetic patients.

The HPI had minimum protein solubility () at pH 4., which increased as pH was decreased or increased. In contrast, the HPM had minimum  at pH 3., which increased at higher pH values. Gel electrophoresis showed that some of the high molecular  proteins (>45 kDa) present in HPM were not well extracted by the alkali and were absent or present in low ratio in the HPI polypeptide profile. The amino acid composition showed that the isolation process increased the Arg/Lys ratio of HPI (5.52%) when compared to HPM (3.35%). Intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism data indicate that the HPI proteins had a well-defined structure at pH 3., which was lost as pH value increased. The differences in structural conformation of HPI at different pH values were reflected as better foaming capacity at pH 3. when compared to pH 5., 7., and 9.. At 10 and 25 mg/mL protein concentrations, emulsions formed by the HPM had smaller oil droplet sizes (higher quality), when compared to the HPI-formed emulsions. In contrast at 50 mg/mL protein concentration, the HPI-formed emulsions had smaller oil droplet sizes (except at pH 3.). We conclude that the functional properties of hemp seed protein products are dependent on structural conformations as well as protein concentration and pH.© 2014 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29589754>Phenothiazine Radical Cation Excited States as Super-oxidants for -Demanding Reactions.</a></h2><p>We demonstrate that the 10-phenyl-10 H-phenothiazine radical cation (PTZ) has a manifold of excited doublet states accessible using visible and near-infrared light that can serve as super-photooxidants with excited-state potentials is excess of +2.1 V vs SCE to power  demanding oxidation reactions. Photoexcitation of PTZ in CHCN with a 517 nm laser pulse populates a D electronically excited doublet state that decays first to the unrelaxed lowest electronic excited state, D' (τ < .3 ), followed by relaxation to D (τ = 10.9 ± .4 ), which finally decays to D (τ = 32.3 ± .8 ). D' can also be populated directly using a lower  900 nm laser pulse, which results in a longer D'→D relaxation time (τ = 19 ± 2 ). To probe the oxidative power of PTZ photoexcited doublet states, PTZ was covalently linked to each of three hole acceptors, perylene (Per), 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA), and 10-phenyl-9-anthracenecarbonitrile (ACN), which have oxidation potentials of 1.04, 1.27, and 1.6 V vs SCE, respectively. In all three cases, photoexcitation wavelength dependent ultrafast hole transfer occurs from D, D', or D of PTZ to Per, DPA, and ACN. The ability to take advantage of the additional oxidative power provided by the upper excited doublet states of PTZ will enable applications using this chromophore as a super-oxidant for -demanding reactions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19113134>Temperature dependence of the free volume from positron lifetime experiments and its relation to structural dynamics: phenylphthalein-dimethylether.</a></h2><p>Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was used to study the microstructure of the free volume in the temperature range between 103 K and 393 K in phenylphthalein-dimethylether (PDE), a low-molecular- glass former. Using the routine LIFETIME9., the ortho-positronium (o-) lifetime distribution was analyzed, and from this, the volume distribution gn(vh) of subnanometer-size holes was calculated. From a comparison of PALS and specific volume data, the number density and the volume fraction of holes were estimated. These free-volume data, as a function of temperature, were used to test the validity of the Cohen-Turnbull (CT) free-volume theory. It was found that the structural relaxation from dielectric spectroscopy can be described by the CT theory after introducing a corrected free volume (Vf-DeltaV), where DeltaV=.014 cm3/g. The extended free-volume theory of Cohen and Grest can be fitted to the dielectric-relaxation and free-volume data, but the parameters of both fits are not consistent. PDE shows some peculiar features. The "knee" in the o - lifetime expansion and crossover in temperature dependence of the frequency of the primary dielectric relaxation process occur at different temperatures. In addition, the change in the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann parameters at TB/Tg=1.1 has no observable effect on the mean free volume vh (or Vf). The size of the smallest representative freely fluctuating subsystem, VSV estimated from the standard deviation sigmah of gn(vh), decreases from 4.1 nm3 to 2.6 nm3 when the temperature increases from T/Tg=1. to 1.. Correspondingly, the length of dynamic heterogeneity, xi=VVS1/3, decreases from 1.6 nm to 1.4 nm.

The aerobic granular SNDPR system was firstly subjected to low salinity (.5%, w/v) at moderate temperature (>  ℃) and subsequent low temperature (<  ℃). The shock loading of salinity temporarily deteriorated biological phosphorus removal, while dual stresses of salinity and low temperature induced temporary inhibition on both nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Both salinity and low temperature stimulated the settleability of aerobic granules, accompanied with decreased ratios of protein to polysaccharide (PN/). Illumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that salinity rarely affected bacterial richness, but significantly decreased the diversity. Whereas low temperature strengthened both bacterial richness and diversity. Phyla Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and their sub-groups acted as the main halophilic bacteria while Proteobacteria was also psychrophilic. The functional bacteria such as nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and phosphorus removal bacteria exhibited greater tolerance to salt and low temperature than glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs). Overall, the present study demonstrated the resilience and robustness of aerobic granular sludge toward salinity and low temperature, which could aid the knowledge of saline wastewater treatment by aerobic granular sludge.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Three types of experiments are reported. First, variation of the excitation wavelength from 297 to 266 nm leaves the excited state dynamics unaffected. The biexponential decay of the excited state absorption is independent of excitation wavelength with time constants of .57 ± .06 and 1.88 ± .09 , in excellent agreement with the results reported earlier (.56 ± .06 and 1.81 ± . ) following excitation at 266 nm. Second, variation of the chirp of the excitation pulse influences the relative amplitude of the fast and slow decay components but has no influence on the photoproduct yield. Third, a 545 nm pulse delayed by .64  with respect to the initial 266 nm pulse was used to perturb the "slow" population and probe the influence of additional electronic or vibrational  on the reaction process. The results show ultrafast internal conversion Sn → S1 on a ca. 150 fs time scale but no subsequent effect on the reaction dynamics.

A critical need exists to develop and test the psychometrics of brief quantitative tools for minority pediatric populations.To modify the adult beverage intake questionnaire (BEVQ-) for Hispanic preschool-aged children (BEVQ-) and test its validity and test-retest reliability in children aged 3 to 5 years.Cross-sectional. The modified quantitative 12-beverage category questionnaire assessed consumption of water, fruit juice, sweetened juice drinks, whole milk, reduced-fat milk, low-fat milk, flavored milk, carbonated sweetened drinks, diet carbonated drinks, sweet tea, tea with or without artificial sweetener, and sport drinks consumed during the past month. Hispanic mothers (n=109) recruited from day-care centers provided one 4-day food intake record (FIR) and completed two BEVQ- surveys during a 2-week period for their preschool-aged child. Data collection was conducted through one-on-one interviews in Spanish. Validity was assessed by comparing amounts (in grams) and energy intake (in kilocalories) for each beverage category between the first BEVQ- and the mean of the FIRs using paired t tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Criteria for validity were nonsignificant mean differences in grams and kilocalories from the first BEVQ- and mean of the FIRs beverage categories, and significant correlation coefficients between beverage categories. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing grams and kilocalories for each beverage category in the first BEVQ- with those from the second BEVQ- using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The criterion for reliability was a significant correlation coefficient between beverage categories. Significance was set at P<.05.Mean differences between the first BEVQ- and FIR for water (42.4±23.1 g), sweetened juice drinks (-1.6±11. g), whole milk (18.3±9.91 g), sweetened carbonated drinks (-13.±7.9 g), and total sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) (1.4±8.9 g) were not significantly different, but were significantly correlated (r=.20 to .37; P<.05). Thus, validity criteria were met. With the exception of flavored milk and tea with or without artificial sweeteners, the remaining beverage categories-total beverages and SSB-in the first BEVQ- were correlated with those from the second BEVQ- (r=.20 to .68; P<.05), meeting reliability criteria.Researchers and clinicians may use the BEVQ- to assess SSB, water, and whole-milk intake in Hispanic children.

Women younger than 65 years (17. vs 12. months; p=.03), who had adenocarcinoma histology (. vs 10. months; p=.006) and who had a hemoglobin level≥12 g/dL (18. vs 12. months; p=.01) were found to have a better median OS rate than men. Median OS rates were found to be 13. months in females and 12. months in males (p=.14). Among metastatic patients, the median OS was 11. months in females and 8. months in males (p=.005). Among stage IIIB and stage IV patients who had first line platinum-based chemotherapy, the median OS was 17. months in women and 11. months in men (p=.002). The response rate of chemotherapy was higher in women than in men (p=.03).In our study, we found that survival duration is longer and chemotherapy response is better in women with NSCLC who do not have anemia or comorbidities and who are mostly non-smokers with adenocarcinomas. Further studies regarding the causes of these differences may provide clarity on this subject.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237801>Adolescent Loss-of-Control Eating and  Loss Maintenance After Bariatric Surgery.</a></h2><p>Loss-of-control (LOC) eating is common in adults undergoing bariatric surgery and is associated with poorer  outcomes. Its long-term course in adolescent bariatric surgery patients and associations with  outcomes are unclear.Adolescents ( = 234; age range = 13-19 years) undergoing bariatric surgery across 5 US sites were assessed for postsurgery follow-up at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. Descriptive statistics and generalized linear mixed models were used to describe the prevalence of LOC eating episodes involving objectively large amounts of food and continuous eating, respectively. Generalized linear mixed models investigated the association of any LOC eating with short- and long-term BMI changes.At baseline, objectively large LOC eating was reported by .4% of adolescents, and continuous LOC eating by 27.8% of adolescents. Both forms of LOC eating were significantly lower at all postsurgical time points relative to presurgery (range = .5%-14.5%; s < .05). However, both behaviors gradually increased from 6-month to 4-year follow-up (s < .05). Presurgical LOC eating was not related to percent BMI change over follow-up ( = .79). However, LOC eating at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up was associated with lower percent BMI change from baseline at the next consecutive assessment (s < .05).Although presurgical LOC eating was not related to relative  loss after surgery, postoperative LOC eating may adversely affect long-term  outcomes. Rates of LOC eating decreased from presurgery to 6-months postsurgery but increased thereafter. Therefore, this behavior may warrant additional empirical and clinical attention.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481514>Total knee arthroplasty in valgus knees: predictive preoperative parameters influencing a constrained design selection.</a></h2><p>In valgus knees, ligament balance might remain a challenge at total knee prostheses implantation; this leads some authors to systematically propose the use of constrained devices (constrained condylar knee or hinge types...). It is possible to adapt the selected level of constraints, by reserving higher constraints to cases where it is not possible to obtain final satisfactory balance: less than 5 degrees of residual frontal laxity in extension in each compartment, and a tibiofemoral gap difference not in excess to 3 mm between flexion and extension.It is possible to establish preoperative criteria that can predict a constrained design prosthetic implantation at surgery.A consecutive series of 93 total knee prostheses, implanted to treat a valgus deformity of more than 5 degrees was retrospectively analysed. Preoperatively, full  bearing long axis AP views A-P were performed: hip knee angle (HKA) averaged 195 degrees (186 degrees to 226 degrees), 36 knees had more than  degrees of valgus, and 19 others more than 20 degrees of valgus. Laxity was measured by stress radiographies with a Telos system at 100 N. Fifty-two knees had preoperative laxity in the coronal plane of more than 10 degrees. Fourteen knees had more than 5 degrees laxity on the convex (medial) side, 21 knees had more than 10 degrees laxity on the concave (lateral) side. Statistical assessment, using univariate analysis, identified the factors that led, at surgery, to an elevated constraint selection level; these factors of independence were tested by multivariate analysis. Logistical regression permitted the classification of the said factors by their odds ratios (OR).High-constraints prostheses (CCK type) numbered 26 out of 93 implantations; the other total knee prostheses were regular posterostabilized () prostheses. Statistically, the preoperative factors that led to the choice of a constrained prosthesis were: (1) valgus severity as measured by HKA (=193 degrees, CCK=198 degrees), (2) increased posterior tibial slope (=4.8 degrees, CCK=6.5 degrees), (3) low patellar height (using Blackburne and Peel index =.89, CCK=.77), (4) severity of laxity in valgus (=2.3 degrees, CCK=4.3 degrees). Among all these factors, the only independent one was laxity in valgus (convex side laxity) (p=.0008). OR analysis showed a two-fold increased probability of implanting an elevated constraints prosthesis for each one degree increment of laxity in valgus.This study demonstrated that it was not the valgus angle severity but rather the convex medial side laxity that increased the frequency of constrained prostheses implantation. Other factors, as a low patellar height or an elevated posterior tibial slope, when associated, potentiate this possible prosthetic switch (to higher constraints) and should make surgeons aware, in these situations, of encountering difficulties when establishing ligament balance.Therapeutic retrospective study.2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A photosensitizing site (Ru()) was introduced by treating cis-[Ru(bpy) (dimethylsulfoxide)Cl]Cl with BPy-PMO. Then a catalytic site (Ru(Cat)) was brought in Ru() -BPy-PMO by reaction with a ruthenium polymer [Ru(CO) Cl ] . The stepwise modification of BPy-PMO successfully affords a novel photocatalyst Ru() -Ru(Cat) -BPy-PMO. The molar fractions (x, y) of Ru() and Ru(Cat) were determined by  dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement and quantification of the amount of CO emitted in the photo-decarbonylation of Ru(Cat), respectively. Photochemical CO reduction (λ >430 nm) by Ru() -Ru(Cat) -BPy-PMO in a CO -saturated N,N-dimethylacetamide/water solution containing 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide catalytically produced CO and formate. The total turnover frequency of CO and formate reached more than 162 h on x=.11 and y=.0055. The product selectivity (CO/formate) became large when the ratio of Ru()-to-Ru(Cat) (x/y) was increased. The photocatalysts can be recycled at least three times without losing their catalytic activity, demonstrating that the Ru() and Ru(Cat) units were strongly immobilized on the BPy-PMO framework.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Its role in determining the extent of vasculopathy in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) needs further investigation. The aim of this study was to compare the presence of altered arteries with nailfold capillaroscopy and clinical signs of ischaemia, that is, digital ulcers or pitting scars (DU/). A feasible CDUS protocol is provided.Two thousand five hundred and twenty-eight arteries of the fingers, palms and wrists from 79 SSc patients (32 arteries per patient) were examined using CDUS. Furthermore, nailfold capillaroscopy, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated.Narrowed or occluded lumens were seen in 39.8% of all assessable arteries (n = 2489) and 48.9% of all proper palmar digital arteries (n = 1564) but only .6% (P < .0001) of proximal arteries (n = 924). Fingerwise analyses presented significant coincidence of pathological CDUS findings and DU/ (P = .0009). Pathological CDUS findings were also associated with elevated CRP concentrations, current or past smoking with ⩾20 pack-years, male gender and present or past DU/. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve = .727) suggested a cut-off value of ⩾20% pathological vessels (sensitivity: 90.7%; specificity: 47.8%) for the presence of DU/. An examination protocol focusing on the right-hand digits II-V (proper palmar digital arteries) revealed similar results (area under the curve = .751; sensitivity: 93.%; specificity: 43.5%).CDUS of hand and finger arteries allows measurement of the extent of SSc vasculopathy, which is associated with clinical signs of chronic malperfusion. A shortened examination protocol of CDUS (right-hand digits II-V;  min instead of 45 min examination time) could complement vascular diagnostics in SSc.© The Author 2017.

Systematic epidemiological and genetic studies are needed to uncover genetic variants that interact with stress to modify metabolic responses across the life cycle that are the proximal contributors to the development of cardiovascular disease and precipitation of acute clinical events. Among the central challenges in the field are to perform and replicate gene-by-environment (G × E) studies. The challenge of measurement of individual experience of psychosocial stress is magnified in this context. Although many research datasets exist that contain genotyping and disease-related data, measures of psychosocial stress are often either absent or vary substantially across studies. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to create a synthetic measure of chronic psychosocial stress across multiple datasets, applying a consistent criterion that uses proxy indicators of stress components. We validated the computed scores of chronic psychosocial stress by observing moderately strong and significant correlations with the self-rated chronic psychosocial stress in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Cohort (Rho = .23, P < .0001) and with the measures of depressive symptoms in five datasets (Rho = .-.42,  = .005 to <.0001) and by comparing the distributions of the self-rated and computed measures.

Ground State Amino Twist Not Essential for ICT.</a></h2><p>From X-ray structure analysis, amino twist angles of 90.° for 2,4-dimethyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (mMMD), 82.7° for 4-(di-tert-butylamino)benzonitrile (DTABN), and 88.7° for 6-cyanobenzoquinuclidine (CBQ) are determined, all considerably larger than the 57.4° of 3,5-dimethyl-4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (MMD). This large twist leads to lengthening of the amino-phenyl bond, 143.5 pm (mMMD), 144.1 pm (DTABN), 144.6 pm (CBQ), and 141.4 pm (MMD), as compared with 136.5 pm for the planar 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN). As a consequence, the electronic coupling between the amino and phenyl subgroups in mMMD, DTABN, CBQ, and MMD is much weaker than in DMABN, as seen from the strongly reduced molar absorption coefficients. The fluorescence spectrum of MMD in n-hexane at 25 °C consists of two emissions, from a locally excited (LE) and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state, with a fluorescence quantum yield ratio Φ'(ICT)/Φ(LE) of 12.8. In MeCN, a single ICT emission is found. With mMMD in n-hexane, in contrast, only LE fluorescence is observed, whereas the spectrum in MeCN originates from the ICT state. These differences are also seen from the half-widths of the overall fluorescence bands, which in n-hexane are larger for MMD than for mMMD, decreasing with solvent polarity for MMD and increasing for mMMD, reflecting the disappearance of LE and the onset of ICT in the overall spectra, respectively. From solvatochromic measurements the dipole moments μe(ICT) of MMD (16 D) and mMMD ( D) are obtained. Femtosecond excited state absorption (ESA) spectra at 22 °C, together with the dual (LE + ICT) fluorescence, reveal that MMD in n-hexane undergoes a reversible LE ⇄ ICT reaction, with LE as the precursor, with a forward rate constant ka = 5.6 × 10(12) s(-1) and a back-reaction kd ∼ .05 × 10(12) s(-1). With MMD in the strongly polar solvent MeCN, ICT is faster: ka = 10 × 10(12) s(-1). In the case of mMMD in n-hexane, the ESA spectra show that ICT does not take place, contrary to MeCN, in which ka = 2.5 × 10(12) s(-1). The ICT reactions with MMD and mMMD are much faster than that of the parent compound DMABN in MeCN, with ka = .24 × 10(12) s(-1). Because of the very short ICT reaction times of 180 fs (MMD, n-hexane), 100 fs (MMD, MeCN), and 400 fs (mMMD, MeCN), it is clear that the picosecond fluorescence decays of these systems appear to be single exponential, due to the insufficient time resolution of 3 . It is concluded that the faster LE → ICT reaction of MMD as compared with DMABN (ka = .24 × 10(12) s(-1) in MeCN) is caused by a smaller  gap ΔE(S1,S2) between the lowest singlet excited states and not by the large amino twist angle. Similarly, the larger ΔE(S1,S2) of mMMD as compared with MMD is held responsible for its smaller ICT efficiency (no reaction in n-hexane).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8436834>Age-dependent V region expression in the human antibody response to the Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide.</a></h2><p>The human L chain antibody repertoire specific for the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polysaccharide () is composed of kappa I, kappa II, kappa III, kappa IV, and lambda L chain V regions, but the most commonly occurring VL is encoded by the unmutated V kappa II-A2 gene. To determine whether this VL repertoire is influenced by age, we used idiotypic probes to monitor V kappa II-A2, V lambda, and V kappa III usage in the antibody response to an Hib -protein conjugate vaccine. A single dose of a vaccine consisting of Hib  coupled to an outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis was administered. Adults (n = 35), 18-month-old infants (n = 35), and 2-month-old infants (n = 46), all with > or = .9 microgram/ml anti-Hib  antibodies, were tested for VL region markers in postvaccination sera. V kappa III anti-Hib  antibodies were not detected in any of the 2-month-old infants but were detected in 29% of the 18-month-old infants and 69% of the adults (p < .001). The lack of kappa III antibodies in 2-month-old infants could not be accounted for by lack of a kappa response, because kappa antibodies to Hib  were present (> . microgram/ml) in 45% of these infants. Hibld-1, an idiotope expressed by anti-Hib  antibodies having the kappa II-A2 V region, was present in postvaccination sera of 66% of the adults and 80% of the 18-month-old infants but was less frequent in the 2-month-old infants (35%, p < .001). In contrast, Hibld-2, which is an idiotope expressed by a subset of V lambda VII anti-Hib  antibodies, was rare or infrequent in adults and 18-month-old infants (% and 6%, respectively) but was present in 43% of 2-month-old infants (p < .001). Our findings demonstrate that dramatic changes in VL region utilization occur in the human antibody response to this Hib  conjugate vaccine as a function of age. Because previous studies have shown that V region usage correlates with antibody fine specificity and avidity for Hib , these age-related differences in V region expression may affect the ability of vaccines to confer protective  at different ages.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861927>Comparison of rhenium-porphyrin dyads for CO photoreduction: photocatalytic studies and charge separation dynamics studied by time-resolved IR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>We report a study of the photocatalytic reduction of CO to CO by zinc porphyrins covalently linked to [Re(2,2'-bipyridine)(CO)L] moieties with visible light of wavelength >520 nm.  contains an amide CHNHC(O) link from porphyrin to bipyridine (Bpy),  contains an additional methoxybenzamide within the bridge CHNHC(O)CH(OMe)NHC(O), while  has a saturated bridge CHNHC(O)CH; each dyad is studied with either L = Br or 3-picoline.

Exocytosis at IHC ribbon synapses is triggered by Ca(2+) inflow through Ca(V)1.3 (L-type) Ca(2+) channels. We investigated the macroscopic (whole-cell) and elementary (cell-attached) properties of Ca(2+) currents in IHCs positioned at the middle turn (frequency ∼ 2 kHz) of the adult gerbil cochlea, which is their most sensitive hearing region. Using near physiological recordings conditions (body temperature and a Na(+) based extracellular solution), we found that the macroscopic Ca(2+) current activates and deactivates very rapidly (time constant below 1 ms) and inactivates slowly and only partially. Single-channel recordings showed an elementary conductance of  , a sub-ms latency to first opening, and a very low steady-state open probability (Po: .024 in response to 500-ms depolarizing steps at ∼-18 mV). The value of Po was significantly larger (.06) in the first 40 ms of membrane depolarization, which corresponds to the time when most Ca(2+) channel openings occurred clustered in bursts (mean burst duration: 19 ms). Both the Po and the mean burst duration were smaller than those previously reported in high-frequency basal IHCs. Finally, we found that middle turn IHCs are likely to express about 4 times more Ca(2+) channels per ribbon than basal cells. We propose that middle-turn IHCs finely-tune Ca(V)1.3 Ca(2+) channel gating in order to provide reliable information upon timing and intensity of lower-frequency sounds.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17570256>Impaired proinsulin secretion before and during oral glucose stimulation in HIV-infected patients who display  redistribution.</a></h2><p>The beta-cell function of HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy who display lipodystrophy may be impaired. An early defect in beta-cell function may be characterized by an increase in secretion of 32-33 split proinsulin (SP) and intact proinsulin (IP). To address this issue, the secretion patterns of SP and IP of 16 HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy (LIPO) and  HIV-infected men without lipodystrophy (NONLIPO) were studied during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All patients received highly active antiretroviral therapy. Insulin secretion rates were determined by deconvolution of plasma C-peptide concentrations. More LIPO than NONLIPO patients displayed diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance than normal glucose tolerance (LIPO 2/8/6 vs NONLIPO 1/2/12, P = .05). LIPO patients had increased fasting levels of SP and IP, ratio of SP/IP, and area under the curve of SP and IP during the early phase (, 10, and 20 minutes) and during the late phase (45, 75, and 105 minutes) of the OGTT compared with NONLIPO patients ( < .05). LIPO patients exhibited significantly increased fasting SP/IP ratio, fasting SP/insulin ratio, and total proinsulin to C-peptide ratio during the OGTT. LIPO patients displayed increased incremental secretion of IP during the first 10 minutes of the OGTT (P < .05), although the incremental insulin secretion during this period did not differ between LIPO and NONLIPO patients. These data suggest that HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy display major perturbations of proinsulin secretion in the fasting state and during an OGTT, which is compatible with the notion of a beta-cell dysfunction of such patients.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26609807>Characterisation of adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles released pre- and post-adipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are submicron vesicles released from many cell types, including adipocytes. EVs are implicated in the pathogenesis of -driven cardiovascular disease, although the characteristics of adipocyte-derived EVs are not well described. We sought to define the characteristics of adipocyte-derived EVs before and after adipogenesis, hypothesising that adipogenesis would affect EV structure, molecular composition and function. Using 3T3-L1 cells, EVs were harvested at day  and day  of differentiation. EV and cell preparations were visualised by electron microscopy and EVs quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). EVs were then assessed for annexin V positivity using flow cytometry; lipid and phospholipid composition using 2D thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography; and vesicular protein content by an immuno-phenotyping assay. Pre-adipogenic cells are connected via a network of protrusions and EVs at both time points display classic EV morphology. EV concentration is elevated prior to adipogenesis, particularly in exosomes and small microvesicles. Parent cells contain higher proportions of phosphatidylserine () and show higher annexin V binding. Both cells and EVs contain an increased proportion of arachidonic acid at day . PREF-1 was increased at day  whilst adiponectin was higher at day  indicating EV protein content reflects the stage of adipogenesis of the cell. Our data suggest that EV production is higher in cells before adipogenesis, particularly in vesicles <300 nm.

About % of patients are diagnosed at metastatic stage, and more than 20% with a localized disease treated by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) will recur. In advanced SCCA, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) combination is the standard option but complete response is a rare event and the prognosis remains poor with most disease progression occurring within the first 12 months. We have previously published the potential role of the addition of docetaxel (D). Among 8 consecutive patients with advanced recurrent SCCA after CRT, the DCF regimen induced a complete response in 4 patients, including 3 pathological complete responses. Then, the Epitopes-HPV02 study was designed to confirm the interest of DCF regimen in SCCA patients.This multicentre phase II trial assesses the DCF regimen in advanced SCCA patients. Main eligibility criteria are: histologically proven SCCA, unresectable locally advanced recurrent or metastatic disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-) <2, and being eligible for DCF. Patients receive either 6 cycles of standard DCF or 8 cycles of modified DCF depending on age (> vs. ≤ 75 years-old) and ECOG- ( vs. 1). The trial was set up based on a Simon's optimal two-stage design for phase II trials, allowing an early futility interim analysis. The primary endpoint is the observed progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months from the first DCF cycle. A PFS rate below 10% is considered uninteresting, while a PFS rate above 25% is expected. With a unilateral alpha error of 5% and a statistical power of 90%, 66 evaluable patients should be included. Main secondary endpoints are overall survival, PFS, response rate, safety, health-related quality of life, and the correlation of biomarkers with treatment efficacy.Since the recommended CF regimen is based in a small retrospective analysis and generates a low rate of complete responses, the Epitopes-HPV02 study will establish a new standard in case of a positive result.

These pathogens are the causal agents of the neglected diseases: Chagas, sleeping sickness and leishmaniases respectively and had recently their genomes sequenced. Q4D059 shows low sequence similarity with mammal proteins and because of its essentiality demonstrated in T. brucei, it is a potential target for anti-parasitic drugs. The 11 hypothetical proteins homologous to Q4D059 are all uncharacterized proteins of unknown function. Here, the solution structure of Q4D059 was solved by NMR and its backbone dynamics was characterized by ()N relaxation parameters. The structure is composed by a parallel/anti-parallel three-stranded β-sheet packed against four helical regions. The structure is well defined by ca. 9 NOEs per residue and a backbone rmsd of .50±.05 Å for the representative ensemble of 20 lowest- structures. The structure is overall rigid except for N-terminal residues A(9) to D(11) at the beginning of β1, K(38), V(39) at the end of helix H3 with rapid motion in the -ns timescale and G(25) (helix H2), I(68) (β2) and V(78) (loop 3) undergoing internal motion in the μs-ms timescale.

The selectivity sequence among monovalent cations based on permeability ratio (PX+/PK+) fell into an order: NH4+(1.4) > Cs+(1. 1) >/= K+(1.) > Na+(.4) >> Li+(). The conductance-activity relationship of the channel in K+ solutions followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a half-maximal saturating activity of 8 mM and a maximal conductance of 9 . The permeability ratio PNa+/PK+ remained constant ( approximately .40) under biionic concentrations from 10 to 500 mM. These results suggests that the channel is a one-ion channel. The pore diameter probed by a set of organic cations was approximately 6 A. The single-channel current was blocked by Ca2+ in a dose-dependent manner that followed a single-site titration curve with a voltage-dependent dissociation constant of .6 mM at 100 mV. The electric distance of the binding site for Ca2+ was .07 from both entrances of the channel, indicating the presence of two symmetrical binding sites in each vicinity of the channel entrance. Correlations between conduction properties and structural aspects of the channel are discussed in terms of a three- and two-binding-site (3B2S) model of Eyring rate theory.

Despite generating nonequilibrium simulations, SMD remains capable of reconstructing equilibrium properties such as the Potential of Mean Force (PMF). Of course, one would like to use all types of force fields (FF) ranging from classical ones to more advanced polarizable models using point induced dipoles and distributed multipoles such as AMOEBA. To enable such studies, the SMD methodology has been implemented in the framework of the massively parallel Tinker-HP software allowing for both long polarizable and non-polarizable MD simulations of large proteins. To validate this new implementation, we first compared the Tinker-HP SMD results to the literature. Tests have been performed on three different benchmark systems: the M-A deca-alanine (112 atoms), the ubiquitin (9737 atoms), and the CD2CD58 complex (97594 atoms). Non-polarizable (AMBER99, AMBER99SB, CHARMM22/CMAP, and OPLS-AA/L) and polarizable (AMOEBAPRO13 and AMOEBABIO18) force fields have been used. For each one of them, PMFs have been reconstructed and compared in terms of free  barrier and hydrogen bonding fluctuations behavior over time. Using a SMD velocity of .01 Å/ applied to a set of 20 trajectories, we show that polarizable and non-polarizable force fields do not always agree. As it could be anticipated, strong discrepancies are noticed between polarizable and non-polarizable models when considered in vacuum, whereas results are more comparable when a water environment is added. However, for the largest system, i.e., the CD2CD58 complex, strong differences related to the modeling of a salt bridge are noticed exhibiting some potential issues with classical FFs. Overall, such simulations highlight the importance of the inclusion of polarization effects as PMF free  barriers computed with AMOEBA always decrease compared to non-polarizable force fields.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588104>Chronic ocular hypertensive rat model using microbead injection: comparison of polyurethane, polymethylmethacrylate, silica and polystyene microbeads.</a></h2><p>To establish and assess an ocular hypertensive rat model using intracameral injection with various microbeads of different sizes and materials.Chronic elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) was induced by the injection of various microbeads into the anterior chamber of Sprague-Dawley rat eyes.

Forty-five sedentary adolescent boys (13-14 years old) were separated in three groups according to the percentage of fat mass as follows:  normal-weight (NW) (body fat: 16. ± 1.9%),  overweight (OW) (body fat: 24. ± 1.6%), and  obese (OB) (body fat: 31. ± 3.%). All groups completed an incremental cycle exercise to exhaustion in which energy consumption (E, W), ME (%), lipid oxidation rate (LO, %), plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were determined consecutively at rest and at three intensity levels corresponding to 50 and 75% of each participant's maximal heart rate (50%HRmax and 75%HRmax) and peak  consumption (  O). During the incremental cycle exercise test, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine responses as well as ME determined at 50%HRmax, 75%HRmax, and at VO stages were significantly lower in OB compared to NW and OW individuals ( < .01). Multiple linear regressions showed that body weight (ß = -.64,  < .001), energy consumption (ß = -.24,  < .05) and lipid oxidation (ß = .69,  < .01) were significant predictors of ME at 50%HRmax. However, at 75%HRmax and  O, significant predictors of ME were epinephrine (ß = .34, ß = .49, respectively,  = .01), norepinephrine (ß = .26, ß = .60, respectively,  < .05) and power output (ß = .62, ß = .71, respectively,  < .01). These findings suggest that excess in body weight exerts a negative effect on ME at a low intensity by increasing energy consumption for obese and overweight adolescent boys, while at higher intensities (75%HRmax and VO) the lower ME could be better explained by the lower power output and catecholamine responses that were attenuated among obese and overweight adolescent boys.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'oxygen', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28094396>Nanostructuration of ionic liquids: impact on the cation mobility. A multi-scale study.</a></h2><p>When probed at the macroscopic scale, Ionic Liquids (ILs) behave as highly dissociated (i.e. strong) electrolytes while, at the molecular scale, they show clear characteristics of weak ionic solutions. The multi-scale analysis we report in this paper reconciles these apparently at odds behaviors. We investigate by quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and neutron spin-echo (NSE), the nanometer/nanosecond dynamics of OMIM-BF, an imidazolium-based IL showing strong nanostructuration. We also probe the same IL on the microscopic (μm and ms) scale by pulsed field gradient NMR. To interpret the neutron data, we introduce a new physical model to account for the dynamics of the side-chains and for the diffusion of the whole molecule. This model describes the observables over the whole and unprecedented investigated spatial ([.-1.65] Å) and time ([.5-2000] ) ranges. We arrive at a coherent and unified structural/dynamical description of the local cation dynamics: a localized motion within the IL nanometric domains is combined with a genuine long-range translational motion. The QENS, NSE and NMR experiments describe the same long-range translational process, but probed at different scales. The associated diffusion coefficients are more than one order of magnitude different. We show how this apparent discrepancy is a manifestation of the IL nanostructuration.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086487>Characteristics of  Loss Trajectories in a Comprehensive Lifestyle Intervention.</a></h2><p>Focusing on average  loss (WL) from interventions provides useful efficacy data but masks large variability across patients. In this study, parameters of  loss trajectories were determined that differentiated individuals during a -week clinical lifestyle intervention.Patients (n = 595) were in a fee-for-service WL lifestyle program with a partial meal replacement diet and lifestyle change counseling. Parameters used in latent class analyses were percent WL (%WL),  nadir, number of weekly  gains, maximum weekly percent  gain, standard deviation of weekly  changes, linear slope values, and change in slope.Average %WL was 9.73%. Latent class analyses revealed three groups with considerable overlap in %WL ranges but differing significantly on all trajectory parameters ( < .001). Group 1 had the most variable and least successful pattern of  changes. Group 3 had the least variable and most successful pattern of  changes. Group 2 fell between the others on all parameters.Emphasis on average WL likely obscures considerable variability in individual courses of  change. Moreover, patients with similar %WL can have different WL trajectories. Identification of behavioral/physiological characteristics associated with different  loss trajectories may facilitate the development of more tailored interventions, particularly for trajectories associated with less optimal outcomes.© 2017 The Obesity Society.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29783203>Mechanical characterization and ion release of bioactive dental composites containing calcium phosphate particles.</a></h2><p>to verify the effect of the addition of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) particles functionalized with di- or triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA or TEGDMA) on the degree of conversion (DC), post-gel shrinkage (), mechanical properties, and ion release of experimental composites.Four composites were prepared containing a BisGMA/TEGDMA matrix and 60 vol% of fillers. The positive control contained only barium glass fillers, while in the other composites  vol% of the barium was replaced by DCPD. Besides the functionalized particles, non-functionalized DCPD was also tested. DC after 24 h (n = 3) was determined by FTIR spectroscopy. The strain gage method was used to obtain  5 min after photoactivation (n = 5). Flexural strength and modulus (n = 10) were calculated based on the biaxial flexural test results, after specimen storage for 24 h or 60 days in water. The same storage times were used for fracture toughness testing (FT, n = 10). Calcium and phosphate release up to 60 days was quantified by ICP-OES (n = 3).

The material containing DEGDMA-functionalized particles showed higher  than the other composites (p < .001). After 60 days, only the composite with DEGDMA-functionalized DCPD presented fracture strength similar to the control, while for flexural modulus only the composite with TEGDMA-functionalized particles was lower than the control (p < .001). FT of all composites containing DCPD was higher than the control after 60 days (p < .005). Calcium release was higher for the composite with non-functionalized DCPD at  days and no significant reductions were observed for composites with functionalized DCPD during the observation period (p < .001). For all the tested composites, phosphate release was higher at  days than in the subsequent periods, and no difference among them was recorded at 45 and 60 days (p < .001).DCPD functionalization affected all the studied variables. The composite with DEGDMA-functionalized particles was the only material with strength similar to the control after 60 days in water; however, it also presented the highest shrinkage.

Hemoconcentration triggers erythrocyte losses to subsequently normalize erythrocyte concentration. The mechanisms of erythrocyte loss may involve enhanced hemolysis, but has never been measured directly in bed rest studies. Steady-state hemolysis was evaluated by measuring two heme degradation products, endogenous carbon monoxide concentration [CO] and urobilinogen in feces, in 10 healthy men, before, during, and after two campaigns of 21 days of 6° head-down-tilt (HDT) bed rest. The subjects were hemoconcentrated at 10 and 21 days of bed rest: mean concentrations of hemoglobin (. ± .2 g/L and 14.6 ± .1 g/L, respectively) and erythrocytes (5.18 ± .06E6/L and 5.02 ± .06E6/L, respectively) were increased compared to baseline (all s < .05). In contrast, mean hemoglobin mass (743 ± 19 g) and number of erythrocytes (2.56 ± .07E13) were decreased at 21 days of bed rest (both s < .05). Indicators of hemolysis mean [CO] (1660 ± 49 ppb and 1624 ± 48 ppb, respectively) and fecal urobilinogen concentration (180 ± 23 mg/day and 199 ± 22 mg/day, respectively) were unchanged at 10 and 21 days of bed rest compared to baseline (both s > .05). A significant decrease in [CO] (-505 ppb) was measured at day 28 after bed rest. HDT bed rest caused hemoconcentration in parallel with lower hemoglobin mass. Circulating indicators of hemolysis remained unchanged throughout bed rest supporting that enhanced hemolysis did not contribute significantly to erythrocyte loss during the hemoconcentration of bed rest. At day 28 after bed rest, decreased hemolysis accompanied the recovery of erythrocytes, a novel finding.© 2017 The Authors.

A positive screen was defined as presence of cough, fever, night sweats, or  loss. Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) was defined as sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli or growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Of 737 participants with at least one diagnostic sputum specimen, PTB was diagnosed in 31 of 522 (5.9%) on ART, and 34 of 215 (.8%) not on ART. The questionnaire missed  of 31 (48.4%) PTB cases on ART, and three of 34 (8.8%) not on ART. Among participants on ART, post-test probability of PTB diagnosis (95% confidence interval) was 6.8% (4.-10.9%) if screening positive, and 5.2% (2.9-8.4%) if screening negative, whereas among participants not on ART, post-test probabilities were 20.3% (14.2-27.5%) and 4.8% (1.-13.5%), respectively.

Because lipid-lowering drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy, natural cholesterol-lowering compounds may be a safe and effective alternative to reduce CVD risk in offspring born to hypercholesterolemic mothers.This study used the hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse model to test the hypothesis that mothers supplemented with phytosterols during gestation and lactation would produce offspring with a more favorable lipid profile than offspring from unsupplemented mothers, despite having a genetic predisposition toward hypercholesterolemia.Sixteen female apoE(-/-) mice were randomly assigned to 2 diets fed throughout the gestation and lactation periods: a cholesterol-enriched diet (CH) (.%) or the cholesterol-enriched diet supplemented with phytosterols (CH/) (2%). Serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured by enzyme assay and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively, and liver cholesterol was analyzed by GC.Compared with the CH-fed dams at the end of lactation, phytosterol-supplemented dams displayed lower (P < .05) serum total cholesterol (-55%), non-HDL cholesterol (-56%), and LDL cholesterol (-47%), but no change (P > .05) in HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations.

Furthermore, compared with pups from CH-fed dams, pups from phytosterol-supplemented dams displayed a lower (P < .05) number of total LDL particles (-34%), VLDL particles (-31%), and HDL particles (-30%).Our results in apoE(-/-) mice suggest that even under strong genetic predisposition to hypercholesterolemia, pups born to mothers supplemented with phytosterols during gestation and lactation exhibit favorable liver and serum lipid responses compared with pups from unsupplemented mothers.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29926059>NO at water surfaces: binding forces, charge separation,  accommodation and atmospheric implications.</a></h2><p>Interactions of N2O5 with water media are of great importance in atmospheric chemistry and have been the topic of extensive research for over two decades. Nevertheless, many physical and chemical properties of N2O5 at the surface or in bulk water are unknown or not microscopically understood. This study presents extensive new results on the physical properties of N2O5 in water and at the surface of water, with a focus on their microscopic basis. The main results are obtained using ab initio molecular dynamics and calculations of a potential of mean force. These include: (1) collisions of N2O5 with water at 300 K lead to trapping at the surface for at least 20  and with 95% probability. (2) During that time, there is no N2O5 hydrolysis, evaporation, or entry into the bulk. (3) Charge separation between the NO2 and NO3 groups of N2O5, fluctuates significantly with time. (4)  accommodation of the colliding N2O5 at the surface takes place within picoseconds. (5) The binding  of N2O5 to a nanosize amorphous ice particle at  K is on the order of  kcal mol-1 for the main surface site. N2O5 binding to the cluster is due to one weak hydrogen bond and to interactions between partial charges on the N2O5 and on water. (6) The free- profile was calculated for transporting N2O5 from the gas phase through the interface and into bulk water. The corresponding concentration profile exhibits a propensity for N2O5 at the aqueous surface. The free  barrier for entry from the surface into the bulk was determined to be 1.8 kcal mol-1. These findings are used to interpret recent experiments.

Changes in the tilt angle and distance of the light guide exit face in relation to the surface of the composite increment have a distinct effect on the total amount of light delivered during polymerization and may cause insufficient conversion of the material. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the influence of the tilt angle and distance of irradiance on the efficiency of light application by recording the total amount of  using the anterior tooth sensor of the MARC .The influence of the tilt angle and distance of the light guide to the sensor surface on the delivered radiant exposure was examined for three different LCUs (Celalux 2 [C2], Bluephase [BP] and Translux Powerblue [TPB]). The measurements were performed for 20 s each with five different tilt angles (α=°, 5°, 10°, °, 20°) and nine different distances (L=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 mm).For all LCUs, a distinct influence of the tilt angle on the delivered amount of fluence was found. At ° tilt the C2 delivered a total light  of 38.55 J/cm(2). By increasing the tilt of the light guide the amount of  applied significantly decreased. At 20° tilt a reduction by 31.2% of the original light fluence was recorded. However, the C2 was the most powerful LCU measured. Even under optimum measurement conditions, the BP delivered a fluence of only 14.8 J/cm(2). At a tilt angle of 20°, though, the light sensor still registered 92.7% of the original output power. Under the same conditions, the TPB delivered 81.4%. With increasing distance of the light guide exit face to the surface of the sensor all LCUs showed a significant loss in delivered light . At a distance of 2mm the C2 showed a reduction by 46.7%, whereas total fluence of BP and TPB were reduced by 3.8% and 4.8%, respectively.The choice of LCU and the application of an appropriate curing time are important for successful polymerization. Nevertheless, a perpendicular positioning of the light guide as close as possible to the surface of the composite increment is of essential importance in order to ensure sufficient delivery of light.Copyright © 2016 Academy of Dental Materials.

When collapsed across all speeds tested, neither unpotentiated force, work, or power differed between genotypes (all data n = 10, P < .05). In contrast, although both genotypes displayed speed-dependent increases, these increases were greater for WT than skMLCK muscles. For example, when collapsed across the six fastest speeds we tested, both concentric force and power were increased 30-34 % in WT but only -17 % in skMLCK muscles. In contrast, at the two slowest speeds, these parameters were increased in WT but decreased in skMLCK muscles (8-10 and 7-9 %, respectively). Intriguingly, potentiation of concentric force and power was optimal near speeds producing maximal power in both genotypes.

We hypothesize that continuous compression of the longissimus and gluteus muscles by the sacral and ischial bones during wheelchair sitting increases muscle stiffness around the bone-muscle interface over time, thereby causing muscles to bear intensified stresses in relentlessly widening regions, in a positive-feedback injury spiral. In this study, we measured long-term shear moduli of muscle tissue in vivo in rats after applying compression (35 KPa or 70 KPa for 1/4-2 h, N = 32), and evaluated tissue viability in matched groups (using phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin histology, N = 10). We found significant (1.8-fold to 3.3-fold, p < .05) stiffening of muscle tissue in vivo in muscles subjected to 35 KPa for 30 min or over, and in muscles subjected to 70 KPa for  min or over. By incorporating this effect into a finite element (FE) model of the buttocks of a wheelchair user we identified a mechanical stress wave which spreads from the bone-muscle interface outward through longissimus muscle tissue. After 4 h of FE simulated motionlessness, 50%-60% of the cross section of the longissimus was exposed to compressive stresses of 35 KPa or over (shown to induce cell death in rat muscle within  min).

However, there was a lack of information on the effect of early-prepartum shearing on the behavior of the offspring from weaning onward. This study evaluated the effect of shearing ewes at 50 days of gestation on the growth, reproductive behavior and response to a gastrointestinal parasite challenge in the female offspring from weaning to 18 months old. Fifty-seven Polwarth female lambs were used, 22 being singles and 35 twins born to ewes either shorn at 50 days of pregnancy (, n = 23) or shorn at 62 days postpartum (U, control, n = 34) resulting in four subgroups: single lambs born to  ewes (n = 8), born to U ewes (n = 14), twin lambs born to  ewes (n = ) or born to U ewes (n = 20). All progeny were managed together under improved pasture with a minimum forage allowance of 6% live  on dry basis. Body , body condition score and fecal eggs count were recorded every 14 days from weaning to 18 months of age. Concentrations of progesterone were measured weekly (from 4 to 10 months of age and from 14 to 18 months of age) to establish the onset of puberty. Ovulation rate at an induced and a natural heat (545 ± 1. and 562 ± 1. day old) was recorded. Prepartum shearing did not affect the age at puberty or the ovulation rate of female offspring, but those born as singles were more precocious ( P = .03) and heavier ( P = .02) at puberty than twin born lambs. Both the average value of parasite egg count ( P = . 7) and the Famacha index ( P = .02) for the entire study period were lower in lambs born to prepartum shorn ewes than those born to postpartum shorn ewes. In conclusion, shearing at 50 days of gestation did not affect the growth or the reproductive behavior of female offspring. However, female lambs born from ewe shorn during gestation showed a better response to the parasitic challenge, and further research is required to confirm this.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797707>Clinical prognostic model for older patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Older patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are often not prescribed standard therapy. It is important to know which older patients would be candidates for aggressive therapy based on their prognosis, and to develop a model that can help determine prognosis.Data on older patients (≥70 years) enrolled on 38 NCI cooperative group trials of advanced NSCLC from 1991 to 2011 were analyzed. Multivariable Cox PH model was built with a stepwise selection. We derived a prognostic score using the estimated Cox PH regression coefficient. We then calculated the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of survival in the testing set.The final analysis included 1467 patients, who were randomly divided into a training (n = 963) and a testing set (n = 504). The prognostic risk score was calculated as: 3 (if male) + 3 (if  = 1) + 8 (if  = 2) + 11 (if initial stage = IV) + 4 (if  loss). Patients were classified into two prognostic groups: good (-8) and poor (≥9). The median survival in the two groups in the testing set were 13. (95% CI, 10.82-.91) and 8.52 months (95% CI, 7.5-9.63), respectively. The model had area under the 1-year and 2-year ROCs (.6 and .65, respectively) that were higher than existing models.Male gender, poor performance status, distant metastases and recent  loss predict for poor overall survival (OS) in older patients with advanced NSCLC.

The presence of DEHP in blood bags has been shown to be beneficial to red blood cells during storage by diminishing haemolysis. However, DEHP use in PVC may be carcinogenic or estrogenising. Vepoloxamer is a poloxamer with rheological and cytoprotective rheological properties and a favourable toxicity profile in clinical trials. We hypothesised that vepoloxamer may be sufficient to replace the plasticiser DEHP to prevent elevated haemolysis while conserving the biochemical and redox potential++ in RBCs stored for up to 42 days.Paired analyses of aliquots from pooled RBC suspensions of ABO identical donors were aseptically split into test storage containers (DEHP/PVC or DEHP-free/ethylene vinyl acetate [EVA]) supplemented with or without vepoloxamer (at concentrations of .1, 1, 5 or 7.89 mg/mL) and cold stored for up to 42 days.Vepoloxamer significantly prevented the increased haemolysis induced by the absence of DEHP in EVA bags in a dose-dependent manner by days 28 and 42 of storage (approx. 50% reduction of the maximum concentration of vepoloxamer; p<.001). There was an inverse correlation between the concentration of vepoloxamer used and the haemolysis rate (r=.27, p<.001) and a direct correlation between haemolysis and phosphatidylserine () exposure (r=.42; p<.01). Increased osmotic fragility and shear induced deformability of 42-day stored RBC in EVA bags was significantly corrected by the addition of vepoloxamer.Vepoloxamer, in a concentration-dependent fashion, is able to partly rescue the increased haemolysis and  exposure induced by the absence of the commonly used plasticiser DEHP. These results provide initial but strong evidence to support vepoloxamer use to replace DEHP in long-term storage of RBC.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7775114>Measurement of blood-retinal  breakdown in endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis.</a></h2><p>Endophthalmitis is a severe inflammatory disorder with profound visual consequences. Treatment of this disorder has been limited by the lack of quantitative information regarding retinal responses to severe inflammation. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis on blood-retinal  (BRB)  in vivo using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Endophthalmitis was produced by injecting Escherichia coli endotoxin into the midvitreous of pigmented rabbits. Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed at selected intervals thereafter. In all cases, a clinical grading system was used to assess the severity of inflammation before imaging. In a dose-response experiment, total vitreous protein was measured from vitreous specimens obtained 1 day after endotoxin injection and immediately after the imaging procedure.At 1 day after injection, endotoxin produced a selective breakdown of the inner BRB at all doses evaluated (.01 microgram to 500 micrograms). Permeability-surface area product normalized to the area of leaky retina (') increased from 1.35 +/- .78 x 10(-4) cm/minute (mean +/- SEM, n = 4 eyes) at a dose of .01 microgram to 8. +/- 2.22 x 10(-4) cm/minute n = 4) eyes) at a dose of 10 micrograms. Inner BRB integrity was restored by day 28 after injection. In general, changes in ', blood-aqueous  leakage, mean clinical score, and vitreous protein concentration were found, but the correlation between any two of these parameters was poor.Leakage of contrast appears early in the course of endotoxin-induced endophthalmitis and is a self-limited process. In future studies, these quantifiable changes in BRB permeability should prove useful in the assessment of various therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30206014>Survival and arrhythmic risk among ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure patients with prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator only therapy: A propensity score-matched analysis.</a></h2><p>Concerns about the efficacy of prophylactic ICD in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) heart failure (HF) patients are still present. We aimed to assess whether survival and arrhythmic risk were different among ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and NICM ICD-only patients, along with specific predictors for mortality.HF patients undergoing ICD-only implant were extracted from the nationwide multicenter UMBRELLA registry. Arrhythmic events were collected by remote monitoring and reviewed by a committee of experts.782 patients (556 ICM; 226 NICM) were recruited: mean ejection fraction of 26.6%; 83.4% in NYHA class II-III; mean QRS duration of 108.9 ms (only 14.9% with QRS > 130 ms). After 4.35 years of mean follow-up, all-cause mortality rate was 4.2%/year.

The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and validity of an EMA protocol to assess older adults' PA and SB. Feasibility was determined by examining factors associated with EMA survey compliance and if PA or SB were impacted by EMA survey compliance. Validity was determined by comparing EMA-reported PA and SB to objectively measured PA and SB at the EMA prompt. Over 10 days, older adults ( = 104; Age = 60-98 years) received 6 randomly prompted EMA questionnaires on a smartphone each day and wore an ActivPAL activity monitor to provide a device-based measure of PA and SB. Participants reported whether they were currently engaged in PA or SB. Older adults were compliant with the EMA and ActivPAL protocol on 92% of occasions. Differences in EMA compliance differed by  status. Among overweight and obese older adults EMA compliance differed by sex (OR = 3., 95% CI: 1.43, 6.92) and day of week (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.41). Among normal  older adults, EMA compliance differed by time of day (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.30). EMA compliance did not differ for device-based PA or SB in the  min before versus the  min after the EMA prompt, suggesting that these behaviors did not influence likelihood of responding and responding did not influence these behaviors (s > .05). When PA was reported through EMA, participants engaged in less device-based PA in the  min after compared to the  min before the EMA prompt ( = .01), suggesting possible reactance or a disruption of PA. EMA-reported PA and SB were positively associated with higher device-based PA and SB in the ± min, respectively, supporting criterion validity (s < .05). The assessment of older adults' PA and SB through EMA is feasible and valid, although there may be PA reactance to EMA prompting. Therefore, EMA represents a significant methodological tool that can aid in our understanding of the environmental, social, and psychological processes regulating older adults' PA and SB in the context of everyday life.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28376034>Rapid Discontinuation of Prednisone in Kidney Transplant Recipients: -Year Outcomes From the University of Minnesota.</a></h2><p>Short- and intermediate-term results have been reported after rapid discontinuation of prednisone (RDP) in kidney transplant recipients. Yet there has been residual concern about late graft failure in the absence of maintenance prednisone.From October 1, 1999, through June 1, 2015, we performed a total of 1553 adult first and second kidney transplants-1021 with a living donor, 532 with a deceased donor-under our RDP protocol. We analyzed the -year actuarial overall patient survival (), graft survival (GS), death-censored GS (DCGS), and acute rejection-free survival (ARFS) rates for RDP compared with historical controls on maintenance prednisone.For living donor recipients, the actuarial -year  rates were similar between groups. But RDP was associated with increased GS (P = .02) and DCGS (P = .01). For deceased donor recipients, RDP was associated with significantly better  (P < .01), GS (P < .01) and DCGS (P < .01). There was no difference between groups in the rate of acute or chronic rejection, or in the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate at  years. However, RDP-treated recipients had significantly lower rates of avascular necrosis, cytomegalovirus, cataracts, new-onset  after transplant, and cardiac complications. Importantly, for recipients with GS longer than 5 years, there was no difference between groups in subsequent actuarial , GS, and DCGS.In summary, at  years postkidney transplant, RDP did not lead to decreased in  or GS, or an increase in graft dysfunction but as associated with reduced complication rates.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25630530>Oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) (OPE) molecular wires: synthesis and length dependence of photoinduced charge transfer in OPEs with triarylamine and diaryloxadiazole end groups.</a></h2><p>The systematic synthesis and photophysical, electrochemical and computational studies on an extended series of triphenylamine-[C≡C-1,4-C6H2(OR)2]n-C≡C-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole dyad molecules (the OR groups are at 2,5-positions of the para-phenylene ring and R = C6H13; n = -5, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively) are reported. Related molecules with identical end groups, triphenylamine-C≡C-1,4-C6H2(OR)2-C≡C-triphenylamine (R = C6H13; 6) and diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-[C≡C-C6H2(OR)2]2-C≡C-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (R = C6H13; 7) were also studied. These D-B-A 1-5, D-B-D 6 and A-B-A 7 (D = electron donor, B = bridge, A = electron acceptor) systems were synthesized using palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions of new p-phenyleneethynylene building blocks. Steady-state emission studies on the dyads 1-5 reveal a complicated behavior of the emission that is strongly medium dependent. In low polarity solvents the emission is characterized by a sharp high- peak attributed to fluorescence from a locally excited (LE) state. In more polar environments the LE state is effectively quenched by transfer into an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state. The medium dependence is also observed in the quantum yields (QYs) which are high in cyclohexane and low in acetonitrile, thus also indicating charge-transfer character. Low-temperature emission spectra for 2-5 in dichloromethane and diethyl ether also reveal two distinct excited states, namely the LE state and the conventional ICT state, depending on solvent and temperature. Hybrid DFT calculations for 1-7 establish that the OPE bridge is involved in both frontier orbitals where the bridge character increases as the bridge length increases. Computed TD-DFT data on 1-5 assign the emission maxima in cyclohexane as LE transitions. Each time-resolved emission measurement on 2-7 in cyclohexane and diethyl ether reveals a wavelength dependent bi-exponential decay of the emission with a fast component in the 5-61  range on blue detection and a slower approximately 1 ns phase, independent of detection wavelength. The fast component is attributed to LE fluorescence and this emission component is rate limited and quenched by transfer into an ICT state. The fast LE fluorescence component varies systematically with conjugation length for the series of D-B-A dyads 2-5. An attenuation factor β of . Å(-1) was determined in accordance with an ICT superexchange mechanism.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Studies linking inflammatory processes to fatigue in cancer survivors led us to test the hypothesis that activation of the proinflammatory cytokine network is associated with fatigue symptoms during radiation therapy for breast and prostate cancer.Individuals with early-stage breast (n = 28) and prostate cancer (n = 20) completed questionnaires and provided blood samples for determination of serum levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 at assessments conducted before, during, and after a course of radiation therapy. Serum markers of proinflammatory cytokine activity, including IL-1 receptor antagonist and C-reactive protein, were examined in a subset of participants. Random coefficient models were used to evaluate the association between changes in cytokine levels and fatigue.As expected, there was a significant increase in fatigue during radiation treatment. Changes in serum levels of inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and IL-1 receptor antagonist were positively associated with increases in fatigue symptoms ( < .05), although serum levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 were not associated with fatigue. These effects remained significant ( < .05) in analyses controlling for potential biobehavioral confounding factors, including age, body mass index, hormone therapy, depression, and sleep disturbance.Results suggest that activation of the proinflammatory cytokine network and associated increases in downstream biomarkers of proinflammatory cytokine activity are associated with fatigue during radiation therapy for breast and prostate cancer.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16689549>Carbon-13 labeled polymers: an alternative tracer for depth profiling of polymer films and multilayers using secondary ion mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>13C labeling is introduced as a tracer for depth profiling of polymer films and multilayers using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Deuterium substitution has traditionally been used in depth profiling of polymers but can affect the phase behavior of the polymer constituents with reported changes in both bulk-phase behavior and surface and interfacial interactions. SIMS can provide contrast by examining various functional groups, chemical moieties, or isotopic labels. 13C-Labeled  (13C-) and unlabeled  (12C-) and PMMA were synthesized using atom-transfer radical polymerization and assembled in several model thin-film systems. Depth profiles were recorded using a Cameca IMS-6f magnetic sector mass spectrometer using both 6.-keV impact energy Cs+ and 5.5-keV impact energy O2+ primary ion bombardment with detection of negative and positive secondary ions, respectively. Although complete separation of 12C1H from 13C is achieved using both primary ion species, 6.-keV Cs+ clearly shows improved detection sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio for detection of 12C, 12C1H, and 13C secondary ions. The use of Cs+ primary ion bombardment results in somewhat anomalous, nonmonotonic changes in the 12C, 12C1H, and 13C secondary ion yields through the /PMMA interface; however, it is shown that this behavior is not due to sample charging. Through normalization of the 13C secondary ion yield to the total C (12C + 13C) ion yield, the observed effects through the /PMMA interface can be greatly minimized, thereby significantly improving analysis of polymer films and multilayers using SIMS. Mass spectra of 13C- and 12C- were also analyzed using a PHI TRIFT I time-of-flight mass spectrometer, with -keV Ga+ primary ion bombardment and detection of positive secondary ions. The (12)C7(1)H7 ion fragment and its 13C-enriched analogues have significant secondary ion yields with negligible mass interferences, providing an early indication of the potential for future use of this technique for cluster probe depth profiling of high molecular  13C-labeled fragments.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30985525>Fat-Free Mass Index in a Diverse Sample of Male Collegiate Athletes.</a></h2><p>Currier, BS, Harty, , Zabriskie, HA, Stecker, RA, Moon, JM, Jagim, AR, and Kerksick, CM. Fat-free mass index in a diverse sample of male collegiate athletes. J Strength Cond Res 33(6): 1474-1479, 2019-Fat-free mass index (FFMI) is a body composition metric that has been used to assess relative muscularity in athletes. Fat-free mass index is calculated by dividing FFM by height squared, although further height corrections through linear regression may be needed in taller individuals. This study reported height-adjusted FFMI (FFMIAdj) data in 209 male collegiate athletes from 10 sports (baseball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, weightlifting, rugby, swimming, track and field, and water polo) and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit for sports with sufficient sample size. The body composition of all subjects (mean ± SD; age: 20.7 ± 1.9 years, height: 182.9 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 90.8 ± 16.8 kg, and percent body fat: .6 ± 5.3) was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression was used to adjust for height, and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit was determined by calculating the 97.5th percentile of all values. One-way analyses of variance with Games-Howell post hoc comparisons were used to determine between-sport differences. A paired-samples t-test revealed a significant difference (p < .001) between unadjusted and adjusted mean FFMI values. The overall mean FFMIAdj was 22.8 ± 2.8 kg·m. Significant between-sport differences (p < .001) in FFMIAdj were identified. Average FFMIAdj was highest in football athletes (24.28 ± 2.39 kg·m) and lowest in water polo athletes (20.68 ± 3.56 kg·m). The FFMIAdj upper limit was calculated for all athletes (28.32 kg·m), rugby (29.1 kg·m), and baseball (25.5 kg·m). This study reported FFMIAdj values in a diverse cohort of male collegiate athletes, providing data for the first time in several sports. These values can be used to guide nutritional and exercise interventions, predict athletic performance, and provide coaches with standardized information regarding the potential for further FFM accretion in male athletes.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29984994>Physical Properties of (NaK )NbO Thin Film Grown at Low Temperature Using Two-Dimensional CaNbO Nanosheet Seed Layer.</a></h2><p>A monolayer CaNbO (CNO) nanosheet was deposited on a Pt/Ti/SiO/Si substrate using the Langmuir-Blodgett method.

During phase 1 (control) all subjects consumed 2% milk containing no , followed by phase 2 with fat-free milk containing free  (2 g/d fPS) and phase 3 with fat-free milk with TRP (2 g/d). After each phase, determinations of lipoprotein cholesterol distribution, particle concentration via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), apolipoproteins, inflammatory markers, and fat-soluble dietary antioxidants were made.Body mass, body composition, dietary energy and macronutrients, and physical activity were unaffected throughout the study. Compared to the control 2% milk, LDL-C was significantly (p < .05) decreased by fPS (-9.1%) and was further decreased by TRP (-.4%); reductions with TRP were significantly greater. Total LDL particle concentration was decreased to a greater extent after TRP (-8.8%) than fPS (-4.8%; p < .05). Only TRP significantly decreased serum levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB; -6%), interleukin-8 (IL-8; -11%) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1; -19%).

The absorbance of the secondary radical H2PO4(•) formed within 7  of the electron pulse is observed using pulse-probe method in the visible.

Studies implicating systemic blood pressure or, more recently, arterial stiffness in the pathophysiology of NTG have produced conflicting results. Our aim was to investigate whether NTG is associated with alterations in the macrocirculation or microcirculation, cardiac function, and peripheral and central hemodynamics. Thirty patients with NTG (mean age 65 years, range 46-79) and 33 healthy subjects (mean age 67 years, range 42-79) matched for age and sex were included in the study. Exclusion criteria (for both cases and controls) were history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, severe hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Aortic stiffness was measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), central hemodynamics using carotid artery applanation tonometry, and diameter, stiffness, and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid and femoral artery using echo-tracking. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) was derived from mean arterial pressure and cardiac index, measured using ultrasound. There were no statistically significant differences in arterial structure nor function between NTG patients and age and sex-matched controls. NTG versus controls, respectively: brachial blood pressure 126 ± /77 ± 8 versus 127 ± 16/76 ± 7 mm Hg, P = .81; carotid-femoral PWV 9.8 ± 2.1 versus 10.1 ± 1.9 m/s, P = .60; TPRI 1833 ± 609 versus 1779 ± 602 dyne.s/cm5/m2, P = .79; and carotid IMT .65 ± .14 versus .68 ± .13 mm, P = .39. This study could not show an association of NTG with altered IMT, arterial stiffness, total peripheral resistance, cardiac output, and peripheral or central hemodynamics at rest. Although the majority of these NTG patients do exhibit symptoms of vascular dysregulation, in the present study this was not translated into alterations in the microcirculation or macrocirculation at rest.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27476548>First in situ TOF-PET study using digital photon counters for proton range verification.</a></h2><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is the imaging modality most extensively tested for treatment monitoring in particle therapy. Optimal use of PET in proton therapy requires in situ acquisition of the relatively strong ()O signal due to its relatively short half-life (~2 min) and high  content in biological tissues, enabling shorter scans that are less sensitive to biological washout. This paper presents the first performance tests of a scaled-down in situ time-of-flight (TOF) PET system based on digital photon counters (DPCs) coupled to Cerium-doped Lutetium Yttrium Silicate (LYSO:Ce) crystals, providing quantitative results representative of a dual-head tomograph that complies with spatial constraints typically encountered in clinical practice (2  ×  50°, of 360°, transaxial angular acceptance). The proton-induced activity inside polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene (PE) phantoms was acquired within beam pauses (in-beam) and immediately after irradiation by an actively-delivered synchrotron pencil-beam, with clinically relevant 125.67 MeV/u, 4.6  ×  10(8) protons s(-1), and 10(10) total protons. 3D activity maps reconstructed with and without TOF information are compared to FLUKA simulations, demonstrating the benefit of TOF-PET to reduce limited-angle artefacts using a 382  full width at half maximum coincidence resolving time. The time-dependent contributions from different radionuclides to the total count-rate are investigated. We furthermore study the impact of the acquisition time window on the laterally integrated activity depth-profiles, with emphasis on 2 min acquisitions starting at different time points. The results depend on phantom composition and reflect the differences in relative contributions from the radionuclides originating from carbon and . We observe very good agreement between the shapes of the simulated and measured activity depth-profiles for post-beam protocols. However, our results also suggest that available experimental cross sections underestimate the production of (10)C for in-beam acquisitions, which in PE results in an overestimation of the predicted activity range by 1.4 mm. The uncertainty in the activity range measured in PMMA using the DPC-based TOF-PET prototype setup equals .2 mm-.3 mm.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637324>The effects of phytosterols on the sexual behavior and reproductive function in the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica).</a></h2><p>Phytosterols () are plant origin sterols naturally found in many foods and added as food additives.

A similar anterior tilt was seen in 2 of 6 with concave inserts and 5 of 6 with the  design, but the tilting started later, when the knee had 5-20 degrees more extension. From 45- degrees of flexion most components tilted into valgus. Three knees (1 concave with, 1 concave without PCL and 1 ) showed a sudden tilt into varus direction followed by a rocking motion in the opposite direction. The other types of displacements studied showed a more uniform pattern. The inducible maximum translation (MTPM) at 20 degrees of extension tended to be associated with increased migration between  and 2 yr when measured with the same parameter (Spearman's rho = .54, P = .03). Increased medial displacement of the center of the proximal tibia at 25 degrees was associated with increased anterior tilt. This type of motion was most commonly seen with the concave design.

Sertaconazole nitrate (STZ), a novel broad spectrum antifungal drug, was suggested as a promising treatment. However, its utility in the ocular route is restricted by its poor solubility, along with other problems facing the ocular delivery like short residence time, and the existing corneal barrier. Therefore, the objective of this study was to formulate STZ loaded binary mixed micelles (STZ-MMs) enriched with different penetration enhancers using thin-film hydration method, based on a 3.2 mixed factorial design. Different formulation variables were examined, namely, type of auxiliary surfactant, type of penetration enhancer, and total surfactants: drug ratio, and their effects on the solubility of STZ in MMs (S), particle size (), polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP) were evaluated. STZ-MMs enhanced STZ aqueous solubility up to 338.82-fold compared to free STZ. Two optimized formulations (MM-8 and MM-11) based on the desirability factor (.891 and .866) were selected by Design expert software for further investigations. The optimized formulations were imaged by TEM which revealed nanosized spherical micelles.

ORR, PFS, OS with ICPi, OS since advanced disease diagnosis, TMB, MSI, and PD-L1 expression were analyzed; uni- and multivariate PFS and OS analyses were done. OS with ICPi was compared between the RTD cohort and the non-selected NSCLC cohort (n-278).Of 50 tumors tested, 32%, 38%, and 30% were associated with ≥50%, 1-49% and <1% PD-L1 expression, respectively. Median TMB (n-48) comprised 4 muts/Mb (-57); TMB ≥ 10 muts/Mb was seen in 19% of tumors. Both TMB and PD-L1 expression varied across different RTDs. All the 47 tumors were MSI stable. ORR with ICPi (n-44) was 16%, median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.6-5.), median OS was 16.2 months (95% CI, 8.4-NR). No correlation was seen between OS with ICPi and PD-L1 expression (p > .4), TMB (p > .8), or RTD type (p > .3). In the multivariate analysis, ECOG  (p-.005), targeted agents exposure (p-.005), and ICPi exposure (p-.04) were the only variables which correlated with OS since advanced disease diagnosis. Median OS since advanced disease diagnosis comprised 32 months (95% CI, 19.9-44.9) and 13 months (95% CI, 6.6-.9) for patients who were and were not exposed to ICPi, respectively (log-rank test-6.3; p-.01).

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between elevated GCF levels of AST and periodontal disease progression.Over a 12-month period, 8 to 10 interproximal sites in 41 periodontitis subjects () and  healthy subjects (HS) were monitored. Clinical measurements included relative attachment level (RAL), probing depth, and bleeding on probing (BOP). Semiquantitative levels of GCF AST (< 800 microIU, > or = 800 microIU, and > or = 1,200 microIU) were determined using a chairside assay. At the 6- and 12-month visits, scaling and root planing and prophylaxis were performed in the  and HS, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for 2 diagnostic criteria (AST > or = 800 microIU, AST > or = 1,200 microIU) utilizing 4 thresholds of disease progression as determined by 2 methods (absolute change in relative attachment level and cumulative sum [CUSUM]).The percentage of sites exhibiting AST > or = 800 microIU, AST > or = 1,200 microIU, and BOP in the  was significantly (P<.02) lower at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline. The use of crevicular AST activity to monitor periodontal disease progression was associated with many false-positive results. Overall, low specificities, PPV, and odds ratios were demonstrated by the assay when using 2 diagnostic criteria and 4 thresholds of disease progression. The high NPV suggest that a negative AST test result was indicative of a periodontally stable site.These results demonstrate that elevated levels of AST were present at sites that did not subsequently exhibit disease progression. The high prevalence of AST-positive sites due to gingival  diminished the test's ability to discriminate between progressive and stable, but inflamed, sites.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30387062>The efficacy and cytotoxicity of iron oxide-carbon black composites for liquid-phase toluene oxidation by persulfate.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the oxidation of toluene (TOL) by persulfate () in aqueous solution in the presence of a FeO-carbon black (CB) composite oxidant system generating sulfate radicals.

A significant season by distance interaction was found for TG (p<.001). TG concentrations peaked at 5 km and decreased logarithmically throughout the OS (1.48 (.34) to .86 (.20) mmol/l) and  (1.90 (.31) to .73 (.18) mmol/l) tests. From the OS to the , there was an increase in the difference in TG at 5- km with a concomitant increase at 2. mmol/l of the lactate threshold. The peak TG concentrations at 5 km followed by a logarithmic decrease suggest that TG may also provide circulating energy. A greater logarithmic decrease in TG occurred in the  than in the OS, indicating a higher rate of use. There was an increase in the difference in TG at 5- km similar to the increase in the speed at 2. mmol/l of the lactate threshold between the two seasons. Glucose, insulin, lactate, and free fatty acids were similar in the two seasons.Free fatty acid and TG concentrations were much higher than expected, and the two training seasons showed significantly different patterns of TG concentration during prolonged running.

This model has been successful in predicting the radiation drive in vacuum hohlraums, but for gas-filled hohlraums used to drive capsule implosions, the model consistently predicts too much drive and capsule bang times earlier than measured. In this work, we introduce a new model that brings the calculated bang time into better agreement with the measured bang time. The new model employs (1) a numerical grid that is fully converged in space, , and time, (2) a modified approximate NLTE model that includes more physics and is in better agreement with more detailed offline emissivity models, and (3) a reduced flux limiter value of .03. We applied this model to gas-filled hohlraum experiments using high density carbon and plastic ablator capsules that had hohlraum He fill gas densities ranging from .06 to 1.6 mg/cc and hohlraum diameters of 5.75 or 6.72 mm. The new model predicts bang times to within ±100  for most experiments with low to intermediate fill densities (up to .85 mg/cc).

Peak ankle power generation at push-off (peakA2), peak hip power generation in early swing (peakH3) and propulsion strategy () [peakA2/(peakA2+peakH3)] were calculated to provide the relative contribution of ankle power to total propulsion. Mean  values decreased as speed increased for comfortable walking (p<.001), fast walking (p<.001) and fast running (p<.001), and less consistently during jogging (p=.054).  varied with age (p<.001) only during fast walking.

However, the terminology associated with MS-DRG determination is often not aligned with typical physician language, leading to inaccurate coding and decreased hospital reimbursements. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of a diagnosis picklist within a paper-based history and physical examination (H&P) on the average MS-DRG  and the Case-mix index (CMI). Our trauma center implemented a paper H&P form for trauma patients featuring picklist diagnoses aligned with the MS-DRG terminology and arranged by the physiologic system. To evaluate its impact, we conducted a cohort study using data from our trauma registry between July 2015 and November 2017. Our cohort included 442 (26.%) paper and 1,261 (74.%) dictated H&. Average CMI (2.56  2.) and expected patients ($25,057  $19,825) were higher for the paper group ( < .001,  = .002). Adjusted regression models demonstrated paper coding to be associated with .265 CMI points, translating to an average increase in expected payment of 6.5 per cent per patient. Utilization of a standardized, paper-based H&P template with picklist diagnoses was associated with a higher trauma service CMI and higher expected payments.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to establish factors of prognostic significance.Of the 53 patients who received first-line triplet therapy, 28 (53%) received second-line chemotherapy [13 men; 8 with a  primary; mutant  in 10, wild-type in , and unknown status in 3; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status () of 1 in 16 patients,  2 in 3,  3 in 2, and unknown in 7; involved organs: liver in 17 patients, lung in 16, and peritoneum in 8]. Second-line chemotherapy consisted of xelox or folfox in 13 patients, xeliri or folfiri in 12, and single-agent irinotecan in 3. Concurrent bevacizumab was given in 16 patients (57%), and cetuximab, in 2 (7%). Median survival was 28. months [95% confidence interval (ci): 22.8 months to 33.2 months] for patients receiving second-line therapy and 23. months (95% ci: 13.2 months to 32.8 months) for those not receiving it.

In this study, CK isoenzyme alterations were examined in male rats, with an 8% body mass weight attached to their tail. The rats were either forced to swim for 5 h (5S, n = 51), or were pre-trained for 8 days and then forced to swim for 5 h (T5S, n = 48). Rats were sacrificed either immediately ( h ), 3 h (3 h ), or 48 h post-swimming (48 h ). Serum CK was increased significantly (P < .01) 6.2- and 2.-fold at  h  following the 5S and T5S protocols, respectively. However, training (T5S protocol) significantly (P < .01) decreased CK release. Soleus and white gastrocnemius (WG) CK activity was significantly decreased following the 5S protocol (P < .05), but not following the T5S protocol. The CK-M activity of the soleus muscle was significantly (P < .05) decreased at  h  following both the 5S and T5S protocols, and returned to control values at 3 h .

The undoped and Mn-doped CdZnSSe alloy NCs have been characterized by employing high-resolution TEM, X-ray diffraction, -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements. A low-temperature injection of chalcogens led to a gradient interface in the alloy, comprised of a CdSe/CdS/ZnSe/ZnS nanostructure. Both steady-state and ultrafast time-resolved absorption studies suggested the formation of a charge-transfer (CT) state due to the inner quasi-type II CdSe/CdS part of the gradient CdZnSSe alloy NCs, in which electrons are delocalized throughout the conduction band (CB) of both CdSe and CdS. The CT-state bleach recovery kinetics gave an additional slow electron cooling component (8 ) in the undoped alloy NCs, which has been assigned to electron equilibration in the delocalized CB before recombination (or trapping). Interestingly, in the presence of dopant Mn, the slow electron cooling component became even more sluggish at 10  due to Mn-mediated electron cooling, in which Mn acts as an electron storage center. An unprecedented increase in the photocurrent conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 30 % from (3.3±.11) to (4.29±.07) % was observed in the Mn-doped gradient alloy compared with the undoped alloy.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Our study aimed to develop a model to identify prognostic factors or survival time in patients diagnosed with MPE.This is a retrospective, descriptive, observational study to identify prognostic factors related to MPE in patients with a confirmed cancer diagnosis. Cox regression analysis was used to determine significant potential prognostic factors with respect to survival time. Survival time was defined as the time from pathological diagnosis to death.One hundred and sixty-five patients were included; 77 were men (47%) and 88 were women (53%). The median age was 60 years, and all of the patients were pathologically proven to have MPE. Non-small-cell lung cancer (36.%), breast carcinoma (26%), and lymphoma (13.%) were the most frequently diagnosed tumors. The median overall survival of patients from the initial diagnosis was 5 months (range: 1.-96. months). Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis showed that survival was significantly related to the following prognostic factors: ECOG  (hazard ratio [HR] 10., 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 5.96 to 18.50, p < .0001), primary cancer site (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.22, p < .01), positive pleural cytology (HR 1.25, 95% CI .88 to 1.78, p = .04), and positive histology (HR 1.33, 95% CI .97 to 1.81, p = .04). Other potential independent diagnostic factors that were examined did not affect survival. Cox regression analysis showed that only the ECOG  was highly predictive of survival (HR 73.58, 95% CI 23.44 to 230.95, p < .0001).ECOG  is an independent predictor of survival in patients with MPE at initial diagnosis.

Continuous noninvasive finger arterial pressure and ECG were recorded in the lying and the standing positions before and after ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal (600 kcal, carbohydrate 78%, protein 13%, and fat 8%). Low-frequency (LF, .04-.

In response to CI and , mean arterial pressure maintained stable, and heart rate increased in women and men in the lying and standing positions. Following CI (60, 90, and 120 min postprandially) in the standing position, SBP LF power increased by 40% in men (P = .02), with unchanged HRV parameters; in contrast, in women, HRV HF power halved (P = .02), with unaltered SBP LF power. During  before and after CI, similar magnitude of SBP LF power, HRV, and BRS changes was observed in men and women. In conclusion, CI induces sex-specific vascular sympathetic activation in healthy older men, and cardiac vagal inhibition in healthy older women; this CI-mediated efferent vagal inhibition may suggest differential cardiovascular risk factors in women, irrespective of insulin resistance, and impairment of autonomic control.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16450840>Purification and characterization of two extracellular lipases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa -x.</a></h2><p>Two different extracellular lipases were isolated and purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa -x to apparent homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography on Q- and S-Sepharose column.

The semi-monolithic scintillator detector consists of 11 polished LYSO slices measuring 1  ×  11.6  ×  10 mm. The slices are glued together with enhanced specular reflector (ESR) in between and outside of the slices. The bottom surface of the slices is coupled to a 4  ×  4 SiPM array with a 1 mm light guide and silicon grease between them. No reflector is used on the top surface and two sides of the slices to reduce the scintillation photon reflection. The signals of the 4  ×  4 SiPM array are grouped along rows and columns separately into eight signals. Four SiPM column signals are used to identify the slices according to the center of the gravity of the scintillation photon distribution in the pixelated direction. Four SiPM row signals are used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth of interaction) positions according to the center of the gravity and the width of the scintillation photon distribution in the monolithic direction, respectively. The detector was measured with 1 mm sampling interval in both the y and z directions with electronic collimation by using a .25 mm diameter Na point source and a 1  ×  1  ×  20 mm LYSO crystal detector. An average slice based  resolution of 14.9% was obtained. All slices of 1 mm thick were clearly resolved and a detector with even thinner slices could be used. The y positions calculated with the center of gravity method are different for interactions happening at the same y, but different z positions due to depth dependent edge effects. The least-square minimization and the maximum likelihood positioning algorithms were developed and both methods improved the spatial resolution at the edges of the detector as compared with the center of gravity method. A mean absolute error (MAE) which is defined as the probability-weighted mean of the absolute value of the positioning error is used to evaluate the spatial resolution. An average MAE spatial resolution of ~1. mm was obtained in both y and z directions without rejection of the multiple scattering events. The average MAE spatial resolution was ~.7 mm in both y and z directions after the multiple scattering events were rejected. The timing resolution of the detector is 575 . In the next step, long rectangle detector will be built to reduce edge effects and improve the spatial resolution of the semi-monolithic detector. Thick detector up to 20 mm will be explored and the positioning algorithms will be further optimized.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25668193>Correlation of perfusion MRI and 18F-FDG PET imaging biomarkers for monitoring regorafenib therapy in experimental colon carcinomas with immunohistochemical validation.</a></h2><p>To investigate a multimodal, multiparametric perfusion MRI / 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose-(18F-FDG)-PET imaging protocol for monitoring regorafenib therapy effects on experimental colorectal adenocarcinomas in rats with immunohistochemical validation.Human colorectal adenocarcinoma xenografts (HT-29) were implanted subcutaneously in n = 17 (n = 10 therapy group; n = 7 control group) female athymic nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1rnu).

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was approximately 50 nM. It is a potent inhibitor in vitro and is also effective in vivo. Administration of WR99210 parenterally (i.e., intraperitoneally) reduced the mean number of RH strain tachyzoites present in peritoneal fluid substantially 4 days after intraperitoneal infection of mice. There was a mean of approximately 35 million parasites in control mice as contrasted with approximately 2 million parasites in mice treated with 1.25 mg WR99210/kg of body  in a representative experiment (P < .05). In addition the prodrug - N'-[3-(2,4, 5-trichlorophenoxy)propyloxy]-N9-(1-methylethyl) imidocarbonimidicdiamide is converted to 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropyloxy)-1,3,5 triazine in vivo when the prodrug is administered orally. - administered by gavage also reduced intraperitoneal RH strain T. gondii tachyzoite numbers. WR99210 has high efficacy and relatively low toxicity because of its substantial effect on T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) but not the mammalian host DHFR. Amino acid sequences of T. gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, and Homo sapiens DHFRs were compared. It is of interest that of the DHFR amino acids considered to be interacting with WR99210 in P. falciparum within interatomic distances within 3 to 5 A, four of eight were shared with T. gondii DHFR. H. sapiens also shared four amino acids thought to be interacting with WR99210.

Mucosal  is important for protection against acquisition and subsequent meningococcal carriage. In this study, we assessed salivary antibody levels against meningococcal serogroup A (MenA), W (MenW) and Y (MenY) after vaccination with a quadrivalent MenACWY conjugated vaccine. We also compared salivary meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) antibody levels after monovalent MenC and quadrivalent MenACWY conjugated vaccination.Healthy participants, who had received MenC conjugate vaccine between 14 months and 3 years of age, received a (booster) MenC or MenACWY vaccination at age 10- years. MenA-, MenC-, MenW- and MenY-polysaccharide () specific IgG and IgA levels in saliva and serum and  specific secretory component levels in saliva were measured using the fluorescent-bead-based multiplex immunoassay.MenACYW vaccination increased salivary -specific IgA (2-fold) and IgG levels(>10-fold) for MenA, MenY, and MenW. After one year, salivary IgA levels had returned to baseline levels. Both vaccines induced an increase in salivary MenC- specific IgA (>3-fold) and IgG (>100-fold), with higher levels after MenC as compared to MenACWY vaccination. The antibody decay rate of MenC in saliva between one month and one year was similar for both vaccines. The overall correlation between serum and saliva IgA levels was low (R = .39, R = .58, R = .31, and R = .36 for MenA, MenC, MenW and MenY, respectively). Serogroup- specific IgG levels between serum and saliva correlated better (R ranged from .51 to .88).Both primary (MenA, MenY, and MenW) and booster (MenC) parenteral meningococcal conjugate vaccination induced high salivary antibody levels. The strong correlation for MenC, MenW and MenY between saliva and serum IgG levels indicates that saliva might be used as a reliable tool to measure vaccine responses after both primary and booster meningococcal vaccination.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28717785>The effects of high concentrations of ionic liquid on GB1 protein structure and dynamics probed by high-resolution magic-angle-spinning NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Ionic liquids have great potential in biological applications and biocatalysis, as some ionic liquids can stabilize proteins and enhance enzyme activity, while others have the opposite effect. However, on the molecular level, probing ionic liquid interactions with proteins, especially in solutions containing high concentration of ionic liquids, has been challenging. In the present work the C, N-enriched GB1 model protein was used to demonstrate applicability of high-resolution magic-angle-spinning (HR-MAS) NMR spectroscopy to investigate ionic liquid - protein interactions. Effect of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, [C-mim]Br) on GB1was studied over a wide range of the ionic liquid concentrations (.6 to 3.5 M, which corresponds to 10%-60% v/v). Interactions between GB1 and [C-mim]Br were observed from changes in the chemical shifts of the protein backbone as well as the changes in N -ns dynamics and rotational correlation times. Site-specific interactions between the protein and [C-mim]Br were assigned using 3D methods under HR-MAS conditions. Thus, HR-MAS NMR is a viable tool that could aid in elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ionic liquid - protein interactions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620471>Effect of a plant sterol-enriched spread on biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and low-grade  in hypercholesterolaemic subjects.</a></h2><p>Plant sterols () lower LDL-cholesterol, an established risk factor for CHD.

However, some patients survive intensive chemotherapy, and complete resection of primary and metastatic tumors may even be possible. In the present study, we examined the prognostic factors associated with survival after intensive chemotherapy in patients with unresectable colorectal cancer.This retrospective study enrolled 61 patients diagnosed with unresectable locally advanced colorectal cancer between January 2004 and December 2013. Among the prognostic parameters, we found that the prognoses of patients with abnormal performance status () of 2 or 3, high Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) of 1 or 2, high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) >5, and low prognostic nutritional index (PNI) <40 were poor. Thus, we scored each patient according to our scoring system (abnormal , 2 or 3 = +1; high GPS, 1 or 2 = +1; high NLR, >5 = +1; and low PNI, <40 = +1). If the patient showed abnormalities in every parameter, the score would be +4.Sixteen patients had a score of , 17 scored +1, 10 scored +2, 17 scored +3, and one scored +4.

The photophysical methods used include steady state flurescence, uv spectroscopy, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Both compounds showed solvatochromic behavior, due to intramolecular charge transfer state formation, and efficient fluorescence in polar solvents. Photophysical behavior was dependent on the metal ion. The addition of metal ions that completely fit into the crown ether cavity resulted in significant blue shifts in the fluorescence emission spectra (chemosensing properties). Partially fitting ions changed the fluorescence spectra slightly. Transient absorption measurements revealed fast and slow decay components with time constants of 10-20 and 500-600  for all fitting ions, respectively. The latter is assigned to a trans-cis photoisomerization process, which decreased in efficiency in the presence of partially fitting ions, i.e., increasing ion size. Steady state irradiation showed clear evidence of a change in the absorption spectra. Trans-cis photoisomerization and [2 + 2] photocycloaddition were found to compete with fluorescence. The ions Li+, Na+, and Ca2+, which fit into the cavity, direct the photoisomerization. Larger ions (K+, Rb+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) that partially fit the cavity cause photocycloaddition. Quantum yields of the photoreaction are between .1 and .3.

Novel associations replicated in the U.S.  cohort included the region harboring lipoma HMGIC fusion partner (LHFP) and conserved oligomeric golgi complex component 6 (COG6) genes on chromosome 13q13 (combined P = 2x10(-6) for rs7993214; OR = .71), the late cornified envelope gene cluster (LCE) from the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (PSORS4) (combined P = 6.2x10(-5) for rs6701216; OR 1.45) and a region of LD at 15q21 (combined P = 2.9x10(-5) for rs3803369; OR = 1.43). This region is of interest because it harbors ubiquitin-specific protease-8 whose processed pseudogene lies upstream from HLA-C. This region of 15q21 also harbors the gene for SPPL2A (signal peptide peptidase like 2a) which activates tumor necrosis factor alpha by cleavage, triggering the expression of IL12 in human dendritic cells. We also identified a novel PSA (and potentially ) locus on chromosome 4q27.

Methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) was injected at 3 weeks after starting treatment, and the femurs were histologically examined bilaterally 3 weeks after methylprednisolone injection. Midazolam clearance was measured before treatment and before methylprednisolone injection to determine hepatic cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) levels.The incidence of osteonecrosis in the proximal metaphysis of the femurs in groups  and SS was significantly lower than in group C (P < .05 and P < .0001, respectively), whereas it did not differ between groups P and C. It was significantly lower in group SS than in group  (P < .05).

The remaining 60% did not maintain membrane integrity but were not completely lysed.  exposure was increased with both STS and POL exhibiting a dose- and time-dependant trend. While activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9, as well as Bax activation, were increased in leukocytes stimulated with low concentrations of STS, only caspases 3 and 9 and Bax were increased with POL. Inhibitory assays demonstrated caspases 3, 8, and 9, and Bax inhibition at low concentrations with both STS and POL. Both agents increased the leukocyte activation of porimin at all concentrations. On confocal microscopy, stains for caspases 3, 8, and 9, and Bax were increased for both STS and POL. Porimin stain was markedly positive for both STS and POL.Both sclerosants induced leukocyte apoptosis at sublytic concentrations. STS activated both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis, while POL stimulated the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis only. Both agents induced oncosis.

In order to assess whether this occurs during heating and storage, an analytical procedure was developed for the determination of concentration levels and identity of  oxidation products in functional food ingredients and products. The method is based on cold saponification, solvent extraction of unsaponifiables, isolation of sterol oxidation products by means of liquid chromatography, and final analysis by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection. Identification of the key  oxidation products was performed by means of GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Isotope dilution MS was used to verify the absence of the formation of potential artifacts by the method. The method described is applicable to spreads (containing 20-65% water), oils, sterol esters, pure sterols, and  extracts from food.

While Palmaria palmata was collected from the upper sublittoral of the Kongsfjord (Spitsbergen, Norway), Odonthalia dentata represents a typical deepwater species at this high latitude. After 6 h and 24 h exposure to UV, chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II ( II efficiency, F(v)/F(m)) was determined as an indicator for photosynthetic performance, and the relative electron transport rates in response to increasing photon fluence rates were recorded. In parallel, tissue samples were prepared for the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The presented data clearly demonstrate a significant influence of experimental UV on photosynthetic performance. Photochemical efficiency of  II of both red algal species decreased to about one third of the initial value under UV. While the PI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve parameter alpha (positive slope at limiting photon fluence rates) strongly decreased in both plants, the I(k) values (initial value of light-saturated photosynthetic rate) increased 3 - 5-fold. Palmaria palmata does not appear to become photoinhibited under these conditions, but O. dentata showed strong photoinhibition. The TEM results demonstrated that the photosynthetic apparatus was severely influenced by UV in both species, because thylakoid membranes appeared wrinkled, lumen dilatations occurred, and the outer membranes were altered. Moreover,  were damaged, and numerous plasma vesicles were observed. In conclusion, both red algal species are negatively affected by UV on the physiological and ultrastructural level.

Pulmonary surfactant () plays a key role in a broad range of treatments for ARDS. The aim of the present investigation was to assess changes in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from choline and determine the effect of exogenous  on its de novo synthesis in rats with OA-induced PE. Experimental rats were randomized into three groups, including a control group, OA-induced PE group, and OA-induced group treated with exogenous  (OA-). Twenty-four rats were sacrificed 4 h after induction of the OA model, and tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy to assess the severity of ALI using an established scoring system at the end of the experiment. After  μCi 3H-choline chloride was injected intravenously, eight rats in each group were sacrificed at 4, 8, and 16 h. The radioactivity of 3H incorporated into total phospholipid (TPL) and desaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue (LT) using a liquid scintillation counter and was expressed as counts per minute (CPM). Results showed that TPL, DSPC, and the ratio of DSPC/total protein (TP) in lung tissue decreased 4 h after challenge with OA, but the levels recovered after 8 and 16 h. At 8 h after injection, 3H-TPL and 3H-DSPC radioactivity in the lungs reached its peak. Importantly, 3H-DSPC CPM were significantly lower in the  treatment group (LT: Control: 62327 ± 9108; OA-PE: 97315 ± 10083; OA-: 45127 ± 10034, P < .05; BALF: Control: 7771 ± 1768; OA-PE: 8097 ± 1799; OA-PE: 3651 ± 1027, P < .05).

Therefore, we hypothesize that exogenous  treatments may adversely affect endogenous de novo synthetic and secretory phospholipid pathways via feedback inhibition. This novel finding reveals the specific involvement of exogenous  in endogenous synthetic and secretory phospholipid pathways during the treatment of ARDS.

It was previously shown that these two photosensitizers exhibit a large singlet  ((1)O2) quantum yield (Φ (Δ) ∼.99 in acetonitrile). Their photon-mediated efficacy to cause cell death (λ = 530 nm, H = 45 J cm(-2)) was tested in vitro in colon and glioma cancer cell lines (CT26.WT, CT26.CL25, F98, and U87) and demonstrated a strong photodynamic effect with complete cell death at concentrations as low as 4 and 1 μM for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. Notably, dark toxicity was negligible at concentrations less than 25 and 10 μM for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. The ability of the PSs to initiate Type I photoreactions was tested by exposing -treated U87 cells to light under hypoxic conditions (pO2 < .5%), which resulted in a complete loss of the PDT effect. In vivo, the maximum tolerated doses 50 (MTD50) were determined to be 36 mg kg(-1) (TLD1411) and 103 mg kg(-1) (TLD1433) using the BALB/c murine model. In vivo growth delay studies in the subcutaneous colon adenocarcinoma CT26.WT murine model were conducted at a photosensitizer dose equal to .5 and .2 MTD50 for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. 4 hours post  injection, tumours were irradiated with continuous wave or pulsed light sources (λ = 525-530 nm, H = 192 J cm(-2)). Overall, treatment with continuous wave light demonstrated a higher tumour destruction efficacy when compared to pulsed light. TLD1433 mediated PDT resulted in statistically significant longer animal survival compared to TLD1411.

However, there is controversy concerning the combined effect on lipid constituents during HD of the three commonly used variables; the type of heparin, dialysis membrane and the constituent of dialysate buffer bases. Consequently, this controlled prospective study was thought of.Randomly 63 patients were assigned from Urology and Nephrology haemodialysis (HD) unit, Mansoura, Egypt for the planned study. Their mean age was 45.79 +/- 13.11 years. Fourteen patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) served as control group for the remaining 49 HD patients. They were subdivided according to the HD duration (< and > 1 year), anticoagulant used (unfractionated [UFH] and low-molecular  heparin [LMWH, Enoxaparin), membrane type (Hemophane [HP] and polysulfone [] membrane) and dialysate buffer bases (bicarbonate versus acetate based).Determining the fasting lipid value of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) as well as lipoproteins including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] was completed.Bicarbonate dialysate was associated with significantly lower TG (134.7 +/- 11 mg/dl vs. 153 +/- 14 mg/dl, p = .004), higher HDL-C (33.1 +/- 3 vs. 28.3 +/- 2, p = .0002) and subsequently better atherosclerosis risk ratio [TC/HDL-C (ARR)] (6.02 +/- .09 vs. 5.3 +/- .9, p = .001) despite its insignificant effect on TC and LDL-C. However, logarithm (log) Lp (a) level was significantly higher (1.92 +/- .05 vs. 1.82 +/- .04 p = .001) in comparison with acetate dialysate. Membrane type was not influential in those dialyzed for < 1 year before intervention while after a year of HD,  (n = 11) compared to HP filters (n = 11) significantly lowered TC (151.7 +/- 16 vs. 172.6 +/- 12, p = .003), TG (127.8 +/-  vs. 155.7 +/- , p = .004), LDL-C (122.1 +/- 5 vs. 130.6 +/- 7, p = .006) levels as well as ARR (5.9 +/- .5 vs. 5.4 +/- .3, p = .02). Likewise was the reduction in log Lp (a) (1.9 +/- .03 vs. 1.8 +/- .04, p = .002) with insignificant effect on HDL-C. After 6 months, Enoxaparin caused significant improvement of TC (.0004), TG (p = .018), LDL-C (p = .006), HDL-C (.041) and Lp (a) (.047) compared to UFH. Patients who continued on Enoxaparin for 3 more months displayed an even better attenuation in most of lipid parameters whilst continuation of UFH was insignificant. Switching few patients (n = 4) from UFH to LMWH for 3 months resulted in significant lowering of TC (153 +/- 7 vs. 177.7 +/- 3, p = .01), TG (127.5 +/- 5 vs. 137.3 +/- 4, p = .03) and LDL-C (124.7 +/- 5 vs. 127.5 +/- 5, p = .005). However, switching equal number of patients from LMWH to UFH caused no significant change.Dyslipidaemia in Egyptian haemodialysis patients was improved when bicarbonate-based haemodialysis, the use of polysulfone membrane, and more so when the low-molecular  heparin Enoxaparin were used.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27532885>The Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Austrians Disease Management Program in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Austrian Disease Management Program (DMP) 'Therapie aktiv-Diabetes im Griff' for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus concerning patient-relevant outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke) and costs.Based on routine health insurance data, we conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using a propensity score () matched control group design.

Out of 208.532 patients with no participation in the DMP up to 2013, -matched controls were selected with a matching ratio 1:3. In the -model, patient's characteristics, form of antidiabetic drug therapy, several prescriptions, the number of hospital admissions and days, main discharge diagnoses and costs at baseline were included.Over a follow-up period of four years, we observed a significantly lower mortality rate in the DMP-group (9.4%) in comparison with the control group (.9%, p<.001). The cumulative number of hospital days and mean annual hospital costs were lower for DMP-participants resulting in significantly lower mean annual total costs, amounting to € 8226.80 per patient in the DMP-group and € 9231.10 in the control group respectively (p<.001).The evaluation shows a survival benefit and an average reduction of costs for participants in the DMP compared with the control-group.

Although TOT has been reported as an effective method for front end readout in PET applications, it has several limitations, including its non-linearity, lower dynamic range, and a trade-off between  resolution and coincidence resolving time (CRT). In this study, we propose a novel design we developed to improve performance with regard to these problems occurring in the conventional TOT by employing a bipolar signal and two comparators. Using a high frequency CR shaping filter, a detected signal was converted into a bipolar signal, and the positive pulse of the converted bipolar signal had a fast rising time, while the negative pulse had a linear slope. The bipolar TOT circuit was composed of a preamplifier, a CR shaping filter, and two comparators. The PET detector was composed of a single LYSO coupled with 4  ×  4 SiPM arrays, a bipolar TOT circuit, and an FPGA based TDC. And this was constructed to evaluate the performance of the proposed bipolar TOT method. A 16-ch PET detector module consisting of a 4  ×  4 array LYSO coupled to a 4  ×  4 SiPM arrays, an Anger logic discretized positioning circuit, and a 4-ch bipolar TOT circuit was also constructed to evaluate the functionality of the bipolar TOT method for PET applications. The pulse height resolution and CRT were measured using both the bipolar TOT method and the conventional TOT method. While the bipolar TOT method provided a similar pulse height resolution (10.4%  ±  .1%), the integral non-linearity (1.4%) and CRT (168  ±  4 ) measured using the bipolar TOT method were greatly improved compared to those (17.2% and 258  ±   , respectively) measured with the conventional TOT method. The positions of the crystals were clearly identified, as seen in the flood histogram acquired using the 4-ch bipolar TOT circuit. The measured average pulse height resolution and average CRT for the 16-ch detector module were 11.5%  ±  .2% and 516  ±  24 . The results obtained in this study indicate that the bipolar TOT method requiring a relatively small number of electronic components could effectively improve the CRT, linearity and dynamic range. Furthermore, they also demonstrated the extendibility allowing the development of a PET system that consists of a large number of detectors.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14523226>Serum MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels are increased in patients with psoriatic arthritis and their siblings.</a></h2><p>To determine matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue-inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) serum levels in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and to compare this with their siblings and local blood donor controls. PsA is an interesting condition in which to study metalloproteinases because there are variations in the level of destructiveness, including a significant proportion of cases without destructive change. This is unlike rheumatoid arthritis (RA) which is more uniformly destructive and where MMP-1/TIMP-1 levels are known to be elevated.MMP-1 and TIMP-1 serum levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in (a) index cases with PsA (subtype: RA n = 43, distal interphalangeal disease n = 2, oligoarticular n = , spondyloarthropathy n = 9, enthesitis n = 1), (b) siblings with PsA, (c) siblings with  (), (d) unaffected siblings and (e) local controls.

There was no statistical difference in MMP-1 or TIMP-1 levels between index cases and their siblings. There was no difference in serum MMP-1 level between the different subtypes (Moll and Wright) of PsA, but there was an increased level of serum TIMP-1 in patients with rheumatoid pattern (P = .05). In the index cases there were increased levels of TIMP-1 in type II onset  (P = .03) but no difference in MMP-1 levels.MMP-1 and TIMP-1 serum levels are elevated in PsA. This is greatest in RA pattern PsA. These levels were also elevated in unaffected siblings suggesting that genetic factors may be important.

TRPM4-like single channel activity is observed in isolated rabbit Purkinje cells but not in ventricular cells. The TRPM4-like current develops during the notch and early repolarization phases of the action potential in Purkinje cells.Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) Ca(2+)-activated non-selective cation channel activity has been recorded in cardiomyocytes and sinus node cells from mammals. In addition, TRPM4 gene mutations are associated with human diseases of cardiac conduction, suggesting that TRPM4 plays a role in this aspect of cardiac function. Here we evaluate the TRPM4 contribution to cardiac electrophysiology of Purkinje fibres. Ventricular strips with Purkinje fibres were isolated from rabbit hearts. Intracellular microelectrodes recorded Purkinje fibre activity and the TRPM4 inhibitor 9-phenanthrol was applied to unmask potential TRPM4 contributions to the action potential. 9-Phenanthrol reduced action potential duration measured at the point of 50 and 90% repolarization with an EC50 of 32.8 and 36.1×10(-6) mol l(-1), respectively, but did not modulate ventricular action potentials. Inside-out patch-clamp recordings were used to monitor TRPM4 activity in isolated Purkinje cells. TRPM4-like single channel activity (conductance = 23.8 ; equal permeability for Na(+) and K(+); sensitivity to voltage, Ca(2+) and 9-phenanthrol) was observed in 43% of patches from Purkinje cells but not from ventricular cells (/16). Action potential clamp experiments performed in the whole-cell configuration revealed a transient inward 9-phenanthrol-sensitive current (peak density = -.65 ± . pA pF(-1); n = 5) during the plateau phases of the Purkinje fibre action potential. These results show that TRPM4 influences action potential characteristics in rabbit Purkinje fibres and thus could modulate cardiac conduction and be involved in triggering arrhythmias.© 2015 The Authors.

Thus, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) can switch between the photosystems consequently transferring more excitation energy to PSII (state 1) or to PSI (state 2) or can end up in LHCII-only domains. In this study, low-temperature (77 K) steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measured on intact cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii shows that independently of the state excitation energy transfer from LHCII to PSI or to PSII occurs on two main timescales of <  and ∼ 100 . Moreover, in state 1 almost all LHCIIs are functionally connected to PSII, whereas the transition from state 1 to a state 2 chemically locked by .1 M sodium fluoride leads to an almost complete functional release of LHCIIs from PSII. About 2/3 of the released LHCIIs transfer energy to PSI and ∼ 1/3 of the released LHCIIs form a component designated X-685 peaking at 685 nm that decays with time constants of .28 and 5.8 ns and does not transfer energy to PSI or to PSII. A less complete state 2 was obtained in cells incubated under anaerobic conditions without chemical locking. In this state about half of all LHCIIs remained functionally connected to PSII, whereas the remaining half became functionally connected to PSI or formed X-685 in similar amounts as with chemical locking. We demonstrate that X-685 originates from LHCII domains not connected to a photosystem and that its presence introduces a change in the interpretation of 77 K steady-state fluorescence emission measured upon state transitions in Chalamydomonas reinhardtii.Copyright © 2015 Biophysical Society.

Currently, the most widely used vaccine is the typhoid Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi-) vaccine. While epidemiological studies on its efficacy have been performed in children in endemic countries, there are no efficacy studies evaluating its use in travel medicine. Response to vaccination may differ in travellers receiving immunosuppressive therapy. This study investigates the humoral response to Vi- vaccination in travellers receiving immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid disease.We recruited patients from the LUMC rheumatology outpatient clinic and travellers from the travel clinic who had previously received Vi- vaccination and also immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid disease. We analysed blood samples acquired from 42 patients over a period of 3 years. We estimated the length of persistence of protective titres using the survival analysis using multiple cut-off values for protection and measured titre half-life and the influence of immunosuppressive medication on titre half-life using mixed models.Anti-Vi- antibody levels stayed above 10 EU/ml for a mean of 13.3 years, above  EU/ml for a mean of 10.1 years and above 20 EU/ml for a mean of 8.6 years after Vi- vaccination. Titre half-life was 7.5 years (95% CI 5.-14.7 years, P < .001). No significant influence of medication on titre half-life was found.Both persistence of protective antibody titres and titre half-life are longer than expected based on other studies.

Demographics, treatment, and survival data were collected.528 patients were seen: 291 (55%) received palliative ST, while 237 (45%) received none. Demographics were as follows: Median age 67, 55% male, 50% ECOG performance status () -1, 48% with  loss. Untreated patients were older (median 71 vs. 64, p<.01), less fit ( -1 in 27% vs. 69%, p<.01), and more likely to have lost  (57% vs. 41%, p<.01). Reasons for no treatment included poor  (67%) and patient choice (23%). Median OS was shorter amongst untreated patients (3.9 vs. 10.7 months, HR 1.80 [95% CI 1.4-2.3], p<.01). In multivariate analysis, not receiving ST was associated with shorter OS.Unsurprisingly, untreated patients had poorer prognostic features and worse OS. However, it is concerning that, despite being seen in an active academic center, nearly half of all referred patients with advanced NSCLC received no anti-cancer treatment.

The interaction of these per se harmless agents results in the production of reactive species.

The search for ideal PDT photosensitizers has been a very active field of research, with a special focus on porphyrins and porphyrin-related macrocycle molecules. The present study describes the photophysical characterization and in vitro phototoxicity evaluation of 5,10,,20-tetra(quinolin-2-yl)porphyrin (2-TQP) as a potential PDT photosensitizer.

The present study investigated the effect of a daily lacto-fermented sauerkraut supplement in relation to IBS patients' gastrointestinal symptoms and gut  composition. A randomized double-blinded intervention was conducted with 34 Norwegian IBS patients. The patients were consuming either pasteurized sauerkraut (; n = ) or unpasteurized sauerkraut (UPS; n = 19) as a supplement to their daily diet for 6 weeks. The differences in change of symptoms were assessed using the questionnaire IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) measured at the baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 (follow-up). The gut  composition was analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples from the baseline and week 6. The mean change in IBS-SSS was -38.57 ± 17.08  vs. -56.99 ± 16.92 UPS and was significantly improved in both groups (P < .04), while the improvement in symptoms was not different between the intervention groups.

Secondary outcomes were pain scores (), opioid consumption, and complications.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients less than 21 years of age undergoing abdominal surgery with a unilateral or bilateral pTAP(s) for postoperative analgesia. The local anesthetic was placed posterior to the termination of the transversus abdominis muscle where the thoracolumbar fascia overrides the quadratus lumborum muscle. The extent of sensory changes, pain scores, and opioid consumption were analyzed.A total of 10 patients ( pTAP blocks) met the inclusion criteria. The mean (sd; range) age and  were  years (5 years; range 7-20 years) and 57 kg (21 kg; 27-97 kg), respectively. The cephalad dermatome levels achieved were: T7 in 6/ (40%); T8 in 10/ (67%); and T9 in 14/ (93%). An inferior dermatome level of T12/L1 and sensory extension from midaxillary line to the midline was documented in / blocks. The mean intraoperative and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) opioid consumption in morphine equivalents were .34 mg·kg (sd = .12 mg·kg ) and .04 mg·kg (sd = .05 mg·kg ), respectively. PACU pain scores were mild (<4) in 60%, moderate (4-7) in 30%, and severe (>7) in 10% of patients. No complications were reported.The current uncertainty regarding sensory blockade limits the clinical application of TAP blocks. While the midaxillary approach results in unpredictable sensory changes of the abdomen, we reliably achieved sensory changes up to a T9 level in 93% of the blocks.In this small series of patients, we demonstrate a high technical success rate of achieving cutaneous analgesia to the abdominal wall. These results should encourage clinical studies of the efficacy of this block for abdominal surgery in pediatric patients.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330262>Evaluation of dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence imaging of colorectal tumours with a high-sensitivity CMOS imager: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>It is important to devise efficient and easy methods of detecting colorectal tumours to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer. Dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence intensity can be used to visualize colorectal tumours. Therefore, we evaluated dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence images of colorectal tumours obtained with a newly developed, high-sensitivity complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager.A total 107 colorectal tumours (44 adenomas, 43 adenocarcinomas with intramucosal invasion, and 20 sessile serrated adenoma/polyps [SSA/]) in 98 patients who underwent endoscopic tumour resection were included. The specimens were irradiated with excitation light at 365 nm and 405 nm, and autofluorescence images measured with a 475 ± 25-nm band pass filter were obtained using a new, high-sensitivity CMOS imager. Ratio images (F365ex/F405ex) were created to evaluate the lesion brightness compared with that of normal mucosa, and specimens were categorized into a no signal or high signal group.Adenomas and adenocarcinomas were depicted in 87 ratio images, with 86.2% (n = 75) in the High signal group. SSA/P was depicted in 20 ratio images, with 70.% (n = 14) in the High signal group.Dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence images of colorectal tumours can be acquired using our high-sensitivity CMOS imager, and are useful in detecting colorectal tumours.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27282074>High wholegrain barley β-glucan lowers food intake but does not alter small intestinal macronutrient digestibility in ileorectostomised rats.</a></h2><p>Using barley cultivars differing widely in β-glucan content, we aimed to determine their effects on small intestinal macronutrient digestion in 24 ileorectostomised rats.

In order to obtain the phase-separated domains with nanoscale size, a liquid prepolymer of cross-linkable polysiloxane was employed as one moiety for increasing the miscibility of the polymer blend. After phase separation via spin-coating, the dispersed domains of liquid polysiloxane with sub-50 nm size could be solidified by UV exposure. The solidified polysiloxane domains took the role of etching mask for formation of high aspect ratio nanopillars by O reactive ion etching (RIE). The aspect ratio of the nanopillars could be further amplified by introduction of a polymer transfer layer underneath the polymer blend film. The effects of spin speeds, the  ratio of the polysiloxane/ blend, and the concentration of polysiloxane/ blend in toluene on the characters of the nanopillars were investigated. The gold-coated nanopillar arrays exhibited a high Raman scattering enhancement factor in the range of 10-10 with high uniformity across over the wafer scale sample. A superhydrophobic surface could be realized by coating a self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of fluoroalkyltrichlorosilane on the nanopillar arrays. Sub-50 nm silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with high aspect ratio of about 1000 were achieved by using the nanopillars as etching mask through a metal-assisted chemical etching process.

Rats with mild or no detectable  features on rotenone showed slight (mean .853+/-.192) but insignificantly increased activity. Rats that had moderately severe  features had higher level of NMT activity (mean 1.223+/-.057), which was borderline significant compared to controls (P=.066). Rats with severe  features had the highest NMT activity (1.353+/-.128) which was significantly greater compared to controls (P=.003) and to the rats that had equivocal or no motor slowing (P=.005).

The aim of this work was to design topical MTX loaded niosomes for management of psoriasis to avoid systemic toxicity. To achieve this goal, MTX niosomes were prepared by thin film hydration technique. A Box-Behnken (BB) design, using Design-Expert(®) software, was employed to statistically optimize formulation variables. Three independent variables were evaluated: MTX concentration in hydration medium (X1), total  of niosomal components (X2) and surfactant: cholesterol ratio (X3). The encapsulation efficiency percent (Y1: EE%) and particle size (Y2: ) were selected as dependent variables. The optimal formulation (F12) displayed spherical morphology under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optimum particle size of 1375.00 nm and high EE% of 78.66%. In-vivo skin deposition study showed that the highest value of percentage drug deposited (22.45%) and AUC0-10 (1. mg.h/cm(2)) of MTX from niosomes were significantly greater than that of drug solution (13.87% and .49 mg.h/cm(2), respectively).

In this study, the rhenium compound Re(dcbyp)(CO)3NCS (Re-NCS), which served as a model CO2 reduction catalyst, was investigated using two dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. The vibrational relaxation dynamics and rotational dynamics of Re-NCS were measured by monitoring both the CO and NCS vibrational modes. The rotational dynamics measurement of the CO vibrational stretch shows a single exponential decay with a time constant of 140 ± 10 . In contrast, a bi-exponential decay is needed to describe the rotational dynamics of the NCS stretching mode with time constants of 1.5 ± .3  and 189 ±  . The 2D IR experiment indicated that the carbonyl CO vibrational modes in Re-NCS are strongly coupled. Furthermore, the intramolecular vibrational  transfer between CO and NCS stretching modes was observed and analyzed based on an  exchange model. The  down flowing transfer from CN to CO stretching mode was determined using time constants of 50 . The relatively slow intramolecular vibrational  transfer rate suggests that there is a weak coupling between CO and NCS ligands. Further theoretical calculation showed that the coupling strength between CO and CN is relatively weak and is about 5-6 times smaller than the coupling strength between the CO vibrational modes in Re-NCS. The distinct structural dynamics of the NCS ligand in Re-NCS presented in this study should provide a fundamental understanding of the role of an anionic ligand in rhenium photo-catalysts, which is believed to play an important role in the photo-catalytic reduction of CO2.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26726437>Photodynamic Anticancer Activity of CoFe2O4 Nanoparticles Conjugated with Hematoporphyrin.</a></h2><p>This work reports the synthesis and the characterization of water-soluble and biocompatible photosensitizer ()-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles composed of a cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) magnetic core coated with a biocompatible hematoporphyrin (HP) shell.

Neutrophils from healthy volunteers exposed to heterologous normal plasma samples exhibited 10.3 +/- 1.2% apoptosis.

Univariate and multivariate survival analysis were performed to identify the factors correlated with overall survival.Applying cut-offs of ≥ 660 (SII), ≥ 3.57 (NLR), ≥ 147 (PLR), ≤ 52.95 (PNI), SII ≥ 660 was significantly correlated with worse ECOG  (< .001), higher T stage (< .001), advanced clinical stage (p = .019), and lower response rate (p = .018). In univariate analysis, SII ≥ 660, NLR ≥ 3.57, PLR ≥ 147, and PNI ≤ 52.95 were significantly associated with worse overall survival (p  < .001). Patients with SII ≥ 660 had a median overall survival of 10 months, and patients with SII < 660 showed a median overall survival of 30 months.

Factors, including age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (), histological confirmation, tumor size, tumor location, biliary drainage, stage, induction chemotherapy, CRP levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, albumin and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were evaluated with regard to overall survival (OS) and patterns of failure using a Cox proportional hazards model.The 1-year OS and median follow-up for all of the patients were 63.9% and .2 months, respectively. The median survival time and 1-year OS were 18. months and 72.5%, respectively, in the patients with lower CRP levels (≤3. mg/L), whereas 11. months and 30.8%, respectively, in the patients with higher CRP levels (>3. mg/L). Thirty-seven patients had tumor recurrence after CRT. All of the patients with higher CRP levels developed distant metastases as a primary sign of treatment failure. In a multivariate analysis, higher CRP levels were significantly correlated with distant disease-free survival (p = .004, HR = 4.50) and OS (p = .004, HR = 3.001). By contrast, local progression-free survival was not significantly different between the CRP subgroups.The CRP levels were a significant predictor of survival and distant disease control for the LAPC patients who received CRT.Copyright © 2015 IAP and EPC.

The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle is unable to produce either EPA or DHA. Escherichia coli Nissle was transformed with the pfBS- plasmid carrying the EPA/DHA gene cluster, previously isolated from a marine bacterium. The transgenic E. coli Nissle produced EPA when grown at 10ºC (16.52 ± 1.4 mg g(-1) cell dry ), ºC (31.36 ± .25 mg g(-1) cell dry ), 20ºC (13.71 ± 2.8 mg g(-1) cell dry ), 25ºC (11.33 ± .44 mg g(-1) cell dry ) or 30ºC (.668 ± .073 mg g(-1) cell dry ). Although DHA was also produced at all these temperatures, it comprised less than .2% of total extracted fatty acids. Transcriptomic analysis using Reverse Transcription qPCR showed upregulation of the entire gene cluster in E. coli Nissle. Among EPA/DHA genes, pfaB, pfaC and pfaD were overexpressed (expression ratio of 181.9, 39.86 and 131.61, respectively) as compared to pfaA (expression ratio of 3.40) and pfaE (expression ratio of 4.05). The EPA/DHA-producing probiotic E. coli Nissle may be used as a safe, alternative and economic source for the industrial and pharmaceutical production of EPA and DHA.© FEMS 2015.

The feasibility of this technique has been demonstrated with low-molecular- compounds, macromolecular dyes, and proteins. Delivery of antisense oligonucleotides into the brain parenchyma represents an additional potential application of this technique not previously described. In this report, the authors examined the distribution and disposition of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (-ODN) infused for this reason. An 18-mer (35)S--ODN (molecular  approximately 6000) was infused over 1 hour into the caudate putamen of Fischer 344 rats. At 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after beginning the infusion, the brains were extracted and analyzed using quantitative autoradiographic techniques. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also aspirated from the cisterna magna and analyzed for radioactivity and stability of the (35)S--ODN. At 1 hour, the infused ODN was uniformly distributed in brain tissue, with a maximum average concentration of 4806.5 +/- 210.5 nCi/g. This represents a tissue concentration of 19.2 +/- .84 microM. Extensive spread into surrounding parenchyma was observed over the ensuing 47 hours. The (35)S--ODN radioactivity peaked in the CSF at the end of the 1-hour infusion, containing 10% (50 +/- 20 nCi) of the infused radioactivity. Activity then decayed exponentially over 11 hours, stabilizing at a lower CSF content of .2% (1 +/- .1 nCi). The volume of distribution (V(d)) was 105 +/- 7.9 mm3 at 1 hour, representing a ratio of V(d)/V(i) (volume of infusion) of 5.2. The V(d) increased to 443.4 +/- 62.3 mm(3) at the end of 48 hours, whereas the average minimum tissue concentration decreased from .2 to 3.2 microM. Undegraded 18-mer was seen throughout the 48-hour period using 20% polyacrylamide/7M urea gel electrophoresis. The animals tolerated the infusion without evidence of toxicity, and minimal structural changes in tissue were observed on histological examination. Thus, -ODN can be safely delivered in high concentrations to wide areas of the rat brain by using high-flow microinfusion, and the concentrations remain stable even after 48 hours in situ.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27070307>Does Whole-Body Hypothermia in Neonates with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Affect Surfactant Disaturated-Phosphatidylcholine Kinetics?</a></h2><p>It is unknown whether Whole-Body Hypothermia (WBH) affects pulmonary function.

The pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and its metabolites were characterized using both traditional noncompartmental analysis and population pharmacokinetics using NONMEM VI; pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic relationships of SN-38 with indices of toxicity were also evaluated.11 patients between 3 and 18 years were enrolled. Pharmacokinetic parameters and consideration of relevant covariates (performance status (), BSA, corrected body  (CBW), exponent of 3/4 on , etc.) were evaluated. Relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters of SN-38 and percentage change from baseline in patient biochemical response data were investigated via regression analysis.CPT-11 exhibited a mean clearance (CL) of .31 +/- 5.95 (l/h) (13.06 +/- 3.58 (l/hr/m(2))) and AUC(-inf) of 3547. +/- 1406.5 (ng x h/ml); the AUC ratio of parent CPT-11 to SN-38 was 5.%. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, decreasing  was significantly dependent on reduction in CL of CPT-11 (p < .001). The final model for CPT-11 are as follows: CL (l/h) = 1.31 x CBW(.75) (omegaCL = 21.7%), Vss (l) = 2.66 x CBW (omegaVss = 21.2%), Vc (l) = 1.13 x CBW, inter-compartment CL (l/h) = .257 x CBW(.75).

This assay has been compared with the classic method using polyclonal antibodies to protein S (ELISA-p). The latter method has the drawback of requiring PEG precipitation of plasma which is time-consuming, difficult to perform with accuracy and therefore poorly reproducible in most laboratories. Results of both ELISAs were compared with those of a functional assay. In 30 normal subjects, there was an excellent correlation between ELISA-m and ELISA-p (r = .95) as well as between ELISA-m and the functional assay (r = .96). In twelve patients with a congenital deficiency, the levels of free protein S antigen were similarly decreased with ELISA-m and ELISA-p and in good agreement with those of protein S activity. In 20 patients with miscellaneous inflammatory diseases, the levels of free proteins S were normal with good correlation between both ELISAs and  activity, despite high levels of C4bBP-protein S complexes. As expected, in  dicoumarol-treated patients, there was a significant and parallel decrease of free protein S antigen with both ELISAs, with even lower levels of protein S activity.

These studies were designed to determine whether PJ34, a novel ultrapotent inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) could modulate neurologic injury after thoracic aortic ischemia reperfusion (TAR) in a murine model of SCI.Forty-one anesthetized male mice were subject to thoracic aortic occlusion (11 minutes) through a cervical mediastinotomy followed by 48 hours of reperfusion (TAR) under normothermic conditions. PJ34-treated mice (PJ, n = 12) were given 10 mg/kg PJ34 intraperitoneally 1 hour before ischemia and 1 hour after unclamping.

Reversal potentials derived from whole patch currents indicated that the inner mitochondrial membrane was primarily cation selective at pH 6.8 with a PK/PCl = 32 (n = 6). Treatment with alkaline pH (8.3) increased the current and anion permeability (PK/PCl = 16, n = 6). The membrane becomes completely cation selective when low concentrations (12 microM) of the drug propranolol are added. The amphiphilic drugs amiodarone (4 microM), propranolol (70 microM) and quinine (.6 mM) blocked almost all of the current. The pH-dependent current was also inhibited by tributyltin.

CYP2C19 polymorphism exhibits marked ethnic heterogeneity. Objective To determine the prevalence of CYP2C19 *2 and *3 alleles in a cohort of Palestinian patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention and dual antiplatelet therapy, and to determine their role in causing major adverse cardiac events. Setting The blood samples were collected at the European Gaza Hospital, and the molecular techniques performed at the molecular genetics laboratory of the Islamic university of Gaza. Method The frequency of CYP2C19 *2 and *3 alleles was determined in 110 patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention and clopidogrel. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. Personal and clinical data was obtained from patient record and 6-month follow-up for major adverse cardiac events. Main outcome measureCYP2C19 genotype, personal and clinical data and incidence of major adverse cardiac events. Results The frequency of CYP2C19 *1, *2 and *3 alleles was 82.3%, .5% and 2.3% respectively. Genotyping analysis showed that, 67.3% were homozygotes for CYP2C19 *1, 27.3% were *1/*2, 2.7% with *1/*3 genotype, 1.8% were *2/*3 and .9% were *2/*2. These frequencies were consistent with those of Caucasian populations. According to this study the poor metabolizers phenotype frequency was 2.7%, which is in the same range reported in Caucasians (2-5%) and lower than Oriental populations 13-23%. A strong significant relation was found between major adverse cardiac events and carrying the variant allele CYP2C19 *2 (P = .001). On the other hand, there was no significant relation between major adverse cardiac events and carrying the variant allele CYP2C19 *3 (P = .324). Conclusion The CYP2C19 *2 allele is relatively common in our population, and its associated reduced metabolic activity deserves attention as it leads to an increased incidence of major adverse cardiac events in the follow-up of patients receiving clopidogrel.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722112>Enzymatic characterization of an active NDH complex from Thermosynechococcus elongatus.</a></h2><p>Although type-1 NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex subunit constituents and physiological functions have been reported in plants and cyanobacteria, the biochemical properties of this enzyme are not clear.

Position-specific body composition values in female collegiate rugby union athletes. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Rugby union is a full-contact, intermittent team sport. Anthropometric characteristics of rugby union athletes have been shown to influence suitability for a given position and affect performance. However, little anthropometric data exist in female rugby union athletes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to report position-specific anthropometric, body composition, and bone density values in female collegiate rugby union athletes and to identify between-position differences in these variables. This investigation was a cross-sectional study involving 101 female collegiate rugby union athletes, categorized as forwards and backs as well as by position (props, hookers, locks, flankers, number 8 forwards, halfback, fly-half, centers, wings, and fullbacks). Anthropometric characteristics of all athletes were measured, and body composition was assessed via dual- x-ray absorptiometry. Outcome variables included age, height, body mass, BMI, body fat percentage, fat mass (FM), FM index, fat-free mass (FFM), FFM index, lean soft tissue, bone mineral content, bone mineral area, and bone mineral density. Anthropometric and body composition differences between forwards and backs were identified via independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, depending on normality of the variable. Between-position differences were assessed using one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons or Welch's ANOVA with Dunnett's T3 post-hoc test. Significant differences (p < .014) were identified between forwards and backs for every anthropometric variable, with forwards displaying greater height (167.7 ± 7.2 cm), body mass (81.5 ± .1 kg), and body fat percentage (28.2 ± 6.1%) relative to backs (164.5 ± 5.1 cm; 64.5 ± 7.7 kg; 21.9 ± 3.7%). Likewise, significant differences were identified for every anthropometric variable between several positions (p < .01). Significant (p < .05) interposition differences were identified within the subgroup of forwards, but not within the subgroup of backs. The present investigation is the first to report position-specific anthropometric and body composition data in female collegiate rugby union athletes. The results of this study can be used by rugby union coaches for recruiting and personnel decisions, to determine a player's suitability for a given position, and to further inform training and nutritional interventions in this population.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26584979>Ultrasound and heat enhanced persulfate oxidation activated with Fe() aggregate for the decolorization of C.I. Direct Red 23.</a></h2><p>Effluents from the paper printing and textile industries are often heavily contaminated with azo dyes. Azo dyes are difficult to oxidize biologically. This work investigated the decolorization of an azo dye, C.I. Direct Red 23 (DR23), by persulfate () activated with Fe() aggregates (/Fe()). Ultrasound (US) and heat were used as enhancement tools in the  oxidation system. Neither US-activated  nor thermally activated  was effective in oxidizing DR23. However, the decolorization was significantly enhanced by /Fe() combined with US (/Fe()/US) or heat (/Fe()/55 °C). Approximately 95% decolorization of 1×10(-4) M DR23 was achieved within  min in the /Fe()/US system at an initial pH of 6.,  of 5×10(-3) M, Fe() of .5 g/L and US irradiation of 106 W/cm(2) (60 kHz). Complete decolorization was achieved within 10 min in the Fe()//55 °C system. The rate of decolorization doubled when US was introduced in the /Fe() system during the treatment of different initial dye concentrations. The dependence of dye and true color (ADMI) depletion on  concentration has been discussed. DR23 was completely degraded based on the disappearance of aromatic groups of UV-vis spectra and the variation of TOC mineralization. The observed pseudo-first-order decolorization rate was substantially enhanced by increasing temperature. The Arrhenius activation  for the  activated with Fe() was estimated as 8.98 kcal/mol, implying that higher temperature is beneficial for the DR23 decolorization. The addition of US into the /Fe() system did not incur a substantial increase in electricity, whereas the mineralization of DR23 occurred quickly. Thus, both /Fe()/US and heated /Fe() systems are practically feasible for the effective degradation of the direct azo dye in textile wastewater.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most of these early studies were done using loading methods not currently in favor, and using non-murine species. Our objective was to re-examine the effects of several loading parameters on the response of cortical bone using the contemporary murine axial tibial compression model. We subjected tibias of 5-month old, female C57Bl/6 mice to cyclic (4 Hz) mechanical loading and examined bone formation responses using dynamic and static histomorphometry. First, using a reference protocol of 1,200 cycles/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks, we confirmed the significant influence of peak strain magnitude on periosteal mineralizing surface (.MS/BS) and bone formation rate (.BFR/BS) (p < .05, ANOVA). There was a significant induction of periosteal lamellar bone at a lower threshold of approx. -1,000 μϵ and a transition from lamellar-woven bone near -2,000 μϵ. In contrast, on the endocortical surface, bone formation indices did not exhibit a load magnitude-dependent response and no incidence of woven bone. Next, we found that reducing daily cycle number from 1,200 to 300 to 60 did not diminish the bone formation response (p > .05). On the other hand, reducing the daily frequency of loading from 5 consecutive days/week to 3 alternate days/week significantly diminished the periosteal response, from a loading-induced increase in .MS/BS of 38% (loaded vs. control) for 5 days/week to only % for 3 days/week (p < .05). Finally, we determined that reducing the study duration from 2 to 1 weeks of loading did not affect bone formation outcomes. In conclusion, cyclic loading to -1,800 μϵ peak strain, at 4 Hz and 60 cycles/day for 5 consecutive days (1 week) induces an increase in periosteal lamellar bone formation with minimal incidence of woven bone in 5-month-old C57Bl/6 female mice. Our results provide a basis for reduction of loading duration (daily cycles and study length) without loss of anabolic effect as measured by dynamic histomorphometry. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Urine collected immediately before and 2, 4, and 6 h after the meal was analyzed for metabolomics, a secondary outcome of the clinical study. We used mixed-effect models, partial least-square regression, and pathway enrichment analysis.At 4 and 6 h after the meal, the postprandial metabolome was found to be fully discriminated according to protein type. We identified 17 metabolites that significantly explained the effect of protein type on postprandial metabolomic changes (protein-time interaction). Among this signature, acylcarnitines and other acylated metabolites related to fatty acid or amino acid oxidation were the main discriminant features. The difference in metabolic profiles was mainly explained by urinary acylcarnitines and some other acylated products (protein type,  < .0001), with a dramatically greater increase (100- to 1000-fold) after WHE, and to a lesser extent after LAC, as compared with CAS. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed that the type of protein had modified fatty acid oxidation (P < .05).Taken together, our results indicate that, in healthy overweight men, the type of protein in a high-fat meal interplays with fatty acid oxidation with a differential accumulation of incomplete oxidation products.

Curcumin holds the potential for α-synuclein clearance to treat PD; however, its applications are still limited due to its low bioavailability and poor permeability through the BBB in a free form.  Herein, this paper fabricated curcumin-loaded polysorbate 80-modified cerasome (CPC) nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean diameter of ~110 nm for enhancing the localized curcumin delivery into the targeted brain nuclei via effective BBB opening in combination with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD).  The liposomal nanohybrid cerasome exhibited superior stability towards  80 surfactant solubilization and longer circulation lifetime (t = 6.22 h), much longer than free curcumin (t = .76 h). The permeation was found to be 1.7-fold higher than that of CPC treatment only at 6 h after the systemic administration of CPC NPs. Notably, motor behaviors, dopamine (DA) level and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression all returned to normal, thanks to α-synuclein (AS) removal mediated by efficient curcumin delivery to the striatum. Most importantly, the animal experiment demonstrated that the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice had notably improved behavior disorder and dopamine depletion during two-week post-observation after treatment with CPC NPs ( mg curcumin/kg) coupled with UTMD.  This novel CPC-UTMD formulation approach could be an effective, safe and amenable choice with higher therapeutic relevance and fewer unwanted complications than conventional chemotherapeutics delivery systems for PD treatment in the near future.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21736326>Effect of fullerene intercalation on the conformation and packing of poly-(2-methoxy-5-(3'-7'-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene).</a></h2><p>Photoluminescence (PL) and resonance Raman spectroscopy are used to track changes in the conformations and packing of poly-(2-methoxy-5-(3'-7'-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MDMO-PPV) chains with the addition of [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) molecules. PL lineshapes of MDMO-PPV thin films as a function of annealing time were first measured to determine the spectroscopic signatures of chain conformations and packing in the absence of PCBM. Annealing results in enhanced interchain interactions leading to red-shifts of PL - transitions by up to ∼300 cm(-1) and apparent increases of the line shape Huang-Rhys factors. Wavelength-dependent PL lifetimes of as-cast and films annealed for short times (∼30 s) are nonexponential with an instrument-limited component of ∼100  and a ∼350  component. With longer annealing times, decays become single exponential with an average lifetime of ∼1 ns indicating that all excitations efficiently funnel to strongly coupled interchain sites. Addition of PCBM disrupts MDMO-PPV interchain interactions causing PL - transitions to blue-shift, increases in line width, and decreases in apparent Huang-Rhys factors. Resonance Raman spectra of MDMO-PPV/PCBM thin films with variable PCBM  fractions (∼50:1 up to 1:8 w/w) were then measured using short (488 nm) and long (568 nm) excitation wavelengths. The out-of-plane vinylene C-H wag mode of MDMO-PPV (∼964 cm(-1)) showed pronounced increases in intensity of up to ∼30% and red-shifts of up to 5 cm(-1) with increasing PCBM content. These changes result from a decrease of planarity between chain segments that suppresses interchain interactions. Furthermore, red-shifts of up to ∼4 cm(-1) were observed for the C═C symmetric stretch of the MDMO-PPV vinylene group (∼1625 cm(-1)) with 488 nm excitation. The sensitivity of the MDMO-PPV vinylene group vibrations with PCBM indicates preferential interactions between these two molecules and is consistent with intercalation of PCBM into the polymer structure. This assignment was confirmed by thermally annealing of MDMO-PPV/PCBM films to remove intercalated PCBM molecules, which partially restores interchain interactions as seen from smaller intensity increases (∼%) and red-shifts (∼2 cm(-1)) of the ∼964 cm(-1) mode. Overall, the spectroscopic results show that MDMO-PPV chains adopt distorted conformations (i.e., less intrachain order and shorter conjugation lengths) that have important implications for explaining the structural origins for large improvements in charge mobilities in MDMO-PPV/PCBM blends.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17905505>Toxicological evaluation of potassium sorbate added to cigarette tobacco.</a></h2><p>Potassium sorbate () may be incorporated in blended cigarette tobacco either as a mold growth inhibitor in processed tobacco sheet material, or as a preservative in flavor systems or paper adhesives.

One of the 31 blocks of cheese was selected at random for analysis before brine salting (i.e., on d ). The remaining 30 blocks were randomly divided into 2 groups of  blocks each; one group was placed in 18% brine (18%B) and the other group was placed in saturated brine (SB). For the  blocks within each of the 2 brine concentrations (BC), 5 blocks were placed in a brine tank at 12 degrees C, 5 at  degrees C, and 5 at 18 degrees C, and submerged for 24 d. The research objective was to determine the combined impacts (i.e., interactions) of  the curd before stretching, BC (SB vs. 18%B), and brine temperature (BT; 12, , and 18 degrees C) on salt uptake, moisture content, and yield of Ragusano cheese. Although BC, BT, and  each had their own separate impacts on salt uptake, there was little interaction of these effects on salt uptake when they were used in combination. The  most quickly delivered salt to the interior of the cheese and was the most effective approach to salting for controlling early gas formation. There were strong separate impacts of BC, BT, and  on cheese moisture content, moisture loss, and net  loss, with BC having the largest separate impact on these parameters. Reducing BT reduced salt content and increased moisture, but the effects were small. The more important effect of reduced BT was to reduce growth of gas forming bacteria. The 18%B produced higher moisture, and less moisture and  loss than SB. The effect of interactions of BC, BT, and  on moisture loss and net  loss were small. To achieve the maximum benefit from the various approaches to salting for controlling early gas formation in Ragusano cheese,  combined with slightly lower BT (i.e.,  degrees C instead of 18 degrees C) should be used. Although using 18%B instead of SB did increase salt uptake, the point at which improved salt uptake occurred due to use of 18%B did not provide benefit in prevention of early gas formation, as reported separately. However, use of 18%B instead of SB provided a 9.98% increase in cheese yield due to reduced moisture loss during brining; this would be very attractive to cheese makers.

In the reported experiments, SAv coated Polystyrene () particles are deposited on a layer of Bi.PEG receptors, bound to a silicon (Si) substrate by silanization. The substrate and the bonded particles are subjected to a pulsed ultrasonic excitation field and their nanometer scale out-of-plane dynamic responses are acquired using a laser vibrometer. The acquired waveforms are processed to obtain the resonance frequencies of the particle motion. Employing a particle adhesion model, the average spring constant of the single ligand-receptor complex and the effective Young's modulus and work-of-adhesion of the SAv-Bi.PEG ligand-receptor layer are extracted from the resonance frequencies. The average spring constant of an individual SAv-Bi.PEG bond is approximated as .1-.4 mN/m.

Reliability and validity of a pool-based maximal  uptake test to examine high-intensity short-duration freestyle swimming performance. J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1208-1215, 2019-A modality-specific swimming protocol to assess maximal  uptake (V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw) is essential to accurately prescribe and monitor swimming conditioning programs. Consequently, there is a need for a reliable and valid graded intensity swimming pool test to accurately assess V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw using indirect calorimetry. The purpose of this study was to assess (a) reliability of an intensity self-regulated swimming pool test of V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw and (b) validity of a V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw test using performance swim () time as the criterion. Twenty-nine men (n = ) and women (n = 14) (age, 23 ± 6.4 years; body mass index, 23.5 ± 3. kg·m) performed 2 swimming pool V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw trials (V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw A and V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw B), and 2  tests (45.7 m [31.20 ± 4.5 seconds] and 182 m [159.2 ± 25.5 seconds]). For test-retest reliability (trials A vs. B), strong correlations (p < .05) were found for V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw (ml·kg·min) (r = .899), O2 pulse (ml O2·beat) (r = .833), and maximum expired ventilatory volume (L·min) (r = .785). For performance validity, moderately strong correlations (p < .05) were found between V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw A and 45.7-m (r = -.543) and 182-m (r = -.486) swim times. The self-regulated graded intensity swimming pool protocol examined presently is a reliable and valid test of V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw.

However, its efficacy when compared to HD-DDP + RT has been questioned. At our institution, low-dose weekly carboplatin is added to Cx + RT for patients unsuitable for HD-DDP.We reviewed records of 16 patients with LA-HNSCC treated with definitive Cx + carboplatin + RT at the University of Miami from 2007 to 2011. Median follow-up was 24 months (range: 1-69 months).Median age: 71.5 years (range: 57-90 years);  male, 1 female. ECOG   = , 1 = 1. TNM staging was: T 1 = 1, T 2 = 5, T 3 = 8, T 4 = 2; N stage: N  = 8, N 1 = 5, N 2a = 2, N 2b = 1. All patients received weekly carboplatin (AUC 1.5-2), Cx given conventionally and daily conventionally fractionated RT. Median total weeks of concurrent systemic therapy = 7 (range: 3-8 weeks). RT was delivered to a median total dose of 70 Gy (range 30-74 Gy). Of the  evaluable patients, there were: 12 CR, 2 PR, and 1 PD. There were three local in-field failures, two regional failures, and three distant failures. At last follow-up, 8/ patients remained with NED. Three-year locoregional recurrence was 28.3% (95% CI: 7.7-53.9%). Mean percentage of  loss was 14% (range: 6-26%). Two patients required systemic therapy dose reduction. Three patients experienced a treatment delay and three did not finish RT as planned including a patient who received only 30 Gy due to death secondary to MI during treatment.In this small retrospective series, carboplatin/Cx/RT was well-tolerated and efficacious in patients unsuitable for HD-DDP having LA-HNSCC. Acute toxicities were similar to Cx + RT, likely due to the non-overlapping toxicity profiles of the two systemic agents. We hypothesize that the addition of a well-tolerated cytotoxic chemotherapy agent may improve the therapeutic ratio of Cx + RT in patients who are poor candidates for more aggressive therapies and warrants evaluation in a prospective manner.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378660>Clinical activity of nivolumab in patients with non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Nivolumab is approved for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) refractory to prior antiangiogenic therapy.

A retrospective analysis including patient characteristics, objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was undertaken.Forty-one patients were identified. Median age was 58 years (33-82), 71% were male, and majority had ECOG   (40%) or 1 (47%). Histology included 16 papillary, 14 unclassified, 5 chromophobe, 4 collecting duct, 1 Xp11 translocation and 1 MTSCC (mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma). Among 35 patients who were evaluable for best response, 7 (20%) had PR and 10 (29%) had SD. Responses were observed in unclassified, papillary and collecting duct subtypes. In the entire cohort, median follow-up was 8.5 months and median treatment duration was 3. months. Median PFS was 3.5 months and median OS was not reached. Among responders, median time to best response was 5.1 months, and median duration of response was not reached as only 2 out of 7 responders had disease progression during follow-up. TRAEs of any grade were noted in 37% and most commonly included fatigue (12%), fever (10%) and rash (10%). Nivolumab treatments were postponed in 34% and discontinued in % of patients due to intolerance. No treatment-related deaths were observed.Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated objective responses and was well tolerated in a heterogeneous population of patients with non-clear cell mRCC.

The data source was the Helping to Outline Paediatric Eating Disorders (HOPE) Project, a prospective ongoing registry study comprising consecutive pediatric tertiary eating disorder referrals. Adolescents (N=104; 12-17years) with eating disorders completed the CET and other measures. Factor structure, convergent validity, and internal consistency were evaluated. Despite failing to identify a factor structure, the study provided clear evidence of the multidimensionality of the measure. The total score correlated significantly with measures of eating pathology, perfectionism, and frequency of exercise for shape and  control (r=.32-.70, <.05). More research into the multidimensional nature of compulsive exercise in clinical populations is needed.

In the present study we describe the synthesis and aPDI testing of a set of derivatives prepared from the parent pheophytin molecule with different numbers of attached side arms (1-3) each consisting of five quaternized cationic groups (pentacationic), producing the corresponding [Zn2+]pheophorbide-a-N(C2N+C1C3)5 (Zn-Phe-N5+, 5 charges), [Zn2+]chlorin e6-[N(C2N+C1C3)5]2 (Zn-Chl-N10+, 10 charges) and [Zn2+]mesochlorin e6-[N(C2N+C1C3)5]3 (Zn-mChl-N15+,  charges). Moreover, a conjugate between Zn-Phe-N5+ and the antibiotic vancomycin called Van-[Zn2+]-m-pheophorbide-N(C2N+C1C3)5 (Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+) was also prepared. The aPDI activities of all compounds were based on Type-II photochemistry (1O2 generation). We tested these compounds against Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and the fungal yeast Candida albicans. All three compounds were highly active against MRSA, giving eradication (≥6 logs of killing) with <1. μM and 10 J cm-2 of 415 nm light. The order of activity was Zn-Phe-N5+ > Zn-Chl-N10+ > Zn-mChl-N15+. In the case of E coli the activity was much lower (eradication was only possible with 50 μM Zn-mChl-N15+ and 20 J cm-2). The order of activity was the reverse of that found with MRSA (Zn-mChl-N15+ > Zn-Chl-N10+ > Zn-Phe-N5+). Activity against C. albicans was similar to E. coli with Zn-mChl-N15+ giving eradication. The activity of Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+ was generally lower than that of Zn-Phe-N5+ (except for E. coli). Red (660 nm) light was also effective as might be expected from the absorption spectra. An initial finding that Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+ might have higher activity against vancomycin resistant Enterococcus fecium (VRE) strains (compared to vancomycin sensitive strains) was disproved when it was found that VRE strains were also more sensitive to aPDI with Zn-Phe-N5+. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+ were higher than those of Van alone, showing that the antibiotic properties of the Van moiety were lessened in the conjugate. In conclusion, Zn-Phe-N5+ is a highly active  against Gram-positive species and deserves further testing. Increasing the number of cationic charges increased aPDI efficacy on C. albicans and Gram-negative E. coli.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068018>Mono- and binuclear chiral N,N,O-scorpionate zinc alkyls as efficient initiators for the ROP of rac-lactide.</a></h2><p>The preparation of new chiral bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methane-based N,N,O-donor scorpionate ligands in the form of the alcohol compounds bpzampeH (1) {2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]ethanol}, bpzaepeH (2) {2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1-[4-(diethylamino)phenyl]ethanol}, and bpzimeH (3) {2,2-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1-[1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl]ethanol} has been carried out by the 1,2-addition reactions of a series of aldehydes. These new chiral heteroscorpionate ligands reacted with [ZnR] (R = Me, Et, CHSiMe) in a 1 : 1 molar ratio in toluene to give the mononuclear monoalkyl zinc complexes [Zn(R)(κ-NNO)] (4-12). When these reactions were carried out in a 1 : 2 molar ratio the binuclear trisalkyls [Zn(R)(κ-NNμ-O)Zn(R)] (13-18) were obtained. The structures of these complexes were elucidated by H and C{H} NMR spectroscopy and the X-ray crystal structures of 4 and 5 were also established. Interestingly, alkyl-containing zinc complexes 4-13,  and 17 act as efficient single-component initiators for the ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide at 20 °C to afford PLA materials with low molecular weights in a few hours. The dinuclear trisalkyls showed higher activity in comparison with the mononuclear zinc counterparts, suggesting a cooperative effect of the two remote metals. The narrow dispersity ranges (M/M = 1.05) of the isolated polymers in conjunction with the linear nature of the number average molecular  versus conversion plot provided evidence for living behavior. Inspection of the kinetic parameters showed that the propagations have the usual pseudo-first-order dependence on rac-lactide and catalyst concentration. End-group analysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed that the initiation occurs through nucleophilic attack of the alkyl on the lactide monomer.

With expanded  foam as the sole diet, the specific  consumption rates for T. obscurus and T. molitor at similar sizes (2. cm, 62-64 mg per larva) were 32.44 ± .51 and 24.30 ± 1.34 mg 100 larvae d, respectively. After 31 days, the molecular  ( M) of residual  in frass (excrement) of T. obscurus decreased by 26.03%, remarkably higher than that of T. molitor (11.67%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated formation of functional groups of intermediates and chemical modification. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested that T. obscurus larvae degraded  effectively based on the proportion of  residue. Co-fed corn flour to T. obscurus and wheat bran to T. molitor increased total  consumption by 11.6% and .2%, respectively. Antibiotic gentamicin almost completely inhibited  depolymerization. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant shifts in the gut microbial community in both Tenebrio species that were associated with the  diet and  biodegradation, with changes in three predominant families (Enterobacteriaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Enterococcaceae). The results indicate that  biodegradability may be ubiquitous within the Tenebrio genus which could provide a bioresource for plastic waste biodegradation.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790088>Cardiac surgery and inhaled nitric oxide: indication and follow-up (2-4 years).</a></h2><p>We studied the effect of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) on 80 patients who had undergone cardiac surgery in our center.

The expected survival range for patients with or without involvement of visceral pleura is respectively 1-9 and 9-12 months; mesothelioma-related pleural effusion severely impairs the patients' quality of life and easily relapses after conservative treatments. Intrapleural administration of IL-2 is reported to be effective both in tumor-associated malignant pleurisy and on primary mesothelioma, whereas few data exist about IL-2 systemic administration. In order to assess the palliative and therapeutic activity of IL-2 in unresectable pleural malignant mesothelioma with pleural effusion, we performed a phase II study on 31 consecutive patients (M/F 16/; median age 61 years, range 40-84;  ECOG  n=7; ECOG 1 n=; ECOG 2 n=9; stage IA n=13; IB n=9; II n=7; IV=2) who received first-line therapy with intrapleural repeated instillation of 9000000 I.U.

Toxicity (WHO criteria) with intrapleural IL-2 consisted of grade 3 fever in 6/31 (19%) patients and of cardiac toxicity (failure) grade 3 in one patient (3%); toxicity during subcutaneous treatment was mild to moderate, mainly a flu-like syndrome. In 28/31 (90%) of patients there was no further or minimal (asymptomatic) pleural fluid collection (according to Paladine criteria); pleurisy relapsed only in 1/28 patients after 19 months. Tumor objective response (WHO criteria), evaluated by CT, occurred in seven patients (one CR and six PR; ORR 22%); ten patients achieved SD and 14 patients progressed. Median overall survival was  months (range 5-39) in all patients. IL-2 intrapleural administration followed by low-dose IL-2 subcutaneously in pleurisy-complicated malignant mesothelioma is feasible and active both in palliation of pleural effusion and on primary tumor, with manageable toxicity.

In this study, a molecularly imprinted polymer was obtained by incorporating fluorescent nanodiamond into a creatinine-imprinted polyacrylamide hydrogel. The quenching of peak nanodiamond fluorescence was significantly higher in the creatinine-imprinted polymer compared to the non-imprinted polymer, indicative of higher creatinine affinity in the imprinted polymer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and microscopic imaging was used to investigate the nature of chemical bonding and distribution of nanodiamonds inside the hydrogel network. Nanodiamonds bind strongly to the hydrogel network, but as aggregates with average particle diameter of 3.4 ± 1.8 µm and 3.1 ± 1.9 µm for the non-imprinted and molecularly imprinted polymer, respectively. Nanodiamond fluorescence from nitrogen-vacancy color centers (NV and NV) was also used to detect creatinine based on nanodiamond-creatinine surface charge interaction. Results show a % decrease of NV/NV emission ratio for the creatinine-imprinted polymer compared to the non-imprinted polymer, and are explained in terms of changes in the near-surface band structure of diamond with addition of creatinine. With further improvement of sensor design to better disperse nanodiamond within the hydrogel, fluorescent sensing from nitrogen-vacancy centers is expected to yield higher sensitivity with a longer range (Coulombic) interaction to imprinted sites than that for a sensor based on acceptor/donor resonance  transfer.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118262>Permanent Atrial Fibrillation and 2 Year Clinical Outcomes in Patients with a Left Ventricular Assist Device Implant.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) may increase the risk of thromboembolic (TE) complications in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).

Subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had higher scores from previously validated NAFLD prediction models such as the hepatic steatosis index, comprehensive NAFLD score and NAFLD liver fat score. BARD and FIB-4 scores were used to define advanced fibrosis in subjects with NAFLD. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) [SMI(%)=total appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)/ (kg)×100] measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to diagnose sarcopaenia with cut points of 32.2% for men and 25.5% for women.SMI was inversely correlated with all NAFLD predicting scores (<.001).

To improve the stability, we synthesized silica-coated PQDs (SPQDs) by an improved ligand-assisted reprecipitation method through simply mixing and stirring under room temperature in air without adding water and catalyst, the whole process took only a few seconds. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the SPQDs can be tuned continuously from 460 to 662 nm via adjusting the composition proportion of precursors. The highest PL quantum yields (PLQYs) of blue-, green-, and red-emissive SPQDs are 56, 95, and 70%, respectively. The SPQDs show remarkably improved environmental and thermal stability compared to the naked PQDs because of effective barrier created by the coated silica between the core materials and the ambience. Furthermore, it is found that different light-emitting SPQDs can maintain their original PL properties after mixing of them and anion-exchange reactions have not happened.

Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), consisting of a blend of amorphous polymer and dielectric nanofillers, have been studied intensely to satisfy these goals; however, nanoparticle aggregates, field localization due to dielectric mismatch between particle and matrix, and the poorly understood role of interface compatibilization have challenged progress. To expand the understanding of the inter-relation between these factors and, thus, enable rational optimization of low and high contrast PNC dielectrics, we compare the dielectric performance of matrix-free hairy nanoparticle assemblies (aHNPs) to blended PNCs in the regime of low dielectric contrast to establish how morphology and interface impact energy storage and breakdown across different polymer matrices (polystyrene, , and poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and nanoparticle loadings (-50% (v/v) silica). The findings indicate that the route (aHNP versus blending) to well-dispersed morphology has, at most, a minor impact on breakdown strength trends with nanoparticle volume fraction; the only exception being at intermediate loadings of silica in PMMA (% (v/v)). Conversely, aHNPs show substantial improvements in reducing dielectric loss and maintaining charge/discharge efficiency. For example, low-frequency dielectric loss (1 Hz-1 kHz) of  and PMMA aHNP films was essentially unchanged up to a silica content of 50% (v/v), whereas traditional blends showed a monotonically increasing loss with silica loading. Similar benefits are seen via high-field polarization loop measurements where energy storage for ∼% (v/v) silica loaded PMMA and  aHNPs were 50% and 200% greater than respective comparable PNC blends. Overall, these findings on low dielectric contrast PNCs clearly point to the performance benefits of functionalizing the nanoparticle surface with high-molecular- polymers for polymer nanostructured dielectrics.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358151>L-Carnitine inhibits eryptosis induced by uremic serum and the related mechanisms.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether L-carnitine (LC) inhibits eryptosis induced by uremic serum and the related mechanism.One percent erythrocyte suspension was cultured by three kinds of mediums in vitro, which was included in the control group (Group C, phosphate buffered saline [PBS]), the uremic serum group (Group U, 30% uremic serum + 70% PBS) and the LC group (Group L, 30% uremic serum + 70% PBS + 200 umol/L LC), respectively.

While many studies have looked into the host genetic response to Salmonella infection, relatively few have used correlation of shedding traits with gene expression patterns to identify genes whose variable expression among different individuals may be associated with differences in Salmonella clearance and resistance. Here, we aimed to identify porcine genes and gene co-expression networks that differentiate distinct responses to Salmonella challenge with respect to faecal Salmonella shedding.Peripheral blood transcriptome profiles from 16 pigs belonging to extremes of the trait of faecal Salmonella shedding counts recorded up to 20 days post-inoculation (low shedders (LS), n = 8; persistent shedders (), n = 8) were generated using RNA-sequencing from samples collected just before (day ) and two days after (day 2) Salmonella inoculation. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of day  samples identified four modules of co-expressed genes significantly correlated with Salmonella shedding counts upon future challenge. Two of those modules consisted largely of innate  related genes, many of which were significantly up-regulated at day 2 post-inoculation. The connectivity at both days and the mean gene-wise expression levels at day  of the genes within these modules were higher in networks constructed using LS samples alone than those using  alone. Genes within these modules include those previously reported to be involved in Salmonella resistance such as SLC11A1 (formerly NRAMP1), TLR4, CD14 and CCR1 and those for which an association with Salmonella is novel, for example, SIGLEC5, IGSF6 and TNFSF13B.Our analysis integrates gene co-expression network analysis, gene-trait correlations and differential expression to provide new candidate regulators of Salmonella shedding in pigs.

Median overall survival (os) was 13.1 months (range .7-86.9+) in all. Tumor outcome consisted of: 9 CR (3%) (os = NR); 35 PR (13%) (os = 19.7 months.); 117 SD (44%) (os = .1 months); 105 PD (39%) (os = 6.4 months). Median lymphocyte counts were 1400/mm(3) at baseline (25th-75th, 900-1900/mm(3)) and 3600/mm(3) as a maximum value (25th-75th, 2600-4800/mm(3)). Death risk significantly decreased by 11% for each 1,000 lymphocytes/mm(3) (RR .89; 95% CI .82-.97), after correcting for clinical characteristics ( ECOG  versus > or =1, time from primary diagnosis > or =2 years versus <2 years, number of metastatic sites 1 versus >1) and tumor response (CR, PR). A two-step bootstrapping procedure confirmed such predictive performance. Lymphocyte count monitoring represents a biomarker of the host response to subcutaneous IL-2 treatment useful for multimodal clinical assessment, as it predicts overall survival in advanced cancer patients independently from tumor response and from main clinical characteristics.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16043262>Long term follow up and analysis of long term survivors in patients treated with paclitaxel-based concurrent chemo/radiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>For patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LANSCLC), concurrent chemotherapy/radiation therapy (RT) has become the standard of care. Three multi-institutional phase II studies with paclitaxel-based chemotherapeutic regimen given concurrently with RT for patients with LANSCLC were performed from March of 1994 to May of 1997. We sought to determine mature data from this database of patients, as well as to perform analysis of a cohort of patients who have achieved long term survival (LTS) when treated with this regimen.Database of these patients was analyzed retrospectively upon longer follow up, with median follow up for the three studies being 498 days (range 11-2905 days, average 780 days).  loss limitation for the three studies was liberal:  loss <10% and <% 3 months preceding diagnosis (LUN-27 and LUN-63, respectively), and no  loss limitation for LUN-56.The 4-year overall survival (OS) for the three trials was 16.3%, and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) was 25.7%. Statistical analysis of the long term survivors (OS > 4 years) was performed, and performance status () was found to be a significant factor predictive of LTS.  of  compared to 1 yielded a 2.5-fold increased likelihood of LTS (p = .04). There was also a trend (p = .067) for responders (complete or partial response) to yield a five-fold likelihood of LTS compared to non-responders (stable or progressive disease).Our results support the efficacy of combined modality therapy (CMT) for patients with LANSCLC even despite our more liberal  loss eligibility criteria.

A mixture of acetic, propionic, butyric, glycolic, lactic, 2-hydroxybutyric, malonic, succinic, glutaric, tartaric and citric acids was separated on a semi-rigid styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer-based H-type cation-exchange resin (ULTRON -80H) based on an ion exclusion chromatographic (IEC) mechanism, with detection using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Formic or acetic acid was used as a mobile phase to separate the carboxylic acids within  min. For liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), the ESI interface was used in both positive and negative ionization mode. ESI produced reasonable signals from positive ions, [M+NH(4)](+), of acetic, propionic and butyric acids and from negative ions, [M-H](-), of glycolic, lactic, 2-hydroxybutyric, malonic, succinic, glutaric, tartaric and citric acids. The effects of ionization parameters, source temperature, capillary voltage and cone voltage, on sensitivity and linearity were examined. Linear plots of peak area versus concentration were obtained over the range .1-20 ppm for MS detection. The detection limits of the target carboxylic acids calculated at signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3 ranged from 9 to 59 ppb.

Six hours following LPS or saline injection, cardiac geometry and function were evaluated in anesthetized mice using the 2-D guided M-mode echocardiography. Mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) properties were examined in hearts. Cell shortening and relengthening were assessed using the following indices: peak shortening ()-indicative of the amplitude a cell can shorten during contraction; maximal velocities of cell shortening and relengthening (± dl/dt)-indicative of peak ventricular contractility; time-to- (TPS)-indicative of systolic duration; time-to-90% relengthening (TR(90))-indicative of diastolic duration (90% rather 100% relengthening was used to avoid noisy signal at baseline concentration). The 360 nm excitation scan was repeated at the end of the protocol and qualitative changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration were inferred from the ratio of fura-2 fluorescence intensity (FFI) at two wavelengths (360/380). Fluorescence decay time was measured as an indicator of the intracellular Ca(2+) clearing rate. Glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and ROS generation were detected as the markers of oxidative stress.Heart rate was increased while EF was reduced in LPS-FVB mice and heart rate was reduced and EF increased in MT-LPS transgenic mice [(528 ± 72) beats/min vs (557 ± 69) beats/min, (66 ± 14)% vs (42 ± 10)%, P < .05].

Although trials comparing the two modalities are underway, most are being conducted using "conventional" PBT (passive scattering/uniform scanning [/US]) rather than pencil beam scanning (PBS). The dosimetric benefits of PBS are well-known, but comparative data are limited. This analysis compares PBS toxicity rates with those of /US in a prospective multicenter registry.We evaluated acute/late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity rates for men with low-to-intermediate risk PC enrolled in PCG 001-09. Acute toxicities with the two techniques were compared using χ tests, and the cumulative incidence methods for late toxicity. Multivariable analyses (MVAs) for acute toxicity were performed using logistic regression, and cox proportional hazards models for late toxicity.Patients were treated using /US (n = 1105) or PBS (n = 238). Acute grade ≥2 GI toxicity in PBS did not significantly differ from that with /US (2.9% and 2.1%, respectively; P = .47). Acute grade ≥2 GU toxicity was significantly higher with PBS (21.9% and .1%; P < .01). In MVA, PBS was significantly associated with increased acute grade ≥2 GU toxicity (RR = 1.57, p < .001).

The compounds were successfully characterised through UV-Vis, Emission, H NMR, and ESI-HRMS techniques. To evaluate the effect of this combination of directly conjugated and non-conjugated pyridyl/cationic pyridinium groups on the porphyrin macrocycle, the efficacy of the synthesised compounds was compared to a known standard 5,10,,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP). These compounds show better efficacy (IC's ranging between .66±.04μM to 3.71±1.01μM) against A549 (human epithelial adenocarcinoma lung cancer) cell line under in vitro photodynamic conditions in comparison to MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) (IC's ranging between 3.7±.087μM to 12.1±.12μM) and Pa-1 (ovarian cancer) (IC's ranging between 17.9±.01μM to 42.45±.02μM) cell lines. It was found that B.3, having a pyridinium group attached to the meso-position of the macrocycle along with three distal cationic pyridinium groups, independent of the porphyrinic electron delocalisation cycle, showed better photocytotoxic efficacy (IC=.66±.04μM, A549 lung cancer cell line) and higher potential to promote apoptosis and hence better efficacy as  towards cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT).

We examined the influence of maternal hypercholesterolemia and phytosterol () intervention on the concentration and  of oxysterols, bioactive oxygenated cholesterol derivatives that regulate arterial health and lesion progression, in mothers and their newly weaned offspring. Twenty-one female apoE mice were randomly assigned to three different diets throughout gestation and lactation: (1) chow, (2) high cholesterol (CH; .%) and (3) CH with added  (2%, CH/). At the end of the lactation period, mothers and pups were euthanized for serum and hepatic oxysterol analyses, hepatic transcriptional profiling of hepatic sterol regulatory targets and atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterolemic dams and their pups demonstrated increased (P˂.05) serum oxysterols [including 24 hydroxycholesterol (HC), 25HC, 27HC, 7αHC, 7βHC and 7 ketocholesterol)] compared with the chow group that were normalized by maternal  supplementation. Hepatic oxysterol concentrations followed a similar pattern of response in mothers but were not altered in newly weaned pups. Hepatic mRNA expression suggested a pattern of enhanced abca1/g1 high-density-lipoprotein-mediated efflux but a reduction in biliary abcg5/g8 export in both dams and their pups. Although arterial lesions were not apparent in newly weaned pups, CH dams demonstrated enhanced atherosclerosis that was reduced upon  intervention.

The mesoporous FeO is firstly prepared using polymeric micelles made of an asymmetric triblock copolymer poly(styrene-b-acrylic acid-b-ethylene glycol) (-b-PAA-b-PEG). Owing to its unique porous structure and large surface area (87. m g), the as-prepared mesoporous FeO can be loaded with a considerably higher amount of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) (7.9 wt%) compared to the commercial FeO powder (.8 wt%). Following the Au loading, the mesoporous FeO structure is still well-retained and Au NPs with varying sizes of 3-10 nm are dispersed throughout the mesoporous support. When evaluated for CO oxidation, the Au-loaded mesoporous FeO catalyst shows up to 20% higher CO conversion efficiency compared to the commercial Au/FeO catalyst, especially at lower temperatures (25-150 °C), suggesting the promising potential of this catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation. Furthermore, the Au-loaded mesoporous FeO catalyst also displays a higher catalytic activity for NH oxidation with a respectable conversion efficiency of 37.4% compared to the commercial Au/FeO catalyst (.6%) at 200 °C. The significant enhancement in the catalytic performance of the Au-loaded mesoporous FeO catalyst for both CO and NH oxidation may be attributed to the improved dispersion of the Au NPs and enhanced diffusivity of the reactant molecules due to the presence of mesopores and a higher  activation rate contributed by the increased number of active sites, respectively.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12718680>Passive Smoking and Other Factors at Different Periods of Life and Breast Cancer Risk in Chinese Women who have Never Smoked - A Case-control Study in Chongqing, People's Republic of China.</a></h2><p>A case-control study of breast cancer (BC) was conducted from 1994 to 1996 in Chongqing, People's Republic of China, in order to explore the etiological role of passive smoking (, so-called second hand smoking) as well as other early life factors (, height, socioeconomic status and history of suffering from a disease resulting in hospitalization). These factors were reviewed both in childhood (age less than 10 years) and in the teenage years (youth: 10 to 16 years). One hundred and eighty six cases of newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed BC, aged 24 to 55 years, were individually matched by day (within six months) and age (within 2 years) at diagnosis as well as marital status to 186 controls selected from outpatients not suffering from cancer.

Our study also found an increased risk of BC in those with a past history of suffering from a disease requiring hospitalization [2.41 (1.21-4.81)].

Being overweight as an adult, however, was associated with a high risk of BC [1.76 (1.02-3.04)]. Age at menarche [.83 (.72-.95)] was associated negatively with risk of BC. A history of benign breast disease [2.05 (1.01-4.16)] or a history of life stress [2.32 (1.54-3.48)] were both associated with increased risk of BC. Our results therefore indicate a small but definite effect associated with , the credibility of which is enhanced by a dose-response relationship to BC risk. The other early life factors, such as age at menarche, history of suffering from a disease requiring hospitalization, history of benign breast disease, being overweight as an adult and life stress are similar to those consistently found in other countries.

Cases were filtered to identify those receiving curative intent therapy including surgery, radiotherapy (RT), chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and combined modality with surgery (S + RT). Information was collected on known prognostic and predictive factors, and  eligibility per the PACIFIC trial. The primary outcome measure was overall survival.A total of 638 patients with stage III NSCLC were referred and received curative intent treatment. Of these, 66 (10%) received surgery, 95 (%) RT, 410 (64%) CRT, and 67 (11%) combined S + RT. Median overall survival (OS) was similar for surgery (28.6 mo) and CRT (27. mo), inferior for RT alone (17.5 mo), and superior for S + RT (55.8 mo). In a multivariate model only, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG ) and treatment cohort significantly influenced OS. In a case-matched analysis, the median OS for CRT was 31.9 months, compared to 55.8 months with trimodality treatment. Overall, 61% of patients receiving CRT and 88% of those receiving trimodality therapy would have been potentially eligible for adjuvant .In stage III NSCLC, the performance of surgery and CRT are similar after controlling for known prognostic factors.

Osmolytes were acetone and three glycol ethers: ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGMME), diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DEGMME), and triethylene glycol monoethyl ether (TEGMEE). The 'osmotic efficiency' of osmolytes was quite different. Their reflection coefficients ranged between . (acetone), .59 (EGMME), .78 (DEGMME), and .80 (TEGMEE). Bulk water permeability (Lp) and diffusive permeabilities () of heavy water (HDO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acetone, and glycol ethers (EGMME, DEGMME, and TEGMEE) were measured using a cell pressure probe. Cells were treated with different concentrations of osmotic solutes of up to 800 mM ( approximately 2. MPa of osmotic pressure). Inhibition of aquaporin activity increased with both increasing concentration and size of solutes (reflection coefficients). As cell Lp decreased,  increased, indicating that water and solutes used different passages across the plasma membrane. Similar to earlier findings of an osmotic gating of ion channels, a cohesion/tension model of the gating of water channels in Chara internodes by high concentration is proposed. According to the model, tensions (negative pressures) within water channels affected the open/closed state by changing the free energy between states and favoured a distorted/collapsed rather than the open state. They should have differed depending on the concentration and size of solutes that are more or less excluded from aquaporins. The bigger the solute, the lower was the concentration required to induce a reversible closure of aquaporins, as predicted by the model.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28168382>Molecular Design, Expression and Evaluation of PASylated Human Recombinant Erythropoietin with Enhanced Functional Properties.</a></h2><p>Erythropoietin (EPO) is the principal hormone which, has somewhat short half-life involved in the differentiation and regulation of circulating red blood cells.

Although the in vitro potency of the fusion protein was significantly reduced (1.26 ± .05 vs. .24 ± .03 ng/ml) but, the in vivo activity was considerably increased up to 1.58 × 10 IU/ml in normocythemic mice assay.

Although trunk muscles also appear to affect spinal alignment, the role of the trunk muscles is not yet clear.The aim was to elucidate the role of the multifidus (MF) and psoas () in maintaining global spinal alignment in patients with DLS.This was a multicenter retrospective matched cohort study.Surgically treated 60 paired DLS and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) female (120 patients), matched for age and body mass index (BMI; DLS age 68.±6.8 vs. LSS 67.1±8.9 years; BMI 21.6±3.3 vs. 23.2±3.8 kg/m(2)), were included and were followed for at least 2 years.Spinal alignment, muscle area, and volume were measured from radiographs, magnetic resonance images (MRIs), and whole-body dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Muscle strength was measured by grip power and peak expiratory flow (PEF).As a surrogate of muscle area, we obtained the cross-sectional area (CSA) at the L5-S level from preoperative MRIs.The MF and  CSAs were significantly smaller in the DLS group than in the LSS group (MF 477.7±192.5 vs. 779.8±248.6 mm(2), p<.01;  692.3±201.2 vs. 943.4±272.4 mm(2), p=.002), whereas percentage of difference between the right and left sides was significantly larger in the DLS group (MF 18.4±30.6 vs. 2.4±3.3%, p<.01;  14.4±.8 vs. 2.1±2.2%, p<.01). In the extremities, there were no significant differences in the left- or right-side lean composition and grip strength or PEF tests between the groups. Correlation coefficient tests showed moderate correlations between the MF average CSA (avCSA) and global spinal alignment and spinopelvic alignment (pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis; R=-.37, -.38) in the DLS group. The MF avCSA was correlated with the postoperative progression of kyphosis at the unfused thoracic vertebrae in the DLS group (R=.34).The CSAs of the MF and  were significantly smaller in the DLS group. Whole-body DXA showed no significant difference in the lean composition between the groups. There were significant correlations in the DLS patients between the MF CSA and sagittal spinal alignment. These findings suggest the causal relationship between muscles and global spine alignment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the inhalation route has gained considerable interest as an innovative strategy for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases. It is, therefore, important to scrutinise the potentially deleterious or side effects of NPs on lung epithelium. The present study investigates, for the first time, the impact of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated NPs on freshly purified primary cultures of rat alveolar type II (ATII) cells. These cells play a central role in the respiratory function of the lungs. They are responsible for synthesizing and secreting pulmonary surfactant (), which is required to stabilise the respiratory surface during breathing dynamics. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of NPs was evaluated by analysing morphology, viability and exocytotic activity of ATII cells ( secretion). The impact of ATII cells' exposure to NPs was studied in a wide range of gold concentration with particles sizes of  and 100 nm. The results show that PEG-coated NPs are very modestly internalised by ATII cells and it neither leads to detectable morphological changes nor to decreased cell viability nor to alterations in basic functional parameters such as  secretion, even on exposure to high gold concentration (~.2 mM) during relatively long periods of time (24-48 h).</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498722>Creep behavior of starch-based nanocomposite films with cellulose nanofibrils.</a></h2><p>Nanocomposite films were successfully prepared by incorporating cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) from sugar beet pulp into plasticized starch () at CNFs concentration of 5-20%.

Toxicity data included immune-related adverse events (irAEs), need for glucocorticoids, and hospitalization. The associations of toxicity with age, CCI, and ECOG  were evaluated using the exact χ test or Fisher exact test.We included 75 patients (median age: 74 y; range, 70-92 y); 53% had a CCI of 3 or higher; 49% had ECOG  of 2 or higher. Median OS for the whole cohort was 8.2 months (ECOG  -1 vs ≥2: 13.7 vs 3.8 mo; p < .01). Median TTF was 4.2 months (ECOG  -1 vs ≥2: 5.6 vs 2. mo; p = .02). Overall, 37% of patients experienced irAE of any grade (a total of 37 events); 8% were grade 3 or higher (no ICI-related deaths). Of those who discontinued ICIs (N = 64), % were due to irAEs. Of those who experienced irAEs, 64% required glucocorticoids. Hospitalizations during ICI treatment occurred in 72%. Toxicity generally did not differ by age, CCI, or ECOG .Outcomes in our cohort were driven by ECOG  rather than chronological age or comorbidities.

Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a well-known natural bioactive material. In this study, we aim to study the anti-inflammatory activity of ESM hydro lysate (AL-) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, AL- was shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 secretion. In vivo treatment with AL- was shown to reduce dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced  loss, clinical signs of colitis and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 (p < .05). In addition, treatment with AL- also attenuated the severity of intestinal inflammation via down-regulation of IL-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine.

The dual-ended readout is one of the common methods that can achieve good DOI resolution. The aim of this study is to evaluate a dual-ended readout detector based on silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) and TOFPET2 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The detector is based on 4 [Formula: see text] 4 lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) units, each unit contained 6 [Formula: see text] 6 LYSO crystals, and the crystal size was 1 [Formula: see text] 1 [Formula: see text] 20 mm. The four lateral surfaces of LYSO crystals were mechanically ground to W14 (surface roughness 10-14 [Formula: see text]m), and the two ended surfaces were polished (surface roughness  <.5 [Formula: see text]m). The reflector was Toray Lumirror E60, and the packing fraction of the LYSO block was 86.5%. Each LYSO unit was read out from both ends with two Hamamatsu S13361-3050AE-08 SiPM arrays.

The hypothesis was that model-based dynamic RSA is able to detect different behaviour of the implant under -bearing and non--bearing conditions.A cohort of  non-consecutive patients was evaluated by dynamic RSA 9 months after TKA implantation. The mean age of patients was 73.4 (65-72) years. The kinematic evaluations were performed using an RSA device (BI-STAND DRX 2) developed in our Institute. The patients were asked to perform two active motor tasks: sit-to-stand in -bearing condition; range of motion (ROM) while sitting on the chair. The motion parameters were evaluated using the Grood and Suntay decomposition and the low-point kinematics methods.The dynamic RSA evaluation showed a significant difference (p < .05) between the biomechanical behaviour of the prosthesis during the two motor tasks. When subjected to the patient  (in the sit-to-stand) the low point of the medial compartment had a shorter motion (5.7 ± .2 mm) than the lateral (11. ± .2 mm). This realizes a medial pivot motion as in the normal knee. In the ROM task, where the patient had no  on the prosthesis, this difference was not present: the medial compartment had a displacement of 12.7 ± .2 mm, while the lateral had 17.3 ± .2 mm.Model-based RSA proved to be an effective tool for the evaluation of TKA biomechanics. In particular, it was able to determine that the fixed-bearing posterior-stabilized TKA design evaluated in this study showed a medial pivoting movement under -bearing conditions that was not present when load was not applied. Under loading conditions what drives the pattern of movement is the prosthetic design itself. By the systematic use of this study protocol future comparisons among different implants could be performed, thus contributing significantly to the improvement of TKA design.IV.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28122314>Does current cefazolin dosing achieve adequate tissue and blood concentrations in obese women undergoing cesarean section?</a></h2><p>Prophylactic administration of antibiotics preceding cesarean delivery is the most effective measure taken for preventing postpartum infection. While obese women are at greater risk for infection than non-obese women, evidence-based recommendations for modifying dosing in these women are limited.The purpose of this study was to determine whether obese women undergoing cesarean delivery similarly reach adequate cefazolin concentrations within tissue and blood when weighing <120kg and dosed 2g versus weighing ≥120kg and dosed 3g.We prospectively studied women ≥18 years old with body mass index ≥30kg/m who underwent scheduled cesarean delivery with singleton pregnancy from August 2014 through March 2016. Women were dosed with 2g and 3g of cefazolin for body weights <120kg and ≥120kg, respectively. Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue (following skin incision and before skin closure), myometrial tissue, fetal cord blood, and maternal blood were collected to assess whether cefazolin concentrations were adequate, i.e., at/above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Concentrations, based on inhibition zones for Streptococcus sanguinis, were calculated per gram of solid tissue and milliliter of blood. For all sample types, log-transformed concentrations were compared between dosage groups. Using a range of published MICs (1-8μg/mL or μg/g), odds ratios, describing differential odds of falling below the MIC between dosage groups, were also computed.Women who received 2g (n=65) versus 3g (n=19) of cefazolin did not significantly differ by maternal or gestational age, race/ethnicity, pre-operative hemoglobin, estimated blood loss, fluid administration, duration of surgery, or timing of sample collections relative to cefazolin administration (>.05). Dosage groups also did not differ in cefazolin concentration (median [interquartile range]) within adipose tissue following skin incision (5.30μg/g [3.00-9.60] vs. 6.35μg/g [3.90-8.40]; P=.551), adipose tissue before skin closure (4.45μg/g [2.78-7.25] vs. 6.90μg/g [2.60-10.6]; P=.342), myometrial tissue (13.1μg/g [8.60-19.6] vs. .7μg/g [10.8-21.7]; P=.116), or maternal blood (41.6μg/mL [26.3-57.] vs. 45.3μg/mL [36.7-68.3]; P=.143). However, cord blood concentrations differed significantly (19.5μg/mL [13.7-28.5] vs. 27.9μg/mL [.8-39.4]; P=.032), and, in 3 of 5 sample types, group concentrations differed at the dosing cut-point of 120kg (<.02). Within the range of MICs considered, differences in the odds of concentration inadequacy were not detected between dosage groups for any sample type. Across all patients, inadequate concentrations in one or more solid tissue types were observed in 1.19%, 17.9%, 59.5%, and 86.9% of patients, given the MICs of 1μg/g, 2μg/g, 4μg/g and 8μg/g, respectively. In adipose tissues, specifically, and both dosage groups, mean concentrations were significantly lower than the MIC of 8μg/g (<.03). Concentrations in one or both blood sample types were inadequate for only 8.33% of patients, given the 8-μg/mL MIC.Adequate cefazolin concentrations were achieved in blood for the majority of our patients. However, concentration adequacy was not achieved in solid tissue for a nearly equally large proportion of patients.

Their inhibitory efficiency depended on the compound lipophilicity, the electronic properties of the substituent R and the position of the substituent R on the benzene ring. The most effective inhibitors showing IC50 values in the range 2.3-3.6μM were substituted in C'(3) by F, CH3, Cl and Br. The dependence of the PET-inhibiting activity on the lipophilicity of the compounds was quasi-parabolic for 3-substituted derivatives, while for C'(2) ones a slight increase and for C'(4) derivatives a sharp decrease of the activity were observed with increasing lipophilicity. In addition, the dependence of PET-inhibiting activity on electronic Hammett's σ parameter of the substituent R was observed with optimum σ value .06 for C'(4) and .34 for C'(3) substituted derivatives, while the value of σ parameter did not significantly influence the PET-inhibiting activity of C'(2) substituted compounds.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may make a contribution to the decrease of organophosphate residues in crops and/or the degradation in soils, but such effects remain unknown.A greenhouse pot experiment studied the influence of AM fungi and phoxim application on the growth of carrot and green onion, and phoxim concentrations in the two vegetables and their soil media. Treatments included three AM fungal inoculations with Glomus intraradices BEG 141, G. mosseae BEG 167, and a nonmycorrhizal control, and four phoxim application rates (, 200, 400, 800 mg l(-1), while 400 mg l(-1) rate is the recommended dose in the vegetable production system). Carrot and green onion were grown in a greenhouse for 130 d and 150 d. Phoxim solution (100 ml) was poured into each pot around the roots 14d before plant harvest. Results showed that mycorrhizal colonization was higher than 70%, and phoxim application inhibited AM colonization on carrot but not on green onion. Compared with the nonmycorrhizal controls, both shoot and root fresh weights of these two vegetables were significantly increased by AM inoculations irrespective of phoxim application rates. Phoxim concentrations in shoots, roots and soils were increased with the increase of phoxim application rate, but significantly decreased by the AM inoculations. Soil phosphatase activity was enhanced by both AM inocula, but not affected by phoxim application rate. In general, G. intraradices BEG 141 had more pronounced effects than G. mosseae BEG 167 on the increase of fresh  production in both carrot and green onion, and the decrease of phoxim concentrations in plants and soils.Our results indicate a promising potential of AM fungi for enhancing vegetable production and reducing organophosphorus pesticide residues in plant tissues and their growth media, as well as for the phytoremediation of organophosphorus pesticide-contaminated soils.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26021978>Effects of obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus on placental phospholipids.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse effects in the offspring. The composition of placental glycerophospholipids (GPL) is known to be altered in GDM and might reflect an aberrant fatty acid transfer across the placenta and thus affect the foetal body composition. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of obesity and GDM, respectively, on placental GPL species composition. We investigated molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine () in term placentas from controls (lean non-diabetic, body-mass-index [BMI] 18-24.9k g/m(2), n=31), obese non-diabetics (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2), n=17) and lean diabetics (n=), using liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. PE(16:/22:6) and PE(18:/20:4) were increased in GDM and decreased species were PC(18:/20:3), PC(18:1/20:3) and (18:/18:2). A consistent difference between BMI related changes and changes caused by GDM was not observed. Arachidonic acid percentages of cord blood correlated with placental PC(16:/20:4), whereas foetal docosahexaenoic acid correlated to placental PE species. Furthermore, a positive correlation of placental  was found to levels of PE containing arachidonic acid. We demonstrated that obesity and GDM are associated with decreased dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents of placental GPL, with unknown consequences for the foetus. PC(16:/20:4) was identified as the major component for the supply of arachidonic acid to the foetal circulation, whereas PE containing arachidonic acid was found to be associated to the placental and infant growth.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2015.

Membrane Biol. 123: 1-8) was analyzed at different concentrations of KCl and KF. At .8 M KCl the conductance G(V(m)) increases exponentially from 21  at 50 mV up to 53  at V(m) = 200 mV, 20 degrees C. The concentration dependence of G(V(m)) corresponds to a Michaelis-Menten type saturation  at all membrane voltage values applied (-200 mV). The anion concentration K(.5), where G(V(m)) has its half-maximum value, increases from .12 M at 50 mV to .24 M at 175 mV for channels in a soybean phospholipid bilayer. The voltage dependence of the single channel conductance, which is different for charged and neutral lipid bilayers, can be described either by a two-state flicker (2SF) model and the Nernst-Planck continuum theory, or by a two , one-site (2B1S) model with asymmetric barriers. The increase in the number of open channels after a voltage jump from 50 mV to 150 mV has a time constant of .8 s. The changes of the single-channel conductance are much faster (<1 ms). The electric part of the gating process is characterized by the (reversible) molar electrical work DeltaG(theta) (el) = rhoZ(g)FV(m) approximately -1.3 RT, which corresponds to the movement of one charge of the gating charge number Z(g) = 1 across the fraction rho = DeltaV(m)/V(m) = . of the membrane voltage V(m) = 200 mV. Unlike with chloride, the single channel conductance of fluoride has a maximum at about 150 mV in the presence of the buffer PIPES (>/=5 mM, pH 6.8) with K(.5) approximately 1 M. It is shown that the decrease in conductance is due to a blocking of the channel by the PIPES anion. In summary, the results indicate that the anion transport by the Clavibacter anion channel (CAC) does not require a voltage dependent conformation change of the CAC.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29795368>Plant sterols lower LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in dyslipidemic individuals with or at risk of developing type 2 ; a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.</a></h2><p>Managing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, e.g., dyslipidemia in type-2  mellitus (T2DM) is critically important as CVD is the most common cause of death in T2DM patients.

To quantify the ability of the copolymer to compatibilize the blends, the time evolution of the domain size upon annealing was analyzed by SEM. It was found that the most effective parameter to quantify the ability of the copolymer to inhibit droplet coalescence is K(rel)t(stable), the relative coarsening constant multiplied by the stabilization time. These results indicate that intermediate-molecular- telechelic pairs of both highly reactive Anhydride--Anhydride/NH(2)-PI-NH(2) and slower reacting Epoxy--Epoxy/COOH-PI-COOH both effectively suppress coalescence, with the optimal molecular  being slightly above the critical molecular  of the homopolymer, M(c). The effects of telechelic loading were also investigated, where the optimal loading concentration for this system was .5 wt %, as higher concentrations exhibited a plasticizing effect due to the presence of unreacted low-molecular- telechelics present in the blend. A determination of the interfacial coverage of the copolymer shows that a conversion of approximately 1.5-3.% was required for 20% surface coverage at 5. wt % telechelic loading, indicating a large excess of telechelics in this system.

Concentration-time data (n=332) obtained in 44 patients were analyzed using the NONMEM program. Pre-treatment plasma levels of HGF (n=36) were assayed by ELISA method. A Cox model was used to identify prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS), and a linear regression to identify factors contributing to the depletion of peripheral lymphocytes at day . Steady-state pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib was described by a one compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination. None of the tested covariates explained the inter-patient variability in CL/F. A significant decrease in total lymphocytes count was observed within the first 15days (median ratio Day15/Day0=.66, p<.0001). Patients with Day15/Day0 ratio below .66 had longer PFS (14 vs 4 months, HR=.41, CI95%=[.-.77], p=.0095). In the multivariate Cox model analysis, ECOG  was the only parameter independently associated with PFS (grade 1 vs , HR=3.26, CI95%=[1.29-8.22], p=.01 and grade ≥2 vs , HR=4.77, CI95%=[1.52-14.95], p=.007). Plasma vemurafenib exposure (p=.046) and pre-treatment HGF levels (p=.003) were independently associated with the total lymphocyte ratio Day15/Day0. These findings show that plasma vemurafenib exposure and pre-treatment HGF levels are two factors contributing to the early peripheral lymphocytes depletion which itself is associated with PFS.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Carperitide (α-human A-type natriuretic peptide) is a cardiac peptide hormone secreted from the atrium. This peptide hormone enhances diuresis by suppressing the RAAS. In our experience, carperitide alleviates decreased hemoglobin (Hb) concentration during elective surgery. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between low-dose carperitide (.01 µg/kg/min) and Hb concentration during oral surgery.Patients (ASA-: I-II, 40-80 years old) undergoing oral maxillofacial surgery (duration of operation >8 h) were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups: the carperitide group received carperitide at .01 µg/kg/min and the control group received normal saline. Body fluid water [including total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), and intracellular water (ICW)], urine volume, and chemical parameters such as Hb concentration, PaO, and serum electrolytes were evaluated every 2 h.In the carperitide group (n = ), Hb decreased from 12.6 ± 1.1 to 10.8 ± 1.5 g/dl, while it decreased from 12.6 ± 1.4 to 9.5 ± 1.3 g/dl in the control group (n = ) (p < .05). Urine volume (2557.3 ± 983.5 mL) in the carperitide group was significantly more than it was in the control group (1108.8 ± 586.4 mL; p < .001). There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics, body fluid water, PaO, and serum electrolytes between the two groups. In addition, there were no perioperative clinical respiratory and hemodynamic complications in the groups.The Hb concentration in the group administered low-dose carperitide at .01 µg/kg/min remained higher than that in the control group during surgery. Administration of low-dose carperitide may therefore reduce the risk of blood transfusion during surgery.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16851802>Ultrafast dynamics of liquid poly(ethylene glycol)s and crown ethers studied by femtosecond Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Ultrafast molecular dynamics of liquid poly(ethylene glycol)s, tetra(ethylene glycol), penta(ethylene glycol), and poly(ethylene glycol) with the molecular  of 600, and crown ethers, 12-crown-4 and -crown-5, have been investigated by means of femtosecond optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy. Picosecond Kerr transients of poly(ethylene glycol)s and crown ethers are characterized by a biexponential function with the time constants of about 2 and 20 . Both the faster and slower time constants do not vary much among the five oligo(ethylene oxide)s. Femtosecond dynamics is discussed based on the Kerr (depolarized Raman) spectra obtained by Fourier transform deconvolution analysis of the high time resolution Kerr transients. The broad low-frequency band (-200 cm(-1)) in the Kerr spectrum is analyzed by two Brownian oscillators. The spectral shapes of linear poly(ethylene glycol) and cyclic crown ether are very different. Both the low- and high-frequency Brownian oscillators for crown ethers show lower frequency and broader spectral features than those for poly(ethylene glycol)s. The comparison of the low-frequency spectra of poly(ethylene glycol)s and crown ethers shows that the low-frequency spectrum of -crown-5 is closer to that of poly(ethylene glycol)s than that of 12-crown-4 is. The difference of the low-frequency spectra between poly(ethylene glycol) and crown ether is discussed with the concepts of molecular conformation and liquid density. The features of the observed intramolecular vibrational bands are also correlated with the molecular conformations.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685356>Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: Establishing a benchmark for the proportion of patients suitable for radical treatment.</a></h2><p>Outcome data from Cancer Care Ontario suggest that only 27% of patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receive chemoradiotherapy. However, many patients are not suitable for radical treatment. This study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with stage III NSCLC suitable for radical treatment and to examine reasons for choosing a palliative approach otherwise.This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed stage III NSCLC treated between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2009, at the Juravinski Cancer Centre, Canada. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes.A total of 122 patients with stage III NSCLC were included. Additional data on 37 patients with stage IV NSCLC and pleural effusions (previously stage IIIB) are included for comparison. Of the 122 patients, 61 (50%) received radical treatment and 61 (50%) were treated palliatively. Reasons for excluding patients from radical treatment were  loss (WL) > 10% within 3 months of presentation (11%), performance status () > 2 (16%), or combined poor  and WL (33%). Significant comorbid health problems excluded only % of patients from radical treatment. The median overall survival (OS) for patients treated radically was 23.3 months versus 7. months for those treated palliatively. Patients with poor  or WL > 10% had OS similar to that of patients with stage IV pleural effusion (7.1 months vs. 7.2 months). Patients with poor  and WL > 10% had the poorest survival (3 months).The present data do not support extrapolating radical treatment of stage III NSCLC beyond the eligibility criteria used in clinical trials. These data serve as a benchmark for the assessment of quality of care for patients with stage III NSCLC.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) detects early neoplasms with a higher level of sensitivity than the guaiac test. We investigated the sensitivity of the FIT in detection of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/).We performed a prospective study of 6198 asymptomatic subjects (mean age, 59. ± 7. years) who received concurrent screening colonoscopies and FITs at the Health Management Center of National Taiwan University Hospital from August 2010 through November 2014. The sensitivity of FIT for conventional adenoma, advanced adenoma, and SSA/P at different cutoffs was calculated, and results were compared by using multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders.Prevalence values of SSA/P, adenoma, and advanced adenoma were 1.4%, 20.2%, and 5.5%, respectively. At cutoffs of 10, , and 20 μg hemoglobin/g feces, the FIT detected all SSA/ with 12.3%, 6.2%, and 6.2% sensitivity, large SSA/ with 18.4%, 10.5%, and 10.5% sensitivity, and advanced adenomas with 32.4%, 24.5%, and 20.9% sensitivity, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that positive results from the FIT did not differ significantly between individuals with SSA/P and those with non-advanced adenoma or those with negative findings from colonoscopy. Patients with large SSA/ were less likely to have positive results from the FIT than patients with advanced adenoma, with odds ratios of .44 (95% confidence interval [CI], .18-1.05), .30 (95% CI, .10-.90), and .37 (95% CI, .12-1.12) at cutoffs of 10, , and 20 μg hemoglobin/g feces, respectively, after adjusting for lesion size, even with synchronous conventional adenoma.In a prospective study of 6198 subjects receiving the FIT and colonoscopy, we found that the FIT detected SSA/ with significantly lower levels of sensitivity than conventional adenoma.

In addition to detailed structural characterization obtained by using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cryogenic TEM techniques, ultrafast fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) from coumarin 153 (C153) as a donor (D) to rhodamine 6G (R6G) as an acceptor (A) is also used to study micelle-vesicle transitions in the present system. Structural transitions of SAIL micelles ([C4mim][C8SO4] or [C12mim]Cl micelles) to mixed SAIL vesicles resulted in significantly increased D-A distances, and therefore, increased timescale of FRET. In [C4mim][C8SO4] micelles, FRET between C153 and R6G occurs on an ultrafast timescale of 3.3 , which corresponds to a D-A distance of about  Å. As [C4mim][C8SO4] micelles are transformed into mixed micelles upon the addition of a .25 molar fraction of [C12mim]Cl, the timescale of FRET increases to 300 , which suggests an increase in the D-A distance to 31 Å. At a .5 molar fraction of [C12mim]Cl, unilamellar vesicles are formed in which FRET occurs on multiple timescales of about 250 and 2100 , which correspond to D-A distances of 33 and 47 Å. Although in micelles and mixed micelles the obtained D-A distances are well correlated with their radius, in vesicles the obtained D-A distance is within the range of the bilayer thickness.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We aimed to examine the association between thiazolidinediones, PPAR-γ agonists and incidence of bacterial abscess among patients with type 2 .This retrospective cohort study between 2000 and 2010 included 46 986 propensity ()-matched patients diagnosed with type 2 . We compared the incidence of bacterial abscess, including liver and non-liver abscesses, between patients treated with metformin plus a thiazolidinedione (M + T, N = 7831) or metformin plus a sulfonylurea (M + S, N = 39 155). Data were retrieved from a population-based Taiwanese database. We applied Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing M + T and M + S after  matching.During a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the incidence rate of bacterial abscess was lower with M + T than with M + S treatment (1.89 vs 3. per 1000 person-years) in the -matched cohort. M + T was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial abscess (HRs after  matching, .58; 95% CI, .42-.80 for total bacterial abscess; .54; 95% CI, .28-1.07 for liver abscess; .59; 95% CI, .41-.85 for non-liver abscess). Results did not change materially after accounting for unmeasured confounding factors using high-dimenional  matching and differential censoring between regimen groups. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, in combination with metformin, produced similar reductions in risk of all abscess outcomes.We found that M + T may provide a protective benefit in reducing the incidence of bacterial abscesses.

Since the original description of deficiency of the pulmonary surfactant in premature neonates by Avery in 1959, RDS has most commonly been attributed to developmental immaturity of surfactant production. But in clinical practice it has been found that there was RDS in term and late-term neonates. Many of them were recognized as transient tachypnea at the beginning, they were diagnosed as RDS until respiratory distress and the typical radiological signs were demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of RDS of term and late-term neonates.All neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine between May, 2005 and May, 2007 on the basis of RDS were analyzed. RDS was diagnosed when respiratory distress and the typical radiological signs were documented. Patients were grouped into preterm group (Group 1, gestational age < 35 w, n = 103) and term and late-term group (Group 2, gestational age > or = 35 w, n = 74).In Group 1, 76 preterm infants were male, the mean gestational age was 31.1 w, the mean Apgar score at 1 min was 7.6, the mean birth  was 1702 g, 56 cases were vaginally delivered and 47 were delivered through Cesarean section.

With regard to high-contrast spatial resolution, the mean values of the f30 (lp/mm), f40 (lp/mm) and f50 (lp/mm) for the left detector were 1.39 ± .04, 1.24 ± .05, and 1.09 ± .04, respectively, while for the right detector they were 1.38 ± .04, 1.22 ± .05, and 1.09 ± .05, respectively. Mean CNRs for the left and right detectors were 148 ± 3 and 143 ± 4, respectively. For geometrical accuracy, both detectors had a measured image length of the QCkV-1 of 57.9 ± .5 mm. The left detector showed dose measurements of 20.4 ± .2 μGy (CS), 191.8 ± .7 μGy (TS), 154.2 ± .7 μGy (AS), and 192.2 ± .6 μGy (), while the right detector showed 20.3 ± .3 μGy (CS), 189.7 ± .8 μGy (TS), 151. ± .7 μGy (AS), and 189.7 ± .8 μGy (), respectively. For X-ray , the left detector (right X-ray tube) had mean kVp readings of 81.6 ± .5 (CS), 122.5 ± .5 (TS), 122. ± .8 (AS), and 122.1 ± .7 (), and the right detector (left X-ray tube) had 81.6 ± .5 (CS), 120.8 ± .5 (TS), 120.9 ± .6 (AS), and 121.3 ± .7 (). Run charts were created so that each parameter could be tracked over time and the constancy of the system could be monitored. A methodology was developed to assess the basic image quality parameters recommended by TG-142 for the ExacTrac system. The ExacTrac system shows a consistent dose, kVp, high-contrast spatial resolution, CNR, and geometrical accuracy for each detector over the evaluated timeframe.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614559>Quantifying Actual and Perceived Inaccuracy When Estimating the Sugar, Energy Content and Portion Size of Foods.</a></h2><p>In order to adhere to dietary guidelines and manage health risks, consumers need to be able to estimate with some accuracy the sugar and energy content of foods. The present study compared how well participants could estimate the sugar and energy content of foods, the  of foods, and approximate portion size (using a hand measure estimation aid). The study had three aims. First, it aimed to investigate differences in accuracy across the four measures. Second, it aimed to examine whether these differences in accuracy between estimation measures were accurately perceived by the participants. Third, it aimed to test if estimation accuracy was related to food journaling experience, body-mass index or gender. One hundred and ninety-seven participants took part in an estimation task and filled in a questionnaire. While the participants were inaccurate when using all four estimation measures, inaccuracy was most pronounced for sugar content (s ≥ .39), which was consistently overestimated by between 62.1% and 98.5% of the sample. None of the other measures showed a consistent pattern of under- or overestimation. Participants' perceived accuracy did not match their actual accuracy (s ≤ |.20|, s ≥ .005). Actual accuracy showed only marginal covariation with food journaling experience (s ≤ 2.01, s ≥ .049, s ≤ .14), body-mass index (s ≤ |.|, s ≥ .041) or gender (s ≤ 3.17, s ≥ .002, s ≤ .46). It is particularly challenging for consumers to estimate the sugar content of food, which might have negative consequences for health and well-being. Thus, more education about sugar content and misperceptions is needed to support consumers so that they can make healthy food choices.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737591>HIV Incidence and Predictors of HIV Acquisition From an Outside Partner in Serodiscordant Couples in Lusaka, Zambia.</a></h2><p>Evaluate the incidence and predictors of HIV acquisition from outside partners in serodiscordant couples.Demographic, behavioral, and clinical exposures were measured quarterly in a cohort of serodiscordant cohabiting couples in Zambia from 1995 to 2012 (n = 3049).

This study includes 2,148 participants who completed the Beck depression inventory (BDI) at baseline and ≥ one follow-up visit in years 1-3.At baseline, 40.4% self-reported treatment for depression. At least mild depressive symptoms (BDI score ≥ 10) were reported by 28.3%; moderate (BDI score 19-29) and severe (BDI score ≥30) symptoms were uncommon (4.2 and .5%, respectively). Mild-to-severe depressive symptoms independently increased the odds (OR = 1.75; P = .03) of a major adverse event within 30 days of surgery. Compared with baseline, symptom severity was significantly lower at all follow-up time points (e.g., mild-to-severe symptomatology was 8.9%, 6 months; 8.4%, 1year; 12.2%, 2 years; .6%, 3 years;  < .001), but increased between 1 and 3 years postoperatively (P < .01). Change in depressive symptoms was significantly related to change in body mass index (r = .42; P < 0001).Bariatric surgery has a positive impact on depressive features. However, data suggest some deterioration in improvement after the first postoperative year.

If a disease associated causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) operates essentially through a complex mechanism that involves multiple SNPs or possible environmental factors, its effect might be missed if the causal SNP is studied in isolation without accounting for these unknown genetic influences. In this study, we attempt to address the issue of reduced power that is inherent in single point association studies by accounting for genetic influences that negatively impact the detection of causal variant in single point association analysis. In our method we use propensity score () to adjust for the effect of SNPs that influence the marginal association of a candidate marker. These SNPs might be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and/or epistatic with the target-SNP and have a joint interactive influence on the disease under study. We therefore propose a propensity score adjustment method (PSAM) as a tool for dimension reduction to improve the power for single locus studies through an estimated  to adjust for influence from these SNPs while regressing disease status on the target-genetic locus. The degree of freedom of such a test is therefore always restricted to 1.We assess PSAM under the null hypothesis of no disease association to affirm that it correctly controls for the type-I-error rate (<.05). PSAM displays reasonable power (>70%) and shows an average of % improvement in power as compared with commonly-used logistic regression method and PLINK under most simulated scenarios. Using the open-access multifactor dimensionality reduction dataset, PSAM displays improved significance for all disease loci. Through a whole genome study, PSAM was able to identify 21 SNPs from the GAW16 NARAC dataset by reducing their original trend-test p-values from within .001 and .05 to p-values less than .0009, and among which 6 SNPs were further found to be associated with immunity and .PSAM improves the significance of single-locus association of causal SNPs which have had marginal single point association by adjusting for influence from other SNPs in a dataset. This would explain part of the missing heritability without increasing the complexity of the model due to huge multiple testing scenarios. The newly reported SNPs from GAW16 data would provide evidences for further research to elucidate the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis. PSAM is proposed as an exploratory tool that would be complementary to other existing methods.

In this study, abundances and characteristics of microplastics in sediments and benthic organisms from the South Yellow Sea were investigated. First, we optimized the sediment sampling for microplastic analysis and found that the top layer (-5 cm) had the highest abundance, and microplastic abundances decreased significantly with increase in sediment depth. The abundance of microplastics was 560-4205 n/kg dry  in the surface sediments (the topmost 3 cm) of 14 sites and 1.7-47. n/g wet  in the tissues of benthic organisms. Moreover, microplastic abundances in sediments and benthic organisms were both positively correlated with water depth. Fibers, transparent microplastics, and small microplastics (<.5 mm) were the most dominant types in sediments and organisms. FTIR analysis showed that polypropylene (PP, 31%), polyester (PE, 24%), nylon (19%), and polystyrene (, %) were the most abundant polymers in sediments. The results of SEM showed rough surfaces and obvious cracks on the microplastics isolated from sediments. In addition, characteristics of microplastics in Ophiura sarsii, Crangon affinis, and Acila mirabilis were compared.

Anabolic threshold (net protein balance = ) and capacity (slope) were determined on an individual basis from the assumed linear relationship between protein intake and net protein balance.We confirmed a linear relationship between protein intake and net protein balance for all participants (R range: .9988-1., p ≤ .0006). On average, the anabolic threshold and anabolic capacity were comparable between the groups (anabolic threshold COPD vs. healthy: 3.82 ± .31 vs. 4.20 ± .36 μmol PHE × kg ffm × hr; anabolic capacity COPD vs. healthy: .952 ± .007 and .954 ± .004).

Racial and genetic factors play roles in manifestation of hirsutism, and the prevalence of hirsutism seems to be low in East Asians. However, the reference value of the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score to diagnose hirsutism and the prevalence of hirsutism have not been determined in Korean populations to date. We aimed to investigate the distribution of the mFG score and establish its reference value for defining hirsutism and to examine its relationship with metabolic and reproductive traits in reproductive-aged Korean women.We enrolled 2139 female volunteers of reproductive age (-39 years). We recorded mFG scores from  to 4 on 9 different body locations (upper lip, chin, chest, arm, upper abdomen, lower abdomen, upper back, lower back and thighs). Hirsutism was defined as >95th percentile of mFG score. In addition, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed, and the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated.The mFG values of the 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles were , 1, 4 and 6, respectively. Therefore, the mFG score was indicative of hirsutism when the score was 6 or greater, which represents the 95th percentile. In the correlation analysis, total testosterone, free testosterone, fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR were positively correlated with mFG score (all  <.05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that HOMA-IR (β = .081) was positively associated with mFG score after adjustments for age, body mass index, total testosterone and the number of menses per year (P < .001).In conclusion, setting the 95th percentile of the mFG score as normal, the reference value to define hirsutism was 6 in reproductive-aged Korean women.

Pressure-volume loops showed reduced ejection fraction (79.1 ± 3.5% FA, 35.5 ± 9.5% PM2.5, P = .005), increased end-systolic volume (10.4 ± 2.5 μl FA, 39.5 ± 3.8 μl PM2.5, P = .001), and reduced dP/dt maximum (11,605 ± 200 μl/s FA, 9,569 ± 800 μl/s PM2.5, P = .05) and minimum (-9,203 ± 235 μl/s FA, -7,045 ± 189 μl/s PM2.5, P = .0005) in PM2.5-exposed mice. Isolated cardiomyocytes from the hearts of PM2.5-exposed mice had reduced peak shortening (%, 8.53 ± 2.82% FA, 6.82 ± 2.04% PM2.5, P = .003), slower calcium reuptake (τ, .22 ± .09 s FA, .26 ± .07 s PM2.5, P = .048), and reduced response to β-adrenergic stimulation compared with cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that were exposed to FA. Histological analyses revealed greater picro-sirius red-positive-stained areas in the PM2.5 vs. FA group, indicative of increased collagen deposition.

Neurochemical, molecular and structural alterations in a variety of brain regions have been well documented, but little information is available on the consequences of developmental hypothyroidism on synaptic function. Developing rats were exposed to the thyrotoxicant, propylthiouracil (PTU:  or  ppm), through the drinking water of pregnant dams beginning on GD18 and extending throughout the lactational period. Male offspring were allowed to mature after termination of PTU exposure at weaning on PND21 and electrophyiological assessments of field potentials in the dentate gyrus were conducted under urethane anesthesia between 2 and 5 months of age. PTU dramatically reduced thyroid hormones on PND21 and produced deficits in body  that persisted to adulthood. Synaptic transmission was impaired as evidenced by reductions in excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope and population spike () amplitudes at a range of stimulus intensities. Long-term potentiation of the EPSP slope was impaired at both modest and strong intensity trains, whereas a paradoxical increase in  amplitude was observed in PTU-treated animals in response to high intensity trains. These data are the first to describe functional impairments in synaptic transmission and plasticity in situ as a result of PTU treatment and suggest that perturbations in synaptic function may contribute to learning deficits associated with developmental hypothyroidism.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15838467>Early outcomes of endovascular versus open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Private Sector (NSQIP-).</a></h2><p>There remains no consensus on the appropriate application of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Information from administrative databases, industry-sponsored trials, and single institutions has inherent deficiencies. This study was designed to compare early outcomes of open (OPEN) versus EVAR in a contemporary (2000 to 2003) large, multicenter prospective cohort.Fourteen academic medical centers contributed data to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Private Sector (NSQIP-), which ensures uniform, comprehensive, prospective, and previously validated data entry by trained, independent nurse reviewers. A battery of clinical and demographic features was assessed with multivariate analysis for association with the principal study end points of 30-day operative mortality and morbidity.One thousand forty-two patients underwent elective infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs: 460 EVAR and 582 OPEN. EVAR patients were older (74 vs 71 years, P < .0001), included more men (84.6% vs 79.6%, P < .05), and had a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25.4% vs 17.9%, P < .01). EVAR resulted in significantly reduced overall morbidity (24% vs 35%, P < .0001) and hospital stay (4 vs 9 days, P < .0001). Cardiopulmonary and renal function-related comorbidities had the expected significant impact on mortality for both procedures at univariate analysis ( P < .05). While crude mortality rates between EVAR and OPEN did not differ significantly (2.8% vs 4.%) ( P = .32). After multivariate analysis, correlates of operative mortality included OPEN (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 5.78; P < .05), advanced age (OR, 1.11; P < .001), history of angina (OR, 5.54; P < .01), poor functional status (OR, 5.78; P < .001), history of  loss (OR, 7.42; P < .01), and preoperative dialysis (OR, 51.4; P < .0001). EVAR also compared favorably to OPEN (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.89; P < .0001) for overall morbidity.Significant morbidity accompanies AAA repair, even at major academic medical centers. These data strongly endorse EVAR as the preferred approach in the presence of significant cardiopulmonary or renal comorbidities, or poor preoperative functional status.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501951>[Pathological physiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Hypothesis (Literature review)].</a></h2><p>Currently prolonged pH-monitoring is considered as Gold standard for diagnosis of Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). Criteria and norms based on prolonged pH-monitoring were the basic concepts of pathophysiology of GERD. For example, it is accepted that esophageal hernia (EG) can be present without GERD, as well as GERD without EG. X-ray diagnosis compared to the pH- monitoring has a low sensitivity (70%) and specificity (74%). Meanwhile, in recent decades, it has been found that the pH-metry is not effective in a non-erosive reflux disease. We figured that the criteria and norms of pH-monitoring are not accurate. The purpose of this study is to determine the radiological norms of gastroesophageal junction (EGJ) and, to clarify the pathological physiology of GERD according to the new criteria and analysis of the literature.The analysis of the survey of 452 patients was done. Among them were 263 children aged from 1 day to  years who have applied to the Belarusian Center of Pediatric Surgery (BCPS) in 1983-1987 and 189 patients aged -92 years surveyed in the BCPC, as well as in the Government Geriatric Center (Israel) in 1994-2004. The standard radiography of the upper digestive tract was supplemented by provocative tests. In 21 children and 36 adults survey was carried out to locate space-occupying lesions of the chest or abdomen. Other patients had symptoms of GERD.The 21 children and 17 of 34 adult patients without of GERD symptoms had the same radiographic picture, indicating of the normal LES function: the width of the esophagus was the same all over and no more than 1.5 cm; in a horizontal position a peristaltic wave opens the LES and pushes its contents into the stomach without delay, despite the provocative tests. In  out of 34 adults with no symptoms of GERD radiographic findings show signs of LES weakness. In these patients, with a mild GERD, abdominal compression caused contraction of the GEJ with length of (3.60 +/- .8 cm) in adults which corresponds to the length of the LES, according to the manometric studies. A rounded cavity (phrenic ampoule) is formed above the contracted LES when the functional'proximal sphincter' () is closed cranially. When, during the am ampoule contraction the pressure in it reaches a threshold level, LES is opened, and the ampoule injects its contents into the stomach.  of the esophageal wall leads to the gradual ampoule expansion. With a width of the ampulla 2 cm and more we found no evidence of the displacement of the stomach into the chest cavity. The radiological symptoms of GERD are described, the identification of which at rest and during provocation, can be used for grading the antireflux function impairment of LES.1. In GERD the last peristaltic wave expands, forming a phrenic ampoule, which is closed cranially by the . 2. The width of the ampoule is proportional to the stages of GERD. This means that ampoule as well as the so-called esophageal hernia are symptoms of GERD. 3. During the ampoule formation the inner surface of it increases by at least to 11 cm2. The deficit of the mucosa is compensated by the motion of the mucosa from GEJ. The shortening of the longitudinal muscle during the ampulla contraction does not significantly affect the length of the esophagus. 4. Transient LES relaxation is caused by a deficiency of the LES capacity.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897623>Effect of selenium supplementation and plane of nutrition on mares and their foals: foaling data.</a></h2><p>To investigate the maternal plane of nutrition and role of Se yeast on foaling variables and passive transfer of IgG, 28 Quarter Horse mares were used in a study with a randomized complete block design. Mares were blocked by expected foaling date and assigned randomly within block to dietary treatments. Dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial with 2 planes of nutrition, pasture or pasture + grain mix (fed at .75% of BW on an as-fed basis) and 2 concentrations of Se yeast ( or .3 mg/kg of DMI). This resulted in 4 treatments: pasture (PA), pasture + Se (), pasture + grain mix (PG), and pasture + grain mix + Se (PGS). Assuming DMI at 2% of BW, the mares fed PA and  received approximately 100% of the calculated NRC (2007) DE requirements, whereas PG and PGS received 120%. Selenium supplementation began 110 d before the estimated foaling date, and all dietary treatments were terminated at parturition. At parturition, foaling variables were recorded. Additionally, placental  was recorded and 2 samples from each placenta were collected for analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein. Colostrum was obtained for fat, protein, milk urea N, somatic cell count, and IgG analyses. Foal blood samples were collected at , 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after parturition for IgG analysis. There was no effect (P >or= .21) of Se or plane of nutrition on foaling variables; however, foal BW as a percentage of mare BW tended (P = .10) to be reduced in foals from mares on grain mix (PG and PGS; 7.6%) compared with mares not fed grain mix (PA and ; 8.%). There was also no effect (P >or= .20) of Se or plane of nutrition on placental cell number (mg of DNA/g), potential cellular activity (RNA:DNA), expulsion time, or . However, mares fed supplemental Se ( and PGS) had decreased (P = .02) placental cell size (24.1 mg of protein/mg of DNA) compared with mares not fed supplemental Se (PA and PG; 32.5 mg of protein/mg of DNA). There was also no effect (P >or= .18) of Se or plane of nutrition on colostral fat, protein, milk urea N, or somatic cell count. However, mares fed grain mix (PG and PGS) had less (P = .03) colostral IgG (76.5 g/L) compared with mares not fed grain mix (PA and ; 126.6 g/L). Foals from mares fed grain (PG and PGS) tended (P = .06) to have less overall serum IgG (13.6 g/L) compared with foals from mares not fed grain (PA and ; .3 g/L).

The variation in the surface properties of the granular sludge at different salinities were investigated to further clarify the effect of salinity on the aggregation of anammox granular sludge in this study. High anammox activity was obtained at a salinity of 30 g/L NaCl, and the average removal efficiency of NHN, NO-N and TN reached 91.9% ± 1.4%, 97.3% ± .4% and 86.3% ± .9%, respectively. The sludge particle size in Reactor 1 (with  g/L NaCl as control) and Reactor 2 (with ,  and 30 g/L NaCl) increased from 1.62 ± .16 mm and 1.59 ± .12 mm to 2.71 ± .23 mm and 2.44 ± .19 mm, respectively, during total operation. PN gradually decreased from 30.58 ± 2.5 mg/g to 18.11 ± 2.1 mg/g, and  sharply increased from 1.48 ± .09 mg/g to 10.52 ± .50 mg/g with the increase in salinity. The /PN ratio of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) rapidly increased from .05 to .58 with an increase of salinity. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that salinity inhibited the expression of anammox sludge hydrophobicity by changing surface groups. Binding between multivalent metal ions and EPS was significantly hindered by the high Na concentration.

The processes of AVM vessel occlusion after SRS are poorly understood. To improve SRS efficacy, it is important to understand the cellular response of blood vessels to radiation. The molecular changes on the surface of AVM endothelial cells after irradiation may also be used for vascular targeting. This study investigates radiation-induced externalization of phosphatidylserine () on endothelial cells using live-cell imaging. METHODS An immortalized cell line generated from mouse brain endothelium, bEnd.3 cells, was cultured and irradiated at different radiation doses using a linear accelerator.  externalization in the cells was subsequently visualized using polarity-sensitive indicator of viability and apoptosis (pSIVA)-IANBD, a polarity-sensitive probe. Live-cell imaging was used to monitor  externalization in real time. The effects of radiation on the cell cycle of bEnd.3 cells were also examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS Ionizing radiation effects are dose dependent. Reduction in the cell proliferation rate was observed after exposure to 5 Gy radiation, whereas higher radiation doses ( Gy and 25 Gy) totally inhibited proliferation. In comparison with cells treated with sham radiation, the irradiated cells showed distinct pseudopodial elongation with little or no spreading of the cell body. The percentages of pSIVA-positive cells were significantly higher (p = .04) 24 hours after treatment in the cultures that received 25- and -Gy doses of radiation. This effect was sustained until the end of the experiment (3 days). Radiation at 5 Gy did not induce significant  externalization compared with the sham-radiation controls at any time points (p > .). Flow cytometric analysis data indicate that irradiation induced growth arrest of bEnd.3 cells, with cells accumulating in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS Ionizing radiation causes remarkable cellular changes in endothelial cells. Significant  externalization is induced by radiation at doses of  Gy or higher, concomitant with a block in the cell cycle. Radiation-induced markers/targets may have high discriminating power to be harnessed in vascular targeting for AVM treatment.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500939>A randomized, double-blind, phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination for recurrent glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>We conducted a phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24+ recurrent glioblastoma to develop a new treatment modality.We randomly assigned 88 recurrent glioblastoma patients to receive PPV (n = 58) or the placebo (n = 30) at a 2-to-1 ratio. Four of 12 warehouse peptides selected based on preexisting peptide-specific immunoglobulin G levels or the corresponding placebos were injected 1×/week for 12 weeks.Our trial met neither the primary (overall survival [OS]) nor secondary endpoints. Unfavorable factors for OS of 58 PPV patients compared with 30 placebo patients were SART2-93 peptide selection (n = 13 vs 8, hazard ratio [HR]: .9), ≥70 years old (4 vs 4, 7.87), >70 kg body  (10 vs 7, 4.11), and performance status ()3 (8 vs 2, 2.82), respectively. Consequently, the median OS for PPV patients without SART2-93 selection plus one of these 3 favorable factors (<70 y old, ≤70 kg, or PS0-2) was significantly longer than that for the corresponding placebo patients (HR: .49, .44, and .51), respectively.

ASD transcatheter occlusion techniques have become alternative to surgical procedures. A number of different devices are available for transcatheter ASD closure. The type and incidence of complications depend partially upon different devices.A retrospective analysis was performed on the patients treated from October 1998 to January 2003. Transcatheter closure of ASD with Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) was performed in 119 patients, of whom 3 patients were multiple ASD, 3 associated with pulmonary stenosis () and 3 patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The age of the cases ranged from .8 to 17 years (mean 7.5 +/- 2.8 years) and the body  ranged from 6.7 to 88 kg (mean 23.7 +/- 7.8 kg). They all met with criteria for transcatheter closure. The balloon-stretched diameter of ASD was determined with fluoroscopy, ultrasound and measuring plate. A choice of device size was identical to or 1 approximately 2 mm larger than the stretched diameter (SD). A simultaneous PDA closure with device or balloon dilation was done in six cases associated with PDA or , respectively. Follow-up was performed based on the echocardiographic and clinical findings.In 119 cases examined with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), ASD mean diameter was (12.9 +/- 5.6) mm (6.5 - 34.5 mm), pulmonary mean pressure was (29. +/- 5.) mmHg (25. - 62. mmHg), and SD was (.7 +/- 4.8) mm (8. - 38. mm). The diameters of these devices were (. +/- 5.) mm (8 - 38 mm). The devices were successfully implanted in 112 cases. Of them, 3 patients had multiple ASD with one device occlusion. 6 cases associated with PDA or  were treated successfully with PDA occlusion or balloon dilatation, respectively. The immediate, one month and one year complete occlusion rates were 93.8% (105/112), 97.3% (109/112) and 98.2% (110/112), respectively. Residual shunt remained in 2 cases. No complication occurred except transient atrial premature beats and grade II type 1 A-V block in 5 cases (4.5%) and 1 cases (.9%), respectively. The whole time period of the procedure ranged from 25 to 68 minutes. The total follow up period was from one month to 4.3 years.

Transcatheter closure of secundum ASD associated with small anterior, inferior or posterior rim is feasible using ASO. ASO can be performed in infants and young children only if the diameter of disk is smaller than the diameter of atrial septum. Multiple ASD is not the contraindication for intervention. If the diameter of ASD is over 36 mm, the device choice should depend on the maximum diameter of ASD determined with echocardiography. TTE is suitable for the smaller ASD and TEE for the bigger ASD.

Following GES, patients reported improvements in total symptom severity score (3/13 studies, mean difference 6.52 [confidence interval--CI: 1.32, 11.73]; P = .01), vomiting severity score (4/13, 1.45 [CI: .99, 1.91]; P < .0001), nausea severity score (4/13, 1.69 [CI: 1.26, 2.12]; P < .0001), SF-36 physical composite score (4/13, 8.05 [CI: 5.01, 11.10]; P < .0001), SF-36 mental composite score (4/13, 8.16 [CI: 4.85, 11.47]; P < .0001), requirement for enteral or parenteral nutrition (8/13, OR 5.53 [CI: 2.75, 11.13]; P < .001), and 4-h gastric emptying (5/13, 12.7% [CI: 9.8, .6]; P < .0001).  gain did not reach significance (3/13, 3.68 kg [CI: -.23, 7.58]; P = .07). The device removal or reimplantation rate was 8.3%.Results show substantial benefits for high-frequency GES in the treatment of gastroparesis. However, caution is necessary in interpreting the results, primarily because of the limitations of uncontrolled studies. Further controlled studies are required to confirm the clinical benefits of high-frequency GES.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459391>Multicentre randomised phase II trial of gemcitabine+platinum, with or without trastuzumab, in advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing Her2.</a></h2><p>To investigate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine and platinum salt, with or without trastuzumab, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing Her2.The main eligibility criterion was Her2 overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC 2+ or 3+) of primary tumour tissue confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Patients were randomised to Arm A: gemcitabine 1000mg/m(2) (days 1 and 8) plus either cisplatin (70mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (AUC=5) (day 1 every 3 weeks) or Arm B: added trastuzumab (8mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 21 days until progression). The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS).Among 563 screened patients, 75 (13.3%) were Her2 positive (IHC 2+/3+ and FISH+) and 61 met all eligibility criteria (median age, 64 years; 54/61 males; 50/61 baseline ECOG- -1; 11 locally advanced and 50 metastatic). There was no significant difference between Arms A and B in median PFS (10.2 versus 8.2 months, respectively, p=.689), objective response rate (65.5% versus 53.2%, p=.39), and median overall survival (.7 versus 14.1 months, respectively, p=.684). In an exploratory analysis, trastuzumab-treated patients receiving cisplatin rather than carboplatin-based chemotherapy fared better (PFS: 10.6 versus 8.; OS: 33.1 versus 9.5 months). Myelosuppression was the main grade 3/4 toxicity. A case of grade 3 cardiotoxicity and one death from febrile neutropenia occurred in arm B.The unexpectedly low incidence of Her2 overexpression precluded the detection of a significant difference in efficacy on addition of trastuzumab to platinum-based chemotherapy with gemcitabine. However, the satisfactory tolerance of the combination warrants further studies, especially of the cisplatin-based combination, in well-defined patient subsets.ClinicalTrials.gov .Crown Copyright © 2014.

This effect was strongest with rs1800925*T (odds ratio (OR) .40, P(allelic) .000067). The prevalence of PsA in cases with the rs1800925*CT or TT genotype is about half that of those with the CC genotype (.5 vs 32.1%, P=.0002).

We have recently shown cell death and a robust activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in brain areas adjacent to the hematoma. Proteasome represents a key component necessary for the activation of NF-κB. The aim of our present study was to examine if selective proteasome inhibition with a clinically relevant agent, -519, might influence the ICH pathogenesis, and improve functional outcome. ICH was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by the double blood injection method. -519 was administered intravenously 4 h and  min after induction of ICH. Behavioral testing was performed 3, 5, and 7 days later. The animals were sacrificed on day 7, and their brains were evaluated for hemorrhage size and  using immunohistochemistry with antibody to various inflammatory markers. Treatment with -519 significantly (p < .05) reduced behavioral impairment post-ICH as determined by the footfault test. This effect was not due to difference in ICH volume. The improved functional status of -519 treated animals correlated positively (p < .01) with reduced expression of astroglial iNOS in areas adjacent to the hemorrhage 7 days post-ICH. No delayed changes in expression of OX-42 and ED-1 (microglia/macrophages marker), or vimentin (intermediate filament; marker of astroglia activation) were detected in animals treated with -519. This data suggests that modulation of proteasome-activated processes may represent a strategic target for treatment of ICH in humans.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541723>Molecular, physiological and biochemical responses of Theobroma cacao L. genotypes to soil water deficit.</a></h2><p>Six months-old seminal plants of 36 cacao genotypes grown under greenhouse conditions were subjected to two soil water regimes (control and drought) to assess, the effects of water deficit on growth, chemical composition and oxidative stress. In the control, soil moisture was maintained near field capacity with leaf water potentials (ΨWL) ranging from -.1 to -.5 MPa. In the drought treatment, the soil moisture was reduced gradually by withholding additional water until ΨWL reached values of between -2. to -2.5 MPa. The tolerant genotypes -1319, MO-20 and MA- recorded significant increases in guaiacol peroxidase activity reflecting a more efficient antioxidant . In relation to drought tolerance, the most important variables in the distinguishing contrasting groups were: total leaf area per plant; leaf, stem and total dry biomass; relative growth rate; plant shoot biomass and leaf content of N, Ca, and Mg. From the results of these analyses, six genotypes were selected with contrasting characteristics for tolerance to soil water deficit [CC-40, C. SUL-4 and SIC-2 (non-tolerant) and MA-, MO-20, and PA-13 (tolerant)] for further assessment of the expression of genes NCED5, PP2C, psbA and psbO to water deficit. Increased expression of NCED5, PP2C, psbA and psbO genes were found for non-tolerant genotypes, while in the majority of tolerant genotypes there was repression of these genes, with the exception of PA-13 that showed an increased expression of psbA. Mutivariate analysis showed that growth variables, leaf and total dry biomass, relative growth rate as well as Mg content of the leaves were the most important factor in the classification of the genotypes as tolerant, moderately tolerant and sensitive to water deficit. Therefore these variables are reliable plant traits in the selection of plants tolerant to drought.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27435750>Photodynamic therapy effect on cell growth inhibition induced by Radachlorin and toluidine blue O on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli: An in vitro study.</a></h2><p>Photodynamic therapy is an innovative treatment modality, which is appropriate for tumor detection and for the treatment of cancer as well as nontumoral diseases, such as  (2), bacterial and viral eradication.Effect of two photosensitizer (toluidine blue O (TBO) and Radachlorin was investigated on Staphylococcus Aureus ATCC 25923 (American Type Culture Collection) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922).PDI by TBO caused S. aureus 5.83 log10 killing (P.Value<.0001) and reduce .08 log 10 in E. coli (P.Value=.321).

The bichromophoric species has been conceived to show potentialities for biological applications since a biocompatible disaccharide spacer, constituted of d-galactose and d-glucose derivatives, was used in compound 12 to connect two BODIPY units with different absorption/emission properties. The luminescence spectrum in acetonitrile of 12 shows an intense fluorescence band with a maximum at about 770 nm that is almost identical to that of the lowest- BODIPY, regardless of the excitation wavelength used. The quantum yield is .2 with an excited state lifetime of 2.5 ns. Excitation and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that a very efficient  transfer takes place in 12 from the highest- lying BODIPY subunit to the lowest- emissive BODIPY moiety, with a time constant of about 31 .

Fluorescence up-conversion studies on H2F20TPP were done demonstrating fluorescence dynamics over the whole spectral range from 440 to 650 nm when excited at 405 nm, 360.5 cm(-1) excess vibrational  of Soret band (411 nm). Single-exponential decay with ∼160 ± 50 fs lifetime of Soret fluorescence (also called S2 fluorescence or B band fluorescence) at around 440 nm was observed. On going from 440 nm, S2 fluorescence to S1 fluorescence, (Q-band) around 640 nm (wavelength of - transition in the stationary spectrum), single-exponential fluorescence time profile turns into a multiexponential time profile and it could be resolved critically into five-exponential components. An ultrafast rise component with ∼160 ± 50 fs followed by two decay components: a very fast decay component with 200 ± 50 fs time constant and another relatively slower 1.8 ± .5  decay component. Next, a very prominent rise component with 105 ± 30  lifetime followed by long-lived 10 ns decay component. The initial rise of S1 (Q-band) fluorescence around 640 nm agreed with the decay time of S2 (Soret or B band) fluorescence indicates that internal conversion (IC) from relaxed S2 to vibrationally excited S1 occurs in the ∼160 fs time scale and subsequent very fast decay with 200 fs time constant, which is assigned to be intramolecular vibrational dephasing or redistribution. The 1.8  decay component of S1 fluorescence is attributed to be "hot" fluorescence from vibrationally excited S1 state, and it reveals the vibrational relaxation time induced by elastic or quasi-elastic collision with solvent molecules. The 105  rise component is the creation time of the thermally equilibrated S1 state population, and it could be attributed either to an excited state conformational relaxation/intramolecular charge transfer or a molecular cooling process by dissipation of excess  within the solvent by inelastic collision. Finally, the decay of equilibrated S1(Qx state) occurs on 10 ns to S0 by fluorescence. Femtosecond resolved transient absorption studies on H2F20TPP in the spectral range 390-620 nm following both S2 (Soret band) and S1 (Qx) band excitation have been done and they complement the observations found in fluorescence up-conversion studies. The stimulated emission (SE) kinetics observed at 640 nm, S1 emission peak, in 2-10  time domain rebuilds a dynamic similar to that observed by fluorescence up-conversion study. The transient absorption kinetics upon S1 excitation were observed mainly to be biexponential with decay constants 105  and 10 ns, respectively. At a long time window (6 ns), a long-lived rise component could be predicted followed by two long-lived decay components for both the excitations in between 450 and 500 nm probe wavelengths. The lifetimes of these components were longer-lived than were possible to exactly measure using our existing femtosecond transient absorption system. However, this apparent rise component is assigned to be a Tn ← T1 transition, and the longest decay component is attributed to the lifetime of the T1 state.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297299>Comparison between normal saline and a polyelectrolyte solution for fluid resuscitation in severely dehydrated infants with acute diarrhoea.</a></h2><p>The optimal intravenous solution for rehydration of infants and children with severe dehydration is debated.The aim was to compare the efficacy of a polyelectrolyte solution (group ) with sodium chloride .9% solution (group NS) in rapid parenteral rehydration of severely dehydrated infants with acute diarrhoea.Primary outcomes were volume and time to hydration.

Quantifying the strength of a film-substrate interface can be challenging due to the brittleness of glassy films which can greatly complicate sample preparation, handling, and testing. Here, a method for measuring the adhesion of glassy thin films to soft elastomeric substrates is explored that exploits an understanding of surface buckling instabilities, specifically the transition from wrinkling to delamination. The adhesion (given by the critical strain  release rate (G)) for two model materials' interfaces is quantified by determining the critical delamination strain for thin glassy polymer films (polystyrene () and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) from an elastomeric substrate (poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS)). By accounting for edge defects that greatly reduce the critical strain for delamination, reasonable adjusted G values of 21. ± 5.1 mJ m and 32.2 ± 4.9 mJ m are found for -PDMS and PMMA-PDMS interfaces, respectively. The utilization of this method to characterize film modulus and adhesion could be used as a facile measurement technique for more applied polymer thin film systems.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26078573>Prevalence, significance and predictive value of antiphospholipid antibodies in Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>To assess the prevalence and stability of different antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) and their association with disease phenotype and progression in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients.About 458 consecutive patients [Crohn's disease (CD): 271 and ulcerative  (UC): 187] were enrolled into a follow-up cohort study in a tertiary IBD referral center in Hungary. Detailed clinical phenotypes were determined at enrollment by reviewing the patients' medical charts. Disease activity, medical treatment and data about evolvement of complications or surgical interventions were determined prospectively during the follow-up. Disease course (development f complicated disease phenotype and need for surgery), occurrence of thrombotic events, actual state of disease activity according to clinical, laboratory and endoscopic scores and accurate treatment regime were recorded during the follow-up, (median, 57.4 and 61.6 mo for CD and UC). Sera of IBD patients and 103 healthy controls (HC) were tested on individual anti-β2-Glycoprotein-I (anti-β2-GPI IgA/M/G), anti-cardiolipin (ACA IgA/M/G) and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (anti-/PT IgA/M/G) antibodies and also anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA IgA/G) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

No difference was found for the prevalence of anti-β2-GPI between different groups (7.2%-9.7%). In CD, no association was found between APLA and ASCA status of the patients. Occurrence of anti-β2-GPI, ACA and anti-/PT was not different between the group of patients with active vs inactive disease state according to appropriate clinical, laboratory and endoscopic scores in CD as well as in UC patients. All subtypes of anti-β2-GPI and ACA IgM status were found to be very stable over time, in contrast ACA IgG and even more ACA IgA status showed significant intraindividual changes.

Survey responses were examined descriptively. Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct donor groups based on response profiles across psychosocial domains. Potential predictors of response profiles were evaluated with regression analysis.Five hundred seventeen donors (66%) participated (M = 5.8 years postdonation, SD = 1.9). Fifteen percent to 48% of donors endorsed current donation-related physical health problems and concerns, and 7%-60% reported socioeconomic concerns (eg, insurance difficulties, financial expenditures). However, on average, donors experienced high psychological growth, and 90% felt positively about donation. Cluster analysis revealed 5 donor groups.

Sleep deprivation is linked to physical problems such as  but also to change in performance at school and mood disorders. Changes have been associated with the use of screens, cell phones, Internet and social media. Use of screens has been shown to delay sleep onset and melatonin secretion and stimulation of wake systems by interaction with social media may exacerbate these effects. The links between the use of social media and sleep patterns have not been fully explored. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of social media on teenagers' sleep and the impact of sleep deprivation.As part of a sleep education program conducted in middle schools, teenagers from 6th to 9th grade were invited to complete an online questionnaire on sleep habits with teacher supervision and after parental consent. Outcome measures were sleep and wake times with estimated sleep duration in school (SP) and rest periods (RP), use of screens (computers, tablets, smartphones and video game consoles), the use of social media and impact on visual analogue scales of sleep quality, mood and daytime functioning. Students were divided into those with clear sleep deprivation (sleep time<6hours in SP) and those whose sleep time was in line with the National Sleep Foundations recommended sleep needs for teenagers (9hours or more).A total of 786 questionnaires were completed and 776 were exploitable. Four schools took part with 408/786 girls (64.2 %) and a mean age of 12.4±1.24. Internet access was almost universal (98.3 %), 85.2 % had cell phones and 42.7 % had a personal computer in their bedroom. Social media was used by 64.6 %. After dinner, 52.6 % spent more than an hour and 14.7 % spent more than 2hours in front of a screen. After bedtime, 51.7 % regularly used electronic devices of which 25.6 % had a screen-based activity (e.g. texts, social media, video games or television).

A negative effect on mood was evident: in sleep, deprived teenagers irritability (5.28±3.12 vs. 3.30±2.34; P<.0001) and feelings of sadness (3.97±2.99 vs. 2.59±2.; P=.003) were more common. There was a clear association between sleep deprivation and access to screens and social media: sleep deprived teens were at more risk of nocturnal disruption with a higher prevalence of computers (67 % vs. 33 %; P<.0001), cell phones (99 % vs. 80 %; P=.0001) and smart phones (85 % vs. 66 %; P=.0001) in their bedrooms.Access to social media and especially a cell phone in teenagers' bedrooms is associated with a reduction in sleep time during the school week with negative effects on daily functioning and mood which increases with increasing age. Education about use of social media and sleep for teenagers needs to start early as modifications in sleep and evening use of screens was present on our population from 11years on and to involve parents as setting parent controlled bedtimes has been shown to increase teenage sleep time.Copyright © 2017 L'Encéphale, Paris.

The maximum advancing spreading pressure, Pimaxa, determined from adsorption isotherms decreases systematically with tauoa for methyl-terminated self-assembled monolayers (CH3 SAM, tauo=- mN/m), polystyrene spun-coated onto electronic-grade SiOx wafers (, tauo=7.2 mN/m), aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated SiOx surfaces (APTES, tauo = 42 mN/m), and fully water wettable SiOx (tauo=72 mN/m). Likewise, the apparent Gibbs' surface excess [Gammasl-Gammasv], which measures the difference in the amount of protein adsorbed Gamma (mol/cm2) at solid-vapor (SV) and solid-liquid (SL) interfaces, decreases with tauo from maximal values measured on the CH3 SAM surface through zero (no protein adsorption in excess of bulk solution concentration) near tauo=30 mN/m (thetaa=65 degrees). These latter results corroborate the conclusion drawn from independent studies that water is too strongly bound to surfaces with tauo>or=30 mN/m to be displaced by adsorbing protein and that, as a consequence, protein does not accumulate within the interfacial region of such surfaces at concentrations exceeding that of bulk solution ([Gammasl-Gammasv]= at tauo=30 mN/m). Results are collectively interpreted to mean that water controls protein adsorption to surfaces and that the mechanism of protein adsorption can be understood from this perspective for a diverse set of proteins with very different amino acid compositions.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19274786>Exocrine pancreatic function testing in patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic sufficiency: a correlation study.</a></h2><p>Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have pancreatic insufficiency; however, % of the patients are pancreatic sufficient ().

The gold standard to determine pancreatic function apart from direct pancreatic stimulation test is the 72-hour fecal  excretion, expressed as coefficient of  absorption (CFA). The aim was to test the correlation between 2 other tests, fecal elastase-1 and serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), as compared with fecal  excretion.21 patients with CF- performed the 3 tests of fecal  excretion, fecal elastase-1, and IRT. Correlation between the tests was evaluated by the kappa statistics test, sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.CFA was abnormal in 5 patients, elastase was <200microg/g in 4 patients, and IRT was <20 ng/mL in 2 patients. The correlation between CFA and IRT was negative(kappa=-.154), and between CFA and fecal elastase-1 was poor (kappa=.213). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of IRT versus CFA were %, 88%, %, and 78%, and for fecal elastase-1 were 40%, 81%, 40%, and 81%, respectively.In CF-, poor correlation was found between IRT, fecal elastase-1, and CFA, therefore neither fecal elastase-1 in the stool nor IRT in the serum reaches the sensitivity or the specificity of the fecal  excretion.

In the warm dense matter regime, experimental data are very scarce so that many theoretical models remain untested. Here we present the first thermal conductivity measurements of aluminum at .5-2.7 g/cc and 2-10 eV, using a recently developed platform of differential heating. A temperature gradient is induced in a Au/Al dual-layer target by proton heating, and subsequent heat flow from the hotter Au to the Al rear surface is detected by two simultaneous time-resolved diagnostics. A systematic data set allows for constraining both thermal conductivity and equation-of-state models.

Surgery with open healing by secondary intention typically is used to achieve the fastest healing time with minimal recurrence rates. A retrospective analysis was conducted of data extracted from the medical records of 73 consecutive patients who had symptomatic natal cleft  over a 10-year period to compare use of NPWT to alginate-based/gauze daily dressing (DD) changes in terms of healing time and recurrence. Variables extracted included age, gender,  wound diameter (small <1 cm, medium 1 cm to 3 cm, large >3 cm), and time in weeks to achieving the endpoint (epithelialization). Risk factors examined that can affect healing or recurrence of previously operated  disease included initial drainage before excision and risk factors for impaired healing (morbid  as determined by body mass index [BMI] ≥35, chronic infective skin conditions, and ongoing therapy with immuno-modulating drugs or chemotherapy), and loss to follow-up. Data were collected and analyzed using the chi-squared statistic, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression models. The total time of follow-up was 390 weeks for the DD group and 311 weeks for NPWT group. Patient mean age was 26.5 ± 10.7 years, most (53, 72.6%) were male, and 12 (16.4%) had comorbidities potentially affecting healing. Nine (9) were treated with primary closure and 62 patients were treated with open healing by secondary intention (2 additional patients receiving DD were excluded from the analysis because they had small sinuses that made NPWT unfeasible). Among participants, 30 (48%) received DD and 32 had NPWT. The median time to healing was 10 weeks (95% CI: 7-17) in the DD group and 8 weeks (95% CI: 7-9) in the NPWT group (not significantly different). In patients who healed, the average time to healing was . ± 18.1 and 9.8 ± 6.3 weeks in the DD and NPWT groups, respectively (not significantly different).

A self-assembled nanoprecipitation technique was used for preparing two types of core polymers poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) with lipid-PEG as stabilizer. The resulting nanoparticles had an average particle size of 88.5±3.4nm for PLGA and 215.±6.3nm for PHBV. Both nanoparticles exhibited a core-shell structure under TEM with high zeta potential and loading efficiency. X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed that the encapsulated pTHPP molecules in polymeric nanoparticles no longer had peaks of free pTHPP in the crystalline state. The pTHPP molecules encapsulated inside the polymeric core demonstrated improved photophysical properties in terms of singlet  generation and cellular uptake rate in a FTC-133 human thyroid carcinoma cell line, compared to non-encapsulated pTHPP. The pTHPP-loaded polymer-lipid-PEG nanoparticles showed better in vitro phototoxicity compared to free pTHPP, in both time- and concentration-dependent manners. Overall, this study provides detailed analysis of the photophysical properties of pTHPP molecules when entrapped within either PLGA or PHBV nanoparticle cores, and demonstrates the effectiveness of these systems for delivery of photosensitizers. The two polymeric systems may have different potential benefits, when used with cancer cells. For instance, the pTHPP-loaded PLGA system requires only a short time to show a PDT effect and may be suitable for topical PDT, while the delayed photo-induced cytotoxic effect of the pTHPP-loaded PHBV system may be more suitable for cancer solid tumors. Hence, both pTHPP-encapsulated polymer-lipid-PEG nanoparticles can be considered promising delivery systems for PDT cancer treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SERT BP maps in nine a priori defined ROIs exhibiting high SERT binding were compared between groups by means of a linear mixed model. Finally, adopted from structural and functional connectivity analyses, we performed correlational analyses using regional SERT binding potentials to examine molecular interregional associations between all selected ROIs. We observed significant differences in the interregional correlations between the precuneus and the hippocampus in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls, using SERT BP of the investigated ROIs (P < .05; Bonferroni corrected). When correlating SERT BP and age in the ADHD and the healthy control group, we confirmed an age-related decline in brain SERT binding in the thalamus and insula (R  = .284, R  = .167,  < .05; Bonferroni corrected). The results show significantly different interregional molecular associations of the SERT expression for the precuneus with hippocampus in patients with ADHD, indicating presumably altered functional coupling.

The rapid (microsecond) initial charging of the capacitor can be used to infer the dielectric constant of the solution. The much slower decay of current arising from the polarization of electrodes depends on the differential capacitance of the diffuse clouds of charge carriers accumulating next to each electrode and on the ohmic resistance of the fluid. Using the Gouy-Chapman model for the differential capacitance, Debye lengths of 80-600 nm were deduced that decrease with increasing concentration of PIBS. Values of the Debye lengths were confirmed by performing independent measurements of double-layer repulsion between a 6 microm polystyrene () latex sphere and a -coated glass plate using total internal reflection microscopy in the same solutions. The charge carriers appear to be inverted PIBS micelles having apparent Stokes diameters of 20-40 nm. Dynamic light scattering reveals a broad distribution of sizes having an intensity-averaged diameter of  nm. This smaller size might arise (1) from overestimating the electrophoretic mobility of micelles by treating them as point charges or (2) because charged micelles are larger on average than uncharged micelles. When Faradaic reactions and zeta potentials on the electrodes can be neglected, such current versus time experiments yield values for the Debye length and ionic strength with less effort than force measurements.

Retrospective review of the 61 consecutive patients who underwent ToF repair between January 2016 and September 2017 was performed. Median age, body , and median PVA (Z) at repair were 166 days (interquartile range, IQR, 141-182 days), 7.4 kg (IQR, 6.6-8. kg), and -1.83 (IQR, -2.56 to -.90), respectively. Upon AP, subvalvar and supravalvar obstructions were completely eliminated, leaving a pressure gradient only at the valve level. AP was achieved in 58 patients (95.1%). Pulmonary valve intervention comprised commissurotomy in 35 patients, commissurotomy with bougination in 8 patients, and transannular patching in 3 patients. For  patients, the pulmonary valve was left intact. Median PVA diameter measured by Hegar dilator after PV intervention was 8 mm (IQR, 7-9 mm), which was 3.9 mm (IQR, 2.3-4.3 mm) smaller than normal dimension and translated to a PVA (Z) of -1.85 (IQR, -2.40 to -.78). Postrepair right and left ventricular pressure ratio was .47 ± .12. During the median follow-up duration of 353 days (IQR, 191-482 days), 4 patients (including 3 who underwent transannular patching) developed significant pulmonary regurgitation. Freedom from reintervention for , significant , and PR at 1 year was 92.4%, 83.2%, and 90.6%, respectively. Optimal PVA for AP may be far smaller than the normal diameter. Minimizing PV intervention upon AP can prevent superfluous postoperative PR.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Among 414 patients who relapsed following R-CHOP, 96 received salvage chemotherapy alone [R - cohort]; and 318 received rituximab with chemotherapy [R + cohort] following a protocol amendment. The R-cohort had a higher proportion of patients with  ≥2 and relapse <1 year after R-CHOP. The response rate (45.6% vs. 25.%, p = .0003), CR/CRu (.7% vs. 4.2%, p = .003) and transplantation rate (51.9% vs. 31.3%, p = .0004) was higher in the R + cohort. Event-free (27% vs. 22%, p = .0954) and overall survival at four years (43% vs. 31%; p = .045) were greater in the R + cohort when the patients with best response SD/PD to R-CHOP were excluded. Addition of rituximab to salvage therapy before ASCT appears to improve the response rate, transplantation rate, and overall survival in patients with CD20+ lymphoma who responded to R-CHOP.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25196500>Acute kidney injury induced by various pneumoperitoneum pressures in a rabbit model of mild and severe hydronephrosis.</a></h2><p>Increased pneumoperitoneum pressure during laparoscopic surgery can result in acute kidney injury. We aimed to clarify whether intraabdominal pressure tolerance is modified in various degrees of unilateral kidney hydronephrosis in rabbits.A total 90 rabbits were randomly allocated to three groups (group PN, PM and , i.e. rabbits with no, mild and severe hydronephrosis, respectively, subjected to intraabdominal pressures). Rabbits in group PM (n=30) and group  (n=30) underwent a surgical procedure inducing a mild or severe left hydronephrosis. Rabbits in all groups were then allocated to 5 subgroups. Then, they were subjected to intraabdominal pressures of , 6, 9, 12, and  mm Hg, respectively. Acute kidney injury was assessed by measuring serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), tubular cell apoptosis, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr-61/CCN1) expression.Acute kidney injury with increased tubular apoptosis and KIM-1 and Cyr-61 expression occurred when intraabdominal pressure reached ,  and 9 mm Hg in PN, PM and  groups, respectively. The Scr and BUN levels were similar in all groups.In rabbits, kidneys with severe hydronephrosis were more likely to suffer acute injury when they were exposed to pneumoperitoneal pressure.© 2014 S.

AYC aqueous coating onto granules and film formation mechanism of AYC.</a></h2><p>From the viewpoint of effective utilization of natural resources and development of new pharmaceutical materials, acid-treated yeast cell wall (AYC) was prepared via a novel approach involving acidification of brewers' yeast cell wall. AYC aqueous dispersion containing 5% (w/v) AYC and .5% (w/v) glycerol was prepared. Subsequently, AYC was coated onto core granules containing acetaminophen (AAP). Spray mist size under various spray conditions and viscosity of the AYC aqueous dispersion at various AYC concentrations were measured. AYC spray mists were optically observed. The surface of AYC cast film and AYC-coated granules were observed with a confocal scanning laser microscope. We attempted to show the utility of AYC as a novel material for granule coating, following the tablet coating in our previous report. In addition, the film formation mechanism of AYC was investigated. A smooth surface of the AYC-coated granules was obtained at a coating ratio of only 5%, which generally requires approximately -30% coating against the core granule , with no aggregation. These results are attributable to the fact that the granules were coated with a large number of small mists of AYC and the coating progressed efficiently, and the thin film layer of AYC was formed on the granules by mutual tangling of the hydrogel layers of AYC polysaccharides. AAP release from AYC-coated granules was obviously rapid, suggesting the high utility of AYC as a coating material for the rapidly releasing granules.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366864>Differential Gene Expression across Breed and Sex in Commercial Pigs Administered Fenbendazole and Flunixin Meglumine.</a></h2><p>Characterizing the variability in transcript levels across breeds and sex in swine for genes that play a role in drug  may shed light on breed and sex differences in drug . The objective of the study is to determine if there is heterogeneity between swine breeds and sex in transcript levels for genes previously shown to play a role in drug  for animals administered flunixin meglumine or fenbendazole. Crossbred nursery female and castrated male pigs (n = 169) spread across 5 groups were utilized. Sires (n = ) of the pigs were purebred Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire or Hampshire boars mated to a common sow population. Animals were randomly placed into the following treatments: no drug (control), flunixin meglumine, or fenbendazole. One hour after the second dosing, animals were sacrificed and liver samples collected. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to measure liver gene expression of the following genes: SULT1A1, ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP3A22 and CYP3A29. The control animals were used to investigate baseline transcript level differences across breed and sex. Post drug administration transcript differences across breed and sex were investigated by comparing animals administered the drug to the controls. Contrasts to determine fold change were constructed from a model that included fixed and random effects within each drug. Significant (P-value <.007) basal transcript differences were found across breeds for SULT1A1, CYP3A29 and CYP3A22. Across drugs, significant (P-value <.0038) transcript differences existed between animals given a drug and controls across breeds and sex for ABCB1,  and CYP1A2. Significant (P <.0038) transcript differences across breeds were found for CYP2E1 and SULT1A1 for flunixin meglumine and fenbendazole, respectively. The current analysis found transcript level differences across swine breeds and sex for multiple genes, which provides greater insight into the relationship between flunixin meglumine and fenbendazole and known drug metabolizing genes.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275596>Early  loss in a standalone mHealth intervention predicting treatment success.</a></h2><p>Early  loss is a strong predictor of longer-term and clinically meaningful  loss but has not been studied in the context of mobile health ('mHealth') interventions.GoalTracker was a randomized trial among adults (21-65 years) with overweight or obesity comparing three 12-week standalone mHealth interventions for  loss.

Collapsing across arms, this analysis examined participants with a 1-month  ( = 84), categorizing them as either early responders (≥2%  loss at 1 month) or early non-responders (<2%  loss at 1 month).Early responders - 36% of participants - had greater per cent  change at 3 months (-5.93% [95% confidence interval: -6.82%, -5.03%]) than early non-responders (-1.45% [-2.%, -.75%]), which was sustained at 6 months (-5.91% [-7.33%, -4.48%] vs. -1.28% [-2.37%, -.19%]; s < .0001). Over half (57%) of early responders achieved ≥5%  loss at 3 months vs. 11% of early non-responders.

The secondary aims were to find whether any difference existed between: i) age groups, ii) performance status scores, iii) patients who had lost  versus those who had not. Eighty-four elderly patients with advanced cancer were included in the study (stage III .4%, and stage IV 72.6%). Serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were significantly higher in elderly than in the other adult cancer patients. Among the CGA variables investigated, the most affected were functional status assessed by IADL, cognitive functions by MMSE and nutrition. The ECOG  was shown to be significantly associated with all the dimensions of CGA investigated: poor  (>/=2) corresponded to severe disabilities. As for the relationship of serum IL-6 with CGA variables, the strongest correlations were between IL-6 and functional status assessed by both Katz ADL (p=.0003), IADL (p=.0070) and nutrition (p=.0013). Moreover, we observed an association, although not statistically significant, between functional disability (ADL and IADL) and high IL-6 levels in individuals with  loss. IL-6 levels seem to be independently associated with all CGA variables investigated in the present study in a population of elderly cancer patients. Because the most important CGA variables, in particular functional status, have been observed to be strongly associated with survival, the present study, confirming our previously reported ones, suggests that IL-6 may be a reliable marker of disease outcome and supports the feasibility of using IL-6 as a sensitive outcome marker in studies based on novel approaches aiming at modifying age- and cancer-related biologic mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p></html>
