While chemical synthesis often leads to undesired racemic mixtures, microbial production allows obtaining optically pure lactones. The production of a specific lactone by biotransformation depends on the supply of the corresponding hydroxy fatty acid, which has economic and industrial value similar to γ-lactones. Hence, the identification and exploration of microorganisms with the rare natural ability for de novo biosynthesis of lactones will contribute to the long-term sustainability of microbial production. In this study, the innate ability of Ashbya gossypii for de novo production of γ-lactones from glucose was evaluated and improved.Characterization of the volatile organic compounds produced by nine strains of this industrial filamentous fungus in glucose-based medium revealed the noteworthy presence of seven chemically different γ-lactones. To decipher and understand the de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones from glucose, we developed metabolic engineering strategies focused on the fatty acid biosynthesis and the β-oxidation pathways. Overexpression of AgDES589, encoding a desaturase for the conversion of oleic acid (C18:1) into linoleic acid (C18:2), and deletion of AgELO624, which encodes an elongase that catalyses the formation of C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acids, greatly increased the production of γ-lactones (up to 6.4-fold; (7.6 ± 0.8) × 10 µg/g). Further substitution of AgPOX1, encoding the exclusive acyl-CoA oxidase in A. gossypii, by a codon-optimized POX2 gene from Yarrowia lipolytica, which encodes a specific long chain acyl-CoA oxidase, fine-tuned the biosynthesis of γ-decalactone to a relative production of more than 99%.This study demonstrates the potential of A. gossypii as a model and future platform for de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones. By means of metabolic engineering, key enzymatic steps involved in their production were elucidated. Moreover, the combinatorial metabolic engineering strategies developed resulted in improved de novo biosynthesis of γ-decalactone. In sum, these proof-of-concept data revealed yet unknown metabolic and genetic determinants important for the future exploration of the de novo production of γ-lactones as an alternative to biotransformation processes.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28238071>Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 is involved in γ-decalactone release from peach (Prunus persica) fruit.</a></h2><p>γ-Decalactone accumulation in peach mesocarp was highly correlated with ACX enzyme activity and natural PpACX1 content. Adding the purified recombinant PpACX1 induced γ-decalactone biosynthesis in cultured mesocarp discs in vitro. Previous gene expression studies have implied that acyl coenzyme A oxidase (ACX) is related to lactones synthesis, the characteristic aroma compounds of peach. Here, we analysed the correlation between γ-decalactone content and ACX enzyme activity in mesocarp of five different types of fully ripe peach varieties. Furthermore, 'Hu Jing Mi Lu' ('HJ') and 'Feng Hua Yu Lu' ('YL'), which have strong aroma among them, at four ripening stages were selected to study the role of ACX in lactone biosynthesis. The result showed that γ-decalactone was the most abundant lactone compound. γ-Decalactone accumulation was highly correlated with ACX enzyme activity. Mass spectrometry (MS) showed that PpACX1 was the most abundant PpACX protein in fully ripe mesocarp of cv. 'HJ'. To further elucidate the function of the PpACX1 protein, the PpACX1 gene was heterologously expressed in a bacterial system and characterized in vitro. MS identification gave the molecular  of the recombinant PpACX1 as 94.44 kDa and the coverage rate of the peptide segments was 47.3%. In cultured mesocarp discs in vitro, adding the purified recombinant PpACX1 and C-CoA substrate induced the expected γ-decalactone biosynthesis. Using a sandwich ELISA based on mixed mono- and polyclonal antibodies against recombinant PpACX1, PpACX1 content in mesocarp was found to be highly correlated with γ-decalactone accumulation in mesocarp of five fully ripe varieties and four ripening stages of 'HJ' and 'YL'. This study revealed the vital function of PpACX1 in γ-decalactone biosynthesis in peach fruit.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29548792>Effect of flavoring chemicals on free radical formation in electronic cigarette aerosols.</a></h2><p>Flavoring chemicals, or flavorants, have been used in electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) since their inception; however, little is known about their toxicological effects. Free radicals present in e-cigarette aerosols have been shown to induce oxidative stress resulting in damage to proliferation, survival, and  pathways in the cell. Aerosols generated from e-liquid solvents alone contain high levels of free radicals but few studies have looked at how these toxins are modulated by flavorants.We investigated the effects of different flavorants on free radical production in e-cigarette aerosols.Free radicals generated from 49 commercially available e-liquid flavors were captured and analyzed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The flavorant composition of each e-liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS). Radical production was correlated with flavorant abundance. Ten compounds were identified and analyzed for their impact on free radical generation.Nearly half of the flavors modulated free radical generation. Flavorants with strong correlations included β-damascone, δ-tetradecalactone, γ-decalactone, citral, dipentene, ethyl maltol, ethyl vanillin, ethyl vanillin PG acetal, linalool, and piperonal. Dipentene, ethyl maltol, citral, linalool, and piperonal promoted radical formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Ethyl vanillin inhibited the radical formation in a concentration dependent manner. Free radical production was closely linked with the capacity to oxidize biologically-relevant lipids.Our results suggest that flavoring agents play an important role in either enhancing or inhibiting the production of free radicals in flavored e-cigarette aerosols. This information is important for developing regulatory strategies aimed at reducing potential harm from e-cigarettes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The pattern of fractional uptake differed between the chemicals and did not show the often assumed inverse correlation with surface loading. Furthermore, the mass uptake of identical cumulative amounts of the chemicals was not always additive. These results show that the uptake of fragrances in absence of occlusion and at finite loadings is chemical-specific and depends on the surface loading, the application scheme, and most probably, on the effects of the chemicals on the skin barrier efficiency. The observed lack of additivity might explain some of the differences in the responses observed in patch and repeated open application tests, and the boosting of the allergic state in sensitized individuals by sub-clinical exposures.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They catalyze the hydrolysis of epoxide containing lipids and are involved in crucial mechanisms, such as the detoxification of xenobiotics or the regulation of  and blood pressure. Here, we describe a function of a putative EH gene in the biosynthesis of a sex attractant in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis and use this gene to localize the site of pheromone production. Males of this parasitic wasp release a mixture of (4R,5R)-( threo-) and (4R,5S)-( erythro-)5-hydroxy-4-decanolide (HDL) to attract virgin females. Using a stable isotope labeled precursor, we demonstrated that vernolic acid ( erythro-12,13-epoxy-octadec-9Z-enoic acid) is converted by N. vitripennis males to threo-HDL. This suggested the involvement of an EH in hydrolyzing the fatty acid epoxide under inversion of the stereochemistry into the respective diol, which might be further processed by chain shortening and lactonization to HDL. We cloned a putative N. vitripennis EH gene (Nasvi-EH1) encoding 470 amino acids and localized its transcripts in the male rectal papillae by in situ RT-PCR. Chemical analyses and histological studies confirmed that males synthesize the sex attractant in the rectal vesicle and release it via the anal orifice. Involvement of Nasvi-EH1 in HDL biosynthesis was established by RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Injection of Nasvi-EH1 dsRNA into male abdomens inhibited pheromone biosynthesis by 55% and suppressed the targeted gene transcripts in the rectal vesicle by 95%.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578432>Yarrowia lipolytica: a beneficious yeast in biotechnology as a rare opportunistic fungal pathogen: a minireview.</a></h2><p>Yarrowia lipolytica is one of the most studied "non-conventional" yeast species capable of synthesizing a wide group of valuable metabolites, in particular lipases and other hydrolytic enzymes, microbial oil, citric acid, erythritol and γ-decalactone. Processes based on the yeast have GRAS status ("generally recognized as safe") given by Food and Drug Administration. The majority of research communications regarding to Y. lipolytica claim that the yeast species is non-pathogenic. In spite of that, Y. lipolytica, like other fungal species, can cause infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. The yeast possess features that facilitate invasion of the host cell (particularly production of hydrolytic enzymes), as well as the protection of the own cells, such as biofilm formation. The aim of this study was to present well-known yeast species Y. lipolytica as a rare opportunistic fungal pathogen. Possible pathogenicity and epidemiology of this yeast species were discussed. Antifungal drugs susceptibility and increasing resistance to azoles in Y. lipolytica yeasts were also presented.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012990>Gamma-decanolactone inhibits iNOS and TNF-alpha production by lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia in N9 cells.</a></h2><p>Activated microglia that produce reactive nitrogen species (RNS), inflammatory factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other neurovirulent factors may lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Certain compounds can inhibit the activation of microglia. However, these mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of Gamma-decanolactone (GD) on the production of reactive oxygen species and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - stimulated N9 murine microglial cells through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The results showed that GD attenuated the activation of N9 cells and inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species and the expression of iNOS and TNF-α induced by LPS in the cells. In addition, GD blocked the phosphorylation of p38 and inhibited cleaved caspase-9 and DNA damage. These data indicate that GD has therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and that it exerts its effects by inhibiting .Copyright © 2016.

The models built upon previously developed self-assembled lipid membranes which have composition and 3D organization similar to those of the lipid matrix in SC. In one model the target chemicals were incorporated in the lipids before their self-assembly, and in the other one they were applied on top of a preformed lipid membrane. The chemicals could be incorporated within the model membranes in quantities close to those reached within human SC upon heavy surface loading. The dose-dependent effects of the chemicals on the lateral molecular organization in the models were qualitatively identical to those observed by infrared spectroscopy in human SC. The models facilitated the interpretation of X-ray diffraction profiles used to determine the nature of the interactions between the chemicals and the lipid lamellae and the position of the exogenous molecules within the unit cell of the lipid phases. These model systems are suitable for in vitro studies in the areas of skin biophysics, dermatology, transdermal drug delivery, and risk assessment.© 2013.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'barrier function', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12174611>[Study on difference in olfactory response in dysosmia patients].</a></h2><p>Using 1952 dysosmia patients, we studied the difference in olfactory response to 5 types of odorous substances used in the standard olfactory acuity test in Japan--beta-phenyl ethyl alcohol, methyl cyclopentenolone, isovaleric acid, , and scatol. Olfactory dysfunctions included 887 patients with chronic paranasal sinusitis, 255 with allergic rhinitis, 326 with common cold sequela, 77 with complications from head injuries, 28 with drug-induced dysosmia, 39 with congenital dysosmia, 257 with dysosmia of unknown etiology, and 83 miscellaneous. The standard olfactory acuity test before treatment indicated that 82 patients detected only one odor within the detection threshold and 157 within the recognition threshold; 40 responded only to isovaleric acid at the detection threshold and 101 at the recognition threshold. Both figures were significantly greater than those who responded to other odors (p < 0.01). No specific trends were noted in etiologies of dysosmia that allowed smelling of isovaleric acid only either at the detection or recognition threshold. Among those whose olfactory thresholds were judged to be scaled out against all 5 odorous substances, 552 were rated as scaled out at the detection threshold and 630 at the recognition threshold. During post treatment, 33 scaled out at the detection threshold and 32 scaled out at the recognition threshold improved enough to smell 1 type of odor. Of these, 15 scaled out at the detection threshold and 13 scaled out at the recognition threshold became able to smell only isovaleric acid. Those becoming able to smell only isovaleric acid either at the detection or recognition threshold, significantly outnumbered those becoming able to smell other odors (p < 0.01). No outstanding cause of dysosmia was seen in those able to smell isovaleric acid. This data indicates that olfactory function for detecting isovaleric acid is relatively resistant to disease and is most likely to be restored. The difference in olfactory response of patients with olfactory dysfunction such as those above may be due to variations in the number of olfactory receptor proteins for specific odors within olfactory cells or different responses to the type of molecules of odor-emitting substances.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28969582>Gamma-Decanolactone Improves Biochemical Parameters Associated with Pilocarpine-Induced Seizures in Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Gamma-decanolactone (GD) is a monoterpene effective against seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. The mechanism of action of GD is likely to be via glutamate antagonism. GD also inhibits intracellular reactive  species (ROS) generation and the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in vitro. Considering the neuropharmacological profile of GD studied so far, we investigated the effect of intraperitoneal administration of GD 100 and 300 mg/kg on pilocarpine (PIL)-induced status epilepticus (SE) in mice.GD was administered 30 min before PIL. Behavioral (latency to first seizure and the percentage of clonic forelimb seizures), biochemical, and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated. DNA damage in the cerebral cortex of mice was assessed using the comet assay and mutagenic activity of GD was evaluated using Salmonella/microsome assay in TA100, TA98, TA97a, TA102, and TA1535 strains, with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix).The behavioral results showed that only the latency to the first clonic seizure increased in the groups treated with GD 300 mg/kg, but not when the animals received GD 100 mg/kg. Both GD doses were able to increase superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, inducing a decrease in ROS and nitrite production and in DNA damage in the cerebral cortex. GD was not able to induce base pair substitution and frameshift mutations in the absence or in the presence of metabolic activation.These findings demonstrate that GD does not improve behavioral parameters in the PIL model, but it was able to protect seizure-related oxidative stress and DNA damage in mice, without inducing gene mutations.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p></html>
