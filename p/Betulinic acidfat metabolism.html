Px rats were provided with a high-fat diet containing 0.6% KME-E, 0.6% KME-W, and 0.6% dextrin (control) for 8 weeks. As normal-control, Sham-operated rats were provided with 0.6% dextrin. In cell-based studies, the effects of its main terpenoids (betulin, , and oleanolic acid) on glucose  were measured. Both KME-W and KME-E decreased epididymal fat mass by increasing fat oxidation in diabetic rats. KME-E but not KME-W exhibited greater potentiation of first-phase insulin secretion than the Px-control in a hyperglycemic clamp. KME-E also made β-cell mass greater than the control by increasing β-cell proliferation and decreasing its apoptosis. In a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, whole-body glucose infusion rate and hepatic glucose output increased with potentiating hepatic insulin signaling in the following order: Px-control, KME-W, KME-E, and normal-control. Betulin potentiated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via increased PPAR-γ activity and insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas oleanolic acid enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cell proliferation in insulinoma cells. In conclusion, KME-E prevented the deterioration of glucose  in diabetic rats more effectively than KME-W and KME-E can be a better therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes than KME-W.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27600166>Beneficial effect of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tuber on experimental ulcerative colitis in rats.</a></h1><p>The tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson (Araceae), commonly called Suran or Jimmikand, has high medicinal value and is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of different gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders.The present study evaluated the effects of extracts of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tubers on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats.Wistar rats were orally administered methanol extract (APME) or aqueous extract (APAE) (250 and 500 mg/kg) or standard drug, prednisolone (PRDS) (4 mg/kg) for 7 days. On 6th day of treatment, UC was induced by transrectal instillation of 4% acetic acid (AA) and after 48 h colitis was assessed by measuring colitis parameters, biochemical estimations and histology of colon.APME or APAE pretreatment significantly (p < .05-.001) prevented AA-induced reduction in body weight and increase in colitis parameters viz. stool consistency, colon weight/length ratio and ulcer score, area and index. Extracts treatment attenuated (p < .001) increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum and myeloperoxidase activity and cytokines in colon tissue due to AA administration. Extracts treatment prevented AA-induced elevation in lipid peroxidation and decline in activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduced-glutathione content (p < .05-.001) along with histopathological alterations. PRDS also showed similar ameliorative effect on colitis.APME and APAE showed a preventive effect on UC, and ameliorated inflammation and oxidative damage in colon. The effects may be attributed to presence of phytochemicals, , β-sitosterol, and glucomannan. In conclusion, the tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited an anticolitic effect through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27426509>Curative effect of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tuber on experimental hemorrhoids in rats.</a></h1><p>Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson (Family- Araceae) is a crop of south East Asian origin. In India, its tuber is widely used in ethnomedicinal practices by different tribes for the treatment of piles (hemorrhoids).The present study evaluated the effect of methanolic and aqueous extract of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tuber on croton oil induced hemorrhoids in rats.The methanolic extract was standardized with the major phenolic compound, , by HPLC. The hemorrhoids were induced by applying 6% croton oil preparation in the ano-rectal region. Rats were orally administered methanolic and aqueous extract at doses of 250 and 500mg/kg, each for 7 days. Pilex (200mg/kg) was used as reference anti-hemorrhoidal drug. Hemorrhoids were assessed on eighth day by measuring hemorrhoidal and biochemical parameters along with histology of ano-rectal tissue.Croton oil application caused induction of hemorrhoids as indicated by significant (p<0.001) increase in plasma exudation of Evans blue in ano-rectal tissue, macroscopic severity score and ano-rectal coefficient as compared to normal rats. It significantly (p<0.001) elevated lactate dehydrogenase and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) levels in serum and increased myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation in ano-rectal tissue along with marked histological damage as compared to normal rats. Treatment with tuber extracts and pilex significantly (p<0.05-p<0.001) ameliorated Evans blue exudation, hemorrhoidal parameters and other biochemical parameters with attenuation of tissue damage compared to hemorrhoid control rats. The results indicate that tuber extracts exhibited curative action on hemorrhoids. The aqueous extract showed more pronounced effect than methanolic extract. The effects may be attributed to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Results indicate that tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited curative action on hemorrhoids through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The study validates the ethnomedicinal use of tuber in hemorrhoids and implicates its therapeutic potential as an anti-hemorrhoidal agent.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

There is a dearth of information of its effect in testis. This study evaluated the protective role of  (BA) against NDMA-induced redox imbalance in testes of rats.Twenty-four male rats were assigned into four groups and treated with normal saline, BA, NDMA and [BA+NDMA]. BA (25 mg/kg) was given for 14 days, while NDMA (5 mg/kg) was given on days 7 and 12.Administration of NDMA significantly increased the weight and relative weight of testes by 51 and 71%, respectively, while treatment with BA attenuated the weight-gain. Furthermore, NDMA decreased the sperm count, motility and live-dead ratio by 57, 36 and 37%, respectively, and increased total sperm abnormality by 56%. However, BA attenuated the changes in the spermiogram of NDMA-treated rats. NDMA significantly decreased the activities of antioxidative enzymes, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones, while testicular levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and total cholesterol were increased. Also, NDMA increased the activities of aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine-N-demethylase. Supplementation with BA attenuated NDMA-induced alteration in these biochemical indices.BA protects against NDMA-induced redox imbalance via activation of antioxidative pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127036>Antitumor drug effect of  mediated by polyethylene glycol modified liposomes.</a></h1><p> (BA), as a natural pentacyclic lupine-type triterpene, principally derives from bark of white birch, due to its potent pharmacological properties and low side-effect, which has been demonstrated a prominent efficiency on cancer therapy. However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability limit its pharmaceutical effect. Herein, we reported the rapid efficient synthesis of the polyethylene glycol modified (PEGylated) BA liposomes using ethanol injection technique for the first time. In the study, hydrophobic BA was encapsulated in the lipid bilayer of liposomes, meanwhile hydrophilic PEG layer covered the surface of liposomes. The mean diameter of PEGylated BA liposomes was 142nm, which can effectively accumulate in the tumor tissues. In vitro drug release study showed that the PEGylated BA liposomes had a better sustained drug release effect than BA liposomes. The PEGylated BA liposomes also exhibited a better tumor inhibitory effect compared with those of free BA or BA liposomes in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, the PEGylated BA liposomes could serve as a better alternative for the cancer therapy in future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have indicated that TGF-β responsiveness is determined by TGF-β receptor partitioning between lipid raft/caveolae-mediated and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Lipid raft/caveolae-mediated endocytosis facilitates TGF-β degradation and thus suppressing TGF-β responsiveness. By contrast, clathrin-mediated endocytosis results in Smad2/3-dependent endosomal signaling, thereby promoting TGF-β responsiveness. Because  shares a similar chemical structure with cholesterol and has been reported to insert into the plasma membrane, we speculate that  changes the fluidity of the plasma membrane and modulates the signaling pathway associated with membrane microdomains. We propose that  modulates TGF-β responsiveness by changing the partitioning of TGF-β receptor between lipid-raft/caveolae and non-caveolae microdomain on plasma membrane.We employed sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation and confocal microscopy to determine membrane localization of TGF-β receptors and used a luciferase assay to examine the effects of  in TGF-β-stimulated promoter activation. In addition, we perform western blotting to test TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and fibronectin production. induces translocation of TGF-β receptors from lipid raft/caveolae to non-caveolae microdomains without changing total level of TGF-β receptors. The -induced TGF-β receptors translocation is rapid and correlate with the TGF-β-induced PAI-1 reporter gene activation and growth inhibition in Mv1Lu cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27773704>Membrane damage by  provides insights into cellular aging.</a></h1><p>Cell senescence is a process of central importance to the understanding of aging as well as to the development of new drugs. It is related with genomic instability, which has been shown to occur in the presence of autophagy deficiency. Yet, the mechanism that triggers genomic instability and senescence from a condition of autophagy deficiency remains unknown. By analyzing the consequences of treating human keratinocytes (HaCaT) with the pentacyclic triterpenoid  (BA) we were able to propose that cell senescence can develop as a response to parallel damage in the membranes of mitochondria and lysosome.We performed biochemical, immunocytochemical and cytometric assays after challenging HaCaT cells with BA. We also evaluated membrane leakage induced by BA in liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles.By destabilizing lipid bilayers of mitochondria and lysosomes, BA triggers the misbalance in the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis leading to perceived autophagy impairment, lipofuscinogenesis, genomic instability and cell senescence. The progressive accumulation of mitochondria and lipofuscin, which comes from imperfect mitophagy triggered by BA, provides a continuous source of reactive species further damaging lysosomes and leading to cell aging.This work reveals that the initial trigger of cell senescence can be the physical damage in the membranes of lysosomes and mitochondria.This concept will help in the search of new drugs that act as senescence-inductors. BA is under evaluation as chemotherapeutic agent against several types of tumors and induction of cell senescence should be considered as one of its main mechanisms of action.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Skeels, ameliorates the proteinuria in experimental membranous nephropathy through regulating Nrf2/NF-κB pathways.</a></h1><p>Membranous nephropathy (MN) is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the kidney.  (BA) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound isolated from the leaves of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BA on experimental MN in rats and explored the mechanisms by which it enhances antioxidant activities and resolves inflammatory condition in experimental MN. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single tail vein injection of anti- Fx1A antiserum. The rats were orally administered BA (25 and 50 mg kg  d ) or dexamethasone (DEX; 0.07 mg kg-1, reference compound) for 4 weeks after the induction of PHN. Blood, urine, and kidney tissue were collected for analysis at the end of the study. Treatment of PHN rats with BA or DEX significantly attenuated renal dysfunction, histopathological alterations and reduced immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Furthermore, BA ameliorated mRNA and protein expression of NF-κB, iNOS, TNF-α, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 in the kidney. BA also restored malondialdehyde level and antioxidant enzyme activities in the kidney. In a nutshell, the protective effect of BA can be explained by its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, which in turn is due to downregulation of NF-κB pathway and activation of Nrf2. The results indicated that BA can effectively suppress experimental PHN in rats by regulating Nrf2/NF-κB pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains to be elucidated, and no established therapeutic regimens for treating NAFLD exist. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main cellular energy sensor, has been implicated as a key regulator of hepatic  and glucose . Recently, emerging evidence indicates that many plant-derived natural products are capable of ameliorating NAFLD by targeting AMPK.The published literature in PubMed relating to this topic was searched through June 2016.Significant advances have been made with respect to understanding the protective effects of plant-derived natural products against NAFLD. A variety of natural products, including alkaloids (berberine, demethyleneberberine, nicotine, caffeine, etc.), polyphenols (resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, caffeic acid, etc.) and other compounds (β- caryophyllene, gastrodin, compound K, , etc.), have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies. Mechanistic studies of these compounds have focused on their activation of AMPK and its downstream effectors involved in .The findings of this review confirm that plant-derived natural products capable of activating the AMPK signaling pathway are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26542288> downregulates expression of oxidative stress-induced lipoprotein lipase via the PKC/ERK/c-Fos pathway in RAW264.7 macrophages.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis is a major cause of coronary artery disease, which is characterized by cellular lipid accumulation. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in lipid . Studies have shown that macrophage-derived LPL exhibits proatherogenic properties, and plays a major role in lipid accumulation in macrophages. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress can effectively enhance macrophage LPL production.  (BA) is a pentacyclic lupane triterpene with a potent antioxidant activity. In this study, we investigated whether BA affects the expression of macrophage LPL and how it regulates cellular lipid accumulation.We revealed that BA downregulated H2O2-simulated macrophage LPL protein, mRNA levels and its activity in both concentration- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, BA decreased LPL-involved total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in macrophages. In addition, cellular lipid staining by Oil Red O showed that BA decreased cellular lipid droplet deposition. Next, we confirmed that pretreatment with BA decreased H2O2-induced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that BA inhibited H2O2-induced membrane translocation of PKC, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Fos. Finally, the induction of LPL production and activity by H2O2 was abolished by BA, inhibition of PKC or ERK or depletion c-Fos, respectively.BA, through its role of antioxidant activity, attenuated macrophage-derived LPL expression and activity induced by oxidative stress, and effectively reduced cellular lipid accumulation, likely through inhibition of the  involving PKC, ERK and c-Fos. These effects of BA may contribute to its mitigation of atherosclerosis and help develop BA as a therapeutic compound in treatment of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The FA-functionalized liposomes loaded with  (BA) (FA-L-BA) were prepared by thin  film method. The FA-L-BA was characterized by their morphology, particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE), stability, cell cytotoxicity and cellular uptake. The average size of FA-L-BA was 222±8 nm. The spherical particles exhibited a negative electrical charge of -20.12±1.45 mV and high EE of 91.61%±1.16%.

(BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to have a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study was designed to determine whether BA could prevent atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (ApoE KO) mice. The mice were treated with BA for 12 weeks to examine its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Male ApoE KO mice and age-matched control group mice (C57BL/6Jms) were used as experimental systems and their systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation were measured. BA-treated ApoE KO mice showed lowered systolic blood pressure. The  parameter showed that BA decreased blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Blood glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance results, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were found to be better in BA-treated ApoE KO mice than untreated ApoE KO mice. Consistent with the change in lipid profiles, oil red O and H&E staining revealed that treatment with BA reduced atherosclerotic lesions such as roughened endothelial layers. BA ameliorated the reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, leading to the inhibition of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) expression. These results suggest that BA may be useful in the treatment and prevention of early atherosclerosis via the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ApoE KO mice.Copyright © 2017.

(BA), an antioxidant prepared from the white birch, exhibits immunomodulation properties. To assess the implications and investigate the mechanisms of BA-elicited immunomodulation, we hypothesized that Dex induced thymocyte apoptosis via oxidative stress could be lessened by BA.Mice were given oral doses of BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and induced oxidative stress by giving a single dose of Dex intraperitoneal at the dosage of 25mg/kg body weight 8h after the last administration of BA.Dex administration alone significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, while significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caspase-3 activation and cellular apoptosis. However, pretreatment with BA dose-dependently mitigated Dex-induced oxidative damage after 14 days of feeding. In addition to ROS scavenging activity in Dex-induced thymocyte, BA administration decreased lipid peroxidation, up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, restored mitochondrial function, increased Bcl-2 expression but reduced Bax expression, inhibited caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival.These findings reveal a protective capability of BA against Dex-induced cell death by reducing oxidative stress via mitochondrial mediated signal pathway which could be the potential mechanism underlying BA-elicited immunomodulation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations of betulin,  and ursolic acid against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are 1024-, 256- and 1024-μg/mL; 512-, 256- and 256 μg/mL; 256-, 256- and 64 μg/mL respectively. Cell viability of betulin-, - and ursolic acid-treated bacteria decrease in time dependent manner. Treatment of bacteria in the presence of 2,2'-bipyrydyl increased cell viability. Superoxide anion radical production increased significantly (p < 0.05) in bacterial cells-treated with betulin,  and ursolic acid. Furthermore, NAD/NADH ratio increased significantly (p < 0.05) in betulin-, - and ursolic acid-treated bacteria. Similarly, level of reduced glutathione in E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus decreased significantly with corresponding increase in glutathione disulphide, malondialdehyde and fragmented DNA following betulin,  and ursolic acid treatments. It is evident from the above findings that betulin,  and ursolic acid enhanced electron transport chain activity in E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus leading to increased ROS generation, Fenton reaction,  peroxidation, fragmented DNA and consequentially bacterial death.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For instance, normal cells take up fatty acids (FAs) from the circulation, while tumour cells generate their own and become dependent on de novo FA synthesis, which could provide a vulnerability to target tumour cells.  (BetA) is a natural compound that selectively kills tumour cells through an ill-defined mechanism that is independent of BAX and BAK, but depends on mitochondrial permeability transition-pore opening. Here we unravel this pathway and show that BetA inhibits the activity of steroyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD-1). This enzyme is overexpressed in tumour cells and critically important for cells that utilize de novo FA synthesis as it converts newly synthesized saturated FAs to unsaturated FAs. Intriguingly, we find that inhibition of SCD-1 by BetA or, alternatively, with a specific SCD-1 inhibitor directly and rapidly impacts on the saturation level of cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrial lipid that has important structural and  functions and at the same time regulates mitochondria-dependent cell death. As a result of the enhanced CL saturation mitochondria of cancer cells, but not normal cells that do not depend on de novo FA synthesis, undergo ultrastructural changes, release cytochrome c and quickly induce cell death. Importantly, addition of unsaturated FAs circumvented the need for SCD-1 activity and thereby prevented BetA-induced CL saturation and subsequent cytotoxicity, supporting the importance of this novel pathway in the cytotoxicity induced by BetA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279966> alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and visceral pain in mice.</a></h1><p> (BA) exhibits many biological effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Free radicals and pro-inflammatory mediators play an important role in the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated pain. We, therefore, examined the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive potential of BA in colitis. Colitis was induced with 3% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water in mice for 1to7 days. BA (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) was given orally for 0 to 7 days. BA was also tested for its efficacy in acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral nociception in mice at same doses. BA significantly prevented diarrhea; bleeding and colonic pathological changes induced by DSS. Further, BA reduced the colon nitrite, malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and  hydroperoxide levels and restored the superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione levels to normalize the redox balance in DSS-exposed mice. Inflammatory mediators like matrix metalloproteinase-9 and prostaglandin E2 levels were also significantly attenuated by BA in colitis mice. Additionally, BA reduced acetic acid and mustard oil-induced visceral pain in mice. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that BA possesses good anti-nociceptive activity and the anti-IBD effects of BA are due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913938>Cardiotoxic and Dyslipidemic Effects of Doxorubicin and  Amide.</a></h1><p>Changes in the blood lipid spectrum and structural reorganization of the rat myocardium in response to injection of a single sublethal dose of doxorubicin (7 mg/kg) alone and in combination with course administration of betulonic acid amide (100 mg/kg/day for 14 days) were studied.  amide in the specified dose exhibited less pronounced cardiotoxic (necrobiotic impairment of cardiomyocytes) and dyslipidemic (increase of cholesterol and triglyceride levels) effects in comparison with doxorubicin.

After a meal, approximately 95% of the bile acids are transported from terminal ileum and back to the liver via the portal vein, resulting in postprandial elevations of bile acids in blood. During the digestion of , components from the microbiota, including LPS, are thought to reach the circulation where it may lead to inflammatory responses after binding TLR4 immune cells. Both LPS and bile acids are present in blood after a high- meal; we therefore wanted to study consequences of a possible interplay between TGR5 and TLR4 in human monocytes.The monocytic cell line U937 stably transfected with the NF-κB reporter plasmid 3x-κB-luc was used as a model system to study the effects of TGR5 and TLR4. Activation of MAP kinases was studied to reveal functional consequences of triggering TGR5 in U937 cells. Effects of TGR5 and TLR4 activation were monitored using NF-κB luciferase assay and by quantification of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 using ELISA.In this study, results show that triggering TGR5 with the specific agonist  (BA), and the bile acids CDCA or DCA, activated both the main MAP kinases ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, and the NF-κB signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that co-triggering of TLR4 and TGR5 enhanced the activation of NF-κB and the release of inflammatory cytokines in a synergistic manner compared to triggering of TLR4 alone.Thus, two different and simultaneous events associated with the digestive process coordinately affect the function of human monocytes and contribute to enhanced inflammation. Because elevated levels of circulatory LPS may contribute to the development of insulin resistance, the results from this study suggest that bile acids through the activation of TGR5 may have a role in the development of insulin resistance as well.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054689>Self-assembled  protects doxorubicin induced apoptosis followed by reduction of ROS-TNF-α-caspase-3 activity.</a></h1><p>Doxorubicin (DOX) is a well-known drug used to treat a wide range of solid tumor and hematological malignancies, but the use of this drug is now restricted owing to its severe side effects, including normal cellular toxicity. This study was conducted to evaluate the potency of self-assembled  (SA-BA) against DOX induced chemotherapeutic toxicity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The isolated  from the bark of Ziziphus jujuba tree was purified by column chromatography and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, (1)H NMR and self-assembly property was investigated by SEM imaging. DOX treatment produced significant reduction of viability of PBLs mainly by lowering cellular anti-oxidant pool and elevating the reactive oxygen species level. Pre-treatment with SA-BA followed by DOX exposure for 24h protected the PBLs from DOX induced oxidative stress. Potent anti-apoptotic role of SA-BA was also confirmed by FACS analysis and western blot assay. Severe inflammation is one of the major concerns in DOX treatment. We found that pre-treatment with SA-BA on PBLs significantly protected the PBLs from DOX induced inflammation. Thus, our finding confirms that SA-BA can be used to ameliorate the cytotoxic effects of DOX, which can be a helpful strategy during DOX mediated chemotherapy in cancer patients.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.
