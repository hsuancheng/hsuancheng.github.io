As the therapeutically active component of bear bile, it has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese Medicine to treat a range of conditions, while manufactured UDCA has been used for decades in Western medicine to treat cholestatic liver . The beneficial qualities of UDCA are thought to be due to its well-established cytoprotective and anti- actions. In addition to its established role in treating liver (s), UDCA is now under investigation for numerous conditions associated with inflammation and apoptosis, including neurological, ocular, metabolic, and cardiovascular disorders.

We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus barrier. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty  alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA)  protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty , associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity or . These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553934>The non-euphoric phytocannabinoid cannabidivarin counteracts intestinal inflammation in mice and cytokine expression in biopsies from UC pediatric patients.</a></h1><p>Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) using marijuana have been reported to experience symptomatic benefit. Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a safe non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid able to activate and desensitize TRPA1, a member of the TRP channels superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in intestinal inflammation. Here, we have investigated the potential intestinal anti- effect of CBDV in mice and in biopsies from pediatric patients with active UC. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by dinitrobenzenesulfonic  (DNBS). The effect of orally administered CBDV on macroscopic and microscopic damage,  parameters (i.e. myeloperoxidase activity, intestinal permeability and cytokine production) and faecal microbiota composition, was evaluated 3 days after DNBS administration. TRPA1 expression was studied by RT-PCR in inflamed colons of mice as well as in mucosal colonic biopsies of children with active UC, whose response to incubation with CBDV was also investigated. CBDV attenuates, in a TRPA1-antagonist sensitive manner, DNBS-induced signs of inflammation including neutrophil infiltration, intestinal permeability, and cytokine (i.e. IL-1β, IL-6 and the chemokine MCP-1) production. CBDV also alters the dysregulation of gut microbiota associated to colitis. Finally, CBDV lessens cytokine expression in colonic biopsies from pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, a condition in which TRPA1 was up-regulated. Our preclinical study shows that CBDV exerts intestinal anti- effects in mice via TRPA1, and in children with active UC. Since CBDV has a favorable safety profile in humans, it may be considered for possible clinical trials in patients with UC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein lies the importance of nanotechnology having a wide range of applications in the field of nano-medicine, particularly in drug delivery systems. The exclusive properties particularly small size and high surface area (which can be modified as required), exhibited by these nanoparticlesrender these structures more suitable for the purpose of drug delivery. Various nanostructures, like liposomes, dendrimers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, etc. have been designed for the said purpose. These nanostructures have several advantages over traditional administration of medicine. Apart from overcoming the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics limitations of many potential therapeutic molecules, they may also be useful for advanced drug delivery purposes like targeted drug delivery, controlled release, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In this review, we attempt to describe an up-to-date knowledge on various strategically devised nanostructures to overcome the problems related to oral drug administration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360579>Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling and the gut-liver axis in liver .</a></h1><p>The liver is the central organ involved in lipid metabolism and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is responsible for nutrient absorption and partitioning. Obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic disorders are of increasing public health concern worldwide, and novel therapeutics that target both the liver and the GI tract (gut-liver axis) are much needed. In addition to aiding fat digestion, bile  act as important signaling molecules that regulate lipid, glucose and energy metabolism via activating nuclear receptor, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Takeda G protein receptor 5 (TGR5) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is synthesized by two sphingosine kinase isoforms and is a potent signaling molecule that plays a critical role in various  such as fatty liver,  (IBD) and colorectal cancer. In this review, we will focus on recent findings related to the role of S1P-mediated signaling pathways in the gut-liver axis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556290>2--β-d-Glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic , an Ascorbic  Derivative Isolated from the Fruits of  L., Modulates Gut Microbiota and Palliates Colitis in Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p>In this study, the effects of 2--β-d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic  (AA-2βG), a natural ascorbic  derivative from the fruits of , on treating the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice were investigated. The results revealed that AA-2βG had palliating effects on DSS-induced  (IBD) in terms of slowing down the trends of body weight and solid fecal mass loss, reducing colitis  activity index, improving serum physiological and biochemical indicators, increasing colon length, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and increasing tight junction proteins. Additionally, AA-2βG treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty  and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The key bacteria related to IBD were found to be Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, ,  and . The results indicated that AA-2βG might treat IBD through the regulation of gut microbiota, suggesting that AA-2βG has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301352>Localisation of oxysterols at the sub-cellular level and in biological fluids.</a></h1><p>Oxysterols are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol that are formed enzymatically or via reactive oxygen species or both. Cholesterol or oxysterols ingested as food are absorbed and packed into lipoproteins that are taken up by hepatic cells. Within hepatic cells, excess cholesterol is metabolised to form bile . The endoplasmic reticulum acts as the main organelle in the bile  synthesis pathway. Metabolised sterols originating from this pathway are distributed within other organelles and in the cell membrane. The alterations to membrane oxysterol:sterol ratio affects the integrity of the cell membrane. The presence of oxysterols changes membrane fluidity and receptor orientation. It is well documented that hydroxylase enzymes located in mitochondria facilitate oxysterol production via an acidic pathway. More recently, the presence of oxysterols was also reported in lysosomes. Peroxisomal deficiencies favour intracellular oxysterols accumulation. Despite the low abundance of oxysterols compared to cholesterol, the biological actions of oxysterols are numerous and important. Oxysterol levels are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple  ranging from chronic   (atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's  and  ), cancer and numerous neurodegenerative . In this article, we review the distribution of oxysterols in sub-cellular organelles and in biological fluids.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the , patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective.To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's  and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness.We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status.We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation.Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks.We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed-treatment contrasts.The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5-ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty.We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5-ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence) and 5-ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low-certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low-certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low-certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective.Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low-certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low-certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied.Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415431>Traditional Chinese medicine for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis: Protocol for a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a universal chronic nonspecific intestinal   of unknown etiology. Although 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) is used as a first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate UC, some patients do not react well to it. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a complementary role in the management of UC. A large number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that TCM has a significant effect in the treatment of mild-to-moderate UC. However, due to the diversity of TCM treatments, its relative effectiveness and safety remains unclear. Therefore, we aim to compare the effectiveness and safety of TCM for mild-to-moderate UC by implementing a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) and provide a reference for clinical treatment.According to the Cochrane Handbook, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CHKD-CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), and WANFANG database will be searched. Related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared one TCM intervention with another or with 5-ASA (placebo) for mild-to-moderate UC from inceptions to February 2019 will be included. Two authors will screen the literature and extract data independently based on predesigned rules, and evaluate the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Both classical pair-wise meta-analysis and Bayesian NMA will be conducted using R-3.4.4 and WinBUGS-1.4.3 software. The ranking probabilities for all interventions will be estimated and the hierarchy of each intervention will be summarized as surface under the cumulative ranking curve. The consistency within network will be evaluated with Cochrane Q statistic and net-heat plot. The quality of evidence will be assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.The study results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal publication or conference presentation.The findings will provide a systematic evidence-based medical evidence of TCM interventions in the treatment of UC and help clinical practitioners, UC patients, and policy-makers make more informed choices in the decision-making.Ethical approval and informed consent are not required since this is a protocol for a network meta-analysis based on published studies.

Involvement of Oxidative Stress and Proinflammatory Biomarkers.</a></h1><p> are a heterogeneous group of disorders represented by two major phenotypic forms, Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. Cross talk between adipokines and myokines, as well as changes in intestinal microcirculation, was proposed in pathogenesis of these disorders. C57BL/6 male mice were fed ad libitum for 12 weeks a standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). After the adaptation period, two groups of animals fed SD or HFD were subjected to 6 weeks of the forced treadmill exercise and the experimental colitis was induced in both groups of sedentary and exercising mice fed SD and HFD by intra-colonic administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic . The  activity index (DAI), colonic blood flow (CBF), the weight of animals, caloric intake, the mesenteric fad pad, the colonic oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and intestinal expression and protein content of proinflammatory markers were evaluated. Macroscopic and microscopic colitis in sedentary SD mice was accompanied by a significant fall in CBF and exacerbated in those fed a HFD. The contents of MDA, GSH, and SOD activity were significantly increased in both SD and HFD fed mice with treadmill exercise as compared with sedentary mice. In sedentary HFD mice a significant increase in the intestinal oxidative stress parameters and mucosal expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17, IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-10 protein were observed and these effects were aggravated in mice subjected to forced treadmill exercise. The mucosal expression of mRNA for TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, COX-2, SOD-1, SOD-2, GPx mRNAs, and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein expression were upregulated in colonic mucosa of treadmill exercising HFD mice with colitis compared with those without exercise. We conclude that forced treadmill running exacerbates the severity of colonic damage in obese mice due to a fall in colonic microcirculation, an increase in oxidative stress, and the rise in expression and activity of proinflammatory biomarkers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406920>Cilostazol against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced colitis: Effect on tight junction, inflammation, and apoptosis.</a></h1><p> are immunologically mediated disorders of gastrointestinal tract, characterized by dysregulated immune responses that result in a chronic intestinal inflammation. The antiplatelet cilostazol (CS), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerted a beneficial effect on several models of gastrointestinal ; however, the full mechanism of action in this context has not been unveiled.The current study aimed to elucidate the potential role of CS in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis model.Male Wistar rats were divided into a sham group and groups treated with sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg), CS (50 and 100 mg/kg), and a combination (sulfasalazine/CS 50 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally 15 days, with TNBS rectal administration on the 11th day.TNBS-produced colitis manifested as a decrease in the epithelial junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and as an increase in trefoil factor-3, ulcerative area, and colon mass index, parameters that collaborate with the gross macroscopic changes in colon tissue. In addition, TNBS increased hemeoxygenase-1, nuclear factor-kappa B, P-selectin, and myeloperoxidase, as well as the apoptotic ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Administration of CS alone, especially at the high dose level, attenuated the severity of TNBS-induced colitis in a sulfasalazine-comparable manner. In addition, a better effect was mediated by the combination regimen, which succeeded in normalizing most of the measured parameters.CS protected the colon against TNBS through its anti- and antiapoptotic effects along with maintaining cellular tight junctions (TJs). Furthermore, CS can be beneficial as an add-on drug with the conventional treatments of colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484704>Hyaluronic  binding to TLR4 promotes proliferation and blocks apoptosis in colon cancer.</a></h1><p>Hyaluronic  (HA), a constituent of the extracellular matrix, promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) growth. CD44 is a relevant HA receptor in this context. However, HA is also a ligand for TLR4, a receptor of significance in CRC. In this study we examine the relative contribution of HA interactions with CD44 and TLR4 in colon tumorigenesis. CRC models included ApcMin/+ mice, azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM-DSS) and CT26 tumor isografts. We used knockout mice and CT26 CRC cells with CRISPR knockdown of CD44 and TLR4. HA activity was modulated by PEP1 (a 12-mer peptide that blocks HA from binding its receptors), hyaluronidase (which promotes HA degradation), or 4-MU (HA synthesis inhibitor). Blockade of HA binding via PEP1 decreased growth in all CRC models and in cell culture. The effects were significant in WT and with CD44 deletion, but not with TLR4 deletion. In the AOM-DSS model, mice deficient in CD44 or TLR4 had fewer tumors. CD44 and TLR4 deficient CT26 isografts grew more slowly, exhibiting decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In vitro, endogenous HA blocked LPS binding to TLR4 suggesting that HA is a relevant TLR4 ligand in colon cancer. Finally, PEP1 enhanced tumor radiation sensitivity in the isograft model. Together these results indicate that HA binding to TLR4, as well as CD44, plays a key role in colon tumorigenesis. These findings also raise the possibility that an agent that blocks HA binding, like PEP1, may be useful as an adjuvant therapy in colon cancer.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625616>Amelioration of colitis in mice by Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1 by M1 to M2 macrophage polarization.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of immune responses by intestine to environmental antigens leads to the chronic  ,  (IBD). Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic  bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

It has a unique function in the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction including irritable  syndrome (IBS), is a common functional  . Its main symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation or alternations between diarrhea and constipation. There are obvious differences in metabolites between TCM syndromes. By comparing the body fluid metabolism maps of model animals, metabolomics can discover  biomarkers, analyze the differences in metabolic pathways and understand the pathological process and the metabolic pathways of substances in the body. Thus, the evaluation of animal models tends to be comprehensive and objective. This may provide further understanding between the interaction between Tong Xie Yao Fang and the IBS model.To evaluate the effect of Tong Xie Yao Fang on IBS rats by using metabolomics method.Wistar rats were used to establish IBS models, and then randomly divided into four groups: A model control group and three Tong Xie Yao Fang treatment groups (high, medium and low doses). A normal, non-IBS group was established. The rats were treated for 2 wk. On days 0 and 14 of the experimental model, urine was collected for 12 h and was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Nine potential biomarkers were identified, and six major metabolic pathways were found to be related to IBS.In the study of metabonomics, nine potential biomarkers including L-serine, 4-methylgallic , L-threonine, succinylacetone, prolyl-hydroxyproline, valyl-serine, acetyl citrate, marmesin rutinoside and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan were identified in urine, which were assigned to amino , organic , succinyl and glycosides. Furthermore, the metabolic pathway of L-serine, L-threonine and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan was found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, which mainly involved the metabolism of cysteine and methionine, vitamin B6 metabolism, serotonin synapse, tryptophan metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, digestion, absorption of protein and amino  metabolism. These pathways are related to intestinal dysfunction,  syndrome, nervous system dysfunction and other .Tong Xie Yao Fang has pharmacological effects on IBS, and its mechanism may be related to the metabolism of the nine potential biomarkers identified above in urine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386809>Colon-Targeted Delivery Facilitates the Therapeutic Switching of Sofalcone, a Gastroprotective Agent, to an Anticolitic Drug via Nrf2 Activation.</a></h1><p>We investigated if the therapeutic switching of sofalcone (SFC), a gastroprotective agent, to an anticolitic agent is feasible using colon-targeted drug delivery. SFC can activate the anti- nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway in human colon epithelial cells and murine macrophages. For the efficient treatment of colitis, SFC was coupled with acidic amino  to yield SFC-aspartic  (SFC-AA) and SFC-glutamic , and their colon targetability and therapeutic effects were assessed as an anticolitic agent in a 2,4-dinitrobenezenesulfonic -induced rat colitis model. The SFC derivatives were decoupled up to 72% in the cecal contents but remained stable in the small intestinal contents. Oral gavage of SFC-AA (oral SFC-AA, equivalent to 1.67 mg/kg of SFC) delivered SFC (maximal cecal concentration: 57.36 μM) to the cecum, while no SFC was detected with oral gavage of SFC (oral SFC, 1.67 mg/kg). Moreover, oral SFC-AA (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of SFC) did not afford detectable concentration of SFC in the blood but detected up to 4.64 μM with oral SFC (10 mg/kg), indicating efficient colonic delivery and limited systemic absorption of SFC upon oral SFC-AA. Oral SFC-AA ameliorated colonic damage and inflammation in rat colitis with elevating colonic levels of HO-1 and nuclear Nrf2 protein, and the anticolitic effects of SFC-AA were significantly undermined by an HO-1 inhibitor. At an equivalent dose of SFC, oral SFC-AA but not oral SFC increased colonic HO-1 and nuclear Nrf2 levels, and oral SFC-AA was more effective than oral SFC in treating rat colitis. Moreover, oral SFC-AA was as effective against colitis as oral sulfasalazine being used for the treatment of . In conclusion, colon-targeted delivery of SFC facilitated the therapeutic switching of the drug to an anticolitic drug via Nrf2 activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246581>Fbxw7 increases CCL2/7 in CX3CR1hi macrophages to promote intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>Resident and  mononuclear phagocytes (MPh) with functional plasticity in the intestine are critically involved in the pathology of  (IBD), in which the mechanism remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we found that increased expression of E3 ligase FBXW7 in the inflamed intestine was significantly correlated to IBD severity in both human  and mice model. Myeloid-Fbxw7 deﬁciency protected mice from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and 2,6,4-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) induced colitis. Fbxw7 deficiency resulted in decreased production of chemokines CCL2 and CCL7 by colonic CX3CR1hi resident macrophages and reduced accumulation of CX3CR1int pro-inﬂammatory MPh in colitis colon tissue. Mice received AAV-shFbxw7 administration showed significantly improved survival rate and alleviated colitis. Mechanisms screening demonstrated that FBXW7 suppresses H3K27me3 modiﬁcation and promotes Ccl2 and Ccl7 expression via degradation of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 in macrophages. Taken together, our results indicate that FBXW7 degrades EZH2 and increases Ccl2/Ccl7 in CX3CR1hi macrophages, which promotes the recruiting CX3CR1int pro-inﬂammatory MPh into local colon tissues with colitis. Targeting FBXW7 might represent a potential therapeutic approach for intestine inflammation intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109951>Activation of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response Impacts the NOD1 Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PRR) responsible for sensing bacterial peptidoglycan fragments. Stimulation of NOD1 leads to a robust innate immune response via activation of the major transcription factor NF-κB. In addition to peptidoglycan sensing, NOD1 and the closely related PRR NOD2 have been linked to inflammation by responding to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we show that differential ER stress induction renders cells more susceptible to  serovar Typhimurium infection in a NOD1-dependent manner, measured by increased NF-κB activation and cytokine expression. In HeLa57A cells stably transfected with an NF-κB::luciferase reporter, we show that cells undergoing ER stress induced by thapsigargin display a significant increase in NF-κB activation in response to NOD1 stimulation by C12-iE-DAP (acylated derivative of the iE-DAP dipeptide [gamma-d-glutamyl--diaminopimelic ]) and the  Typhimurium effector protein SopE. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress had no effect on NOD1-stimulated NF-κB activation. We further show that the mouse intestinal epithelial cell line MODE-K and RAW264.7 macrophages are more responsive to  infection when treated with thapsigargin but not with tunicamycin. These profound differences between thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-treated cells upon inflammation suggest that different components downstream of the UPR contribute to NOD1 activation. We found that the NOD1-induced  response is dependent on protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activation in conjunction with stimulation of the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R). Together, these results suggest that differential UPR activation makes cells more responsive to bacterial infections in a NOD1-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Mendez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043642>G protein-coupled estrogen receptor mediates anti- action in Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Estrogens exert immunomodulatory action in many autoimmune . Accumulating evidence highlights the meaningful impact of estrogen receptors in physiology and pathophysiology of the colon. However, the significance of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) on Crohn's  (CD), one of the  (IBD) types, is still elusive. Our study revealed GPER overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels in patients with CD. To evaluate the effects of GPER activation/inhibition on colitis development, a murine 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced model of CD was used. We showed that activation of GPER reduces mortality, improves macroscopic and microscopic scores and lowers C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The impact of estrogen signaling on the suppression of the intestinal inflammation was proved by immunohistochemistry. It was demonstrated that GPER activation is accompanied by modulation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and expression level of genes involved in signal transmission and immune response as well as the expression of some microRNAs (miR-145, miR-148-5p and miR-592). Our study revealed that the membrane-bound estrogen receptor GPER mediates anti- action and seems to be a potent therapeutic target in maintaining remission in CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472697>Diet-induced remission in chronic enteropathy is associated with altered microbial community structure and synthesis of secondary bile .</a></h1><p>The microbiome has been implicated in the initiation and persistence of . Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's , the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic  enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and .We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile , lithocholic and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile  inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile  during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's .These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile . Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's , along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate . These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal  and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379610>Pinocembrin Protects Against Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Rats Colitis by Ameliorating Inflammation, Improving Barrier Function and Modulating Gut Microbiota.</a></h1><p>Pinocembrin (PIN) is a natural flavonoid widely found in bee propolis with potent gastrointestinal protective effects. In consequence, PIN has great potential in preventing  (IBDs) while scant information is available. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rats ulcerative colitis model (3.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days) was applied to explore the protective effects of PIN on macroscopic colitis symptoms, inflammation, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and gut microbiota homeostasis. While DSS-treated rats showed severe colitis clinical symptoms and histological changes (colonic pathological damages and intestinal goblet cells loss), pre-administration of PIN (5 and 10 mg/kg, ) for a week alleviated these symptoms. Pre-administration of PIN also suppressed the pro- gene expressions and improved tight junction functions of colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, PIN administration reversed DSS-induced short chain fatty  loss, and improved the gut microbial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA phylogenetic sequencing. Overall, our results suggest a wide spectrum of protective effects of PIN in preventing IBDs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610337>No Superiority of Tacrolimus Suppositories vs Beclomethasone Suppositories in a Randomized Trial of Patients With Refractory Ulcerative Proctitis.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative proctitis (UP) refractory to 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) suppositories is a challenge to treat, often requiring step up to immunomodulator or biological therapy. Topical tacrolimus is effective and safe in patients with refractory UP. However, it is not clear how tacrolimus suppositories fit into in the treatment algorithm of UP.We performed a randomized controlled, double-blind study at 8 hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium from 2014 through 2017. Eighty-five patients with refractory UP (65% women) were randomly assigned to groups given once daily tacrolimus suppositories (2mg, n=43) or beclomethasone (3mg, n=42) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical response (decrease in Mayo score of 3 or more). Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response and remission, adverse events and quality of life. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.Proportions of patients with clinical responses were 63% in the tacrolimus group and 59% in the beclomethasone group (P=.812); proportions of patients in clinical remission were 46% and 38%, respectively (P=.638). Proportions of patients with an endoscopic response were 68% and 60% in the tacrolimus group and in the beclomethasone group (P=.636); proportions in endoscopic remission rates were 30% and 13%, respectively (P=.092) Median increases in the  questionnaire score were 18.0 in the tacrolimus group and 20.5 in the beclomethasone group (P=.395). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories induce comparable clinical and endoscopic responses in patients with UP refractory to 5-ASA. There were no significant differences in adverse events rates. Tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories are therefore each safe and effective treatment options for 5-ASA refractory .

However, side effects from cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) are often reported by patients. Here we hypothesized that stimulating the vagus nerve closer to the end organ will have fewer off-target effects and will effectively reduce intestinal inflammation. Specifically, we aimed to: (i) compare off-target effects during abdominal and cervical VNS; (ii) verify that VNS levels were suprathreshold; and (iii) determine whether abdominal VNS reduces chemically-induced intestinal inflammation in rats. An electrode array was developed in-house to stimulate and record vagal neural responses. In a non-recovery experiment, stimulation-induced off-target effects were measured by implanting the cervical and abdominal vagus nerves of anaesthetized rats ( = 5) and recording changes to heart rate, respiration and blood pressure during stimulation (10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase). In a chronic experiment, the efficacy of VNS treatment was assessed by implanting an electrode array onto the abdominal vagus nerve and recording  electrically-evoked neural responses during the implantation period. After 14 days, the intestine was inflamed with TNBS (2.5% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic ) and rats received therapeutic VNS ( = 7; 10 Hz; 320 nC per phase; 3 h/day) or no stimulation ( = 8) for 4.5 days. Stool quality, plasma C-reactive protein and histology of the inflamed intestine were assessed. Data show that abdominal VNS had no effect (two-way RM-ANOVA:  ≥ 0.05) on cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure parameters. However, during cervical VNS heart rate decreased by 31 ± 9 beats/minute ( ≥ 0.05), respiration was inhibited and blood pressure decreased. Data addressing efficacy of VNS treatment show that electrically-evoked neural response thresholds remained stable (one-way RM ANOVA:  ≥ 0.05) and therapeutic stimulation remained above threshold. Chronically stimulated rats, compared to unstimulated rats, had improved stool quality (two-way RM ANOVA:  < 0.0001), no blood in feces ( < 0.0001), reduced plasma C-reactive protein (two-way RM ANOVA:  < 0.05) and a reduction in resident  cell populations within the intestine (Kruskal-Wallis:  < 0.05). In conclusion, abdominal VNS did not evoke off-target effects, is an effective treatment of TNBS-induced inflammation, and may be an effective treatment of IBD in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540027>Profiling of Amino  in Urine Samples of Patients Suffering from  by Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Urine represents a convenient biofluid for metabolomic studies due to its noninvasive collection and richness in metabolites. Here, amino  are valuable biomarkers for their ability to reflect imbalances of different biochemical pathways. An impact of amino  on pathology, prognosis and therapy of various , including  (IBD), is therefore the subject of current clinical research. This work is aimed to develop a capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) method for the quantification of the 20 proteinogenic amino  in human urine samples obtained from patients suffering from IBD and treated with thiopurines. The optimized CE-MS/MS method, with minimum sample preparation (just "dilute and shoot"), exhibited excellent linearity for all the analytes (coefficients of determination were higher than 0.99), with inter-day and intra-day precision yielding relative standard deviations in the range of 0.91-15.12% and with accuracy yielding relative errors in the range of 85.47-112.46%. Total analysis time, an important parameter for the sample throughput demanded in routine practice, was shorter in ca. 17% when compared to established CE-MS methods. Favorable performance of the proposed CE-MS/MS method was also confirmed by the comparison with corresponding ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method. Consistent data for the investigated amino  metabolome were obtained using both methods. For the first time, the amino  profiling by CE-MS approach was applied on the clinical IBD samples. Here, significant differences observed in the concentration levels of some amino  between IBD patients undergoing thiopurine treatment and healthy volunteers could result from the simultaneous action of the  and the corresponding therapy. These findings indicate that amino  analysis could be a valuable tool for the study of mechanism of the IBD treatment by thiopurines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313354>The protective effect of syringic  on dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis in BALB/c mice.</a></h1><p> involve chronic intestinal inflammation which is mostly caused by Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis (UC) conditions. Patients having UC are prone to colorectal cancer and dysplastic polyps, and also have sporadic adenomas. Syringic  (SA) possesses many health benefits including antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer. This study was aimed to identify the effects of SA on UC, using a murine experimental model. Clinical symptoms and weight loss were significantly reduced in mice induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and treated with SA, compared to untreated mice. The effects of SA exhibited in DSS-induced mice were associated with significant decrease in the expressions levels of  mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), pro- cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF-α], interleukin [IL-1β and IL-6]), remarkable amelioration of colonic architectural disruption, and a significant reduction in the activity of colonic myeloperoxidase. To further confirm the anti- property of SA, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides. SA dose-dependently inhibited the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. It also decreased the expressions of p65-NF-κB and IκB, thus reducing the activation and nuclear accumulation of p-STAT-3 . This prohibited the degradation of inhibitory protein, IκB, as well as inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65-NF-κB in colonic tissue. It was concluded that SA has a potential to limit inflammation via inhibiting the p65-NF-κB and STAT3 signaling; hence it can be used for therapeutic purposes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443089>Evaluation of the effect of liposomes loaded with chlorogenic  in treatment of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced murine colitis.</a></h1><p>Crohn's  (CD), one of the types of , poses a significant challenge to modern healthcare. This condition severely impacts patients' quality of life, and its incidence is continuously rising. Despite constant research, current treatment options are limited and largely unsuccessful and result in serious side effects, therefore new therapy alternatives are needed. Liposomal formulation provides a new hope for  management. In our study, we characterized the anti- activity of mesalazine (5-ASA) and chlorogenic  (CGA) encapsulated in liposomal formulation in the animal model of CD. Liposomes were obtained by thin film hydration method and characterized in terms of suspension stability and particle size and distribution. Colitis was induced in mice by intracolonic (i.c.) administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS). The effect of treatment with liposomal suspensions of 5-ASA and CGA was evaluated macroscopically and by measuring myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. We observed that liposome-encapsulated 5-ASA (5 mg/kg), but not CGA (20 mg/kg) attenuated colitis as evidenced by a decreased macroscopic and microscopic scores. It may be hypothesized that the composition of liposomal lipid bilayer as well as the switch in macrophage populations leading to unfavorable accumulation of anti- agents in the cells may underly the efficiency of obtained liposomes and need to be taken into consideration in further studies on drug delivery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417547>Gut Bacterial Metabolite Urolithin A (UA) Mitigates Ca Entry in T Cells by Regulating miR-10a-5p.</a></h1><p>The gut microbiota influences several biological functions including immune responses.  is favorably influenced by consumption of several dietary natural plant products such as pomegranate, walnuts, and berries containing polyphenolic compounds such as ellagitannins and ellagic . The gut microbiota metabolizes ellagic  resulting in the formation of bioactive urolithins A, B, C, and D. Urolithin A (UA) is the most active and effective gut metabolite and acts as a potent anti- and anti-oxidant agent. However, whether gut metabolite UA affects the function of immune cells remains incompletely understood. T cell proliferation is stimulated by store operated Ca entry (SOCE) resulting from stimulation of Orai1 by STIM1/STIM2. We show here that treatment of murine CD4 T cells with UA (10 μM, 3 days) significantly blunted SOCE in CD4 T cells, an effect paralleled by significant downregulation of Orai1 and STIM1/2 transcript levels and protein abundance. UA treatment further increased miR-10a-5p abundance in CD4 T cells in a dose dependent fashion. Overexpression of miR-10a-5p significantly decreased STIM1/2 and Orai1 mRNA and protein levels as well as SOCE in CD4 T cells. UA further decreased CD4 T cell proliferation. Thus, the gut bacterial metabolite UA increases miR-10a-5p levels thereby downregulating Orai1/STIM1/STIM2 expression, store operated Ca entry, and proliferation of murine CD4 T cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268137>Negative Effects of a High-Fat Diet on Intestinal Permeability: A Review.</a></h1><p>The intestinal tract is the largest barrier between a person and the environment. In this role, the intestinal tract is responsible not only for absorbing essential dietary nutrients, but also for protecting the host from a variety of ingested toxins and microbes. The intestinal barrier system is composed of a mucus layer, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), tight junctions (TJs), immune cells, and a gut microbiota, which are all susceptible to external factors such as dietary fats. When components of this barrier system are disrupted, intestinal permeability to luminal contents increases, which is implicated in intestinal pathologies such as , necrotizing enterocolitis, and celiac . Currently, there is mounting evidence that consumption of excess dietary fats can enhance intestinal permeability differentially. For example, dietary fat modulates the expression and distribution of TJs, stimulates a shift to barrier-disrupting hydrophobic bile , and even induces IEC oxidative stress and apoptosis. In addition, a high-fat diet (HFD) enhances intestinal permeability directly by stimulating proinflammatory signaling cascades and indirectly via increasing barrier-disrupting cytokines [TNFα, interleukin (IL) 1B, IL6, and interferon γ (IFNγ)] and decreasing barrier-forming cytokines (IL10, IL17, and IL22). Finally, an HFD negatively modulates the intestinal mucus composition and enriches the gut microflora with barrier-disrupting species. Although further research is necessary to understand the precise role HFDs play in intestinal permeability, current data suggest a stronger link between diet and intestinal  than was first thought to exist. Therefore, this review seeks to highlight the various ways an HFD disrupts the gut barrier system and its many implications in human health.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247473>Canine adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells pre-treated with TNF-alpha enhance immunomodulatory effects in  in mice.</a></h1><p>Canine  (IBD) is an intractable autoimmune disorder that results in various gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for IBD treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro- cytokines show enhanced anti- properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α in mouse models of IBD. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS)-induced colitis were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-α. Colitis severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic  cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80/iNOS cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas M2 macrophages (F4/80/CD206 cells) were increased.

These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of -based disorders of the gut, like  (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated  responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal  disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070847>Ultrastructural changes in colonic epithelial cells in a rat model of .</a></h1><p> (IBD) is a global, chronic intractable .

Here, we used transmission (TEM) and osmium-maceration scanning (SEM) electron microscopy to evaluate the ultrastructure of colonic epithelial cells in rat models of IBD induced by TNBS. Histological evaluation revealed that the intestinal crypts in the most regions of the IBD-model colons were deformed and we classified them as having high cell migration rates (HMIG). The remaining regions in the intestinal crypts retained a relatively normal structure and we classified them as having low cell migration rates (LMIG). Osmium-maceration SEM revealed the mucosal fluid flowing in spaces without secretory granules in crypt goblet cells of both HMIG and LMIG regions, indicating the depletion of goblet cell mucin that is found in patients with IBD. The Golgi apparatus in absorptive cells was stacked and curled in both regions. Osmium-maceration SEM showed membrane network structures resembling endoplasmic reticulum that were large and expanded in absorptive cells with HMIG rather than with LMIG regions in IBD-model colons. These findings indicated that endoplasmic reticulum stress is associated with susceptibility to IBD and that the effects of various agents can be evaluated according to endoplasmic reticulum stress revealed by using electron microscopy in models of IBD induced by TNBS.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593888>The nitroxide 4-methoxy-tempo inhibits the pathogenesis of dextran sodium sulfate-stimulated experimental colitis.</a></h1><p> (IBD) is a chronic condition characterised by leukocyte recruitment to the gut mucosa.

Histopathological damage decreased markedly in MetT-treated mice, as judged by maintenance of crypt integrity, goblet cell density and decreased cellular infiltrate. Colonic Ly6C, MPO-labelled cells and 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr) decreased in MetT-treated mice, although biomarkers for nitrosative stress (3-nitro-tyrosine-tyrosine; 3-NO-Tyr) and low-molecular weight thiol damage (assessed as glutathione sulfonamide; GSA) were unchanged. Interestingly, MetT did not significantly impact colonic IL-10 and IL-6 levels, suggesting a non-immunomodulatory pathway. Overall, MetT ameliorated the severity of experimental IBD, likely via a mechanism involving the modulation of MPO-mediated damage.Copyright © 2019.

Besides protecting enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules also play an important role as radical scavengers. Within bacteria the amino  derivative ectoine (2-methyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylate) is the most abundant compatible solute and stress protectant. Although this compound is already produced commercially for applications as moisturizer and skin-care product, it has been a matter of debate whether ectoine also has radical-scavenging activity. Here we report on its hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in comparison to other compatible solutes and describe the reaction products obtained when ectoine is exposed to hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction. In a sodium salicylate scavenging test system this compatible solute performed as well as mannitol. As a consequence of its reaction with hydroxyl radicals, ectoine was converted into two major products: N-acetimide aspartate and N-acetimide-β-alanine. We propose a reaction mechanism in which the heterocycle of the compatible solute ectoine is cleaved and further oxidized at the C-terminus. The proven radical scavenging ability of ectoine will help to explain observed effects as anti- compound in skin, lung and  .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast with PBC, PSC has a strong association with  and is the prototypical  of the gut-liver axis. Still, there are some distinct overlapping microbial features in the microbiome of patients with PSC and PBC suggesting similarities in cholestatic , although the possible pathogenetic involvement of these shared microbial changes is unknown. Herein, we present an overview of the available data and discuss the relevance for potential  relevant host-microbiota interactions. In general, the microbiome interacts with the host via the immunobiome (interactions between the host immune system and the gut microbiome), the endobiome (where the gut microbiome contributes to host physiology by producing or metabolizing endogenous molecules) and the xenobiome (gut microbial transformation of exogenous compounds, including nutrients and drugs). Experimental and human observational evidence suggest that the presence and functions of gut microbes are relevant for the severity and progression of cholestatic liver . Interestingly, the majority of new drugs that are currently being tested in PBC and PSC in clinical trials act on bile  homeostasis, where the endobiome is important. In the future, it will be paramount to perform longitudinal studies, through which we can identify new intervention targets, biomarkers or treatment-stratifiers. In this way, gut microbiome-based clinical care and therapy may become relevant in cholestatic liver  within the foreseeable future.© 2019 The Authors.

This role has largely been attributed to nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) signaling since the latter is considered a major inducer of RICK activation. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms accounting for RICK-mediated inhibition of  (IBD). In an initial series of studies focused on trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-colitis and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis we showed that down-regulation of intestinal RICK expression in NOD2-intact mice by intra-rectal administration of a plasmid expressing RICK-specific siRNA was accompanied by down-regulation of pro- cytokine responses in the colon and protection of the mice from experimental colitis. Somewhat surprisingly, intra-rectal administration of RICK-siRNA also inhibited TNBS-colitis and DSS-colitis in NOD2-deficient and in NOD1/NOD2-double deficient mice. In complementary studies of humans with IBD we found that expression of RICK, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) and downstream signaling partners were markedly increased in inflamed tissue of IBD compared to controls without marked elevations of NOD1 or NOD2 expression. In addition, the increase in RICK expression correlated with  activity and pro- cytokine responses. These studies thus suggest that NOD1- or NOD2-independenent activation of RICK plays a major role in both murine experimental colitis and human IBD.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2019.

Prior to FDC development, pharmacokinetic properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have to be evaluated, as well as methods for their determination developed. So as to increase patient compliance in , three novel FDCs of thiopurine immunosuppressants and folic  are proposed; physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties such as hydrophobicity, lipophilicity and plasma protein binding of all APIs are evaluated. Moreover, experimental results of different properties are compared to those computed by various on-line prediction platforms so as to evaluate the viability of the in silico approach. A simultaneous method for their determination is developed, optimized, validated and applied to commercial tablet formulations.

In an attempt to improve the oral bioavailability of 2-PMPA, we explored a prodrug approach using (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl)methyl (ODOL), an FDA-approved promoiety, and systematically masked two (), three (), or all four () of its acidic groups. The prodrugs were evaluated for in vitro stability and in vivo pharmacokinetics in mice and dog.

Arachidonic  metabolites play an important role in the  response of intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's . Recent studies have shown that the polymorphism locus in the promoter region of  gene affects LTB4 expression level and the susceptibility to extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, we identified a total of 148 patients with intestinal tuberculosis, 145 with Crohn's , and 700 normal controls in this study.All the study participants were local Han people from Jiangxi Province in the past eleven years. DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded specimens or the whole blood. The  promoter SNP (rs17525495) was genotyped with TaqMan assay.The T-alleles frequency was not significantly increased in patients with intestinal tuberculosis compared with healthy control group (=0.630; OR=1.07; 95%CI=0.81-1.41), while patients with Crohn's  have significantly increased T allele frequency compared with healthy population (=0.032; OR=1.34; 95%CI=1.03-1.75).

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of grape peel powder (GPP) and its bioactive rich-fractions on the barrier function and colonic injury in a model of colitis induced by 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS). Wistar rats received diets supplemented with either GPP (8%), extractable polyphenols (EP), non-extractable polyphenols-rich fraction (NEP-F), or polyphenols-poor, fiber-rich fraction (F) from grapes at amounts equivalent to the GPP group during 15 days before and for 7 days after colitis induction. NEP-F has decreased the extension of colonic lesion but the other grape peel bioactive fractions did not protect against macroscopic or microscopic colonic damage, EP diet increased macroscopic colonic damage. GPP, EP, and NEP-F reduced claudin-2 mRNA expression, whereas GPP and F fraction increased occludin and ZO-1 mRNA expression. All experimental diets reduced the colitis-triggered increase of MMP-9 mRNA expression. Colitis reduced by 30% the production of cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA). GPP and NEP-F completely protected against this effect, whereas F fraction was ineffective. Only GPP and NEP-F were able to decrease the upregulation of GRP94 mRNA triggered by colitis. Dietary fiber seems to reestablish the intestinal barrier function, whereas fiber-bound phenolics were able to restore cecal metabolism to produce beneficial metabolites like SCFA and to reduce the activation of the unfolded protein response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this objective, overlapping actions of complex cellular processes, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation, are required. These events are longitudinally and tightly controlled by numerous factors including a wide range of distinct regulatory proteins. However, the sequence of events associated with colon mucosal repair after colitis and the evolution of the luminal content characteristics during this process have been little studied.To document the evolution of colon mucosal characteristics during mucosal healing using a mouse model with chemically-induced colitis.C57BL/6 male mice were given 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5 d. They were euthanized 2 (day 7), 5 (day 10), 8 (day 13), and 23 (day 28) d after DSS removal. The colonic luminal environment and epithelial repair processes during the  flare and colitis resolution were analyzed with reference to a non-DSS treated control group, euthanized at day 0. Epithelial repair events were assessed histo-morphologically in combination with functional permeability tests, expression of key  and repairing factors, and evaluation of colon mucosa-adherent microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing.The maximal intensity of colitis was concomitant with maximal alterations of intestinal barrier function and histological damage associated with goblet cell depletion in colon mucosa. It was recorded 2 d after termination of the DSS-treatment, followed by a progressive return to values similar to those of control mice. Although signs of colitis were severe ( cell infiltrate, crypt disarray, increased permeability) and associated with colonic luminal alterations (hyperosmolarity, dysbiosis, decrease in short-chain fatty  content), epithelial healing processes were launched early during the  flare with increased gene expression of certain key epithelial repair modulators, including transforming growth factor-β, interleukin (Il)-15, Il-22, Il-33, and serum amyloid A. Whereas signs of inflammation progressively diminished, luminal colonic environment alterations and microscopic abnormalities of colon mucosa persisted long after colitis induction.This study shows that colon repair can be initiated in the context of inflamed mucosa associated with alterations of the luminal environment and highlights the longitudinal involvement of key modulators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491456>Changes in colonic contractility in response to : Long-term assessment in a model of TNBS-induced inflammation in rats.</a></h1><p> is a chronic relapsing inflammation that affects the gastrointestinal tract, causing changes in colonic motility. The evolution of these changes is not completely understood and possibly related to symptoms that appear in different degrees of the intestinal inflammation. Therefore, our aim is evaluate during 14 days of assessment aspects of colonic contractility using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) model of inflammation in rats and associate the  process with colonic motility.Contractility and  parameters were assessed in the same animal in six different moments: before intestinal inflammation induction, 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 days after induction. The mechanical activity was determined by alternating current biosusceptometry (ACB) and subdivided into rhythmic propagating ripples (RPR) and rhythmic propulsive motor complexes (RPMC). We assessed inflammation by determining myeloperoxidase activity in feces.Transient and permanent changes were observed in colonic motility as a function of the  process evaluated through myeloperoxidase activity. We identified two contraction profiles: RPR and RPMC. The microscopic analysis demonstrated a depth of damage caused by an injury that was associated with changes in motility.We implemented a robust and adequate (specific) signal processing to quantify two measured colonic frequency patterns. Thus, we performed a detailed temporal analysis of the consequences of TNBS-induced inflammation on colonic motility in rats. Our approach enables further long-term assessments in the same animal with different mechanisms and duration of injury, remission, treatments and their motor consequences.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying active substances and molecular mechanisms remain obscure.A bioinformatics/topology based strategy was proposed for identification of the drug targets, therapeutic agents and molecular mechanisms of SiNiSan against irritable  syndrome.In this work, a bioinformatics/network topology based strategy was employed by integrating ADME filtering, text mining, bioinformatics, network topology, Venn analysis and molecular docking to uncover systematically the multicomponent synergy mechanisms. In vivo experimental validation was executed in a Visceral Hypersensitivity (VHS) rat model.76 protein targets and 109 active components of SNS were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 116  pathways associated with IBS therapy could be classified into the 19 statistically enriched functional sub-groups. The multi-functional co-synergism of SNS against IBS were predicted, including  reaction regulation, oxidative-stress depression regulation and hormone and immune regulation. The multi-component synergetic effects were also revealed on the herbal combination of SNS. The hub-bottleneck genes of the protein networks including PTGS2, CALM2, NOS2, SLC6A3 and MAOB, MAOA, CREB1 could become potential drug targets and Paeoniflorin, Naringin, Glycyrrhizic  may be candidate agents. Experimental results showed that the potential mechanisms of SiNiSan treatment involved in the suppression of activation of Dopaminergic synapse and Amphetamine addiction signaling pathways, which are congruent with the prediction by the systematic approach.The integrative investigation based on bioinformatics/network topology strategy may elaborate the multicomponent synergy mechanisms of SNS against IBS and provide the way out to develop new combination medicines for IBS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the usefulness of diagnostic tests in such patients.We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, from 1978 until April 2017. We included diagnostic test accuracy studies reporting on the use of fecal and blood tests for the evaluation of adult patients with functional diarrhea, including irritable  syndrome. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies II, and the certainty in the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity, and the proportion of patients with true and false positive and negative results. We evaluated the following tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fecal lactoferrin, fecal calprotectin, serologic tests for celiac , tests for bile  diarrhea, the commercially available version of anti-cytolethal distending toxin B and anti-vinculin antibodies, and tests for Giardia infection. We did not evaluate breath tests for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as they are not part of a standard diarrhea workup.Thirty-eight studies proved eligible to evaluate 1 or more of these tests. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were similar at discriminating organic from functional , with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 0.54-0.78 and 0.46-0.95 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 0.73 and 0.78 for C-reactive protein. Among fecal tests, fecal calprotectin in a range of 50-60 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.86; pooled specificity 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) and fecal lactoferrin in a range of 4.0-7.25 μg/g (pooled sensitivity 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; pooled specificity 0.93; 95%CI 0.63-0.99) presented the lowest proportion of false-negative results (low certainty in the evidence). Among tests for celiac , IgA tissue transglutaminase presented the best diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity range, 0.79-0.99; specificity range, 0.90-0.99) with moderate certainty in the evidence. Among tests for bile  diarrhea, the selenium homotaurocholic  test performed better than serum fibroblast growth factor 19 and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, but is not available in the United States. There was insufficient evidence to recommend serologic tests for irritable  syndrome at this time. There are several good diagnostic tests for Giardia infection.Moderate to low certainty in the evidence indicates that available fecal and blood tests may play a role in the diagnostic workup of adult patients with functional diarrhea. At the moment, no tests are available to reliably rule in irritable  syndrome.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is not clear how inhibitors of cytokines, such as antagonists of tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF), affect the intestinal microbiome. We investigated the effects of anti-TNF agents on gut microbe community structure and function in a longitudinal 2-step study of patients with IBD. We correlated our findings with outcomes of treatment and investigated patterns of metabolites in fecal samples before and after anti-TNF therapy.We performed a prospective study of 2 cohorts of patients in Germany; the discovery cohort comprised 12 patients with IBD, 17 patients with rheumatic , and 19 healthy individuals (controls); fecal samples were collected at baseline and 2, 6, and 30 weeks after induction of anti-TNF therapy. The validation cohort comprised 23 patients with IBD treated with anti-TNF or vedolizumab (anti-α4β7 integrin) and 99 healthy controls; fecal samples were collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, and 14. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by V3-V4 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Clinical response and remission were determined by clinical  activity scores. Metabolic network reconstruction and associated fecal metabolite level inference was performed in silico using the AGORA (Assembly of Gut Organisms through Reconstruction and Analysis) resource. Metabolomic analyses of fecal samples from a subset of patients were performed to validate metabolites associated with treatment outcomes.Anti-TNF therapy shifted the diversity of fecal microbiota in patients with IBD, but not with rheumatic , toward that of controls. Across timepoints, diversity indices did not vary significantly between patients with IBD who did or did not achieve clinical remission after therapy. In contrast, in silico modeling of metabolic interactions between gut microbes found metabolite exchange to be significantly reduced at baseline in fecal samples from patients with IBD and to be associated with later clinical remission. Predicted levels of butyrate and substrates involved in butyrate synthesis (ethanol or acetaldehyde) were significantly associated with clinical remission following anti-TNF therapy, verified by fecal metabolomic analyses.Metabolic network reconstruction and assessment of metabolic profiles of fecal samples might be used to identify patients with IBD likely to achieve clinical remission following anti-TNF therapy and increase our understanding of the heterogeneity of IBD.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Therefore, plasma amino  profile might represent a novel marker of human IBD.To determine the plasma amino  profiles of dogs with IBD and its usefulness as a novel marker of IBD in dogs.Fasting blood plasma was obtained from 10 dogs with IBD and 12 healthy dogs.All IBD dogs were prospectively included in this study, and heparinized blood samples were collected.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in IBD. Kynurenic  (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's  (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053627>In Vivo Generation of Gut-Homing Regulatory T Cells for the Suppression of Colitis.</a></h1><p>Current therapies for gut inflammation have not reached the desired specificity and are attended by unintended immune suppression. This study aimed to provide evidence for supporting a hypothesis that direct in vivo augmentation of the induction of gut-homing regulatory T (Treg) cells is a strategy of expected specificity for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation (e.g., ). We showed that dendritic cells (DCs), engineered to de novo produce high concentrations of both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active vitamin D metabolite, and retinoic , an active vitamin A metabolite, augmented the induction of T cells that express both the regulatory molecule Foxp3 and the gut-homing receptor CCR9 in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, the newly generated Ag-specific Foxp3 T cells homed to intestines. Additionally, transfer of such engineered DCs robustly suppressed ongoing experimental colitis. Moreover, CD4 T cells from spleens of the mice transferred with the engineered DCs suppressed experimental colitis in syngeneic hosts. The data suggest that the engineered DCs enhance regulatory function in CD4 T cell population in peripheral lymphoid tissues. Finally, we showed that colitis suppression following in vivo transfer of the engineered DCs was significantly reduced when Foxp3 Treg cells were depleted. The data indicate that maximal colitis suppression mediated by the engineered DCs requires Treg cells. Collectively, our data support that DCs de novo overproducing both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and retinoic  are a promising novel therapy for chronic intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212833>Contribution of the Gut Microbiota in P28GST-Mediated Anti- Effects: Experimental and Clinical Insights.</a></h1><p>An original immuno-regulatory strategy against  based on the use of 28 kDa glutathione S-transferase (P28GST), a unique schistosome protein, was recently proposed. Improvement of intestinal inflammation occurs through restoration of the immunological balance between pro- T-helper 1 (Th1) responses and both T-helper 2 (Th2) and regulatory responses. However, detailed mechanisms explaining how P28GST prevents colitis and promotes gut homeostasis remain unknown. Considering the complex interplay between the adaptive and innate immune system and the intestinal microbiota, we raised the question of the possible role of the microbial ecosystem in the anti- effects mediated by the helminth-derived P28GST protein. We first analyzed, by 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacterial profiles of mice fecal microbiota at several time points of the P28GST-immunomodulation period prior to trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-colitis. The influence of gut microbiota in the P28GST-mediated anti- effects was then assessed by fecal microbiota transplantation experiments from P28GST-immunized mice to either conventional or microbiota depleted naïve recipient mice. Finally, the experimental data were supplemented by the temporal fecal microbiota compositions of P28GST-treated Crohn's  patients from a pilot clinical study (). The P28GST administration slightly modulated the diversity and composition of mouse fecal microbiota while it significantly reduced experimental colitis in mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments failed to restore the P28GST-induced anti- effects. In Crohn's  patients, P28GST also induced slight changes in their overall fecal bacterial composition. Collectively, these results provide key elements in both the anti- mechanisms and the safe therapeutic use of immunomodulation with such promising helminth-derived molecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258872>Carcinoid tumor causing ileoceccal intussusception in an adult patient.</a></h1><p>: Little is known about adult intussusception, but current evidence suggests that malignancy, polyps, and diverticula are usual etiologies. We present a case of adult ileoceccal intussusception secondary to carcinoid tumor. : A 53-year-old African American male presented with hematochezia and non-radiating constant left upper quadrant pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. CT of the pelvis demonstrated a pathognomic 'target' sign, consistent with ileoceccal intussusception and early small  obstruction. Two years prior to this current presentation, the patient had experienced an episode of hematochezia for which he underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy, with subsequent pathology results negative for colon cancer. He denies diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, decreased appetite or skin flushing. Due to persistent symptoms of  obstruction, he underwent exploratory laparotomy. During the surgery a white-colored, chalky mass indicative of penetrating tumor was noted 13 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. An extended right hemi-colectomy followed the discovery of the mass. Pathology showed a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor consistent with carcinoid tumor. Evaluation for metastatic  using 5-HIAA and chromogranin A was unremarkable, and the resection of the right colon carcinoid tumor was felt to be curative. : It is uncommon for adults to present with intussusception; in such cases, malignancy should be ruled out as an underlying cause.

Exosome-induced regulation in  (IBD) is becoming increasingly popular due to their potential functions of exosomal pathways. Exosomes, which are involved in the regulation of IBD, can be released from various cell types, or found in many physiological fluids, and plants. The specific functions of exosomes in IBD primarily depend on the internal functional components, including RNAs, proteins, and other substances. However, exosome-induced transport mechanisms involving cell-cell communications or cell-environment interactions are also very important. Recent studies have revealed that exosome crosstalk mechanisms may influence major IBD-related pathways, such as immune responses, barrier functions, and intestinal flora. This review highlights the advancements in the biology of exosome secretions and their regulation in IBD. The functional roles of exosomal components, including nucleic , proteins, and some other components, are the main focus of this review. More animal and clinical research is needed to study the functions of exosomes on IBD. Designing new drug dosage form using exosome-like-structure may provide new insights into IBD treatment.

A Review.</a></h1><p>Chronic inflammation takes part in the pathogenesis of some malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract including colorectal (CRC), gastric, and esophageal cancers. The use of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (ω3-PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy of gastrointestinal cancers is being investigated in recent years. Most evidence has been reported in CRC, although their protective role has also been reported for -induced gastric cancer or Barrett's esophagus-derived adenocarcinoma. Studies based on ω3-PUFA supplementation in animal models of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and CRC revealed positive effects on cancer prevention, reducing the number and size of tumors, down-regulating arachidonic -derived eicosanoids, upregulating anti-oxidant enzymes, and reducing lipid peroxidation, whereas contradictory results have been found in induced colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Beneficial effects have also been found in FAP and ulcerative colitis patients. Of special interest is their positive effect as adjuvants on radio- and chemo-sensitivity, specificity, and prevention of treatment complications. Some controversial results obtained in CRC might be justified by different dietary sources, extraction and preparation procedures of ω3-PUFAs, difficulties on filling out food questionnaires, daily dose and type of PUFAs, adenoma subtype, location of CRC, sex differences, and genetic factors. Studies using animal models of  have confirmed that exogenous administration of active metabolites derived from PUFAs called pro-resolving mediators like lipoxin A4, arachidonic -derived, resolvins derived from eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA), and docosapentaenoic (DPA)  as well as maresin 1 and protectins DHA- and DPA-derived improve  and  outcomes without causing immunosuppression or other side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315227>Gut Microbiome: Profound Implications for Diet and .</a></h1><p>The gut microbiome plays an important role in human health and influences the development of chronic  ranging from metabolic  to gastrointestinal disorders and colorectal cancer. Of increasing prevalence in Western societies, these conditions carry a high burden of care. Dietary patterns and environmental factors have a profound effect on shaping gut microbiota in real time. Diverse populations of intestinal bacteria mediate their beneficial effects through the fermentation of dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty , endogenous signals with important roles in lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Recent progress shows that an individual's starting microbial profile is a key determinant in predicting their response to intervention with live probiotics. The gut microbiota is complex and challenging to characterize. Enterotypes have been proposed using metrics such as alpha species diversity, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla, and the relative abundance of beneficial genera (e.g., , ) versus facultative anaerobes (), pro- , or nonbacterial microbes. Microbiota composition and relative populations of bacterial species are linked to physiologic health along different axes.

In the area of stem cell biology, vitamin C has shown its direct impact toward homeostasis and epigenetic changes (D'Aniello et al., Stem Cells International, 2017, 1-16). Vitamin B aids in maintaining healthy intestinal homeostasis and reducing gut inflammation by participating in the rapamycin signaling pathway (Kumar et al., The American Journal of Physiology-Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology, 2013). In this study, vitamin C and vitamin B (600 and 1,200 μg/mL) have been explored as potential new biomaterials to study their effects on four types of intestinal stem cells which are isolated from mice bearing different microbiota. We observed that C3H ASF and 129 ASF IL-10 are more sensitive towardB7 600 μg/mL vitamin B and 1,200 μg/mL vitamin C. The lowest growth rate and viability for all types of organoids was with 1,200 μg/mL vitamin C. From quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis (qPCR analysis), MUC2 was upregulated for 129 ASF and C3H Conv when exposed to 600 μg/mL and 1,200 μg/mL vitamin C. It suggests that large amounts of glycoprotein may be produced after adding high concentrations of vitamin C. Since  has low level of MUC2, this finding may be helpful in restoring mucosal health by upregulating the MUC2 gene while altering patient's microbiota (Sibila et al., Annals of the American Thoracic Society, 2016). These results are expected to have a positive translational impact because this bottom-up strategy would be instrumental in developing Vitamin C and B3 based orally available therapeutic strategies and formula for advancing the fields of gastrointestinal regenerative medicine.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267470>Resolvins: Emerging Players in Autoimmune and  .</a></h1><p>Resolvins, belonging to the group of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), are metabolic products of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (ω-3 PUFAs) and are synthesized during the initial phases of acute  responses to promote the resolution of inflammation. Resolvins are produced for termination of neutrophil infiltration, stimulation of the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, and promotion of tissue remodeling and homeostasis. Metabolic dysregulation due to either uncontrolled activity of pro- responses or to inefficient resolution of inflammation results in chronic inflammation and may also lead to atherosclerosis or other chronic autoimmune  such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, , and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Hence, endeavors to improve the  pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti- and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating  disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, B., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

Cholesterol can be metabolized into several molecules including bile , hormones, and oxysterols. Studies from the last few decades have demonstrated that oxysterols are not only active metabolites but are further involved in the modulation of immune responses. Liver X Receptors (LXRs), nuclear receptors for oxysterols, are important for cholesterol homeostasis and regulation of  response but are still poorly characterized during autoimmune . Here we review the current knowledge about the role of oxysterols during autoimmune conditions and focus on the implication of LXR-dependent and LXR-independent pathways. We further highlight the importance of these pathways in particular during central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity and  (IBD) in both experimental models and human studies.

However, in the current literature, little is known about their implication in  (IBD). IBD is a group of multifactorial, autoimmune, and debilitating  with increasing incidence worldwide. Despite extensive research, their etiology and exact pathogenesis is still unclear. Since cfNAs were observed in other autoimmune  and appear to be relevant in  processes, their role in the pathogenesis of IBD has also been suggested. This review provides a summary of knowledge from the available literature about cfDNA and cfRNA and the structures involving them such as exosomes and neutrophil extracellular traps and their association with IBD. Current studies showed the promise of cfNAs in the management of IBD not only as biomarkers distinguishing patients from healthy people and differentiating active from inactive  state, but also as a potential therapeutic target.

We need new biomarkers, so that we can offer patients the best treatment and keep the  in an inactive state for as long as possible. Alterations in metabolic profiles have been incriminated in the pathophysiology of IBD. The aim of the present study was to identify molecules that could serve as biomarkers for a positive diagnosis of IBD as well as to discriminate UC from colonic CD. Twenty-two patients with active colonic IBD (UC = 17, CD = 5) and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Plasma lipid and metabolic profiles were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate statistical tests were employed. Six lipid species and seven metabolites were significantly altered in IBD compared to healthy controls, with the majority belonging to glycerophospholipid, linoleic , and sphingolipid metabolisms. Five lipid species and only one metabolite were significantly increased in UC compared to CD. This preliminary study suggests that lipid and metabolic profiling of serum can become diagnostic tools for IBD.

In this work, a hydro-alcoholic extract of manna (HME) from Sicilian  Vahl was investigated using HPLC-DAD to find phenol components and using chemical and biological in vitro assays to determine its reducing, antioxidant and anti- capacity. We identified elenolic , tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, fraxetin, verbascoside, gallic , procyanidin-B1, and luteolin 3,7 glucoside, in order of abundance. Measurements of total antioxidant activity by Folin-Ciocalteu reaction and ferric reducing ability (FRAP), as well as of scavenger activity towards ABTS•, DPPH•, and perferryl-myoglobin radicals, showed that the phytocomplex effectively reduced oxidants with different standard potentials. When compared with vitamin E, HME also behaved as an efficient chain-breaking antioxidant against lipoperoxyl radicals from methyl linoleate. In cellular models for oxidative stress, HME counteracted membrane lipid oxidation of human erythrocytes stimulated by -butyl hydroperoxide and prevented the generation of reactive oxygen species, as well as the GSH decay in IL-1β-activated intestinal normal-like cells. Moreover, in this in vitro intestinal   model, HME reduced the release of the pro- cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.

However, the induction remission efficacy and endoscopic outcomes of 5-ASA are unknown. We investigated remission induction at 8 weeks, endoscopic outcomes until 52 weeks, and event-free survival at 52 weeks in patients with intestinal BD treated with 5-ASA.Forty-one patients with intestinal BD were treated with oral 5-ASA. Clinical remission was evaluated with the Crohn's  activity index (CDAI). The endoscopic response was evaluated using the modified global gastrointestinal endoscopic assessment scores. Rescue therapy-free survival and surgery-free survival at 52 weeks were estimated, and predictive factors for a clinical response at weeks 8 and 52 were identified.Seven patients (17%) withdrew 5-ASA early (≤ 8 weeks) because of adverse events. At week 8, clinical efficacy could be accurately evaluated in 28 patients, and the response and remission rates were 61% and 57%, respectively, using the CDAI. Endoscopic evaluation was achieved in 17 patients up to 52 weeks, and the endoscopic response and remission rates were 71% and 35%, respectively. The probabilities of rescue therapy-free survival and surgery-free survival were 73% and 100%, respectively, at 52 weeks in all 41 patients.

We divided patients administered with biologics as maintenance treatment into those who did and did not continue on 5-ASA and compared the efficacies of the two treatment options using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models.Of 1300 total IBD patients, 128 (UC, 63; CD, 65) were prescribed biologics as induction and maintenance treatments. The median follow-up period was 109.5 weeks. All cases were divided into those who did or did not combine 5-ASA with biologics as maintenance treatments.

Biotransformation of primary to secondary bile  have been known to be involved in the immune regulation of human physiology. Several 16S amplicon-based studies with  (IBD) subjects were found to have an association with the level of fecal bile . However, a detailed investigation of all the bile salt biotransformation genes in the gut microbiome of healthy and IBD subjects has not been performed.Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the bile salt biotransformation genes and their distribution at the phyla level. Based on the analysis of shotgun metagenomes, we found that the IBD subjects harbored a significantly lower abundance of these genes compared to the healthy controls. Majority of these genes originated from Firmicutes in comparison to other phyla. From metabolomics data, we found that the IBD subjects were measured with a significantly low level of secondary bile  and high levels of primary bile  compared to that of the healthy controls.Our bioinformatics-driven approach of identifying bile salt biotransformation genes predicts the bile salt biotransformation potential in the gut microbiota of IBD subjects.

This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon epithelium. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring,  and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the  activity index (DAI) and histopathological  scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti- and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the gut mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local  reactions and oxidative stress. These effects suggested that TRF could serve as a gut health supplement for preventive measures for UC condition in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119329>Identification and characterization of a novel anti- lipid isolated from Mycobacterium vaccae, a soil-derived bacterium with immunoregulatory and stress resilience properties.</a></h1><p>Mycobacterium vaccae (NCTC 11659) is an environmental saprophytic bacterium with anti-, immunoregulatory, and stress resilience properties.

In the biologic era, it still remains the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. Positioning of this therapeutic class in moderate-to-severe UC is less clear. : Several studies demonstrated the ability of 5-ASA to induce endoscopic remission to a similar extent as anti-TNF therapy on the moderate segment of UC. Histologic remission is achieved after induction in up to 45% of patients treated with topical 5-ASA and 30% with oral formulations. Aminosalicylates offer a favorable safety profile compared to that of immunomodulators and biologics. High-dose 5-ASA therapy may be a valuable option for patients with moderately active , and physicians should weigh the pros and cons of this strategy in selected patients. Whether aminosalicylates should be continued in combination with thiopurines or biologic therapy remains under debate. : In the era of biologics, aminosalicylates remain the first-line therapy in patients with mild UC, and have to be considered in case of moderate UC, given their favorable risk-benefit profile. We suggest that 5-ASA should be used in moderate patients without poor prognostic factors, while biologics should be preferred otherwise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281735>Gut microbiota metabolite regulation of host defenses at mucosal surfaces: implication in precision medicine.</a></h1><p>The gut microbiota has a well-established role in the regulation of host homeostasis. Multiple factors control the composition and function of the microbiota. The westernization of diet, a shift away from nutrient-dense foods toward diets high in saturated fats, has been implicated in the rise of chronic   such as  (IBD). Diet is critical in the development and maintenance of a healthy microbiome, where dietary fiber (found in the highest amounts in fruits, vegetables, and legumes) is metabolized by the microbiome. In turn, the bacterial metabolites of dietary fiber, short chain fatty  (SCFAs), regulate gut homeostasis. SCFAs engage G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs) and act as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to module epithelial and immune cell functions in the intestines, where they generally promote an anti- state. This review highlights the functions of SCFAs and their roles in the pathogenesis of IBD to provide insights into their potential therapeutic application for the treatment of IBD for the purposes of precision medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029826>Cardiac myocyte KLF5 regulates body weight via alteration of cardiac FGF21.</a></h1><p>Cardiac metabolism affects systemic energetic balance. Previously, we showed that Krüppel-like factor (KLF)-5 regulates cardiomyocyte PPARα and fatty  oxidation-related gene expression in diabetes. We surprisingly found that cardiomyocyte-specific KLF5 knockout mice (αMHC-KLF5) have accelerated diet-induced obesity, associated with increased white adipose tissue (WAT). Alterations in cardiac expression of the mediator complex subunit 13 (Med13) modulates obesity. αMHC-KLF5 mice had reduced cardiac Med13 expression likely because KLF5 upregulates Med13 expression in cardiomyocytes. We then investigated potential mechanisms that mediate cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and WAT. High fat diet-fed αMHC-KLF5 mice had increased levels of cardiac and plasma FGF21, while food intake, activity, plasma leptin, and natriuretic peptides expression were unchanged. Consistent with studies reporting that FGF21 signaling in WAT decreases sumoylation-driven PPARγ inactivation, αMHC-KLF5 mice had less SUMO-PPARγ in WAT. Increased diet-induced obesity found in αMHC-KLF5 mice was absent in αMHC-[KLF5;FGF21] double knockout mice, as well as in αMHC-FGF21 mice that we generated. Thus, cardiomyocyte-derived FGF21 is a component of pro-adipogenic crosstalk between heart and WAT.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with  (IBD) and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti- effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from IBD patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in mice and protected intestinal barrier integrity. CRYAB regulates  response in intestinal mucosa by inhibiting IKKβ-mediated signaling and may serve as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092280>Systematic assessment of secondary bile  metabolism in gut microbes reveals distinct metabolic capabilities in .</a></h1><p>The human gut microbiome performs important functions in human health and . A classic example for host-gut microbial co-metabolism is host biosynthesis of primary bile  and their subsequent deconjugation and transformation by the gut microbiome. To understand these system-level host-microbe interactions, a mechanistic, multi-scale computational systems biology approach that integrates the different types of omic data is needed. Here, we use a systematic workflow to computationally model bile  metabolism in gut microbes and microbial communities.Therefore, we first performed a comparative genomic analysis of bile  deconjugation and biotransformation pathways in 693 human gut microbial genomes and expanded 232 curated genome-scale microbial metabolic reconstructions with the corresponding reactions (available at https://vmh.life ). We then predicted the bile  biotransformation potential of each microbe and in combination with other microbes. We found that each microbe could produce maximally six of the 13 secondary bile  in silico, while microbial pairs could produce up to 12 bile , suggesting bile  biotransformation being a microbial community task. To investigate the metabolic potential of a given microbiome, publicly available metagenomics data from healthy Western individuals, as well as  patients and healthy controls, were mapped onto the genomes of the reconstructed strains. We constructed for each individual a large-scale personalized microbial community model that takes into account strain-level abundances. Using flux balance analysis, we found considerable variation in the potential to deconjugate and transform primary bile  between the gut microbiomes of healthy individuals. Moreover, the microbiomes of pediatric  patients were significantly depleted in their bile  production potential compared with that of controls. The contributions of each strain to overall bile  production potential across individuals were found to be distinct between  patients and controls. Finally, bottlenecks limiting secondary bile  production potential were identified in each microbiome model.This large-scale modeling approach provides a novel way of analyzing metagenomics data to accelerate our understanding of the metabolic interactions between the host and gut microbiomes in health and  states.

Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of α-amyrin acetate was compared to the amyrin derivatives, α-amyrin and β-amyrin. All displayed a suppressive effect on Th17 polarization and all reduced the expression of single transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and retinoic  receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), which are crucial transcription factors regulating Th17 differentiation. α-Amyrin acetate, however, exhibited the most prominent effects, which indicates that the functional group, acetate, might strengthen the inhibitory effect on Th17 differentiation.Taken together, these results suggest that the extract of F. rhynchophylla and its active constituent, α-amyrin acetate, could be applied as a potential therapeutic agent for autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2019.

We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of IBD in central Taiwan. We retrospectively analyzed patients with IBD diagnosed at our hospital between January 2000 and September 2018. The diagnostic criteria were based on endoscopic and pathologic findings. Clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. A total of 190 patients with IBD were enrolled (80 with Crohn's  (CD) and 110 with ulcerative colitis (UC)). The mean age at diagnosis was 38.4 years (CD: 36 years, UC: 40 years). Male patients accounted for the majority of patients (71.1%). The male-to-female ratio was 3 : 1 for CD and 2.1 : 1 for UC. Current and ever smokers accounted for 30.5% of all patients. Only 4.2% of patients had a family history of IBD. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) were reported in 7.9%, and colorectal cancers (CRCs) were reported in 2.1% of all patients. In patients with CD, the ileal type was the most common  phenotype (57.5%), and the stricturing type was the most common  behavior (60.0%).

Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the  process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty  are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  due to its less pro- properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty  in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac  at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level.

All-trans retinoic  (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic  (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells.

Adult wild-type mice were placed on chow or a high sugar diet (50% sucrose) ± acetate. After two days of diet, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis.  severity was assessed daily. Colonic tissues were analyzed for cytokine expression using the MesoScale discovery platform. Intestinal dextran permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) were measured. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing and short chain fatty  (SCFA) concentrations by gas chromatography. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were incubated with LPS and cytokine secretion measured. Mice on a high sugar diet had increased gut permeability, decreased microbial diversity and reduced SCFA. BMDM derived from high sugar fed mice were highly responsive to LPS. High sugar fed mice had increased susceptibility to colitis and pro- cytokine concentrations. Oral acetate significantly attenuated colitis in mice by restoring permeability.

Developing novel efficient therapeutics is still a common interest for clinicians. Increasing evidence have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) contributes to the pathological pain state in some pain models. Resveratrol (RSV) has showed promising potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain and  pain. However, whether RSV has analgesic effect on visceral pain and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established the colitis model through intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS), and found that TNBS induced colonic inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Meanwhile, astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), TRAF6, phosphorylation of NF-κB (pNF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were increased in L6-S1 spinal cord after TNBS enema. Then, intrathecal injection of TRAF6 siRNA attenuated visceral pain, blocked the upregulation of pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the spinal cord in TNBS mice. Furthermore, spinal administration of NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 reversed the pain behavior and suppressed spinal TNF-α and IL-1β expression in TNBS mice. Finally, repeated intrathecal injection of RSV reversed TNBS-induced visceral pain hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TNBS-induced enhancement of spinal GFAP, TRAF6, pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β were reduced by the same treatment of RSV. In conclusion, our results suggest that RSV exerts the effects of antinociception on colitis-induced visceral hyperalgesia through inhibition of spinal TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway and the production of  mediators in the spinal cord, suggesting a new application of RSV for the treatment of visceral pain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Surprisingly, HABN also modulates the gut microbiota, increasing the overall richness and diversity and markedly augmenting the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium XIVα, which are microorganisms with crucial roles in gut homeostasis.

Participants had a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, handgrip dynamometer test, wore a pedometer and completed a food diary. Arterialised hand and venous forearm blood samples were collected concurrently and brachial artery blood flow measured at baseline and every 20 min for 2 hrs after the ingestion of a standardised liquid meal. Net balance of branched chain amino  (BCAA) and glucose were derived.Controls had a positive mean BCAA balance. CD participants had an initial anabolic response to the meal, with increasing BCAA balance between t = 0 & t = 20, but returned to negative by t = 60. This was associated with reduced FFM z-scores in CD but not with insulin resistance or  activity. Exploratory analyses suggest that negative postprandial BCAA response seen in CD is predominant in males (p = 0.049), with associated lower appendicular muscle mass (p = 0.034), higher muscle fatigue (p = 0.014) and reduced protein intake (p = 0.026).The inability to sustain a positive protein balance postprandially could provide an explanation for the reduced muscle mass seen in CD. Further mechanistic studies will be needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's  (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti- abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti- capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic -induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti- cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro- cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

However, the accurate mechanisms of miRNAs in CD are definitely unclear. We employed colonic tissue samples from normal volunteers and CD patients, an acute mice colitis model induced by 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene-sulfonic  (TNBS), and a cellular oxidative stress model induced by HO in HT-29 cells to determine the effects of oxidative stress on expressions of miR-122, selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1, SBP1), p65 nuclear factor B (p65NF-B) signaling, and DNA methylation. We found that SBP1 was mainly located on epithelial cells and was significantly increased in patients with active CD. SBP1 was the target gene of miR-122. miR-122 expression was downregulated while SBP1 expression was upregulated under TNBS-induced colitis or oxidative stress. Pre-miR-122 or siRNA SBP1 (si-SBP1) treatment ameliorated acute TNBS-induced colitis and HO-induced oxidative stress. Cotreatment of pre-miR-122 and si-SBP1 enhanced these effects. Besides, pre-miR-122 and si-SBP1 obviously activated the p65NF-B signaling by phosphorylation of IB. Bisulfite sequencing of the CpG islands in the promoter region of miR-122 showed that CpG methylation was significantly increased under oxidative stress. Treating cells with 5'-AZA which was well known as a DNA-demethylating agent significantly increased miR-122 expression. Our results suggest that oxidative stress-induced DNA methylation of miR-122 aggravates colitis targeting SELENBP1 partially by p65NF-B signaling and may promote the progression of CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567972>Serum cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor profiles and their modulation in .</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn  (CD) are the most common forms of  (IBD). Because these subtypes of IBD are characterized by periods of activity and remission, an understanding of the modulation of biochemical markers with the clinical features of IBD or its treatment, may be useful for determining the correct treatment protocol.This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of 27 protein biomarkers to determine their association with IBD, correlation with clinical findings of , and modulation according to the pharmacologic therapy.A case-control study was carried out in Zacatecas, Mexico. The 27 protein profiles of serum from 53 participants (23 UC, 11 CD, and 19 controls) were evaluated using the Pro Human Cytokine 27-Plex immunoassay (Bio-Rad).Considering the controls as a reference, the group with IBD endoscopic activity showed higher serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) (P < .05). Interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10) was associated with extraintestinal symptoms of  (P = .041). Both PDGF-BB and interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed the strongest correlations with clinical features of IBD. Levels of IL-6, IL-7, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were higher with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) + Azathioprine therapy than controls (P < .05). Combined therapy with 5-ASA + Adalimumab led to the strongest changes in marker modulation: IL-4, IL-5, IL-15, and PDGF-BB, were upregulated (P < .05).Elevated serum levels of G-CSF, IL-1Ra, and PDGF-BB were associated with IBD endoscopic activity, and of IP-10 with extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Combined therapy of 5-ASA + Adalimumab produced significant upregulation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-15, and PDGF-BB.

The rodent Slfn3 and its human analog Slfn12 are critical in regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation. We sought to characterize intestinal function in Slfn3 knockout (KO) mice. Male and female pair-fed Slfn3KO mice gained less weight with decreased food efficiency than wild type (WT) mice, with more pronounced effects in females. RNA sequencing performed on intestinal mucosa of Slfn3KO and WT mice showed gene ontology decreases in cell adhesion molecule signaling, tumor necrosis factor receptor binding, and adaptive immune cell proliferation/functioning genes in Slfn3KO mice, with greater effects in females. qPCR analysis of fatty  metabolism genes, Pla2g4c, Pla2g2f, and Cyp3c55 revealed an increase in Pla2g4c, and a decrease in Pla2g2f in Slfn3KO females. Additionally, adipogenesis genes, Fabp4 and Lpl were decreased and ketogenesis gene Hmgcs2 was increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Sequencing did not reveal significant changes in differentiation markers, so qPCR was utilized. Slfn3KO tended to have decreased expression of intestinal differentiation markers sucrase isomaltase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, villin 1, and glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) vs. WT males, although these trends did not achieve statistical significance unless data from several markers was pooled. Differentiation markers, Glut2 and sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), did show statistically significant sex-dependent differences. Glut2 mRNA was reduced in Slfn3KO females, while SGLT1 increased in Slfn3KO males. Notch2 and Cdx2 were only increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Although Slfn3KO mice gain less weight and decreased food efficiency, their biochemical phenotype is more subtle and suggests a complex interplay between gender effects, Slfn3, and another regulatory pathway yet to be identified that compensates for the chronic loss of Slfn3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583160>Volatile Organic Compounds as Biomarkers of Gastrointestinal  and Nutritional Status.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this review was to identify the best solution for rapid and noninvasive diagnosis and long-term monitoring of patients affected by  gastrointestinal , colon and gastric cancer, obesity in correlation to diet, and breast milk to evaluate exposure to VOCs in women and infants.This review included 20 previously published eligible studies. VOC analysis has allowed us to highlight differences in lifestyles, intestinal microbiota, and metabolism. New innovative methods have been described that allow the detection and quantification of a broad spectrum of metabolites present in exhaled breath even at very low levels, some of which have been shown to be indicators of pathological conditions.Five studies were analyzed that involved VOC analysis in relation to type of diet. All of them showed that the type of diet can have an impact on metabolites excreted and therefore can be a useful tool in the nutritional studies related to metabolism and health and  status. Two studies concerned VOC analysis in , and the results showed that VOCs can distinguish active  from remission; VOC profile is clearly different in patients. In particular, CH 1-pentadecene, 3-methyl-1-butanal, octane, acetic , alpha-pinene, and m-cymene are elevated in active ulcerative colitis. Four studies examined VOCs in gastric and colorectal tumors showing a change in metabolic biomarkers of cancer patients compared to the control group. Finally, the study of VOCs in breast milk has improved the understanding of the potential health risks of exposure of children to chemical pollutants.VOC analysis allowed to highlight differences in behavior, lifestyle, and metabolism of individuals.

Studies of treatment-naive patients have identified microbial taxa associated with  course and treatment efficacy. To gain a mechanistic understanding of how the microbiome affects gastrointestinal health, we need to move from census to function. Bacteria, including those that adhere to epithelial cells as well as several Clostridium species, can alter differentiation of T helper 17 cells and regulatory T cells. Similarly, microbial products such as short-chain fatty  and sphingolipids also influence immune responses. Metagenomics and culturomics have identified strains of Ruminococcus gnavus and adherent invasive Escherichia coli that are linked to IBD and gut inflammation.

The etiology of colitis cases can be manifold, and diet can significantly affect onset and outcome of colitis. While many forms of acute colitis are easily treatable, chronic forms of colitis such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's  (summarized as ) are multifactorial with poorly understood pathogenesis.  are characterized by exacerbated immune responses causing epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. There is no cure and therapies aim at reducing inflammation and restoring intestinal barrier function. Unfortunately, most drugs can have severe side effects. Changes in diet and inclusion of nutritional supplements have been extensively studied in cell culture and animal models, and some supplements have shown promising results in clinical studies. Most of these nutritional supplements including vitamins, fatty  and phytochemicals reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and have shown beneficial effects during experimental colitis in rodents induced by dextran sulphate sodium or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic , which remain the gold standard in pre-clinical colitis research.

Accumulating evidence points to the significance of estrogen action not only in tumors of hormonally regulated tissues such as the breast, endometrium and ovary, but also in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The effects of estrogens in physiological and pathophysiological conditions are mediated by the nuclear estrogen receptors α and β, as well as the membrane-bound G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). The roles of GPER in CRC development and progression, however, remain poorly understood. Studies on the functions of GPER in the colon have shown that this estrogen receptor regulates colonic motility as well as immune responses in CRC-associated , such as Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. GPER is also involved in cell cycle regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, proliferation, apoptosis, vascularization, cell migration, and the regulation of fatty  and estrogen metabolism in CRC cells. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that GPER may play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. In this review, we present the current state of knowledge regarding the contribution of GPER to colon function and CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059511>Meiotic gatekeeper STRA8 suppresses autophagy by repressing Nr1d1 expression during spermatogenesis in mice.</a></h1><p>The transition from mitotic to meiotic cell cycles is essential for haploid gamete formation and fertility. Stimulated by retinoic  gene 8 (Stra8) is an essential gatekeeper of meiotic initiation in vertebrates; yet, the molecular role of STRA8 remains principally unknown. Here we demonstrate that STRA8 functions as a suppressor of autophagy during spermatogenesis in mice. Stra8-deficient germ cells fail to enter meiosis and present aberrant upregulation of autophagy-lysosome genes, commensurate with autophagy activation. Biochemical assays show that ectopic expression of STRA8 alone is sufficient to inhibit both autophagy induction and maturation. Studies also revealed that, Nr1d1, a nuclear hormone receptor gene, is upregulated in Stra8-deficient testes and that STRA8 binds to the Nr1d1 promoter, indicating that Nr1d1 is a direct target of STRA8 transcriptional repression. In addition, it was found that NR1D1 binds to the promoter of Ulk1, a gene essential for autophagy initiation, and that Nr1d1 is required for the upregulated Ulk1 expression in Stra8-deficient testes. Furthermore, both genetic deletion of Nr1d1 and pharmacologic inhibition of NR1D1 by its synthetic antagonist SR8278 exhibit rescuing effects on the meiotic initiation defects observed in Stra8-deficient male germ cells. Together, the data suggest a novel link between STRA8-mediated autophagy suppression and meiotic initiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095872>Urine Proteome Changes in a TNBS-Induced Colitis Rat Model.</a></h1><p>Urine is an important resource for biomarker research.

Although the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear, growing evidence has shown that dysregulated immune system reactions in genetically susceptible individuals contribute to mucosal inflammation. However, conventional treatments have been effective in inducing remission of IBD but not in preventing the relapse of them. In this way, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) therapy has been recognized as a promising treatment for IBD due to their immunomodulatory properties, ability to differentiate into several tissues, and homing to  sites. Even so, literature is conflicted regarding the location and persistence of MSC in the body after transplantation. For this reason, recent studies have focused on the paracrine effect of the biofactors secreted by MSC, especially in relation to the immunomodulatory potential of soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) and extracellular vehicles that are involved in cell communication and in the transfer of cellular material, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic . Moreover, treatment with interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β causes MSC to express immunomodulatory molecules that mediate the suppression  cell-contact dependent mechanisms.

PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder for which there is no established medical therapy. Preclinical data suggest curcumin may have a beneficial effect in PSC.  Subjects with PSC and a serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) received curcumin 750 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks in an open-label pilot study. The primary composite endpoint was proportion of subjects who had a reduction of SAP to less than 1.5 times ULN or a 40% reduction in SAP between baseline and week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, Mayo PSC risk score and self-reported health questionnaires.  Two-hundred and fifty-eight patients with PSC were screened and 15 subjects were enrolled and all completed 12 weeks of therapy. The most common reason for subject exclusion was SAP less than 1.5 times the ULN ( = 98). Curcumin did not result in a significant median (interquartile range) change in SAP times the ULN [3.43 (2.10-4.32) to 2.46 (1.89-4.41),  = .36], and only 20% (3/15) subjects achieved the primary endpoint. Similarly, there was no significant change in the secondary endpoints. There were no serious adverse events reported.

This updated Cochrane review summarizes current evidence on the use of 5-ASA formulations for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.To assess the efficacy and safety of 5-ASA agents for the maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 16 July 2018. We also searched references, conference abstracts, and trials registers.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included participants with CD in remission following surgery and compared 5-ASAs to no treatment, placebo or any other active intervention with duration of at least three months were considered for inclusion.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic recurrence, radiologic and surgical relapse, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events.Fourteen RCTs (1867 participants) were included in the review. Participants (15 to 70 years) were recruited from gastroenterology hospitals and medical clinics in Europe and North America and followed up between 3 and 72 months. The risk of bias was assessed as 'low' in one study, 'unclear' in seven and as 'high' in six.At 12 months, 36% (20/55) of participants in the 5-ASA group experienced clinical relapse compared to 51% (28/55) in the no treatment control group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.10; low certainty evidence). Moderate certainty evidence suggests that 5-ASAs are more effective for preventing clinical relapse than placebo. During a follow-up period of 12 to 72 months, 36% (131/361) of 5-ASA participants relapsed compared to 43% (160/369) of placebo participants (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). At 12 months, 17% (17/101) of the 4 g/day mesalamine group relapsed compared to 26% (27/105) of the 2.4 g/day group (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.13; moderate certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in clinical relapse rates when 5-ASA compounds were compared to purine antimetabolites. At 24 months, 61% (103/170) of mesalamine participants relapsed compared to 67% (119/177) of azathioprine participants (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07; I² = 28%; low certainty evidence). During 24 months, 50% (9/18) of 5-ASA participants had clinical relapse compared to 13% (2/16) of adalimumab participants (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.01 to 15.84; low certainty evidence). The effects of sulphasalazine compared to placebo on clinical relapse rate is uncertain. After 18 to 36 months, 66% (95/143) of participants treated with sulphasalazine relapsed compared to 71% (110/155) in the placebo group (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.38; I² = 38%; low certainty evidence).The effect of 5-ASA drugs on safety was uncertain. During 24 months follow-up, 4% (2/55) of 5-ASA participants experienced adverse events compared to none (0/55) in the no treatment control group (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.81; very low certainty evidence). An equal proportion of 5-ASA participants (10%; 23/241) and placebo (9%; 20/225) groups experienced an adverse event during a follow-up of 3 to 72 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Adverse event rates were similar in the 5-ASA and purine analogues groups. However, serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in participants who received purine analogues than 5-ASA. At 52 weeks to 24 months, 52% (107/207) of 5-ASA participants had an adverse event compared to 47% (102/218) of purine analogue participants (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Four per cent (6/152) of 5-ASA participants had a serious adverse event compared to 17% (27/159) of purine analogue participants (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80; very low certainty evidence). Eight per cent (17/207) of 5-ASA participants withdrew due to an adverse event compared to 19% (42/218) of purine analogue participants (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.83; low certainty evidence). Adverse event rates were similar in high and low dose mesalamine participants. After 12 months, 2% (2/101) of 4 g/day mesalamine participants had an adverse event compared to 2% (2/105) of 2.4 g/day participants (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.24; low certainty evidence). The proportion of participants who experienced adverse events over a 24 month follow-up in the mesalamine group was 78% (14/18) compared to 69% (11/16) of adalimumab participants (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.71; very low certainty evidence). None (0/32) of the sulphasalazine participants had an adverse event at 18 months follow-up compared to 3% (1/34) of the placebo group (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.38; very low certainty evidence). Commonly reported adverse events in the included studies were diarrhoea, nausea, increased liver function tests, pancreatitis, and abdominal pain.5-ASA preparations are superior to placebo for the maintenance of surgically-induced clinical remission in patients with CD (moderate certainty). The number needed to treat to prevent one relapse was 13 patients. The evidence for endoscopic remission is uncertain. The sulphasalazine class of 5-ASA agents failed to demonstrate superiority against placebo, 5-ASAs failed to demonstrate superiority compared to no treatment (very low and low certainty). The efficacy of two different doses of the same 5-ASA and the efficacy of 5-ASA compared to purine antimetabolites (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) in maintaining surgically-induced remission of CD remains unclear. However, purine analogues lead to more serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events. There is a low certainty that 5-ASA is inferior for maintaining surgically-induced remission of CD compared to biologics (anti TNF-ɑ). 5-ASA formulations appear to be safe with no difference in the occurrence of adverse events or withdrawal when compared with placebo, no treatment or biologics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135224>Dietary  Fruit Attenuates Colitis-Associated Tumorigenesis: A Pivotal Role of the NF-κB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 Pathway.</a></h1><p> (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the risk factors for the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). CAC is a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer death.  (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid , and flavonoids, and it has shown anti- property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice ( = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea,  activity index (DAI), spleen weight ( < 0.001), and the number of tumors ( < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length ( < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-кB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that dietary ZJ attenuates inflammation by interfering NF-κB/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527366>[Physiological and pathophysiological roles of TRPV4 channel in gastrointestinal tract].</a></h1><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a non-selective cation channel that responds to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli in addition to various endogenous ligands, such as arachidonic  metabolites. The present study aimed to elucidate the expression of TRPV4 in the gastrointestinal tract and the pathogenic roles of TRPV4 in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. TRPV4-immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial-like cells of the mouse tongue, esophagus, stomach, ileum, and colon; TRPV4 expression in the tongue was higher than other gastrointestinal tracts. TRPV4 colocalized with a type IV cell marker sonic hedgehog in circumvallate papillae. These findings suggest that TRPV4 contributes to sour taste sensing by regulating type III taste cell differentiation in mice. DSS-induced colitis was significantly attenuated in TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4KO) mice when compared to wild-type mice. DSS treatment upregulated TRPV4 expression in vascular endothelia of colonic mucosa and submucosa. DSS treatment increased vascular permeability, which was abolished in TRPV4KO mice. The activation of TRPV4 decreased VE-cadherin expression in mouse aortic endothelial cells exposed to TNF-α. These findings indicate that the upregulation of TRPV4 in vascular endothelial cells contributes to the progression of colonic inflammation via the activation of vascular permeability. Thus, TRPV4 is an attractive target for the treatment of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142251>The Potential Use of Grape Phytochemicals for Preventing the Development of Intestine-Related and Subsequent  .</a></h1><p>Grape phytochemicals prevent intestine-related and subsequent other  . Phytochemicals and vitamin D are useful for the regulation of  responses. Phytochemicals is the generic name for terpenoids, carotenoids, and flavonoids that consist of a variety of chemicals contained in vegetables and fruits. There are a variety of grape cultivars that contain many kinds of phytochemicals in their skin and seeds. Grape phytochemicals including Grape Seed Extracts (GSE) have already been used to maintain healthy condition through manipulating  responses by decreasing the expression of inflammation-related factors.Grape phytochemicals mainly consist of a variety of chemicals that include terpenoid (oleanolic ), carotenoids (β-carotene, lutein), and flavonoids: flavon-3-ols (quercetin), flavan-3-ols (catechins), anthocyanins, oligomers and polymers (tannins and proanthocyanidins), and resveratrol. Phytochemicals improve the dysbiosis (gut microbiota complication) induced by metabolic syndrome and regulate   induced by TNF-α production. Once absorbed, flavonoids change into glucuronide-form, move into the bloodstream and reach the  sites including liver, lung, and sites of arteriosclerosis, where they become active. Furthermore, oleanolic  acts on TGR5 - the cholic  receptor, as an agonist of cholic .

In this study, we used a proteomics approach to explore the molecular intestinal response in two rhesus macaque (RM) animal models of experimentally induced colitis using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. Proteomic analysis detected more than 2500 proteins in colonic tissue collected from 30 RMs. Differential protein expression analysis revealed a protein expression pattern in DSS-treated RMs resembling the proteome of human ulcerative colitis. In a group of 12 DSS-treated RMs compared to 6 with no treatment, decrease in expression of proteins related to mitochondrial energy metabolism, including fatty  metabolism was noted, while innate immune activation pathways, including complement and coagulation proteins were upregulated. SIV infection of RMs resulted in increased innate immune responses related to viral defense. Proteomic signatures of barrier damage were apparent in both DSS treatment or SIV infection.

Overexpression of iNOS increases the levels of NO, and this increased NO level is implicated in pathophysiology of complex multifactorial  like Parkinson's , Alzheimer's , multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and . Selective inhibition of iNOS is an effective approach in treatment of such complex . l-Arginine, being a substrate for iNOS, is the natural lead to develop iNOS inhibitors. More than 200 research reports on development of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors by different research groups across the globe have appeared in literature so far. The first review on iNOS, in 2002, discussed the iNOS inhibitors under two classes that is, amino  and non-amino  derivatives. Other review articles discussing specific chemical classes of iNOS inhibitors also appeared during last decade. In the present review, all reports on both natural and synthetic iNOS inhibitors, published 2002 onwards, are studied, classified, and discussed to provide comprehensive information on iNOS inhibitors. The synthetic inhibitors are broadly classified into two categories that is, arginine and non-arginine analogs. The latter are further classified into amidines, five- or six-membered heterocyclics, fused cyclics, steroidal type, and chalcones analogs. Structures of the most/significantly potent compounds from each report are provided to know the functional groups important for incurring iNOS inhibitory activity and selectivity.

We sought to develop a chronic mouse IBD model for assessing long-term anti- effects with ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) by using dual P- and E-selectin targeted microbubbles (MB). : Interleukin 10 deficient (IL-10 on a C57BL/6 genetic background; n=55) and FVB (n=16) mice were used. In IL-10mice, various experimental regimens including piroxicam, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), respectively were used for promoting colitis; colitis was induced with DSS in FVB mice. Using clinical and small animal ultrasound scanners, evolution of inflammation in proximal, middle and distal colon, was monitored with USMI by using MB at multiple time points. Imaged colon segments were analyzed  for  changes on H&E staining and for P-selectin expression on immunofluorescence staining. : Sustained colitis was not detected with USMI in IL-10 or FVB mice with various experimental regimens. USMI signals either gradually decreased after the colitis enhancing/inducing drug/agents were discontinued, or the mortality rate of mice was high. Inflammation was observed on H&E staining in IL-10 mice with piroxicam promotion, while stable overexpression of P-selectin was not found on immunofluorescence staining in the same mice. : Sustained colitis in IL-10 mice induced with piroxicam, TNBS or DSS, and in FVB mice induced with DSS, was not detected with USMI using MB, and this was verified by immunofluorescence staining for inflammation marker P-selectin. Thus, these models may not be appropriate for long-term monitoring of chronic colitis and subsequent treatment response with dual-selectin targeted USMI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387229>Supercritical Fluid Extract of  and  Roscoe Ameliorates TNBS-Induced Colitis in Rats.</a></h1><p> (IBD) is a worldwide healthcare problem calling for the development of new therapeutic drugs.  and  Roscoe are two common dietetic Chinese herbs, which are traditionally used for complementary treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. As bioactive constituents, volatile and pungent substances of these two herbs could be effectively extracted together by supercritical fluid extraction. In this study, the supercritical fluid extract of  and  Roscoe (AZ-SFE) was obtained by an optimized extraction process and it was chemically characterized. The anti- effect and underlying mechanism of AZ-SFE were evaluated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cell model and a 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis rat model. AZ-SFE notably inhibited the production of NO in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and it inhibited the proliferation of Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced splenocytes with suppression of the Th1 immune response. In vivo, the study demonstrated that AZ-SFE significantly alleviated  activity, colonic shortening, macroscopic damage and histological injury of TNBS-treated rats with reduction of oxidative stress, suppression of  cytokines, and modulation of hepcidin and serum iron.

The objective of this study was to investigate prescribing patterns and non-persistence of anti-TNFα therapy for the treatment of IBD in a real-world scenario.Data from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database obtained between 2010 and 2014 were evaluated to identify patients with IBD who had received anti-TNFα therapy (infliximab or adalimumab). Patient characteristics and prescribing patterns were investigated. The non-persistence rate and associated reasons were determined in patients who initiated therapy between 2010 and 2012.A total of 131,158 patients with UC and 57,286 with CD were identified. Of these 1747 UC (1.3%) and 3731 (6.5%) CD patients had received anti-TNFα therapy and were included in the analysis. Infliximab was prescribed more frequently than adalimumab (84.6% vs 15.4% in UC and 80.7% vs 19.4% in CD); 81.0% of UC and 72.0% of CD patients received anti-TNFα alone or in combination with 5-aminosalicylic . The non-persistence rate of anti-TNFα therapy was 72.6% and 80.4% in the UC and CD groups, respectively, with discontinuation of medication being the most common reason in both the UC and CD groups (63.9% and 73.3%, respectively).The use of anti-TNFα therapy was seen to be low, with a high rate of non-persistence.

Total flavone of Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic (TFA), has been used as anti‑ and myocardial ischemia protective drug. The present study aimed to explore the effects of TFA on CD and its underlying mechanism. We reported that TFA comprises eight flavone glycosides, including quercetin‑3‑O‑robinobioside, gossypetin‑3‑O‑glucoside, quercetin‑3'‑O‑glucoside, isoquercetin, hyperoside, myricetin, gossypetin and quercetin. In vivo, TFA promoted the survival of 2,4,6‑trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)‑induced colitis in mice, decreased weight loss and increased colon length in a dose‑dependent manner. Additionally, TFA notably ameliorated the  response in mice with TNBS‑induced colitis as determined by histopathological analysis. In addition, the administration of TFA in mice with TNBS‑induced colitis led to a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines in the sera and colon tissues; a significant decrease myeloperoxidase activity in the colon tissues was also observed. These findings may be associated with the suppression of the nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) and mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In vitro, TFA significantly downregulated the expression of cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced RAW264.7 cells. In addition, TFA suppressed LPS‑induced activation of the NF‑κB and MAPK signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. Our findings indicated that TFA could suppress the  response in mice with TNBS‑induced colitis via inhibition of the NF‑κB and MAPK signaling pathways.

In this review, we focus on methanogenic Archaea, which rely on hydrogen for their metabolism and growth. On one hand, methanogenic Archaea in the gut are functional associates of the fermentative digestion of dietary fibers, favoring the production of beneficial short-chain fatty  and likely contributing to the weaning reaction during the neonatal window of opportunity. On the other hand, methanogenic Archaea trigger the activation of innate and adaptive responses and the generation of specific T and B cells in animals and humans. In mouse models, lung hypersensitivity reactions can be induced by inhaled methanogenic Archaea mimicking human professional exposure to organic dust. Changes in methanogenic Archaea of the microbiota are detected in an array of dysimmune conditions comprising , obesity, malnutrition, anorexia, colorectal cancer, and diverticulosis. At the subcellular level, methanogenic Archaea are activators of the TLR8-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome, modulate the release of antimicrobial peptides and drive the production of proinflammatory, Th-1, Th-2, and Th-17 cytokines.

We identified factors associated with  seropositivity in the F4 survey. Further, we assessed relative risks of incident metabolic /risk factors at the time of the second follow-up survey of S4 (termed FF4) and  seropositivity at the F4 survey as a determinant.

However, the knowledge about the AT2 receptor involvement in this process is still evolving. We previously found that in an experimental model of colitis, AT2 receptor activation can contribute to the impairment of the muscle contractility in vitro in the course of inflammation. Here, we investigated the potential alleviating effects of the in vivo treatment of PD123319 (1-[[4-(Dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7- tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic  ditrifluoroacetate), AT2 receptor antagonist, in 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS)-induced rat model of colitis. The effects of i.p PD123319 (0.3, 3 and 10 mg/kg) administration to rats subjected to intra-rectal DNBS instillation were investigated. The study revealed that the colon injury and the  signs were ameliorated by PD123319 when visualized by the histopathological examination. The colon shortening, myeloperoxidase activity, and colonic expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and iNOS were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner in DNBS-induced colitis rats treated with PD123319 and the anti-oxidant defense machinery was also improved. The mechanism of these beneficial effects was found in the ability of PD123319 to inhibit NF-κB activation induced by DNBS. The colonic contractility in inflamed tissues was also improved by PD123319 treatment. In conclusion, our data have demonstrated previously that undescribed proinflammatory effects for the AT2 receptors in DNBS-induced colitis in rats in which they are mediated likely by NF-κB activation and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, when the  process is mitigated by the AT2 receptor antagonist treatment, the smooth muscle is able to recover its functionality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240835>Correlation of diet, microbiota and metabolite networks in .</a></h1><p>Microbiota dysbiosis in  (IBD) has been widely reported.

In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's  [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with IBD and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and oleic ) and medium-chain fatty  (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with IBD. Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites.

This study was aimed at exploring the connection between a panel of biomarkers (C-reactive protein, asymmetric dimethylarginine, uric , total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, and orosomucoid [ORM]) and cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients.The inclusion criterion was the onset of psoriasis with skin lesions. Exclusion criteria were impaired renal function (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m), acute inflammations (urinary, respiratory, skin inflammation, etc), autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or ), and any kind of biological antipsoriatic treatment. Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction, coronary heart , stroke, transient ischemic attack, and carotid artery stenosis were also excluded. Biomarkers were measured by routine procedures, ELISA and HPLC. QRISK®2-2017 was used to assess 10-year risk of cardiovascular  development. Psoriasis severity was measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index.One hundred and fourteen psoriatic patients were enrolled. Only urinary orosomucoid and urinary orosomucoid/urinary creatinine (u-ORM/u-CREAT) ratio showed significant correlation with QRISK score (u-ORM, r=0.245; u-ORM/u-CREAT, r=0.309).

Also, a trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced mouse colitis model was employed to detect the function of MSC-treated Breg cells .  We demonstrated that coculturing with hMSCs significantly enhanced the immunomodulatory activity of B cells by up-regulating IL-10 expression. We then identified that a novel regulatory B cell population characterized by CD23 and CD43 phenotypic markers could be induced by hMSCs. The CD23CD43 Breg cells substantially inhibited the  cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells through an IL-10-dependent pathway. More significantly, intraperitoneal injection of hMSCs ameliorated the clinical and histopathological severity in the mouse experimental colitis model, accompanied by an increase in the number of CD23CD43 Breg cells. The adoptive transfer of CD23CD43 B cells effectively alleviated murine colitis, as compared with the CD23CD43 B cells.

We analyzed the expression of mucin and MUC5AC in the nasal mucosa of patients with CRS through periodic  Schiff (PAS) staining and immunohistochemical examination. Real-time quantitative PCR, ELISA, confocal microscopy and western blotting were used to measure MUC5AC expression in primary human nasal epithelium cells (PHNECs) stimulated with recombinant human IL-19 (rhIL-19), IL-19 receptor siRNA transfection or a control. The involvement of the STAT3 signaling pathway was examined using cryptotanshinone (CRY, an inhibitor of STAT3). Mucin and MUC5AC were significantly increased in mucosa of CRS patients with/without nasal polyps compared to mucosa isolated from controls who had no CRS, but there were no significant differences between these two groups. Pretreatment with rhIL-19 up-regulated the expression of MUC5AC levels in PHNECs. Knockdown of IL-20R2 and pretreatment with CRY attenuated MUC5AC production induced by rhIL-19. We propose that IL-19 up-regulates MUC5AC-induced mucin production  the STAT3 pathway in CRS, highlighting the important role IL-19 may play in mucin production in chronic respiratory .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599507>Ethnic Variations in  Among Israel's Populations.</a></h1><p>Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis are the two major classic presentations of  (IBD). Studies have shown a wide variation in the incidence and prevalence attributed to different geographic and ethnic populations.To assess the clinical characteristics of IBD among Arabs in Israel and to compare them to characteristics of IBD among Ashkenazi Jews.This retrospective, comparative study compared the clinical characteristics of IBD among 150 Arabs from the Holy Family Hospital and the Nazareth Hospital EMMS, both located in Nazareth, Israel, to those of 97 age- and sex-matched Ashkenazi Jewish patients from Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.The Arab cohort, which included 106 patients (70%) with Crohn's  and 44 (29%) with ulcerative colitis, was compared to 97 Ashkenazi patients (81% with Crohn's  and 17% with ulcerative colitis) (P < 0.05). Alcohol consumption was found in both groups, but Arabs smoked more (46% vs. 12%, respectively, P < 0.05). Obstructive phenotype was lower in Arabs (10% vs. 32%, P < 0.05). 5-aminosalicylic  and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha were prescribed for the Arab and Ashkenazi groups (89% and 21%, respectively). The need for surgical intervention due to  severity and/or complications was not significant (22% vs. 24%).Despite similar reports of NOD2/CARD15 mutations, Crohn's  is more common than ulcerative colitis within the Arab-Israeli population. Increased smoking rates may explain milder  severities in Arabs, as reflected by lower obstructive pattern and frequent use of milder therapeutic modalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145706>Enteric hyperoxaluria: role of microbiota and antibiotics.</a></h1><p>Enteric hyperoxaluria is commonly observed in malabsorptive conditions including Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and  (IBD). Its incidence is increasing secondary to an increased prevalence of both disorders. In this review, we summarize the evidence linking the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric hyperoxaluria.In enteric hyperoxaluria, fat malabsorption leads to increased binding of calcium to free fatty  resulting in more soluble oxalate in the intestinal lumen. Bile  and free fatty  in the lumen also cause increased gut permeability allowing more passive absorption of oxalate. In recent years, there is more interest in the role of the gut microbiota in modulating urinary oxalate excretion in enteric hyperoxaluria, stemming from our knowledge that microbiota in the intestines can degrade oxalate. Oxalobacter formigenes reduced urinary oxalate in animal models of RYGB. The contribution of other oxalate-degrading organisms and the microbiota community to the pathophysiology of enteric hyperoxaluria are also currently under investigation.Gut microbiota might play a role in modulating the risk of enteric hyperoxaluria through oxalate degradation and bile  metabolism. O. formigenes is a promising therapeutic target in this population; however, further studies in humans are needed to test its effectiveness.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593809>Evaluation of the therapeutic activity of melatonin and resveratrol in : A longitudinal PET/CT study in an animal model.</a></h1><p> (IBD) is a group of chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, which two main types are Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis. Although conventional therapeutic strategies have demonstrated to be effective in the IBD treatment, it is necessary to incorporate novel therapeutic agents that target other mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the , such as oxidative stress. For this reason, the efficacy in vivo of two antioxidant compounds, melatonin and resveratrol, has been investigated in an animal model of TNBS (2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic ) induced colitis. PET/CT (Positron emission tomography/Computer Tomography) scans were performed to assess  activity and evaluate treatment response. SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) values, body weight changes and histological evaluation were used as  indices to measure the efficacy of both treatments. SUV values increased rapidly after induction of colitis, but after the beginning of the treatment (day 3) a statistically significant decrease was observed on days 7 and 10 in treated animals compared to the non-treated group. This remission of the  was also confirmed by histological analysis of the colon tissue using the Nancy histological index (p value < 0.05 for differences between non-treated and both groups of treated animals). Moreover, statistical analysis showed a correlation (R = 65.52%) between SUV values and weight changes throughout the treatment. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of resveratrol, and melatonin in lower extent, as therapeutic agents in the IBD treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Kefir is a fermented dairy product including yeast and bacterial species. We aimed to investigate the effect of kefir on trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats using two different doses. Fifty-four Wistar rats were divided into six groups. For 14 days, the normal control and colitis control groups were given tap water, kefir10 control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 control, and the kefir30 colitis groups were given phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% or 30% kefir, respectively, instead of tap water. Colitis was induced by intracolonically administrating TNBS in the colitis control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 colitis groups. On the 14th day, the rats were sacrificed. The weights and lengths of the colons were measured and macroscopically evaluated, and the distal 10 cm segments were subjected to a histopathological examination. The incidence of bloody stool and diarrhea in the kefir10 colitis group was found to be less than the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. The colonic weight/length ratio in the kefir10 colitis group was lower than that in the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. We detected that the 10% kefir treatment reduced TNBS-induced macroscopic colonic damage, while it was exacerbated by the 30% kefir treatment. No significant difference was observed between the colitis groups in terms of microscopic colonic damage scoring. These results indicate that kefir, with a careful dose selection, may be a useful agent in the treatment of IBD.© 2019 The Authors.

(IBD) is an idiopathic  condition characterized as an autoimmune disorder that includes dysfunctions in the T helper (Th)/T regulatory cell (Treg) balance, which normally plays pivotal roles in immune homeostasis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of DHA to ameliorate IBD by restoring the Th/Treg cell balance. To this end, we established mouse models of colitis induced by oxazolone (OXA) and 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic  (TNBS). We then treated mice with DHA at 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day. DHA treatment ameliorated colitis signs and reduced lymphocyte infiltration and tissue fibrosis. Moreover, DHA decreased the numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells and Th9 and Th22 cells in TNBS- or OXA-induced colitis, respectively, and increased Tregs in both models. DHA (0.8 mg/mL) also inhibited activated CD4+ T lymphocytes, which was accompanied by apoptosis induction. Moreover, it promoted heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) production in vitro and in vivo, concomitant with CD4+ T cell apoptosis and restoration of the Th/Treg balance, and these effects were blocked by treatment with the HO-1 inhibitor Sn-protoporphyrin IX. Overall, these results suggest that DHA is a novel and valuable candidate for IBD therapy or Th/Treg immunoregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529416>The Role of Gastrointestinal-Related Fatty -Binding Proteins as Biomarkers in Gastrointestinal .</a></h1><p>The fatty -binding proteins play a major role in intracellular transportation of long-chain fatty . Nine fatty -binding proteins have been identified, with each having individual tissue-specific functions in addition to regulation of fatty . This review focuses on the three fatty -binding proteins found in the gastrointestinal tract and discusses their role as diagnostic or  monitoring markers in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, celiac , and . Of these three fatty -binding proteins, intestinal fatty -binding protein is of the most interest due to its exclusive expression in the gastrointestinal tract. The elevation of intestinal fatty -binding protein in blood and urine reflects enterocyte damage, regardless of the underlying cause. The short half-life of intestinal fatty -binding protein also means it is a relatively sensitive marker. In contrast, there is currently less evidence to support liver fatty -binding protein and ileal bile -binding protein as sensitive biomarkers in these conditions. More extensive studies with specific endpoints are required to validate the roles of these fatty -binding proteins in gastrointestinal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437166>The long-term consequences of antibiotic therapy: Role of colonic short-chain fatty  (SCFA) system and intestinal barrier integrity.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological studies revealed that antibiotics exposure increases a risk of  (IBD) development. It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced  response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/2 MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental colitis 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of colitis, Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of  cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10). Since the recognition of the importance of microbiota metabolic activity rather than their composition in the development of  disorders, e.g. IBD, the present study is the first report on the role of the SCFA system in the long lasting side effects of antibiotic treatment and its implication in IBD development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559126>A Proresolving Peptide Nanotherapy for Site-Specific Treatment of  by Regulating Proinflammatory Microenvironment and Gut Microbiota.</a></h1><p>The incidence and prevalence of  (IBD) increases steadily worldwide. There is an urgent need for effective and safe IBD therapies. Accelerated resolution of inflammation is a new strategy for the management of  . For effective and safe IBD treatment, herein a smart nanotherapy (i.e. oxidation-responsive nanoparticles containing a proresolving annexin A1-mimetic peptide Ac2-26, defined as AON) is developed, which can release packaged Ac2-26, in response to highly expressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) at diseased sites. AON effectively protects Ac2-26 from degradation in the enzyme-rich environment of the gastrointestinal tract. By delivering this nanotherapy to the inflamed colons of mice with IBD, site-specific release and accumulation of Ac2-26 in response to high levels of ROS at the  sites are achieved. Mechanistically, the Ac2-26-containing, oxidation-labile nanotherapy AON effectively decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators, attenuates trafficking and infiltration of  cells, promotes efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and increases phenotypic switching of macrophages. Therapeutically, AON reduces symptoms of inflammation, accelerates intestinal mucosal wound healing, reshapes the gut microbiota composition, and increases short-chain fatty  production. Additionally, oral delivery of this nanomedicine shows excellent safety profile in a mouse model, conferring the confidence for further development of a targeted precision therapy for IBD and other  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643703>Sulfonamides.</a></h1><p>The sulfonamides represent a large class of antibiotics that have multiple clinical uses. The sulfonamides were the first effective antibiotics to be introduced into clinical medicine and have been in use continuously since the 1930’s. They are considered bacteriostatic and appear to act by inhibition of bacterial biosynthesis of folic , which is needed for cell growth, at least in those bacteria that are sensitive to sulfonamides. Because humans rely upon dietary folic , they are usually resistant to the adverse effects of inhibition of folate synthesis. Sulfonamides have a wide range of antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and -negative organisms. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to sulfonamides is now common, and their use has decreased with the introduction of more potent classes of antibiotics. However, sulfonamides are still widely used especially for urinary tract infections in combination with trimethoprim and for treatment or prevention of parasitic (toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis jiroveci) and malarial infections usually combined with trimethoprim or pyrimethamine. Sulfonamides with 5-aminosalicyclic  are the structural components of sulfasalazine, which is widely used for long term management of . The combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is used as prophylaxis against chloroquine-resistant malaria. Dapsone is a sulfonamide related drug that is used for the therapy of leprosy and dermatitits herpetiformis. The sulfonamides are well known to cause idiosyncratic liver injury. Hepatotoxicity appears to be a class effect, in that virtually all sulfonamides used today have been linked to rare, but convincing cases of drug induced liver injury. The pattern of injury is variable, often mixed but it can be either hepatocellular or cholestatic. Most typically, the injury appears precipitously within one to three weeks of starting therapy, often preceded or accompanied by signs of hypersensitivity such as fever, rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytosis (or both). Hepatotoxicity from sulfonamides may represent a part of a spectrum of hypersensitivity due to sulfa-derived medications and have been linked to many cases of DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) as well as Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis. The severity of injury varies widely. Most instances of sulfonamide related liver injury are mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited in course. Cases with severe cholestasis may be prolonged and can lead to vanishing bile duct syndrome. Importantly, sulfonamides can cause acute liver failure, particularly in instances with a precipitious onset and hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Indeed, the sulfonamides remain one of the most common causes of drug induced acute liver failure and account for 5% to 10% of instances in many case series. Formulations of sulfonamides currently in general use in the United States include sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine, and sulfisoxazole as well as the combination formulations including sulfasalazine and trimethoprim-sulfamethazole (TMP-SMZ, also referred to as co-trimoxazole). The term sulfonamide applies to derivatives of para-aminobenzene sulfonamide (sulfanilamide), which is composed of a benzene ring with a sulfate and amide group at one end and an amide group at the other (para-position). These agents will be discussed as groups, rather than individual medications, and cases and references are combined.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316522>Corrigendum: Short Chain Fatty  (SCFAs)-Mediated Gut Epithelial and Immune Regulation and Its Relevance for .</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00277.].</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342601>Micronutrient Deficiencies in Children With .</a></h1><p>Children with  (IBDs) are at risk of developing nutrition deficiencies, particularly because of reduced intake, restrictive diets, malabsorption, and excessive nutrient loss. In this study, we aimed to assess the status of trace elements, minerals, and vitamins in a large cohort of children with IBDs.Medical records of children diagnosed with IBDs during 2000-2016 were reviewed retrospectively. Retrieved data included demographics,  characteristics,  activity indices, anthropometric measures, and specific trace elements, minerals, and vitamins at diagnosis and during follow-up.Out of 359 children with IBD (158 [44%] females, median age at diagnosis 14.1 years, interquartile range [IQR] 12.0-16.0), 240 (67%) were diagnosed with Crohn's  (CD) and 119 (33%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). Median follow-up time was 7 years (IQR 5-10). The prevalence of deficiencies in patients with CD at diagnosis and last follow-up, respectively, were iron (88% and 39.5%), zinc (53% and 11.5%), vitamin D (39% and 36%), and folic  (10% and 13%). In patients with UC, frequencies were: iron (77% and 40%), vitamin D (49% and 33%), zinc (31% and 10%), and folic  (3.8% and 9.7%). Magnesium and vitamin B12 deficiencies were rare. For both , iron deficiency was associated with hypoalbuminemia. Deficiencies in iron and zinc were more common in patients with CD than those with UC.Deficiencies in iron, zinc, and vitamin D are common at pediatric IBD diagnosis with limited improvement during follow-up, whereas deficiencies in magnesium and vitamin B12 are rare.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290223>The impact of dietary fermentable carbohydrates on a postinflammatory model of irritable  syndrome.</a></h1><p>A low fermentable carbohydrate (FODMAP) diet is used in quiescent  when irritable  syndrome-like symptoms occur. There is concern that the diet could exacerbate inflammation by modifying microbiota and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production. We examined the effect of altering dietary FODMAP content on inflammation in preclinical  models.C57BL/6 mice were given 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5 days and recovered for 3 weeks (postinflammatory, n = 12), or 5 days (positive-control, n = 12). Following recovery, DSS-treated or control mice (negative-control, n = 12) were randomized to 2-week low- (0.51 g/100 g total FODMAP) or high-FODMAP (4.10 g) diets. Diets mimicked human consumption containing fructose, sorbitol, galacto-oligosaccharide, and fructan. Colons were assessed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological damage. Supernatants were generated for perforated patch-clamp recordings and cytokine measurement. Cecum contents were analyzed for microbiota, SCFA, and branched-chain fatty  (BCFA). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni. markers were higher in the positive-control compared with negative-control and postinflammatory groups, but no differences occurred between the two diets within each treatment (MPO P > .99, histological scores P > .99, cytokines P > .05), or the perforated patch-clamp recordings (P > .05). Microbiota clustered mainly based on DSS exposure. No difference in SCFA content occurred. Higher total BCFA occurred with the low-FODMAP diet in positive-control (P < .01) and postinflammatory groups (P < .01).In this preclinical study, reducing dietary FODMAPs did not exacerbate nor mitigate inflammation. Microbiota profile changes were largely driven by inflammation rather than diet. Low FODMAP intake caused a shift toward proteolytic fermentation following inflammation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221869>Association of Parkinson's  and treatment with aminosalicylates in : a cross-sectional study in a Spain drug dispensation records.</a></h1><p>To analyse the association between aminosalicylate-treated  (IBD) and Parkinson's  (PD) at population level.Cross-sectional study.The study was performed based on electronic drug prescription and dispensation records of the Andalusian Public Health System.All individuals aged ≥50 years with at least one drug dispensation during December 2014 were identified from the records.Groups were formed: 'possible PD' group, including all who received an anti-Parkinson agent; 'possible IBD' group, those treated with mesalazine and/or derivatives (5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA)); and 'possible PD and IBD', including those receiving both anti-Parkinson agent and 5-ASA. Prevalence of possible PD was determined among those with possible IBD and among those without this condition. The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted OR was calculated.We recorded 2 020 868 individuals (68±11 years, 56% female), 19 966 were included in possible PD group (75±9 years, 53% female) and 7485 in possible IBD group (64±10 years, 47% female); only 56 were included in both groups (76±8 years, 32% female). The prevalence of possible PD was 0.7% among those with possible IBD and 1% among those without this condition (adjusted OR=0.94; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.23; p=0.657). OR was 0.28 in individuals aged ≤65 years (95% CI 0.10 to 0.74; p=0.01) and 1.17 in older individuals (95% CI 0.89 to 1.54; p=0.257).Within the limitations of this study, the results suggest a protective role for IBD and/or 5-ASA against PD development, especially among under 65-year olds.

We studied the effects of cell-specific IDO1 expression in the epithelium at baseline and during intestinal inflammation in mice.We generated transgenic mice that overexpress fluorescence-tagged IDO1 in the intestinal epithelium under control of the villin promoter (IDO1-TG). We generated intestinal epithelial spheroids from mice with full-length Ido1 (controls), disruption of Ido1 (knockout mice), and IDO1-TG and analyzed them for stem cell and differentiation markers by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Some mice were gavaged with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E2348/69) to induce infectious ileitis, and ileum contents were quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Separate sets of mice were given dextran sodium sulfate or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  to induce colitis; intestinal tissues were analyzed by histology. We utilized published data sets GSE75214 and GDS2642 of RNA expression data from ilea of healthy individuals undergoing screening colonoscopies (controls) and patients with Crohn's .Histologic analysis of small intestine tissues from IDO1-TG mice revealed increases in secretory cells. Enteroids derived from IDO1-TG intestine had increased markers of stem, goblet, Paneth, enteroendocrine, and tuft cells, compared with control enteroids, with a concomitant decrease in markers of absorptive cells. IDO1 interacted non-enzymatically with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to inhibit activation of NOTCH1. Intestinal mucus layers from IDO1-TG mice were 2-fold thicker than mucus layers from control mice, with increased proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and Mucispirillum schaedleri. Compared to controls, IDO1-TG mice demonstrated an 85% reduction in ileal bacteria (P = .03) when challenged with enteropathogenic E coli, and were protected from immune infiltration, crypt dropout, and ulcers following administration of dextran sodium sulfate or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic . In ilea of Crohn's  patients, increased expression of IDO1 correlated with increased levels of MUC2, LYZ1, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor, but reduced levels of SLC2A5.In mice, expression of IDO1 in the intestinal epithelial promotes secretory cell differentiation and mucus production; levels of IDO1 are positively correlated with secretory cell markers in ilea of healthy individuals and Crohn's  patients. We propose that IDO1 contributes to intestinal homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to drug therapies, which exert several side effects, herbal remedies have constantly attracted the attention of researchers. Therefore, in the present study, a mother tincture (MT) from fresh, young, non-woody  L. branches with leaves was obtained using distillation-based techniques. Further, this was used to assess its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities and anti- properties, and to validate it as a potential phytotherapeutic treatment for IBD. The characterization of the tincture included common phytochemical screening assays for antioxidant capacity measurement, cell viability assays on Caco-2 colon cells, and in vivo assessment of antioxidant and anti- effects by histopathological and ultrastructural analysis of the intestinal mucosa, measurement of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and gene expression of the inflammation markers (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) in intestine after oral administration to an experimental mouse model of colon inflammation (colitis) developed by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS). Our study proved that administration of 25 or 50 mg  MT/kg of body weight/day by gavage for 7 days succeeded in inhibiting the  process induced by TNBS in the intestine, most probably because of its rich contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds.

Similar to VNS, SNS may also have a therapeutic potential for colonic inflammation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614204>Polysaccharides derived from Morinda citrifolia Linn reduce  markers during experimental colitis.</a></h1><p>There are many reports of pharmacological activities of extracts and fractions of different vegetable-derived products in the scientific literature and in folk medicine. Ethnopharmacological use of these products by various communities continues to be extensively explored, and they account for more than half of all medications used worldwide. Polysaccharides (PLS) extracted from plants such as Morinda Citrifolia Linn present therapeutic potential in treatment of  (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC).To evaluate the anti- action of Noni PLS against the intestinal damage in UC induced by acetic  in mice.In acetic -induced colitis, the mice were treated intraperitoneally (ip) with PLS (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (sc) with dexamethasone (2.0 mg/kg) 30 min before euthanasia to determine the best dose of PLS with an anti- effect in the course of UC. The colonic tissue samples were collected for macroscopic, wet weight, microscopic and biochemical (myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO/NO), cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX-2)) analyses.Treatment with PLS reduced the intestinal damage induced by acetic  as it reduced macroscopic and microscopic scores and the wet weight of the colon. In addition, MPO activity and levels of GSH, MDA, NO/NO, pro- cytokines, and COX-2 expression reduced.This study suggests that PLS exhibits anti- action against intestinal damage by reducing  cell infiltration, oxidative stress, pro- action of cytokines, and COX-2 expression in the inflamed colon. PLS shows therapeutic potential against  disorders like UC.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to review the current knowledge regarding the efficacy of dietary and nutritional intervention in IBD patients. Exclusive enteral nutrition might be inferior to corticosteroid treatment in adults with active Crohn's  (CD) but might even be superior considering the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment in children. Total parenteral nutrition has no advantage over enteral nutrition, which is considered a more physiologic modality in organ function. Current guidelines do not yet recommend ω3-polyunsaturated fatty  supplementation for the prevention and maintenance of remission in IBD patients. Dietary fiber supplementation could be effective in the relief of symptoms and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). Although vitamin D may be favorable to clinical course of IBD and bone density. Probiotic supplementation has proven to be effective in preventing and treating pouchitis for UC but is less effective in treating CD. Nutritional interventions not only correct nutritional deficiencies but also improve symptoms and clinical courses of the . Hence, nutritional approaches need to be developed to significantly evaluate the effectiveness of dietary interventions used to treat IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657664>Cyanidin-3--Glucoside and Cyanidin Protect Against Intestinal Barrier Damage and 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic -Induced Colitis.</a></h1><p>Anthocyanin-rich extracts have shown anti-inflammation activity in mouse colitis models. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti- activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of  cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and  cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti- activity in both colitis mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti- effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing  cytokine secretion.

In these patients, the over-production of ROS generated by inflamed  tissue and  cells activates a pathogenic cascade that further exacerbates inflammation and leads to increased oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. We measured the products of protein/lipid oxidation and the total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma, FRAP) in the serum of CD patients with severe  activity requiring surgery with the aim to characterize their redox status and identify associations between oxidative stress-related markers and their clinical characteristics. At the systemic level, CD was associated with increased levels of protein and lipid oxidation products when compared to healthy volunteers, even though the FRAP values were similar. Advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels showed the highest difference between patients and the controls (11.25, 5.02-15.15, vs. 1.36, 0.75-2.70, median, interquartile range;  < 0.0001) and the analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, indicated for AOPP, the best area under the curve (AUC) value for CD prediction. Advanced glycated end-products (AGEs) were also significantly higher in CD patients ( < 0.01), which is of interest since AOPP and AGEs are both able to activate the membrane receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) involved in  . Thiobarbituric  reactive substance (TBARS) levels were significantly higher in CD patients with ileal localization and aggressive  behavior, in smokers, and in patients suffering from allergies. In conclusion, our data indicate that circulating oxidative stress biomarkers may be attractive candidates as  predictors as well as for clinical or therapeutic monitoring of CD. Our results also suggest that AOPP/AGEs and RAGE signaling may represent a pathogenic factor and a potential therapeutic target in CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143502>Characterizing intestinal strictures of Crohn's   by endoscopic photoacoustic imaging.</a></h1><p>Crohn's  (CD) is one type of  where both inflammation and fibrosis cause the thickening of the  wall and development of the strictures. Accurate assessment of the strictures is critical for the management of CD because the fibrotic strictures must be removed surgically. In this study, a prototype capsule-shaped acoustic resolution photoacoustic (PA) endoscope, which can perform mulitwavelength side-view scanning, was developed to characterize the intestinal strictures of CD. The imaging performance of the probe was tested in phantom experiments and a rabbit trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) model with acute ( only) or chronic (mixed fibrotic and ) colitis . The motion artifacts due to intestinal peristalsis and the respiratory motion of the animals were compensated to improve image qualities. Quantitative molecular component images derived from multi-wavelength PA measurements of normal, acute and chronic intestinal strictures demonstrated statistically significant differences among the three groups that were confirmed by histopathology.

We discuss the impact of SCFAs in the duodenal defense mechanisms and in the gastrointestinal (GI) pathogenesis.Luminal SCFAs augment the duodenal mucosal defenses via release of serotonin (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) from enteroendocrine cells. Released GLP-2 protects the small intestinal mucosa from nonsteroidal anti- drug-induced enteropathy. SCFAs are also rapidly absorbed via SCFA transporters and interact with afferent and myenteric nerves. Excessive SCFA signals with 5-HT receptor overactivation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable  syndrome symptoms. SCFA production exhibits diurnal rhythms with host physiological responses, suggesting that oral SCFA treatment may adjust the GI clocks. SCFAs are not only a source of energy but also signaling molecules for the local regulation of the GI tract and systemic regulation via release of gut hormones. Targeting SCFA signals may be a novel therapeutic for GI  and metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372995>Lamin A/C deficiency in CD4 T-cells enhances regulatory T-cells and prevents .</a></h1><p>The mechanisms by which lamin A/C in CD4 T-cells control intestinal homeostasis and can cause  (IBD) are unknown. Here, we explore lamin A/C in a mouse model of IBD. Adoptive transfer to Rag1 mice of Lmna CD4 T-cells, which have enhanced regulatory T-cells (Treg) differentiation and function, induced less severe IBD than wild-type T-cells. Lamin A/C deficiency in CD4 T-cells enhanced transcription of the Treg master regulator FOXP3, thus promoting Treg differentiation, and reduced Th1 polarization, due to epigenetic changes in the Th1 master regulator T-bet. In mesenteric lymph nodes, retinoic  (RA) released by CD103 dendritic cells downregulated lamin A/C in CD4 T-cells, enhancing Treg differentiation. However, non-RA-producing CD103 dendritic cells predominated in peripheral lymph nodes, facilitating lamin A/C expression in CD4 T-cells and therefore Th1 differentiation. Our findings establish lamin A/C as a key regulator of Th differentiation in physiological conditions and show it as a potential immune-regulatory target in IBD. © 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Heavily glycosylated mucin establishes a first-line barrier against pathogens and serves as a niche for microbial growth.To elucidate relationships among dysbiosis, abnormal mucin utilisation, and microbial metabolic dysfunction, we analysed short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) and mucin components in stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 44 Crohn's  (CD) patients from Japan.Levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in stools of both CD and UC patients than in stools of healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified seven bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels; the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans serve as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgtTreg cells and IgA-producing cells in colonic lamina propria. Microbial utilisation of mucin-associated O-glycans was significantly reduced in n-butyrate-deficient UC patients.Mucin O-glycans facilitate symbiosynthesis of n-butyrate by gut microbiota.

However, epidemiological surveys have suggested that colorectal cancers are increasing in incidence among patients aged 20 to 39 years in the United States. Colorectal adenocarcinoma is often not considered in the differential diagnosis in this demographic because of age. Here, we present the case of an incidental finding of anemia during a preliminary evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis leading to the diagnosis of stage IV-B rectal adenocarcinoma in a 34-year-old male patient. A 34-year-old Caucasian male presented with the incidental finding of anemia during a preliminary evaluation for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient was asymptomatic with the exception of a three-month history of wrist and ankle joint pain. Past medical history was positive for only a three-year history of occasional spotty, painless rectal bleeding attributed to internal hemorrhoids. Physical exam findings were positive for mild extremity pallor and positive fecal occult blood test. Hematologic studies revealed a significant microcytic, hypochromic anemia with severe iron deficiency. Laboratory studies revealed no evidence of vitamin deficiency, hemolytic activity, hematuria, hypothyroidism, or clotting factor disorder. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor, and cyclic citrullinated peptide 3 (CCP3) were elevated supporting the diagnosis of underlying rheumatoid arthritis. On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been utilizing an average of 2000 mg of ibuprofen daily during the previous several months in an attempt to control his joint pain. The patient was evaluated for a potential upper gastrointestinal bleed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which found no evidence of active bleeding. As the patient continued to have decreasing hemoglobin levels, he was evaluated for a lower gastrointestinal source of bleeding by colonoscopy, which revealed an 8 cm circumferential mass at the anal verge. Pathological evaluation of biopsy samples revealed a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The patient had no family history of colorectal cancer or major associated risk factors, such as obesity, smoking history, heavy alcohol use, diabetes mellitus type 2, or a history of . Following discharge, positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed extensive metastatic  to multiple regional lymph nodes as well as multiple suspicious hepatic lesions and bilateral pulmonary nodules. Due to the poor prognosis, recommended treatment consisted of folinic , 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) along with palliative radiation. The cause of the increase in the incidence rate of colorectal cancer in young adults remains unknown. Among this demographic, colorectal cancers appear to be more aggressive and present at later stages with more advanced . In young adults, the most common clinical sign at presentation is rectal bleeding. In young adults presenting with seemingly common gastrointestinal complaints, a high degree of suspicion for colorectal cancer may be warranted by clinicians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366843>[Practice Examples of Academic Detailing -Prescription Support Based on Basic Pharmaceutical Science and Evidence].</a></h1><p>Better prescription assistance can be provided by applying basic pharmaceutical science concepts, and by considering evidence from clinical trials. For example, several drugs are currently used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), a form of . In general, after a drug is administered, it is first absorbed into the upper part of the small intestine and then enters the bloodstream. However, 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA), which is commonly used to treat UC, acts locally on the colonic mucosa; its absorption must be prevented in the upper gastrointestinal tract so that it can be delivered to the colorectal mucosa. Therefore, in this case, it is important to consider drug dissolution tests rather than pharmacokinetics. Currently, three types of 5-ASA formulations are available: a pH-dependent release formulation, a time-dependent release formulation, and a combination of the two at maximum dosages of 3600, 4000, and 4800 mg, respectively. Although it is often thought that selecting a high dose is better, the clinical effectiveness of 5-ASA is determined by the amount of drug actually delivered to the lesion. Therefore, rather than dosage, it is most important to understand differences in drug solubility. It is beneficial to provide prescription assistance for the treatment of UC by 5-ASA, because when 5-ASA fails, a steroid or expensive biological drug is administered.

EA (1 mA, 2 Hz, 30 min) treatment was applied to bilateral acupoints "Dachangshu" (BL25) 1 day after TNBS injection once daily for 7 consecutive days. Von Frey filaments were used to measure the mechanical pain threshold. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of adenosine 1 receptor (A1R), adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR), adenosine 2b receptor (A2bR), adenosine 3 receptor (A3R), substance P (SP), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) in colon tissue. EA significantly ameliorated the -related indices and reduced the expression of SP and IL-1β in the colon tissues of mice with IBD. EA increased the expression of A1R, A2aR, and A3R and decreased the expression of A2bR in the colon tissue. Furthermore, the administration of adenosine receptor antagonists influenced the effect of EA.

Due to saturable uptake, high dose oral B supplements are largely unabsorbed and reach the distal gut where they are available to interact with the microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine if oral B supplementation in mice alters 1) the concentration of B and related corrinoids in the distal gut, 2) the fecal microbiome, 3) short chain fatty  (SCFA), and 4) susceptibility to experimental colitis. C57BL/6 mice (up to 24 animals/group) were supplemented with oral 3.94 µg/ml cyanocobalamin (B), a dose selected to approximate a single 5 mg supplement for a human. Active vitamin B (cobalamin), and four B-analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba, CN-Cbi) were analyzed in cecal and fecal contents using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), in parallel with evaluation of fecal microbiota, cecal SCFA, and susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis. At baseline, active B was a minor constituent of overall cecal (0.86%) and fecal (0.44%) corrinoid. Oral B supplementation increased active B at distal sites by >130-fold (cecal B increased from 0.08 to 10.60 ng/mg, fecal B increased from 0.06 to 7.81 ng/ml) and reduced microbe-derived fecal corrinoid analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba). Oral B had no effect on cecal SCFA. Microbial diversity was unaffected by this intervention, however a selective decrease in Bacteroides was observed with B treatment.

Previously, the administration of folate and riboflavin-producing lactic  bacteria (LAB) or an immune-modulating strain showed beneficial effects as they were able to reduce the acute inflammation in mouse models. The aim of this work was to evaluate a mixture of vitamin-producing and immune-modulating LAB administering together with an anti- drug during the remission period of a mouse model of recurrent colitis. BALB/c mice were intrarectally instilled with trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) and those who recovered from this acute challenge were given the LAB mixture, mesalazine, or the combination of both (mesalazine + LAB) during 21 days, followed by a second challenge with TNBS. Control mice instilled with ethanol (vehicle of TNBS) and receiving the different treatments were also evaluated in order to study the effect of chronic anti- therapy. The combination of mesalazine and LAB mixture was the most effective to decrease the intestinal damage at macroscopic and histological levels and to reduce pro- cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in intestinal fluids. In animals instilled with ethanol, mesalazine produced a loss of body weight and intestinal damages with increased IL-6. These side effects were prevented by the co-administration of mesalazine and the LAB mixture. The LAB blend did not affect the primary anti- treatment, was able to improve it, and also prevented the side effects of this therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366329>The culprit of mesalamine intolerance: case series and literature review.</a></h1><p>Mesalamine is a first-line drug in the treatment of , while its intolerance occasionally occurs in clinical practice.

Thus, distinguishing different kinds of intolerance is extremely important for clinical decision.Here we reported two cases with mesalamine intolerance. One patient with 5-aminosalicylic  intolerance had similar adverse reactions to the treatment of different preparations, while another patient with excipients intolerance failed to tolerate Salofalk but could take Pentasa with no symptoms. Meanwhile, clinical manifestations were analysed and the previous reports referring to excipients intolerance were summarized. It is interesting to found that the patients with excipients intolerance mainly presented with acute skin symptoms, such as skin rash, urticaria and angioedema. But the adverse effects of 5-ASA in previous reports include fever, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, interstitial nephritis, pneumonitis, pericarditis and so on.5-aminosalicylic  and excipients should be taken into consideration together when mesalamine-related adverse events occur.

A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage , cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous  history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of , 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable  syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in fecal donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic  such as constipation, irritable  syndrome, , etc., no autoimmune , not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant ; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious  (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative fecal examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; (2) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every fecal donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the fecal flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of -resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day transplantation after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule transplantation and one-time transplantation through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before transplantation. Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.  Of the 2010 patients, 1,497 cases received nasointestinal tube transplantation (nasointestinal tube group), 452 cases oral capsule transplantation (oral capsule group) and 61 cases colonoscopy (colonoscopy group).

In this study, we aim to examine the therapeutic effects of a hyperthermostable SOD from the Thermus thermophilus HB27 (TtSOD) for treatment of experimentally induced IBD.A recombinant TtSOD was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and its therapeutic effects were examined in 2 experimental IBD animal models.In IBD induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  in zebrafish, TtSOD treatment decreased intestinal enlargement and attenuated neutrophil infiltration, resulting in alleviation of enterocolitis. In mice, SOD activity was substantially increased in the intestine after oral gavage of TtSOD, which ameliorated gut inflammation, preserved gut barrier function, and attenuated the severity of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Furthermore, TtSOD inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced production of reactive oxygen species and  responses in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.Our results demonstrate that TtSOD possesses therapeutic activities toward experimentally induced IBD, offering new clinical treatment options for patients with IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

While the exact pathogenesis of IBD is unclear, the current belief is that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in development of . Management options include nutritional, pharmacological, and surgical therapies. In particular, nutritional therapies for IBD have garnered significant interest due to their limited side effect profile, -sparing nature, and naturalistic approach. This review will examine the role of diet in the pathogenesis and malnutrition in IBD, and will discuss dietary approaches to management of IBD, including exclusive enteral nutrition, specific carbohydrate diet, anti- diet, and food supplements (specifically curcumin and long-chain 3 polyunsaturated fatty ). Past and recent literature on these subjects were reviewed in Medhub and Scopus databases for this review article with a focus on pediatric and high-quality publications. At this time, these approaches seem to be safe and show promise of an efficacious sole or supplemental role in the treatment of IBD, but randomized, prospective studies are lacking. Additional studies investigating these diets and food supplements are needed to provide more information on their efficacy, mechanism, applicability, and safety.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain Fatty  Characterization in Patients With .</a></h1><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) have been reported in  (IBD), but the results are conflicting. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to explore the characterization of SCFAs in IBD patients and their potential role in the occurrence and development of IBD.Case-control studies investigating SCFAs in IBD patients were identified from several English databases. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effects model.The SMDs of acetate, valerate, and total SCFAs in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were -0.51 (95% CI, -0.90 to -0.13), -0.65 (95% CI, -1.02 to -0.28), and -0.51 (95% CI, -0.95 to -0.07), respectively. The SMDs of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in patients with active UC were -1.74 (95% CI, -3.15 to -0.33), -2.42 (95% CI, -4.24 to -0.60), and -1.99 (95% CI, -3.39 to -0.60), respectively. However, the SMD of butyrate in UC patients in remission was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.11). In addition, the SMDs of acetate, butyrate, and valerate in Crohn's  (CD) patients were -1.43 (95% CI, -2.81 to -0.04), -0.77 (95% CI, -1.39 to -0.14), and -0.75 (95% CI, -1.47 to -0.02), respectively. Finally, the SMDs of acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and lactate in IBD patients were -2.19 (95% CI, -3.98 to -0.39), -1.64 (95% CI, -3.02 to -0.25), -1.98 (95% CI, -3.93 to -0.03), -0.55 (95% CI, -0.93 to -0.18), and 4.02 (95% CI, 1.44 to 6.61), respectively.There were alterations of SCFAs in IBD patients, and inconsistent SCFA alterations were found in CD and UC. More importantly, inverse SCFA alterations existed in patients with active UC and those in remission.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) is essential for activating TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) in immune cells, which regulates TNF-α release. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation in IBD.The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in the colonic tissue of IBD patients and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution (TNBS)-treated mice was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. To assess the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation, colitis was induced in wild-type and iRhom2-/- mice by the administration of TNBS enema.In LPS-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells, the mRNA and protein levels of TACE and iRhom2 were upregulated. The expression of TACE and iRhom2 in the colon of the IBD patients and TNBS-treated mice was significantly enhanced. The  cells that expressed high levels of iRhom2 in the colon were identified as macrophages. Finally, iRhom2 deficiency ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis by inhibiting TNF-α release.iRhom2 has an important role in intestinal inflammation through TNF-α secretion in immune cells, which suggests that iRhom2 could be a novel therapeutic target for IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs include: (1) Reduction of triglyceride levels; (2) anti-arrhythmic and antithrombotic effects, and (3) resolution of  processes. The human microbiota project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have highlighted that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human gut, and that there has been a significant variability of taxa in the microbiota composition among people. Several factors (gestational age, mode of delivery, diet, sanitation and antibiotic treatment) influence the bacterial community in the human gastrointestinal tract, and among these diet habits play a crucial role. The disturbances in the gut microbiota composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, have been associated with  ranging from localized gastrointestinal disorders to neurologic, respiratory, metabolic, ocular, and cardiovascular illnesses. Many studies have been published about the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the gut microbiota/microbioma. On the contrary, PUFAs in the gut microbiota have been less well defined. However, experimental studies suggested that gut microbiota, n-3 PUFAs, and host immune cells work together to ensure the intestinal wall integrity.

Until now, there are few researches related to the relationship between oxidative stress and Crohn's  (CD); furthermore, no such study has been reported from China. Our aim was to evaluate serum bilirubin, albumin, and UA levels in CD patients and relate them to  activity.Seventy-one patients diagnosed with CD and 125 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were retrospectively analyzed during the same period. Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were analyzed in CD patients and healthy control groups.Serum levels of bilirubin, albumin, and UA in patients with CD were significantly lower than those in the healthy control group. Correlation analysis demonstrated that serum concentrations of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, albumin, and UA were negatively related to  activity in patients with CD (r = -0.620, P < .001; r = -0.304, P < .05; r = -0.623, P < .001; r = -0.408, P < .01; and r = -0.296, P < .05; respectively).Serum bilirubin, albumin and UA levels were significantly lower in CD patients, suggesting potential correlations between serum bilirubin, albumin, and UA levels and  activity in CD patients.

Accordingly, elucidating this metabolic network is critical for understanding how the gut microbiota contributes to health and . Bile , which are first biosynthesized in the liver, are modified in the gut by enzymes expressed by commensal bacteria into secondary bile , which regulate myriad host processes, including lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and immune homeostasis. The gateway reaction of secondary bile  biosynthesis is mediated by bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), bacterial cysteine hydrolases whose action precedes other bile  modifications within the gut. To assess how changes in bile  metabolism mediated by certain intestinal microbiota impact gut physiology and pathobiology, methods are needed to directly examine the activities of BSHs because they are master regulators of intestinal bile  metabolism. Here, we developed chemoproteomic tools to profile changes in gut microbiome-associated BSH activity. We showed that these probes can label active BSHs in model microorganisms, including relevant gut anaerobes, and in mouse gut microbiomes. Using these tools, we identified altered BSH activities in a murine model of , in this case, colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate, leading to changes in bile  metabolism that could impact host metabolism and immunity. Importantly, our findings reveal that alterations in BSH enzymatic activities within the gut microbiome do not correlate with changes in gene abundance as determined by metagenomic sequencing, highlighting the utility of chemoproteomic approaches for interrogating the metabolic activities of the gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158441>Onion bulb extract reduces colitis severity in mice via modulation of colonic  pathways and the apoptotic machinery.</a></h1><p>The use of nutraceutical-based products has increased in recent years due to their demonstrated efficacy and their good safety profile. Onion is one of the most commonly used plants in the traditional medicine for the management of various conditions including  and gastrointestinal . However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of the anti- effects of onion particularly in  (IBD).To test the anti- effects of onion bulb extract (OBE) in an IBD mouse model and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects such as modulation of the expression and/or the activity profile of various pro- molecules.Colitis was induced in mice by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) daily administration for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed, colons were removed and the severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of various cytokines and chemokines were measured using proteome profiling-based assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques.DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by the daily OBE treatment and 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA, positive control), particularly at 100-200 mg/kg doses, at both the gross and histological levels. OBE was also shown to reduce colonic expression and activity of several pro- molecules and signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinase family, mammalian target of rapamycin, cyclooxygenase-2, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. In addition, OBE reduced the expression of interferon-γ, various C-C and C-X-C chemokines, and molecules involved in the apoptotic machinery such as cytochrome c, caspase-3 and -8, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large and -2.OBE showed anti- actions in IBD mouse model, which is attributed, in part, to the modulation of the expression and the activity of important pro- molecules and signaling pathways involved in the  response. These data suggest that OBE may be a promising lead in the therapeutic management of IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to examine the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) coated with the anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1) antibody on experimental colitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The antibody was coated onto the MSCs isolated from male BALB/C mice to generate anti-VCAM 1 antibody-coated MSC (V-MSC). The Transwell assay was used to detect migration rate. 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) was used to generate experimental colitis. MSCs were injected intravenously into experimental models. Weight changes,  activity index, and histological changes were evaluated. The SRY gene were used for cell tracking. Expression of Ki67 and claudin 1 was used to measure local repair using immunohistochemistry. T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory cells were counted. RESULTS V-MSCs were successfully generated through coating MSCs with VCAM1 antibody. Analysis showed that the V-MSCs had similar surface types and differentiation as uncoated MSCs. Transwell assays showed that V-MSCs had higher migration rate than MSCs. After injection of V-MSCs, the expression of the SRY gene was enhanced in diseased colon and all indices (including weight changes, DAI score, histological changes, and the expressions of Ki67 and claudin 1) recovered rapidly. The ratio of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells decreased, but the ratio of anti- Th2 and Treg cells increased after the treatment.

We first attempt to investigate the serum bile  (sBAs) profile in a large cohort of IBD patients to evaluate changes under anti-TNF alpha treatment.Forty CD and 40 UC patients were enrolled and BAs were quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ES-MS/MS). Up to 15 different sBAs concentrations and clinical biomarkers where added to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to discriminate IBD from healthy conditions and treatment.PCA allowed a separation into two clusters within CD (biologic-free patients and patients treated with anti-TNF alpha drugs and healthy subjects) but not UC. The first included CD. CD patients receiving anti-TNF alpha have an increase in total sBAs (4.11 1.23 μM) compared to patients not exposed. Secondary BAs significantly increase after anti-TNF alpha treatment (1.54 0.83 μM). Furthermore, multivariate analysis based on sBA concentration highlighted a different qualitative sBAs profile for UC and CD patients treated with conventional therapy.According to our results, anti-TNF alpha in CD restores the sBA profile by re-establishing the physiological levels. These findings indicate that, secondary BAs might serve as an indirect biomarker of the healing process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644151>Monoclonal Antibodies.</a></h1><p>Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have a high degree of specificity (mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated  such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, , multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino  that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31334133>Strain-Specific Anti- Properties of Two  Strains on Chronic Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p> is potential probiotic in that its type strain ATCC BAA-835 has beneficial effects upon obesity and diabetes.

Hence, we used an isolated murine  strain (designated 139) and  type strain ATCC, to investigate their anti- properties in cell models and in Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis of mice. , the two  strains exerted similar anti- properties as they both reduced IL-8 production by TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells. However, neither of the strains showed capacity to increase the differentiation of regulatory T (Treg)-cells from CD4+ T cell populations significantly. , both  strains exerted anti- effects on chronic colitis as they improved clinical parameters including spleen weight, colon inflammation index, and colon histological score. They also down-regulated the expression of the pro- cytokines including TNF-α and IFN-γ in the colon of mice. However, the anti- effects of strain ATCC were stronger than strain 139 in that ATCC significantly reduced spleen weight, colon inflammation index, and fecal lipocalin-2 content in mice with chronic colitis, while strain 139 was not. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was observed in mice with chronic colitis. Both  strains facilitated the normalization of the gut microbiota. The specific capacity of strain ATCC to modulate the differentiation of Tregs as well as increase production of short chain fatty , demonstrated strain-specific characteristics for these two  strains. This study suggests the potential beneficial effect of  on IBD and the importance of the future study of the function of  at the strain-level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160900>Anti- effects of alosetron mediated through 5-HT receptors on experimental colitis.</a></h1><p>Development of new medicine with fewer deleterious effects and more efficacies for treatment of  is needed. 5-Hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5-HTR) antagonists have exhibited analgesic and anti- features  and . The present study was designed to evaluate the anti- effect of alosetron, a 5-HTR antagonist, on trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Two h subsequent to induce colitis (intracolonic instillation of TNBS, 50 mg/kg) in male Wistar rats, alosetron (1 mg/kg), dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), meta-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG, a 5-HTR agonist, 5 mg/kg), or alosetron + mCPBG were administrated intraperitoneally for 6 days. Animals were thereafter sacrificed and the efficacy of drugs was evaluated macroscopically, histologically, and biochemically (myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 beta) on distal colon samples. Treatment with alosetron and dexamethasone improved macroscopic and microscopic colonic damages significantly and decreased myeloperoxidase activity and colonic levels of  cytokines. The profitable effects of alosetron were antagonized by concurrent administration of mCPBG. Our data provided evidence that the protective effects of alosetron on TNBS-induced colitis can be mediated by 5- HT3R.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243807> is associated with increased gut-to-blood penetration of short-chain fatty : A new, non-invasive marker of a functional intestinal lesion.</a></h1><p>What is the central question of this study? 'Leaky gut' has been found in intestinal and extra-intestinal . However, functional evaluation of intestinal permeability is not widely used as a diagnostic marker, possibly owing to significant limitations of currently used permeability assays. There is an unmet need for development of a new, non-invasive test to assess intestinal function. What is the main finding and its importance? We show that an increased blood-to-stool ratio of the concentration of gut bacteria-produced short-chain fatty  may be used as a marker of gut permeability. Our findings lay the groundwork for establishing a new, non-invasive, risk-free diagnostic tool in  associated with intestinal barrier malfunction, such as .Intestinal , such as  (IBD), are characterized by an impaired gut-blood barrier commonly referred to as 'leaky gut'. Therefore, functional evaluation of the gut-blood barrier is a promising diagnostic marker. We hypothesized that short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria might serve as a marker in IBD. Animal experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats with acetic -induced colitis and in sham control animals. The gut-blood barrier permeability was determined by assessing the ratios of the following: (i) portal blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); (ii) systemic blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); and (iii) C and C of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran administered into the colon. As a clinical study, we evaluated C , C and the C /C ratio of SCFAs in six paediatric patients with IBD, assessed as mild/moderate/severe by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Paediatric Crohn's  Activity Index (PCDAI) at the time of sample collection, and nine age-matched healthy control subjects. Rats with histologically confirmed IBD had significantly increased ratios of C /C and C /C for SCFAs. This was positively correlated with the plasma FITC-dextran concentration. Likewise, IBD patients showed a significantly higher C /C ratio for SCFAs, including acetic, valeric, isocaproic, caproic and propionic , in comparison to control subjects. In conclusion, in the rats and in paediatric patients with IBD we found an increased blood-to-stool ratio of SCFAs, suggesting an increased gut-to-blood penetration of SCFAs. These findings pave the way for a new, non-invasive diagnostic tool in IBD and other  accompanied by intestinal barrier malfunction.© 2019 The Authors.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this  better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408679>The role of gut microbiota for the activity of medicinal plants traditionally used in the European Union for gastrointestinal disorders.</a></h1><p>Many medicinal plants have been traditionally used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. According to the monographs published by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) at the European Medicines Agency, currently 44 medicinal plants are recommended in the European Union for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders based on traditional use. The main indications are functional and chronic gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia and irritable  syndrome (IBS), and typical effects of these plants are stimulation of gastric secretion, spasmolytic and carminative effects, soothing effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa, laxative effects, adstringent or antidiarrheal activities, and anti- effects. A possible interaction with human gut microbiota has hardly been considered so far, although it is quite likely.In this review, we aimed to identify and evaluate published studies which have investigated interactions of these plants with the gut microbiome.According to this survey, only a minor portion of the 44 medicinal plants considered in EMA monographs for the treatment of gastrointestinal  has been studied so far with regard to potential interactions with gut microbiota. We could identify eight relevant in vitro studies that have been performed with six of these medicinal plants, 17 in vivo studies performed in experimental animals involving seven of the medicinal plants, and three trials in humans performed with two of the plants. The most robust evidence exists for the use of inulin as a prebiotic, and in this context also the prebiotic activity of chicory root has been investigated quite intensively. Flaxseed dietary fibers are also known to be fermented by gut microbiota to short chain fatty , leading to prebiotic effects. This could cause a health-beneficial modulation of gut microbiota by flaxseed supplementation. In flaxseed, also other compound classes like lignans and polyunsaturated fatty  are present, that also have been shown to interact with gut microbiota. Drugs rich in tannins and anthocyanins also interact intensively with gut microbiota, since these compounds reach the colon at high levels in unchanged form. Tannins and anthocyanins are intensively metabolized by certain gut bacteria, leading to the generation of small, bioavailable and potentially bioactive metabolites. Moreover, interaction with these compounds may exert a prebiotic-like effect on gut microbiota. Gut microbial metabolization has also been shown for certain licorice constituents, but their potential effects on gut microbiota still need to be investigated in detail. Only a limited amount of studies investigated the interactions of essential oil- and secoiridoid-containing drugs with human gut microbiota. However, other constituents present in some of these drugs, like curcumin (curcuma), shogaol (ginger), and rosmarinic  have been shown to be metabolized by human gut microbiota, and preliminary data also indicate potential gut microbiome modulatory effects. To conclude, the interaction with gut microbiota is still not fully investigated for many herbal drugs traditionally used for gastrointestinal disorders, which offers a vast field for future research.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the pursuit of novel and more economic therapies, patients may increasingly look at complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Recently, CAM is increasingly favored by the general public on account of its safety, low toxicity, and effectiveness. As a branch of CAM, herbal plants and their extracts have a significant effect on the treatment of IBD. Treatment of IBD with herbaceous plants has been reported, but specific mechanisms and effects have not yet been elaborated.English abstracts were identified in PubMed and Science Direct by multiple search terms, such as "herbal," "CAM," "IBD," "ulcerative colitis," "abdominal pain," and so on.

Previously, our study revealed significant loss of Roseburia intestinalis from the gut of untreated patients with CD, and that R. intestinalis exerted anti‑ functions in TNBS‑induced colitis; however, the function of R. intestinalis supernatant is unknown. Therefore, LPS‑induced macrophages, including RAW264.7 macrophages and bone marrow‑derived macrophages were treated with R. intestinalis supernatant. The results indicated that R. intestinalis supernatant suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)‑6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by macrophages. Additionally, these findings were further verified in vivo in DSS‑ and TNBS‑induced mouse models of colitis. It was observed that R. intestinalis supernatant ameliorated IBD colitis by reducing the number of  macrophages and Th17 cells in the colon, and by downregulating the expression of IL‑6 and STAT3. Finally, the non‑protein components of R. intestinalis supernatant were examined using gas chromatography‑mass spectrometry analysis and identified the presence of short‑chain fatty . In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that R. intestinalis supernatant may regulate immune responses and ameliorate colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31033140>A randomised controlled trial of amnioexchange for fetal gastroschisis.</a></h1><p>Morbidity in fetuses affected by gastroschisis is mainly the result of  ischaemic and  processes. Experimental studies on animal models show that clearing amniotic fluid from the digestive secretions by amnioexchange procedures reduces the  process. We evaluated the benefit of the amnioexchange procedure for fetal gastroschisis in humans.Prospective, interventional, randomised study.Eight referral centres for fetal medicine.Pregnant women carrying a fetus with gastroschisis.We compared, in utero, amnioexchange with a sham procedure. The protocol included, in both arms, steroid injections at 30 weeks of gestation and the use of postnatal minimal enteral feeding.The primary outcome was a composite variable based on the duration of ventilation and parenteral nutrition. Secondary outcomes were the effectiveness and safety of the amnioexchange procedure, including the rate of perinatal death, time to full enteral feeding, primary closure, and late feeding disorders.Sixty-four patients were randomised. There was no difference in the composite criteria between the amnioexchange and control groups. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant between-group differences in pregnancy outcome or complications. When studying the relationship between digestive compounds and amniotic fluid  markers, a clear correlation was found between bile  and both ferritin and interleukin 1β (IL1β).In humans, amnioexchange, as described in our protocol, is not an option for fetal care; however, we provide supplementary proof of the involvement of inflammation in the pathogenicity of gastroschisis and suggest that future research should aim at reducing inflammation.

Intrinsic sensory neurons in the enteric nervous system and afferent sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, connecting with the central nervous system, represent the primary neuronal pathways transducing gut visceral pain. Current pharmacological therapies have several limitations, owing to their partial efficacy and the generation of severe adverse effects. Numerous cellular targets of visceral nociception have been recognized, including, among others, channels (i.e., voltage-gated sodium channels, VGSCs, voltage-gated calcium channels, VGCCs, Transient Receptor Potential, TRP, and -sensing ion channels, ASICs) and neurotransmitter pathways (i.e., GABAergic pathways), which represent attractive targets for the discovery of novel drugs. Natural biologically active compounds, such as marine toxins, able to bind with high affinity and selectivity to different visceral pain molecular mediators, may represent a useful tool (1) to improve our knowledge of the physiological and pathological relevance of each nociceptive target, and (2) to discover therapeutically valuable molecules. In this review we report the most recent literature describing the effects of marine toxin on gastrointestinal visceral pain pathways and the possible clinical implications in the treatment of chronic pain associated with gut .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198116>Identification of quinolone and colistin resistance genes in Escherichia coli strains isolated from mucosal samples of patients with colorectal cancer and healthy subjects.</a></h1><p>Antibiotic resistance and extensive use of antibiotics is one of the major causes of failure in antibiotic treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns and to identify resistance genes of quinolones and colistin in Escherichia coli. There are very few patents on E. coli isolated from colorectal cancer. So, this study demonstrated that some bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin are not present resistance genes. As well as, new patterns for E. coli are presented for samples of patients with colorectal cancer.Of the three healthy,  (IBD) and colorectal cancer groups, 40 E. coli strains isolated after confirmation by biochemical and molecular methods. The susceptibility of isolates to antibiotics was investigated using disk diffusion test. After deoxyribonucleic  (DNA) extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin (qnr A, qnr B) and colistin (mcr-1).The results showed that E. coli isolates from colorectal cancer patients had the highest resistance to piperacillin (67.5%), ceftazidime (47.5%), and cefepime (42.5%). Also, E. coli strains isolated from IBD patients showed resistance to antibiotic ceftazidime 13%. More than 95% of E. coli strains isolated from healthy people were susceptible to antibiotics. Based on the results, 18 (15%) E. coli strains were showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. The qnr A gene was detected in 61.11% isolate; however qnr B was detected in 9 (50%). Isolates resistant to colistin were not observed.These findings indicate increased resistance of E. coli to ciprofloxacin in comparison with prior studies.

With increasing use of immunosuppressive agents and biological agents, opportunistic infections are becoming a hot topic in the perspective of drug safety in IBD patients. Despite the well-established role of opportunistic infections in the prognosis of IBD patients, there are few epidemiological data investigating the incidence of opportunis-tic infections in IBD patients in China. Besides, the risk factors for opportunistic infection in Chinese IBD patients remain unclear.To predict the incidence of opportunistic infections related to IBD in China, and explore the risk factors for opportunistic infections.A single-center, prospective study of IBD patients was conducted. The patients were followed for up to 12 mo to calculate the incidence of infections. For each infected IBD patient, two non-infected IBD patients were selected as controls. A conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between putative risk factors and opportunistic infections, which are represented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Seventy (28.11%) out of 249 IBD patients developed opportunistic infections.  infections and respiratory syncytial virus infections were found in 24 and 16 patients, respectively. In a univariate analysis, factors such as the severity of IBD, use of an immunosuppressant or immunosuppressants, high levels of fecal calprotectin, and C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate were individually related to a significantly increased risk of opportunistic infection. Multivariate analysis indicated that the use of any immunosuppressant yielded an OR of 3.247 (95%CI: 1.128-9.341), whereas the use of any two immunosuppressants yielded an OR of 6.457 (95%CI: 1.726-24.152) for opportunistic infection. Interestingly, when immunosuppressants were used in combination with infliximab (IFX) or 5-aminosalicylic , a significantly increased risk of opportunistic infection was also observed. The relative risk of opportunistic infection was greatest in IBD patients with severe  activity (OR = 9.090; 95%CI: 1.532-53.941, relative to the remission stage). However, the use of IFX alone did not increase the risk of opportunistic infection.Factors such as severe IBD, elevated levels of fecal calprotectin, and the use of immunosuppressive medications, especially when used in combination, are major risk factors for opportunistic infections in IBD patients. The use of IFX alone does not increase the risk of opportunistic infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411504>High-fat diet promotes experimental colitis by inducing oxidative stress in the colon.</a></h1><p>Diets high in animal fats are associated with increased risks of , but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental colitis in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty  in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental colitis model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe colitis compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro- cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) tight junction regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture, palmitic  or palmitic  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes colitis by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes colitis in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced experimental colitis model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation. These observations provide molecular evidence that diets high in saturated fats are detrimental to patients with .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428839>Protective effect of methylene blue on TNBS-induced colitis in rats mediated through the modulation of  and apoptotic signalling pathways.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common type of chronic, idiopathic  (IBD) that affects the mucosal lining of the colon. Long-term UC remission has shed light on the necessity of modified therapeutic strategies. In this study, UC was induced in rats by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS). The anticolitis effect of methylene blue (MB), a well-known dye and antioxidant and a potent mitochondrial enhancer was tested. MB was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg, and colosalazine was administered orally (p.o.) at a dose of 500 mg/kg 11 days after the administration of TNBS, which was injected on the 8th day. All treatment group results were compared to the TNBS group results. Macroscopically, limited body weight loss and decrease in the colon weight per unit length ratio were observed in the MB groups. MB improved histological damage and decreased the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and accumulation of CD4 lymphocytes observed by immunohistochemistry. Downregulation of Bax/Bcl protein expression was detected using Western blotting, and increased mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was measured by qPCR. MB produced biochemical alterations, such as significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels as well as significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase levels were observed with MB, and these effects were similar to those produced by colosalazine. Thus, MB altered  pathogenesis and could be a promising and challenging therapeutic target for UC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137456>Dietary Walnut Supplementation Alters Mucosal Metabolite Profiles During DSS-Induced Colonic Ulceration.</a></h1><p>Walnuts contain a complex array of natural compounds and phytochemicals that exhibit a wide range of health benefits, including protection against inflammation and colon cancer. In this study, we assess the effects of dietary supplementation with walnuts on colonic mucosal injury induced in mice by the ulcerogenic agent, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57Bl/6J mice were started on the Total Western Diet supplemented with freshly-ground whole walnuts (0, 3.5, 7 and 14% g/kg) 2 weeks prior to a 5-day DSS treatment and walnut diets were continued throughout the entire experimental period. Mice were examined at 2 days or 10 days after withdrawal of DSS. In a separate study, a discovery-based metabolite profiling analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on fecal samples and colonic mucosa following two weeks of walnut supplementation. Dietary walnut supplementation showed significant effects in the 10-day post-DSS recovery-phase study, in which the extent of ulceration was significantly reduced (7.5% vs. 0.3%,  < 0.05) with 14% walnuts. In the metabolite-profiling analysis, walnuts caused a significant increase in several polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and 9-oxo-10(E),12(E)-octadecadienoic  (9-oxoODA), as well as kynurenic . In colon tissue samples, walnuts caused a significant increase in the levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and betaine, important components of fatty  β-oxidation. These metabolite changes may contribute in part to the observed protection against DSS-induced  tissue injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621721>Intestinal anti- activity of xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei A. Weber ex K. Schum. Bly. Ex Rowl) juice on acetic -induced colitis in rats.</a></h1><p> (IBD) is characterized by severe mucosal damage in the intestine and a deregulated immune response. Natural products derived from plants that are rich in bioactive compounds are used by many patients with IBD. Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti- effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of 5 mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro- markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-2. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice. Further studies are needed before suggesting the use of xique-xique juice as a new alternative for treating IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238939>Mucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNF scFv expression vector ameliorates experimental colitis in mice.</a></h1><p>Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha therapy has become clinically important for treating . However, the use of conventional immunotherapy requires a systemic exposure of patients and collateral side effects. Lactic  bacteria have been shown to be effective as mucosal delivering system for cytokine and single domain antibodies, and it is amenable to clinical purposes. Therefore, lactic  bacteria may function as vehicles for delivery of therapeutic antibodies molecules to the gastrointestinal tract restricting the pharmacological effect towards the gut. Here, we use the mucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNFα scFv expression plasmid on a DSS-induced colitis model in mice.Experimental colitis was induced with DSS administered in drinking water. L. lactis carrying the scFv expression vector was introduced by gavage. After four days of treatment, animals showed a significant improvement in histological score and  activity index compared to those of untreated animals. Moreover, treated mice display IL-6, IL17A, IL1β, IL10 and FOXP3 mRNA levels similar to health control mice. Therefore, morphological and molecular markers suggest amelioration of the experimentally induced colitis.These results provide evidence for the use of this alternative system for delivering therapeutic biopharmaceuticals in loco for treating , paving the way for a novel low-cost and site-specific biotechnological route for the treatment of  disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h1><p>Patients with  (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's , have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic  bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal  cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268316>7-Methylation of Chenodeoxycholic  Derivatives Yields a Substantial Increase in TGR5 Receptor Potency.</a></h1><p>TGR5 agonists are potential therapeutics for a variety of conditions including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and . After screening a library of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) derivatives, it was determined that a range of modifications could be made to the  moiety of CDCA which significantly increased TGR5 agonist potency.

Inflammation has been implicated as a significant driver for the development of tolerance to opioids. Recent studies show that chronic morphine in mice results in gut microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in the colon. In the present study, we examined whether colonic inflammation results in tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic . The development of antinociceptive tolerance was determined by warm-water tail-immersion assay in mice implanted with 25-, 50-, or 75-mg morphine pellet. Colonic inflammation significantly enhanced the rate at which tolerance developed in each cohort of chronic morphine-treated mice. At the lowest dose of morphine pellet (25 mg), antinociceptive tolerance only developed in the presence of colonic inflammation, whereas in 50- and 75-mg pelleted mice, tolerance developed faster in the inflamed animals than in the noninflamed mice. The enhanced antinociceptive tolerance was attenuated with daily administration of peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, 6--heterocyclic-substituted naltrexamine derivative [17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14-dihydroxy-4,5-epoxy-6-[(4'pyridyl)acetamido]morphinan (NAP)], irrespective of colonic inflammation. Collectively, these findings show that the rate of tolerance to morphine antinociception is exaggerated in the presence of colonic inflammation, and tolerance is prevented by a peripheral -opioid receptor antagonist. These studies suggest a peripheral component to the development of antinociceptive tolerance to opioids. Furthermore, peripherally selective opioid antagonists may be useful adjuncts in opioid-based pain management. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study supports the notion that inflammation influences the development of antinociceptive tolerance to chronic morphine exposure. We found that, in the presence of colonic inflammation, the rate of development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine increased. We also found that treatment with a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist prevented morphine antinociceptive tolerance. Increasing opioid intake during an  state would result in decreased analgesia and enhanced analgesic tolerance, which puts patients with ,  joint , and sickle cell anemia at risk for heavy opioid use.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With .</a></h1><p>Butyrate-producing gut bacteria are reduced in patients with active  (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty  and bacterial butyryl CoA:acetate CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Taxonomic profiling was performed by aligning the reeds, not maped on hg19, on MetaPhlAn2 reference database. Reeds were mapped using the HUNAnN2 algorithm to the ChocoPhlAn database to assess the representation of microbial metabolic pathways. Short-chain fatty  (SCFA) level were measured in fecal samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis.Changes in IBD patients gut microbiota were characterized by an increase in the representation of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla bacteria and decrease in the number of Firmicutes phylum bacteria and Euryarchaeota phylum archaea; a decrease in the alpha-diversity index, relative representation of butyrate-producing, hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, and Methanobrevibacter smithii; increase in the relative representation of Ruminococcus gnavus in UC and CD patients and Akkermansia muciniphila in CD patients. Reduction of Butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA transferase gene relative representation in CD patients, decrease of absolute content of SCFA total number as well as particular SCFAs and main SCFAs ratio in IBD patients may indicate inhibition of functional activity and number of anaerobic microflora and/or an change in SCFA utilization by colonocytes.the revealed changes can be considered as typical signs of dysbiosis in IBD patients and can be used as potential targets for IBD patients personalized treatment development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322753>Mucosal gene expression changes induced by anti-TNF treatment in  patients.</a></h1><p>In the last two decades anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy for  (IBD) has been widely used to induce and maintain clinical and endoscopical remission, completely changing management of the . In this study, we aimed to identify gene expression changes in inflamed mucosa from Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis patients treated with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) (N = 25) or anti-TNF agents (N = 12) compared to drug-free IBD patients (N = 12) and non-IBD control subjects (N = 18). The mucosal expression of 84 genes previously associated with IBD was evaluated by qPCR. We found that both therapeutic regimens induce a decrease in LCN2, NOS2, and TFF1, the levels of which are overexpressed in drug-free patients compared to non-IBD control subjects. Interestingly, a stronger effect of anti-TNF drugs was observed on LCN2 and TFF1 levels. However, 5-ASA seems to induce a more robust reduction of NOS2 expression. Moreover, we found that anti-TNF treatment significantly increased ABCB1, leading to levels similar to those found in non-IBD control subjects.© 2019 The Authors.

The purported efficacies of these phytochemicals have led to potential functional food and nutraceutical applications which aim to protect against cardiometabolic and  risk factors associated with non-communicable , such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular , , and some cancers. Concurrent understanding that perturbations of gut microbial composition and metabolic function manifest throughout health and  has led to dietary strategies, such as prebiotics, which exploit the diet-host-microbe paradigm to modulate the gut microbiota, such that host health is maintained or improved. The prebiotic definition was recently updated to "a substrate that is selectively utilised by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit", which, given that previous discussion regarding seaweed prebiotics has focused upon saccharolytic fermentation, an opportunity is presented to explore how non-complex polysaccharide components from seaweeds may be metabolised by host microbial populations to benefit host health. Thus, this review provides an innovative approach to consider how the gut microbiota may utilise seaweed phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty , and carotenoids, and provides an updated discussion regarding the catabolism of seaweed-derived complex polysaccharides with potential prebiotic activity. Additional in vitro screening studies and in vivo animal studies are needed to identify potential prebiotics from seaweeds, alongside untargeted metabolomics to decipher microbial-derived metabolites from seaweeds. Furthermore, controlled human intervention studies with health-related end points to elucidate prebiotic efficacy are required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626701>Unique Phenotypic Characteristics and Clinical Course in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Multicenter US Experience.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare phenotype. We aimed to assess patients with UC-PSC or UC alone and describe differences in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and long-term clinical outcomes.This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of UC from 1962 through 2015. We evaluated clinical factors associated with UC-PSC vs UC alone and assessed associations by using multivariable logistic regression models.Among 522 patients with UC, 56 (10.7%) had PSC. Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], 2.35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal 5-aminosalicyte  (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Body weight,  activity index (DAI), colon length, histological index (HI), intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran, uc.261, and tight junction proteins (TJPs) levels were evaluated in BALB/C mice treated with saline enema, trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)/ethanol enema, and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody injection, respectively.Uc.261 expression was overexpressed in CD patients, TNF-α treated cells, and colitis mice. Uc.261 expression was positively correlated with HBI ( = 0.582,  = 0.007) in CD patients, and positively correlated with TNF-α concentration and negatively correlated TEER in Caco2 and T84 cells (all  < 0.05). Furthermore, uc.261 was positively correlated with DAI ( = 0.824,  = 0.008), HI ( = 0.672,  = 0.021), and intestinal permeability ( = 0.636,  = 0.012), while negatively correlated with body weight ( = -0.574,  = 0.035), colon length ( = -0.866,  = 0.017), and TJP expression (all  < 0.05) in colitis mice.Uc.261 expression was closely correlated with  activity and intestinal permeability in CD. Anti-TNF-α treatment may play its role through suppressing uc.261 expression in colitis mice.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216958>The handling of the rectal stump does not affect severe morbidity after subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis: a retrospective cohort study.</a></h1><p>Colectomy due to ulcerative colitis is associated with complications. One severe complication is the risk for blow-out of the remaining rectal remnant. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency and severity of complications in patients with the rectal remnant left subcutaneously versus patients with the rectal remnant left intra-abdominally. A secondary aim was to identify risk factors for complications.Consecutive patients at two tertiary centers in Sweden were retrospectively reviewed regarding surgical procedures; complications classified according to Clavien-Dindo; and possible risk factors for complications such as preoperative medication, emergency surgery, and body mass index.307 patients were identified. Minor complications were more common than previously reported (85%-89%). Severe surgical complications were not related to the handling of the rectal remnant. Leaving the rectal remnant subcutaneously was associated with local wound problems. Risk factors for severe complications were emergency surgery and preoperative medication with 5-aminosalicylic .Minor complications after colectomy for ulcerative colitis are very common and need to be addressed. Leaving the rectal stump intra-abdominally seems safe and may be advantageous to reduce local wound morbidity.</p></html>
