<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222613>Phytochemical investigations and antiproliferative secondary metabolites from Thymus alternans growing in Slovakia.</a></h2><p>Thymus alternans Klokov (Lamiaceae) is a neglected species of the genus Thymus (Sect. Serpyllum) endemic to Carpathian area, where it is used as a flavouring agent and for medicinal purposes.The aim of the work was to identify antiproliferative constituents from the flowering aerial parts of this plant.Thymus alternans extracts were analyzed by HPLC-MS and subjected to extensive chromatographic separations. The isolated compounds (phenolics and triterpenes) were structurally elucidated by MS and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Essential oil (EO) composition was determined by GC-FID and GC-MS. Six purified triterpenes and EO were assayed for in vitro antiproliferative activity against a panel of human  cells, namely, breast (MDA-MB 231),  (HCT-15 and HCT116), lung (U1810), pancreatic (BxPC3), melanoma (A375) and cervical carcinoma (A431) cells.The structures of the isolated compounds were achieved on the basis of H-NMR and MS experiments. Luteolin-4'-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P1), chrysoeriol-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P2), chrysoeriol-5-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P3), apigenin-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P4), rosmarinic  (P5), rosmarinic -3'-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P6), caffeic -3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P7), 3α-hydroxy-urs-12,15-diene (T1), α-amyrin (T2), β-amyrin (T3), isoursenol (T4), epitaraxerol (T5), and oleanolic  (T6). GC-MS analysis revealed that the EO of T. alternans was devoid of phenols and belonged to the nerolidol-chemotype, that is typical of the Sect. Serpyllum. The six purified triterpenes (T1-T6) were active with IC ranging from 0.5 to 5 μM being comparable or better than those of reference compounds betulinic  and cisplatin. The EO exhibited significant effects on A375, MDA-MB 231 and HCT116 cell lines with IC in the range of 5-8 μg/mL.The reported results suggest that T. alternans can be considered as a good source of phytoconstituents with possible importance in the pharmaceutical field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26756900>COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 suppresses doxorubicin-induced p53 accumulation through inhibition of ROS-mediated Jnk activation.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is one of the isoforms of cyclooxygenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the arachidonic  cascade. COX-2 protein expression is highly induced by numerous factors and it has been reportedly overexpressed in various human malignancies. Although anti-tumorigenic effects of COX-2 inhibitors have been shown, several lines of evidence suggest that COX-2 inhibitors antagonize the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, on modulation of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced p53 accumulation. Non-selective and selective COX-2 inhibitors attenuated DOX-induced accumulation of wild type (WT) but not mutant p53. Nutlin-3α or MG132 abolished the suppressive effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on DOX-induced p53 increase. Moreover, the DOX-induced increase in p53 protein levels was reduced in COX-2 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to those in WT or COX-1 KO MEFs. DOX-induced accumulation of p53 was attenuated by a specific inhibitor or knockdown of Jun-N-terminal kinase (Jnk). In addition, DOX-induced Jnk activation was decreased in COX-2 KO MEFs or by COX-2 inhibition, suggesting that Jnk stabilizes p53 by a mechanism that involves COX-2. Pre-treatment with a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, attenuated DOX-induced Jnk activation and subsequent p53 accumulation. Furthermore, the absence or inhibition of COX-2 resulted in suppression of DOX-induced increase in ROS levels. These results suggest that COX-2 activates Jnk through modulation of ROS levels, leading to accumulation of p53. Our study identifies a putative novel cross-talk between COX-2 and p53.© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28134947>Identification of terpenoids from Rubus corchorifolius L. f. leaves and their anti-proliferative effects on human  cells.</a></h2><p>The leaves of Rubus corchorifolius L. f. have been consumed as a herbal tea for a long time. In this study, two novel (1 and 5) and four known (2, 3, 4 and 6) terpenoids were isolated from the leaves of Rubus corchorifolius L. f. Structural analysis was performed using various spectroscopic methods (H NMR, C NMR and MS) to identify the following six compounds: (16α)-16,17,18-trihydroxy-ent-kauran-18-O-β-d-glucoside (1), ent-16β,17-dialkyl-3-oxygen-kaurane (2), ent-kaurane-3α,16β,17-triol (3), ent-kaurane(5R,8S,9R,10R,13R,16R)-2-one-16α,17-diol (4), (16R)-16β,17,19-trihydroxy-ent-kaur-3-one (5) and ent-16α,17-dihydroxy-kauran-19-oic- (6). These compounds showed different inhibitory effects on various human  cells. Compounds 3 and 6 exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on human  HCT116 cells than the other 4 compounds. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that both compounds 3 and 6 caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and induced cellular apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Compounds 3 and 6 modulated the expression levels of key signaling proteins closely related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, i.e., increasing the levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, p53, and p27, and decreasing the levels of EGFR, cyclin D1, CDK2 and CDK4. Overall, our findings provided insight into the anticancer components of Rubus corchorifolius L. f. leaves, which could facilitate their utilization as functional food ingredients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28211011>TEOA, a triterpenoid from Actinidia eriantha, induces autophagy in SW620 cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress and ROS-dependent mitophagy.</a></h2><p>2α,3α,24-Thrihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oicacid (TEOA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, isolated from the roots of Actinidia eriantha, exhibits significant cytotoxicity against SW620, BGC-823, HepG-2, A549 and PC-3  cells. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of the anticancer activity of TEOA in SW620 cells. We demonstrated that TEOA induced apoptosis through cleavage of caspase-9 and PARP in SW620 cells. In addition, evidence of TEOA-mediated autophagy included the induction of autophagolysosomes and activation of autophagic markers LC-3B and p62. Further analysis illustrated that TEOA promoted the phosphorylation of PERK and elF2α, followed by up-regulation of the downstream protein CHOP, suggesting the involvement of PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway and ER stress in TEOA-induced autophagy in SW620 cells. Meanwhile, TEOA-mediated PINK1, Parkin, ubiquitin and p62 activation revealed that TEOA induced specific autophagy-mitophagy in SW620 cells. Additionally, an antioxidant NAC attenuated the TEOA-induced mitophagy, indicating that TEOA triggers mitophagy via a ROS-dependent pathway. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel cellular mechanism of TEOA in the  cell line SW620, thus providing a molecular basis for developing TEOA into an anti-tumor candidate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732824>Metabolic reprogramming of -associated fibroblasts by IDH3α downregulation.</a></h2><p>-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) provide critical metabolites for tumor growth and undergo metabolic reprogramming to support glycolysis. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this change remain unclear. Here, we report that TGF-β1- or PDGF-induced CAFs switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. We identify downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α (IDH3α) as a marker for this switch. Furthermore, miR-424 downregulates IDH3α during CAF formation. Downregulation of IDH3α decreases the effective level of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by reducing the ratio of α-KG to fumarate and succinate, resulting in PHD2 inhibition and HIF-1α protein stabilization. The accumulation of HIF-1α, in turn, promotes glycolysis by increasing the uptake of glucose, upregulating expression of glycolytic enzymes under normoxic conditions, and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation by upregulating NDUFA4L2. CAFs from tumor samples exhibit low levels of IDH3α, and overexpression of IDH3α prevents transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs. Our studies reveal IDH3α to be a critical metabolic switch in CAFs.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
