This study aimed to determine the role of demographic factors, lipid profile, family history (the estimation of genetic association) and anthropometric factors on  onset.Data from the enrolment phase of the Tabari Cohort study was applied for this study and included 10,255 participants aged between 35-70 years. Anthropometric variables were measured by trained staff using standard tools. Blood specimens were collected for lipid profile and blood glucose measurements. Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 24, with univariate and multivariate logistic regression.The prevalence of  was estimated to be 17.2% in the cohort population, 15.6% in men, and 18.3% in women.

A 10-residue class G* peptide from apolipoprotein J (apoJ), namely, D-[113-122]apoJ, possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. This prompted us to determine its effect on the aggregation process of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, an early event in the development of atherosclerosis. LDL particles with and without [113-122]apoJ peptide were incubated at 37 °C with sphingomyelinase (SMase) or were left to aggregate spontaneously at room temperature. The aggregation process was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), native gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE), absorbance at 405 nm, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). In addition, circular dichroism was used to determine changes in the secondary structure of apoB, and SDS-PAGE was performed to assess apoB degradation. At an equimolar ratio of [113-122]apoJ peptide to apoB-100, [113-122]apoJ inhibited both SMase-induced or spontaneous LDL aggregation. All methods showed that [113-122]apoJ retarded the progression of SMase-induced LDL aggregation at long incubation times. No effect of [113-122]apoJ on apoB secondary structure was observed. Binding experiments showed that [113-122]apoJ presents low affinity for native LDL but binds readily to LDL during the first stages of aggregation. Laurdan fluorescence experiments showed that mild aggregation of LDL resulted in looser lipid packaging, which was partially prevented by D-[113-122]apoJ. These results demonstrate that [113-122]apoJ peptide prevents SMase-induced LDL aggregation at an equimolar ratio and opens the possibility for the use of this peptide as a therapeutic tool.Copyright © 2019.

The loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells, in patients with type 1 and type 2  respectively, put these cells at the center of the disease initiation and progression. Therefore, major efforts have been taken to restore the β-cell mass by cell-replacement or regeneration approaches. Implementing novel therapies requires deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate β-cells and determine the acquisition of their physiological phenotype. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the postnatal maturation of β-cells and define their functional identity. Furthermore, we discuss different routes by which β-cells lose their features and functionality in type 1 and 2 diabetic conditions. We then focus on potential mechanisms to restore the functionality of those β-cell populations that have lost their functional phenotype. Finally, we discuss the recent progress and remaining challenges facing the generation of functional mature β-cells from stem cells for cell-replacement therapy for  treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669219>Benzimidazole-based dual dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Multiple-targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases, such as , and contribute to the greater therapeutic success. Targeting reactive oxygen species-producing enzymes, as xanthine oxidase (XO), might suppress progression of -associated vascular complications. In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives (1-9) was evaluated for inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and XO. One 1,3-disubstituted-benzimidazole-2-imine (5) and 1,3-thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazolone derivative (8) were shown as effective dual DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, with IC values lower than 200 μM, and predicted binding modes with both target enzymes. Both selected dual inhibitors (compounds 5 and 8) did not show cytotoxicity to a greater extent on Caco-2 cells even at concentration of 250 μM. These structures represent new non-purine scaffolds bearing two therapeutic functionalities, being DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, more favorable in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors with DPP-4 as a single target due to pleiotropic effects of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2019.

Patients who received contrast were compared with unexposed controls before and after propensity score (PS) matching derived from baseline characteristics, admission diagnoses, comorbidities and severity of illness. AKI, defined as initial onset (stage 1) or increased severity, was determined from serum creatinine according to KDIGO guidelines.Based on 2,306 PS-matched pairs obtained from 2,557 cases that received intravenous contrast and 4,776 unexposed controls, the increase in AKI attributable to contrast was 1.3% (19.3 vs. 18.0%, p=0.273) and no association was found between contrast and the pattern of onset and recovery. Hospital mortality increased by 14.3% subsequent to AKI (18.0 vs. 3.6, p<0.001) but the risk ratio in relation to patients with stable AKI did not vary when stratified by contrast. Multivariable regression identified sepsis, metabolic disorders, , history of renal disease, and severity of illness as factors more strongly associated with AKI.In critically ill adults with normal kidney function, low osmolar radiocontrast media did not substantively increase AKI. Rather than limiting the use of contrast in ICU patients, efforts to prevent AKI should focus on the susceptibility of patients with sepsis,  complications, high APACHE score, or a history of renal disease.Copyright © 2019 American College of Chest Physicians.

Previous studies have found that high-glucose environments can aggravate BP-induced DNA damage in nerve cells. Ku70 is subunit of the DNA damage repair enzyme DNA-PK. This study was designed to determine whether high-glucose conditions enhance BP neurotoxicity and DNA damage by inhibiting Ku70 expression.We examined the effect of BP on apoptosis and DNA damage in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons under hyperglycaemic conditions. Untreated DRG cells and DRG cells pretreated with NU7441, a DNA-PK inhibitor, were cultured for 3 days under normal culture conditions or with 50 mM glucose, and the cells were then treated with BP for 3 h. DNA damage was investigated via comet assays, the ratio of early to late apoptotic cells was assessed by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assays. The protein expression levels of DNA-PK, Ku70, Bax, Bcl-2 and γH2ax were measured by immunofluorescence or Western blotting.Compared to its effect under normal culture conditions, BP treatment led to decreased cell viability and increased DNA damage in DRG cells grown under high-glucose conditions. The rate of DRG cell apoptosis and the expression of γH2ax, the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 also increased under the high-glucose conditions. Furthermore, Ku70 expression was inhibited. The DNA-PK inhibitor, NU7441, could significantly inhibit DNA-PK and Ku70 expression, simultaneously further aggravating BP-induced apoptosis and DNA damage under high-glucose conditions.These data indicate that hyperglycaemia may enhance BP-induced neurotoxicity and DNA damage by inhibiting the DNA repair protein Ku70.Copyright © 2019.

Accumulating data suggest excessive oxidative stress contributes to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in cardiovascular-related diseases. Excessive oxidative stress is also a primary underlying mechanism for the development and progression of T2DM. However, whether oxidative stress plays a role in mediating the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in T2DM is not known. Therefore, this review explores the potential role of oxidative stress leading to increased activation of the afferent arm of the exercise pressor reflex. Several lines of evidence support direct and indirect effects of oxidative stress on the exercise pressor reflex. For example, intramuscular ROS may directly and indirectly (by attenuating contracting muscle blood flow) increase group III and IV afferent activity. Oxidative stress is a primary underlying mechanism for the development of neuropathic pain, which in turn is associated with increased group III and IV afferent activity. These are the same type of afferents that evoke muscle pain and the exercise pressor reflex. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced release of inflammatory mediators may modulate afferent activity. Collectively, these alterations may result in a positive feedback loop that further amplifies the exercise pressor reflex. An exaggerated reflex increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, identifying the contribution of oxidative stress could provide a potential therapeutic target to reduce this risk in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using insulin resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during insulin resistance, while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common liver condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, 5.6), 28.7% had , 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with , obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC.  had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD.  conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC. Diabetic patients with co-existing hypertension and obesity may be important targets for secondary prevention.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671906>Antioxidant, Xanthine Oxidase, α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities of Bioactive Compounds from  L.

ATH generally initiates during the childhood, occurring as a result of a number of changes in the intima tunica and in the media of arteries. A key event occurring during the pathobiology of ATH is the accumulation of lipoproteins in the sub-intimal spaces mediated by extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, especially by the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) -containing proteoglycans (CS/DSPGs). Among them, the proteoglycan biglycan (BGN) is critically involved in the onset and progression of ATH and evidences show that BGN represents the missing link between the pro-atherogenic status induced by both traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the development and progression of vascular damage. In the light of these findings, the role of BGN in dyslipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, , chronic kidney disease and inflammatory status is briefly analyzed and discussed in order to shed new light on the underlying mechanisms governing the association between BGN and ATH.Copyright © 2019.

Quercetin is a type of flavonoid compound that influences antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities have protective and therapeutic effects for treating various diseases including  and neuro-degenerative diseases. In this study, fetal alcohol syndrome was tested in rat models, with the aim of verifying the protective effect of quercetin in preventing alcohol-induced liver and lymphoid tissue (thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes) injuries on the 21st day for the offspring of alcohol treated mother rats. The pregnant rats were randomly assigned into four groups. The control group (C) (n = 3) of pregnant rats received only physiological saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) throughout the pregnancy (1 to 21 days gestation) and during lactation until postnatal day 21. The quercetin positive control group (QT) of pregnant rats (n = 3) received quercetin at 50 mg/kg/days i.p. for the same period. The ethanol treatment group (E) (n = 3) of pregnant rats received 1 ml/day of 40% v/v ethanol (4 g/kg) intragastrically (i.g) for the same period. The model group of pregnant rats (EQ) received ethanol + quercetin (n = 3) with a dose of 1 ml/day of v/v ethanol (4 g/kg i.g.) and quercetin at 50 mg/kg body weight per day i.p. for the same period. Ten offspring were used in each of the C, QT, E and EQ groups. Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content (PC) and chemiluminescence levels (CL) in liver and lymphoid tissues significantly increased in group E versus the C group (P < 0.05-P < 0.001) whereas glutathione levels (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities significantly decreased in group E compared to the C group (P < 0.05-< 0.001). However, tissue MDA, PC, and CL levels decreased in the EQ group compared to group E. GSH level, GP, GR, SOD, and CAT activity were significantly increased by quercetin (P < 0.05-P < 0.001). The plasma TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and NF-κB activation significantly increased in group E compared to the C and QT groups, but IL-10 significantly decreased in group E compared to the C and QT groups. The TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and NF-κB activation significantly decreased in group EQ compared to group E.

Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/2 J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type 2  and obesity traits. Liver and adipose tissues genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with . The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient.

It is unclear what walking speeds and durations significantly affect plantar tissue viability and risks for foot ulcers in non-diabetics and diabetics.The aim of this study was to establish the normal response of plantar skin blood flow to different speeds and durations of walking exercise in non-diabetics that would be needed to quantify impaired responses in diabetics.Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure plantar skin blood flow of the first metatarsal head in 12 non-diabetics. A 3 × 2 factorial design, including 3 speeds (slow at 3 km/h, moderate at 6 km/h, and fast at 9 km/h) and 2 durations (10 and 20 min), was used in this study. Skin blood flow after walking was expressed as a ratio of skin blood flow before walking. The 3 × 2 two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to examine the main effects of speeds and durations and their interaction.The walking speed significantly affected skin blood flow responses (p < 0.01). Walking at 9 km/h significantly increased plantar skin blood flow (5.71 ± 1.89) compared to walking at 6 km/h (2.1 ± 0.29) and 3 km/h (1.16 ± 0.14), especially at 20-minute walking duration (p < 0.01). The walking duration showed a trend of significance on affecting skin blood flow responses (p = 0.06). There was no significant interaction between walking speeds and durations (p > 0.05).Our results provide the first evidence that walking speeds affect plantar skin blood flow and a fast walking speed (9 km/h) significantly increases plantar skin blood flow compared to moderate (6 km/h) and slow (3 km/h) walking speeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design.

During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0.2 [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059).

Scores from the 12-item Short Form Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument were collected. The association between diabetic foot disease and changes in HRQOL was assessed using the general linear mixed model after adjustment for sociodemographics, previous health-care use, Elixhauser comorbidities index, baseline health status and -specific behaviours.Among the cohort (n=969), average age was 64.3 (standard deviation, 10.0) years and 55% were male. Overall, 265 (27.4%) participants reported having diabetic foot disease. Those with diabetic foot disease reported lower HRQOL in comparison to those without diabetic foot disease at baseline: PCS, 8.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.06 to 9.82); MCS, 4.33 (95% CI, 2.99 to 5.67) and EQ-5D-5L index score, 0.12 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.14). After adjustment, no differences were observed in the score changes at year 2 (PCS, 0.16 [95% CI, -0.88 to 1.21]; MCS, 0.36 [95% CI, -0.77 to 1.50]; EQ-5D-5L index score, 0.004 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02]).Although participants with diabetic foot disease reported lower HRQOL at baseline, they had similar changes compared to those without diabetic foot disease during the 2-year follow up. Efforts to maintain general health and early intervention to prevent diabetic foot disease may help to avoid initial deterioration of physical health and HRQOL.Copyright © 2019.

N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular metabolic phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and ) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

Certain cellular pathways modification and also some transcription factors activation may protect cells from hyperglycemia condition induced damages. This study purpose was to determine the vitamin D supplementation effect on some key factors [advanced glycation end products (AGEs) signaling pathway] that were involved in the diabetic complications occurrence and progression for type-2  participants.48 type-2 diabetic patients (T2DM) randomly divided into two groups (n = 24 per group), receiving: 100-µg vitamin D or placebo for 3 months. At this study beginning and the end, the receptor expression for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and glyoxalase I (GLO1) enzyme from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and AGEs and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) serum levels were measured by the use of real-time PCR and ELISA methods, respectively.This study results demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation could down-regulate RAGE mRNA [fold change = 0.72 in vitamin D vs. 0.95 in placebo) P = 0.001)]. In addition, no significant changes were observed for GLO1 enzyme expression (P = 0.06). This study results also indicated that vitamin D serum level significantly increased in vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Moreover, AGES and TNF-α serum levels significantly reduced in vitamin D group, but they were remained unchanged in the placebo group.In conclusion, vascular complications are more frequent in diabetic patients, and vitamin D treatment may prevent or delay the complications onset in these patients by AGEs serum level and RAGE gene expression reducing. .

In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (F) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that F is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: F equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of F are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in F is independent of all environmental confounding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669757>The evolutionary hypothesis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</a></h1><p>Human otoliths, primarily formed from salts of calcium and carbonate, are different from bones of the skeleton, which are composed of calcium phosphate. The echinoderms, which share the earliest common ancestor with us, began to protect the body by making an endoskeleton out of calcium and carbon dioxide dissolved in the sea. In subsequent vertebrates, aerobic respiration supported strong muscle activity, but an occasional shortage of oxygen led to low pH due to the accumulation of lactate produced by anaerobic respiration, increasing the risk of melting bones composed of calcium carbonate. So, all vertebrates used calcium phosphate to increase bone strength, having a stronger ionic bonding than calcium carbonate. But otoliths, which are in the inner ear and thereby not connected to muscles, still use calcium carbonate. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder in which otoliths detached from the utricle enter the semicircular canals and cause a sense of rotation. Otoliths, the calcium carbonate ear bones retaining a long evolutionary history, can be easily broken at low pH. During sleep, shallow breathing produces mild respiratory acidosis and low pH in the blood. Since otoliths are corroded at low pH during nighttime, BPPV occurs frequently in the morning. In addition,  or gout often decreases pH in the blood and increases the occurrence of BPPV.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical and genetic aspects of HeFH patients with T2DM in the dyslipidemia registry of the Spanish Arteriosclerosis Society.HeFH patients were classified according to the presence or absence of T2DM. The clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics of the 2 groups were compared.Of the 2301 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia included in the registry, 1724 with a probable or definite diagnosis according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score were finally included. HeFH patients with T2DM had a higher rate of CVD and a less favorable lipid profile, with higher total cholesterol (366.9±86.7mg/dL vs 342.0±74.7mg/dL; mean difference 24.894; 95%CI, 5.840-43.949) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (316.9±87.8mg/dL vs 286.4±75.4mg/dL; mean difference 30.500; 95%CI, 11.211-49.790) levels. No significant differences were found between the groups concerning the specific type of HeFH-causing mutation (P=.720). After adjustment for major risk factors, logistic regression analysis confirmed a relationship between T2DM and the presence of CVD (OR, 2.01; 95%CI, 1.18-3.43; P=.010).HeFH patients with T2DM have a higher rate of CVD and a less favorable lipid profile, regardless of genetic mutation type.

We developed a linear and two exponential expressions to predict the probability of the outcome of 2-year mortality and compared to actual outcome in the target dataset from NHANES. The risk indicator demonstrated good performance with area under ROC curve of 0.84. The linear and two exponential expressions generated similar predictions in the lower categories of risk indicator ( ≤ 6). However, in the groups with higher  value, the linear expression tends to predict lower, and the exponential expressions higher, probabilities than the observed outcome. A Combined model which averaged the linear and logistic expressions was shown to approximate the actual outcome data the best.

Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis, liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty acids in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670029>PAPP-A activity is increased in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and correlates with peripheral nerve impairment.</a></h1><p>Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have neuroprotective effects. IGF activity is partly controlled by pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), an enzyme which enhances IGF-action by cleavage of IGF-binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4). To study the role of PAPP-A and the IGF system in diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), we measured immunoreactive (total) concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II, bioactive IGF by cell-based bioassay, PAPP-A, as well as intact and PAPP-A-cleaved IGFBP-4 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from patients with type 2  (T2D) with and without DPN.Twenty-three patients with T2D were included. Based on clinical examination, vibratory perception thresholds and nerve conduction studies, patients were diagnosed with (n = 9) or without (n = 14) DPN.In CSF, PAPP-A activity, as estimated by IGFBP-4 fragment levels, was higher in patients with than without DPN (34.57 vs 13.79 μg/L, p = .003) and concentrations correlated with peripheral nerve impairment measures (r = 0.73, p < .01). Furthermore, serum bioactive IGF was lower in patients with than without DPN (0.8 vs 1.3 μg/L, p = .006) and correlated inversely to the severity of DPN (r = -0.67, p < .01).In both CSF and serum, members of the IGF system correlated with measures of peripheral nerve impairment in patients with T2D. This supports a relationship between the IGF system and the development of DPN. Further studies are needed to clarify if these changes are causally linked to the pathogenesis of DPN.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixteen samples from 5 different commercially available IVIg preparations were tested with cell-based assays (CBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect and characterize common neuronal autoantibodies, and with immunohistochemistry on teased fibers from mouse sciatic nerve and on mouse brain sections to screen for nodal and not yet identified neuronal antigens. In 15/16 IVIg preparations, anti-GAD antibodies were detected in titers ranging from 40 to 1507 IU/mL, as typically seen in type 1 , but not in the range (> 2000 IU/mL) seen in GAD-positive neurological patients. None of the preparations was however positive with anti-GAD CBA. Antibodies to AQP4 were also detected by ELISA in 15/16 IVIg preparations with titers comparable to those seen in AQP4-seropositive NMO patients; with CBA, however, all IVIg samples were AQP4-negative. IVIg preparations contained IgG-anti-MAG antibodies by ELISA at statistically significant higher titers compared to controls. Two of the 16 IVIg samples were positive for human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies. All IVIg preparations were negative for antibodies to MOG, NMDAR, anti-nodal, and other neuronal-specific proteins. IVIg preparations contain antibodies against GAD and AQP4 in titers comparable to those seen in autoimmune patients when tested by ELISA, but not by CBA or tissue immunohistochemistry, suggesting that the autoantibodies within the IVIg are against linear rather than structural epitopes, as part of the natural antibody immune repertoire.

The distribution among our four groups was: HIP-/RF- (n = 1144); HIP-/RF+ (n = 2313); HIP+/RF- (n = 163); and HIP+/RF+ (n = 898). HIP was more frequent when RFs were present rather than absent (33.1% vs 15.4%, respectively; P < 0.001). Incidence of the composite endpoint differed significantly (P < 0.0001) across groups [HIP-/RF- 6.3%; HIP-/RF+ 13.2%; HIP+/RF- 8.6%; and HIP+/RF+ 17.1% (HIP effect: P < 0.05; RF effect: P < 0.001; interaction HIP * RF: P = 0.94)] and significantly increased with the number of RFs (no RF: 6.3%, 1 RF: 10.8%, 2 RFs: 14.7%, 3 RFs: 28.0%, 4-5 RFs: 25.0%; P < 0.0001).RFs are predictive of HIP, although 15.4% of women with HIP have no RFs. Also, irrespective of HIP status, RFs are predictive of HIP-related events, suggesting that overweight/obesity, the only modifiable RFs, could be targets of interventions to improve pregnancy prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

The search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) presentation database and the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) registries. All cost-effectiveness studies assessing metformin in prediabetic patients were included.ResultsTwenty-three reports were included. Metformin and intensive lifestyle changes (ILC) interventions were always cost-effective compared to placebo. ILC was cost-effective and sometimes dominant compared to metformin. Metformin was cost-saving compared to ILC in the short and medium-term. Although, in the long term, metformin was more expensive than ILC in terms of direct medical costs, when indirect non-medical costs are included, metformin less expensive than ILC. One study reported that for patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) higher than 30 kg/m2, metformin is a cost-effective strategy compared to placebo and ILC. However, this finding was not confirmed by other retrieved studies.ConclusionILC is cost-effective compared to metformin and, both of them are cost-effective compared to placebo. Metformin may be cost-saving in the short- to medium-term and possibly in the long-term.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673293>Painless destructive thyroiditis in a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone: a case report.</a></h1><p>Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) usually features a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (SITSH) without suppression of the typical high thyroid hormone levels. However, some patients with RTH show thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression due to thyrotoxicosis. We report a case of painless thyroiditis in a patient with RTH that was misdiagnosed as Graves' disease because of TSH-suppressed thyrotoxicosis.A sixteen-year-old boy consulted a local general physician for fatigue. He had a goiter, and biochemical analysis showed TSH < 0.1 μIU/mL, free triiodothyronine (FT3) of 2.70 pg/mL, and free thyroxine (FT4) of 3.6 ng/dL. He was diagnosed with Graves' disease and was treated with 20 mg thiamazole. One year later, he was referred to the department of endocrinology because of SITSH. He was finally diagnosed with RTH due to the finding of a heterozygous missense mutation (methionine 334 threonine) in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene. Three years after cessation of thiamazole, his hyperthyroxinemia showed marked exacerbation with TSH suppression. We diagnosed him with painless destructive thyroiditis because of low technetium-99 m (Tc-99 m) uptake in the thyroid. Extreme hyperthyroxinemia was ameliorated, with a return to the usual SITSH levels, within 1 month without any treatment.The present case demonstrates that diagnosing RTH is difficult when patients show hyperthyroxinemia with complete suppression of TSH to undetectable levels, and the data lead to misdiagnosis of RTH as Graves' disease. The initial diagnosis is important, and Tc-99 m scintigraphy is useful for the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis accompanying RTH.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670214>Impact of peripheral artery disease on the quality of life of patients with .</a></h1><p> (DM) has become one of the main problems of health, which might lead to a series of complications, such as peripheral vasculopathy.The objectives of this study were to determine whether peripheral artery disease affects the quality of life and pain level and functionality of the foot in patients with DM.The sample consisted of 150 participants: with peripheral vasculopathy and DM, with DM, without peripheral vasculopathy, with neither DM nor peripheral vasculopathy.

Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the occurrence of insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type-2  (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers. Among all types of biologically active peptides inclusive of marine-derived ones, this paper's focus would solely be on fish and fishery by-processes' extracted peptides and products. Isolation and fractionation processes of these products alongside their structural, compositional and digestion stability characteristics have likewise been briefly discussed to better address the structure-activity relationship, expanding the reader's knowledge on research and discovery trend of fish antihypertensive biopeptides. Furthermore, drug-likeness of selected biopeptides was predicted by Lipinski's rules to differentiate a drug-like biopeptide from nondrug-like one.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669619>The Changing Landscape of Clinical Trials for Mitochondrial Diseases: 2011 to Present.</a></h1><p>We reviewed the status of interventional clinical trials for primary mitochondrial diseases.

Recently, a new plasma glucagon assay based on liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was developed. We evaluated the influence of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (anagliptin) on plasma glucagon levels in Japanese patients with type 2  by using this new assay.Twenty-four patients with type 2  were enrolled in a prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label study and were randomly allocated to 4 weeks of treatment with metformin (1000 mg/day) or anagliptin (200 mg/day). A liquid test meal labeled with sodium [C] acetate was ingested before and after the treatment period. Samples of blood and expired air were collected over 3 hours. Plasma levels of glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were measured, and gastric emptying was also evaluated.Twenty-two patients completed the study (metformin group: n=10; anagliptin group: n=12). Glycemic control showed similar improvement in both groups. In the anagliptin group, there was a slight decrease of the incremental area under the plasma concentration versus time curve for glucagon after the test meal (P=0.048). In addition, the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP was increased, and plasma C-peptide was also increased versus baseline. Neither anagliptin nor metformin delayed gastric emptying.In patients with type 2  maintained endogenous insulin secretion, anagliptin increased the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP in association with a slight stimulation of insulin secretion and slight inhibition of glucagon secretion, but did not delay gastric emptying.Copyright © 2019.

Overall comparisons between disease and control groups with respect to allele distribution at a given locus were performed by assembling rare alleles applying an exact Freeman Halton contingency table test with Monte-Carlo p values based on 150,000 samples.The Montecarlo Exact Fisher Test demonstrated marked differences in all three Loci, DQA1, DQB1, DRB1 (p<0.0001) between AP versus both AITD and controls, as well as between AP type II (Addison's disease as major endocrine component) and AP type III (T1D + AITD). Differences were also noted between AP and T1D pertaining to the DRB1 allele (p<0.041). The following seven amino acid positions DRB1-13, DRB1-26, DRB1-71, DRB1-74, DQA1-47, DQA1-56, and DQB1-57 significantly contributed to AP. Five positions in DQA1 (11, 47, 50, 56, and 69) completely correlated (p<0.0001).Amino acid polymorphisms within HLA class II exon 2 mediate the AP risk and differentiate between thyroid and polyglandular autoimmunity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Yet the extent of this improvement and whether it impacts multiple risk factors together is uncertain. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to investigate the effects of text-messaging interventions for CVD prevention.Electronic databases were searched to identify trials investigating a text-messaging intervention focusing on CVD prevention with the potential to modify at least two CVD risk factors in adults. The main outcome was blood pressure (BP). We conducted standard and IPD meta-analysis on pooled data. We accounted for clustering of patients within studies and the primary analysis used random-effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed.Nine trials were included in the systematic review involving 3779 participants and 5 (n=2612) contributed data to the IPD meta-analysis. Standard meta-analysis showed that the weighted mean differences are as follows: systolic blood pressure (SBP), -4.13 mm Hg (95% CI -11.07 to 2.81, p<0.0001); diastolic blood pressure (DBP), -1.11 mm Hg (-1.91 to -0.31, p=0.002); and body mass index (BMI), -0.32 (-0.49 to -0.16, p=0.000). In the IPD meta-analysis, the mean difference are as follows: SBP, -1.3 mm Hg (-5.4 to 2.7, p=0.5236); DBP, -0.8 mm Hg (-2.5 to 1.0, p=0.3912); and BMI, -0.2 (-0.8 to 0.4, p=0.5200) in the random-effects model. The impact on other risk factors is described, but there were insufficient data to conduct meta-analyses.Mobile phone text-messaging interventions have modest impacts on BP and BMI. Simultaneous but small impacts on multiple risk factors are likely to be clinically relevant and improve outcome, but there are currently insufficient data in pooled analyses to examine the extent to which simultaneous reduction in multiple risk factors occurs.CRD42016033236.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of one-week treatment with sevelamer on oxidative nucleic acid modifications and inflammation markers.Two double-blinded studies including 30 patients with type 2  (T2D) and 20 healthy individuals were conducted. Participants were randomised to one week of treatment with sevelamer (1600 mg three times daily) or placebo. RNA and DNA oxidation, measured by urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine(8-oxoGuo) and (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine(8-oxodG), and markers of inflammation were determined before and after the intervention.In patients with T2D there was no significant placebo-corrected reduction in 8-oxoGuo or 8-oxodG. However, a reduction in 8-oxoGuo was observed within the group treated with sevelamer (∆8-oxoGuo/creatinine (median[IQR]): -0.04 [-0.24; 0.01] nmol/mmol, p = 0.02). A sevelamer-mediated reduction in interleukin-2 (p = 0.04) and a trend towards reduction in interleukin-6 (p = 0.053) were found in patients with T2D.This study reveals a potential effect of sevelamer treatment on inflammation and possible oxidative RNA modifications.

The target population included individuals with type 2  (T2D) aged 40 years, without retinopathy, followed over a 40-year time horizon. A Markov model was developed with five health states and a 1-year cycle. Model parameters were based on literature and country databases. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model parameters' uncertainty. WHO willingness-to-pay (WHO-WTP) thresholds were used as reference (i.e. one and three times the Brazilian per capita Gross Domestic Product of R$32747 in 2018).Compared to usual practice, the systematic teleophthalmology-based screening was associated with an incremental cost of R$21445/QALY gained ($9792/QALY gained). The systematic ophthalmology referral-based screening was more expensive (incremental costs = R$4) and less effective (incremental QALY = -0.012) compared to the systematic teleophthalmology-based screening. The probability of systematic teleophthalmology-based screening being cost-effective compared to usual practice was 0.46 and 0.67 at the minimum and the maximum WHO-WTP thresholds, respectively.Systematic teleophthalmology-based DR screening for the Brazilian population with T2D would be considered very cost effective compared to the opportunistic ophthalmology referral-based screening according to the WHO-WTP threshold. However, there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty around the results.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674940>ESC guidelines on , ECHO-TR trial, and more.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669253>Bone mineral density at different sites and 5 years mortality in end-stage renal disease patients: A cohort study.</a></h1><p>Bone disease with osteoporosis and renal osteodystrophy is common in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and associates with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increased morbimortality.

However, its ability to reveal individual transmission links within clusters is limited. Here, we used a 2-step approach based on Bayesian transmission reconstruction to (1) identify likely index and missing cases, (2) determine risk factors associated with transmitters, and (3) estimate when transmission happened.We developed our transmission reconstruction method using genomic and epidemiological data from a population-based study from Valencia Region, Spain. Tuberculosis (TB) incidence during the study period was 8.4 cases per 100,000 people. While the study is ongoing, the sampling frame for this work includes notified TB cases between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. We identified a total of 21 transmission clusters that fulfilled the criteria for analysis. These contained a total of 117 individuals diagnosed with active TB (109 with epidemiological data). Demographic characteristics of the study population were as follows: 80/109 (73%) individuals were Spanish-born, 76/109 (70%) individuals were men, and the mean age was 42.51 years (SD 18.46). We found that 66/109 (61%) TB patients were sputum positive at diagnosis, and 10/109 (9%) were HIV positive. We used the data to reveal individual transmission links, and to identify index cases, missing cases, likely transmitters, and associated transmission risk factors. Our Bayesian inference approach suggests that at least 60% of index cases are likely misidentified by local public health. Our data also suggest that factors associated with likely transmitters are different to those of simply being in a transmission cluster, highlighting the importance of differentiating between these 2 phenomena. Our data suggest that type 2  is a risk factor associated with being a transmitter (odds ratio 0.19 [95% CI 0.02-1.10], p < 0.003). Finally, we used the most likely timing for transmission events to study when TB transmission occurred; we identified that 5/14 (35.7%) cases likely transmitted TB well before symptom onset, and these were largely sputum negative at diagnosis. Limited within-cluster diversity does not allow us to extrapolate our findings to the whole TB population in Valencia Region.In this study, we found that index cases are often misidentified, with downstream consequences for epidemiological investigations because likely transmitters can be missed. Our findings regarding inferred transmission timing suggest that TB transmission can occur before patient symptom onset, suggesting also that TB transmits during sub-clinical disease. This result has direct implications for diagnosing TB and reducing transmission. Overall, we show that a transition to individual-based genomic epidemiology will likely close some of the knowledge gaps in TB transmission and may redirect efforts towards cost-effective contact investigations for improved TB control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669079>Vitamin D Supplementation during Pregnancy: An Evidence Analysis Center Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>Given the high rates of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women and possible effects on offspring health, a systematic review on this topic was conducted to help inform future practice guidelines.To evaluate associations between maternal vitamin D supplementation, maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, and health outcomes.A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify studies that examined the health effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes published from 2000 to 2016. Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational , preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5.2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Vascular ATP-sensitive potassium (K) channels most likely participate in the processes of  and hypertension. The aim of this research was to examine whether GDM and PIH cause changes in the expression and function of K channels in vascular smooth muscle of human umbilical vein (HUV). Western blot and immunohistochemistry detected significantly decreased expression of Kir6.1 subunit of K channels in GDM and PIH, while the expression of SUR2B was unchanged. In GDM, a K channel opener, pinacidil caused reduced relaxation of the endothelium-denuded HUVs compared to normal pregnancy. However, its effects in HUVs from PIH subjects were similar to normal pregnancy. In all groups K channel blocker glibenclamide antagonized the relaxation of HUV induced by pinacidil without change in the maximal relaxations indicating additional K channel-independent mechanisms of pinacidil action. Iberiotoxin, a selective antagonist of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, inhibited the relaxant effect of pinacidil in PIH, but not in normal pregnancy and GDM. Experiments performed in K-rich solution confirmed the existence of K-independent effects of pinacidil, which also appear to be impaired in GDM and PIH. Thus, the expression of K channels is decreased in GDM and PIH. In GDM, vasorelaxant response of HUV to pinacidil is reduced, while in PIH it remains unchanged. It is very likely that K channels modulation and more detailed insight in K channel-independent actions of pinacidil may be precious in the therapy of pathological pregnancies.Copyright © 2019.

However, to date, a limited number of scholars have attempted to systematically elucidate the characteristics of KP-PLA. The aim of the present study was to analyze clinical, microbiological, and molecular epidemiological characteristics of KP-PLA patients in Southeastern China.The KP-PLA cases from a tertiary teaching hospital in China from January 2016 to December 2017 were systemically studied and elucidated comprehensively. The virulence factors, resistant spectrum, and clones of  isolates were identified with string test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antimicrobial susceptibility test, and multilocus sequence typing. Moreover, the characteristics in KP-PLA patients with and without other hepatobiliary diseases (OHD) were also been compared.A total of 163 KP-PLA cases were enrolled, in which the majority of those cases were senior males, and often associated with multiple underlying diseases, including  (49.7%). The remaining cases belonged to healthy individuals (50.3%). The clinical symptoms were common but nonspecific, characterized by increased inflammatory parameters and abnormal liver function parameters. The abscess was often right-sided solitary presentation (58.3%). Cephalosporin or carbapenem plus metronidazole combined with percutaneous puncture or catheter drainage were favorable therapeutics. Although low resistance rates of commonly used antimicrobial drugs (< 10%) were observed, twelve strains were identified as multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, and were mainly isolated from the OHD patients. The hypermucoviscosity, as well as K1 and K2 serotypes accounted for 30.7, 40.5, and 19.0%, respectively. Except for  (24.5%) and  (45.4%), the high prevalence of virulence genes (e.g. , , , , , , , , , and ) was identified (68.7-100.0%). Additionally, ST23 was found as a predominant sequence type (ST; 38.7%), and three novel STs (ST3507, ST3508 and ST3509) were noted as well.The present study reported the abundant hvKp strains in KP-PLA, as well as convergence of hypervirulent and MDR  isolates from the KP-PLA patients, particularly those cases with OHD. Given the various clinical manifestations and destructive pathogenicity, determination of the comprehensive characteristics of such isolates is highly essential to effectively carry out for optimal management and treatment of KP-PLA.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672711>Pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial to determine the effectiveness of bridging from emergency to regular contraception: the Bridge-It study protocol.</a></h1><p>Oral emergency contraception (EC) can prevent unintended pregnancy but it is important to start a regular method of contraception. Women in the UK usually access EC from a pharmacy but then need a subsequent appointment with a general practitioner or a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service to access regular contraception. Unintended pregnancies can occur during this time.Bridge-It is a pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial designed to determine whether pharmacist provision of a bridging supply of a progestogen-only pill (POP) plus rapid access to a local SRH clinic, results in increased uptake of effective contraception and prevents more unintended pregnancies than provision of EC alone. Bridge-It involves 31 pharmacies in three UK regions (London, Lothian and Tayside) aiming to recruit 626-737 women. Pharmacies will give EC (levonorgestrel) according to normal practice and recruit women to both intervention and the control phases of the study. In the intervention phase, pharmacists will provide the POP (desogestrel) and offer rapid access to an SRH clinic. In the control phase, pharmacists will advise women to attend a contraceptive provider for contraception (standard care).Women will be asked 4 months later about contraceptive use. Data linkage to abortion registries will provide abortion rates over 12 months. The sample size is calculated on the primary outcome of effective contraception use at 4 months (yes/no) with 90% power and a 5% level of significance. Abortion rates will be an exploratory secondary analysis. Process evaluation includes interviews with pharmacists, SRH clinicians and women. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use a healthcare system perspective and be expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Ethical approval was received from South East Scotland REC June 2017. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.ISRCTN70616901.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Patients in the HDHP cohort (n = 1490) were matched by propensity scores to a non-HDPH control cohort (n = 1490). Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2014.Switching from a non-HDHP in 2013 to a full replacement HDHP in 2014 (no non-HDHP option offered) vs staying on a non-HDHP.Difference-in-differences models estimated discontinuation of branded and generic antihyperglycemic medications.Among the 2980 patients included in the analysis (1932 men [64.8%]; mean [SD] age, HDHP cohort: 52.6 [6.9] years; non-HDHP cohort: 52.7 [7.3] years), no difference between the HDHP and non-HDHP cohorts was found in unadjusted follow-up discontinuation rates for all antihyperglycemic medications (255 [22.7%] vs 255 [23.3%]; P = .72); however, among patients using branded medication, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the HDHP group did not refill branded medications (81 of 396 [20.5%] vs 61 of 437 [14.0%]; P = .009). Difference-in-differences models were not statistically significant.These findings suggest switching to an HDHP is associated with discontinuation specifically of branded medications.

Tools for evaluating clinical utility are scarce. We propose a new clinical utility index (CUI), which is the expected gain in utility (EGU) of the test divided by the EGU of an ideal test, both adjusted for EGU of the optimal clinical action without testing. The index expresses the relative benefit of using the test compared to using an optimal test when making a clinical decision. To illustrate how the index may be used, we estimated CUI for fasting glucose, both as a continuous and as a dichotomous test, at several values of pretest probability of  and at two levels of cost/benefit-ratio. In the same clinical situations we also estimated CUI for the 2 h glucose tolerance test. Hemoglobin A1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol was used as a reference standard for . In this model, fasting glucose was clinically more useful as a continuous test than as a dichotomous one, based on CUIs. At pretest probability above the treatment threshold, fasting glucose as a continuous test was even more useful than the complete glucose tolerance test. These results are not necessarily generalizable; however, they show how the CUI can be used to select the most useful test in certain clinical situations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675452>Bone Marrow and Muscle Fat Infiltration are Correlated Among Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis: the AMBERS Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Bone and muscle have shown to interact, but little is known about fat within bone and muscle. Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and . Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and . More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. This study was designed to investigate the influences of tanshinone IIA, an active compound extracted from Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, on the proliferation and migration of human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs). cultured in a high glucose medium and the underlying mechanisms related miRNAs. Using a miRNA microarray method, we profiled the miRNA expression signature in human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs) exposed to normal glucose, high glucose with and without Tanshinone IIA. Cell proliferation was measured with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Cell migration was evaluated using transwell migration assay and wound scratch assay. Western blot was used to examine the expression of tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) and miRNA level was quantified by real-time PCR. The results showed that several miRNAs that were highly expressed in the high glucose group were significantly decreased in the high glucose with Tanshinone IIA group compared with the normal glucose group (P < 0.05). Among these miRNAs, miR-21-5p was significantly upregulated in the high glucose group and downregulated after Tanshinone IIA treatment (P < 0.05). The depletion of miR-21-5p in HASMCs resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration (P < 0.05). Moreover, we found that Tanshinone ⅡA inhibited proliferation and migration partly through miR-21-5p-mediated TPM1 downregulation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Tanshinone IIA is able to protect HASMCs from high glucose-induced proliferation and migration through regulating expression of miRNAs.Copyright © 2019.

These compounds have been widely screened for their pharmacological effects. Polyphenols, such as soy-derived isoflavones, also called phytoestrogens, have been extensively studied due to their ability to inhibit carcinogenesis. These compounds are chemically similar to 17β-estradiol, and mimic the binding of estrogens to its receptors, exerting estrogenic effects in target organs. Genistein is an isoflavone derived from soy-rich products and accounts for about 60% of total isoflavones found in soybeans. Genistein has been reported to exhibit several biological effects, such as anti-tumor activity (inhibition of cell proliferation, regulation of the cell cycle, induction of apoptosis), improvement of glucose metabolism, impairment of angiogenesis in both hormone-related and hormone-unrelated cancer cells, reduction of peri-menopausal and postmenopausal hot flashes, and modulation of antioxidant effects. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical studies have reported health benefits of genistein in many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, , and osteoporosis, and aid in the amelioration of typical menopausal symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Although the biological effects are promising, certain limitations, such as low bioavailability, biological estrogenic activity, and effects on target organs, have limited the clinical applications of genistein to some extent. Moreover, studies report that modification of its molecular structure may eliminate the biological estrogenic activity and its effects on target organs. In this review, we summarize the potential benefits of genistein on menopause symptoms and menopause-related diseases like cardiovascular, osteoporosis, obesity, , anxiety, depression, and breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669292>Effects of Opisthorchis viverrini infection on glucose and lipid profiles in human hosts: A cross-sectional and prospective follow-up study from Thailand.</a></h1><p>Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) infection is endemic to the Northeast Thailand where the prevalence of Type 2  (T2DM) is higher whilst the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is lower than the rest of Thailand. Helminth infection has both nutritional and immunological impact on their definitive hosts. Thus, a cross-sectional study was performed to see the effects of OV infection on glucose and lipid profiles. For this purpose, 200 each of OV infected and uninfected residents were recruited and their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) levels and anthropometric measurements, including BMI were examined. Then, as the prospective follow- up study, changes of those metabolic parameters of OV positive subjects (n = 120) before and after Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment were monitored for six months. The results showed that OV infection has a protective effect against hyperglycemia (OR 0.482 and p = .04) and metabolic disease risk group (OR 0.478 and p = .03). OV positive participants had lower HbA1c (5.5% Vs. 6.01%, p = .001) but higher HDL (54.07 Vs. 49.46 mg/dL, p = .001) than OV negative participants that are statistically significant. After PZQ treatment for OV-positive subjects, their serum levels of HbA1c (p < .05) and HDL (p < .05) significantly rose during the follow up.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of , hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on insulin-related metabolism in the central nervous system, especially in type 2  (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on insulin sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

It has been shown that dexamethasone promotes t-tubule development in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and that cardiomyocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knockout (GRKO) leads to heart failure. Here, we studied if the t-system is altered in GRKO hearts and if GR signalling is required for t-system preservation in adult cardiomyocytes. Confocal and 3D STED microscopy of myocardium from cardiomyocyte-specific GRKO mice revealed decreased t-system density and increased distances between ryanodine receptors (RyR) and L-type Ca channels (LTCC). Because t-system remodelling and heart failure are intertwined, we investigated the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Ventricular cardiomyocytes from failing human and healthy adult rat hearts cultured in the absence of glucocorticoids (CTRL) showed distinctively lower t-system density than cells treated with dexamethasone (EC 1.1 nM) or corticosterone. The GR antagonist mifepristone abrogated the effect of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone improved RyR-LTCC coupling and synchrony of intracellular Ca release, but did not alter expression levels of t-system-associated proteins junctophilin-2 (JPH2), bridging integrator-1 (BIN1) or caveolin-3 (CAV3). Rather, dexamethasone upregulated LC3B and increased autophagic flux. The broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine prevented dexamethasone-induced upregulation of autophagy and t-system preservation, and autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A and chloroquine accelerated t-system loss. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin or amino acid starvation preserved the t-system. These findings suggest that GR signalling and autophagy are critically involved in t-system preservation and remodelling in the heart.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669668>Protective efficacy of Tinospora sinensis against streptozotocin induced pancreatic islet cell injuries of diabetic rats and its correlation to its phytochemical profiles.</a></h1><p>Tinospora sinensis Lour. (Merr.) belongs to the family Menispermaceae and its stem extract have been used traditionally in broad aspects of therapeutic remedies including debility, dyspepsia, fever, jaundice, ulcer, bronchitis, urinary disease, skin disease, liver disease and .The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effects of methanol extract of stem of Tinospora sinensis (METS) on streptozotocin induced pancreatic islet cell injuries of diabetic rats and its correlation to its phytochemical profiles.A high-performance liquid chromatography technique (HPLC) was used to identify and quantify the major phytochemicals present in the METS. Diabetic rats were administered with METS at a dose of (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively orally) and standard drug Metformin (300 mg/kg) was given orally to group serving positive control. Effect of the METS on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, antioxidant status, histopathology of pancreas and also on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, cell cycleof pancreatic islet cells were studied in diabetic rats.The major phytochemicals identified and quantified by HPLC in the extract were berberine, caffeic acid, myricetin and ferulic acid. This result showed that methanol extract exhibited good antioxidant effect. The methanol extract of the plant prevented the diabetogenic effect of STZ and significantly lowered the fasting blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin and increased insulin and C-peptide level in treated rats. METS reduced apoptosis of STZ treated islet cells by significantly decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL6), intracellular ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) production and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and sub-G peak area, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.The results revealed that the methanol extract of the stem of the plant possesses protective effects against  and associated complications.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we developed a biomimetic platform that can sustain human islet physiology for a prolonged period ex vivo. Our approach involved the creation of a multichannel perifusion system to monitor dynamic insulin secretion and intracellular calcium flux simultaneously, enabling the systematic evaluation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion under multiple conditions. Using this tool, we developed a nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel-based islet-preserving platform (iPreP) that can preserve islet viability, morphology, and function for nearly 12 weeks ex vivo, and with the ability to ameliorate glucose levels upon transplantation into diabetic hosts.

Additional information was gathered from books, Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations, and unpublished materials.and discussion: F. hispida is used especially in Chinese and Indian traditional medical systems as a remedy for skin disorders, respiratory diseases, and urinary diseases. Wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, sedative, antidiarrheal, antiulcer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antineoplastic, and antidiabetic activities have been reported for crude extracts and isolated metabolites, but the methodologies in these studies often have inadequate design and low technical quality. More than 76 compounds have been isolated from F.hispida, including sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, phenylpropionic acids, benzoic acid derivatives, alkaloids, steroids, other glycosides, and alkanes, but the method of bioassay-guided fractionation is seldom applied in the isolation from F. hispida.F. hispida is used widely in traditional medicines and has multiple pharmacological effects that could support traditional uses. However, pharmacological studies should be viewed with caution because of the inappropriate experimental design.

To prevent recurrence, simple cyst fenestration and drainage of the cyst contents to the sphenoid sinus is recommended, but it occasionally recurs. The authors postulated that obstruction of fenestration is a main cause of recurrence, and they developed a method, named the "mucosa coupling method (MC method)," that maintains persistent drainage. In this method, the RCC epithelium and the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus are connected, which promotes re-epithelialization between the two epithelia, maintaining persistent drainage. The outcome of this method was compared with that of conventional cyst fenestration.In a consecutive series of 40 patients with RCC, the surgical strategy was changed during the study period: from December 2009 to September 2014 (the conventional period), 24 patients were scheduled to be treated using the conventional fenestration method, whereas from September 2014 to September 2017 (the MC period), 16 patients were scheduled to be treated using the MC method. However, because of an intraoperative CSF leak, the fenestration was closed during surgery in 3 patients in the conventional period and 2 in the MC period; therefore, these 5 patients were excluded from the analysis. Twenty-one patients treated with the conventional fenestration method (conventional group) and 14 patients treated with the MC method (MC group) were analyzed. All patients regularly underwent MRI after surgery to detect reaccumulation of cyst contents. The rate of reaccumulation with and without reoperation, visual outcomes, endocrinological outcomes, and postoperative complications were compared between these two groups.The median follow-up period in all 35 patients was 48.0 months (range 1-96 months), 54.0 months (range 1-96 months) in the conventional group and 35.5 months (range 12-51 months) in the MC group. No reaccumulation was detected on MRI in the 14 patients in the MC group, whereas it was noted in 9 (42.9%) of 21 patients in the conventional group, and 2 of these 9 patients required repeat surgery. There were no significant differences in visual and endocrinological outcomes and complications between these two groups.The MC method for RCC is effective for preventing obstruction of cyst fenestration, which contributes to preventing cyst reaccumulation. Furthermore, this method is equivalent to the conventional fenestration method in terms of visual and endocrinological outcomes and the complication rate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670895>Muscle fatigability in patients with type 2 : relation with long-term complications.</a></h1><p>It is unclear whether long-term complications play a role in muscle fatigue characteristic of patients with type 2  (T2DM). The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between muscle fatigability and micro and macrovascular complications in patients with T2DM.One-hundred and forty-six patients with T2DM (80 males, 66 females, aged 66.9 ± 7.9 years) were recruited. Maximal voluntary contraction (MCV) and endurance time (ET, 50% of the MVC) were assessed at the knee extensor muscles with an isometric dynamometer. Univariate and multivariate correlations of ET values with diabetic complications, a wide range of surrogate measures of these sequelae, and cardiovascular risk factors were examined.A higher muscle fatigability was detected in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN, ET: -32.4%), cardiovascular disease (CVD, ET: -32.1%), retinopathy (ET: -35.8%), and nephropathy (ET: -30.4%). At univariate analysis, muscle fatigability was associated with age, physical activity level,  duration, HbA , systolic blood pressure, albuminuria, eGFR, and several parameters of nervous and vascular function. Multivariate analysis showed that, after adjusting for covariates, ET was independently associated with sensory nerve conduction velocity, vibration perception threshold at malleolus, and ankle-brachial index. In addition, ET values were independently associated with the presence of DPN, CVD, and retinopathy.In T2DM, muscle fatigability is associated with presence of DPN, CVD, and retinopathy. Such defect appears to be mediated predominantly by sensory nerve and peripheral vascular dysfunction.This article is protected by copyright.

To test whether the difference might be explained by rapid tachyphylaxis in response to elevated concentrations of GIP, and whether patients with type 2  and their relatives are more susceptible to tachyphylaxis than healthy subjects.In a two-way crossover design, insulinotropic responses to repeated bolus injection (50 pmol/kg body weight at 30 and 120 min) and continuous infusion of GIP (2 pmol.kg-1.min-1 from 30-180 min) under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions (8.5 mmol/l) was compared in age- gender- and weight-matched patients with type 2 , first degree relatives of such patients, and healthy subjects.Insulin secretory responses to the first and second GIP bolus were not significantly different in any of the subject groups. Subjects with type 2  had a significant relative impairment versus healthy subjects with continuous (C-peptide, -13.2 %, p < 0.05), but not with repeated bolus administration of GIP (+11.1 %, n.s.). First-degree relatives tended to hyper-secrete insulin with bolus or continuous administrations of GIP.Rapid tachyphylaxis in response to continuous exposure to slightly supraphysiological concentrations of GIP does not explain the reduced insulinotropic response to GIP infusions in patients with type 2  or their first-degree relatives.Copyright © 2019.

The decision cycle, investigated in PDM-ProValue and similarly recommended by the 2018 ADA/EASD consensus report, can benefit  management in persons with type 2 . This is reflected in improved glycaemic control as well as patient and physician communication and satisfaction.Copyright © 2019.

Bishkhapra (Trianthema portulacastrum Linn.) is a well-known common weed belonging to the family Aizoaceae. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated from this weed and widely used against several diseases. The present study evaluated the protective and therapeutic efficacies of T. portulacastrum against atherosclerosis in a rat model. The animals were divided into the sham, control (- + atherosclerosis-inducing diet), 100 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, and positive control groups. Blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and other lipid parameters, as well as the expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124), were measured. Glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly reduced to near normal levels. The serum levels of fibrinogen, sVCAM-1, and oxidized low density lipoproteins were substantially increased in control rats. Treatment with the T. portulacastrum extract reversed these levels to near normal levels. The mRNA expression of GPR124 was increased by 150% in the control group. However, treatment with T. portulacastrum extract decreased the mRNA expression up to 40% compared with the control group. Rats treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum extract showed a decrease in GPR124 protein expression by 9.5% and 33.3%, respectively. Taken together, the results suggest that an extract of T. portulacastrum is effective against atherosclerosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671625>Maternal Obesity during Pregnancy Alters Daily Activity and Feeding Cycles, and Hypothalamic Clock Gene Expression in Adult Male Mouse Offspring.</a></h1><p>An obesogenic diet adversely affects the endogenous mammalian circadian clock, altering daily activity and metabolism, and resulting in obesity. We investigated whether an obese pregnancy can alter the molecular clock in the offspring hypothalamus, resulting in changes to their activity and feeding rhythms. Female mice were fed a control (C, 7% kcal fat) or high fat diet (HF, 45% kcal fat) before mating and throughout pregnancy. Male offspring were fed the C or HF diet postweaning, resulting in four offspring groups: C/C, C/HF, HF/C, and HF/HF. Daily activity and food intake were monitored, and at 15 weeks of age were killed at six time-points over 24 h. The clock genes , , , and  in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and appetite genes  and  in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) were measured. Daily activity and feeding cycles in the HF/C, C/HF, and HF/HF offspring were altered, with increased feeding bouts and activity during the day and increased food intake but reduced activity at night. Gene expression patterns and levels of , , and  in the SCN and  and  in the ARC were altered in HF diet-exposed offspring. The altered expression of hypothalamic molecular clock components and appetite genes, together with changes in activity and feeding rhythms, could be contributing to offspring obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673973>European Association for the Study of  2019 Conference: Podcast Overview of the Conference.</a></h1><p>Podcast recording of Editorial Board Members Uazman Alam and Shazli Azmi live from the EASD 2019 conference in Barcelona (MP4 377292 kb).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672891>Measles virus infection diminishes preexisting antibodies that offer protection from other pathogens.</a></h1><p>Measles virus is directly responsible for more than 100,000 deaths yearly. Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here we report on a meta-analysis of real-world observational studies on the impact of flash continuous glucose monitoring on glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c.A total of 271 studies were identified in our search, of which 29 contained data reporting changes in HbA1c over periods from 1 to 24 months that could be used in a statistical analysis. Our meta-analysis focuses on observed change in HbA1c at either 2, 3 or 4 months, in adult or paediatric subjects, as well as a longitudinal analysis up to 12 months in adult subjects. These data were drawn from 25 of the studies identified in our initial search. These reported HbA1c data up to 12 months in a total of 1723 participants with type 1  (T1D) or type 2  (T2D) using the FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system.Overall mean change in laboratory HbA1c across study subjects at 2-4 months was - 0.55% (95% CI - 0.70, - 0.39). Amongst the 1023 adults, mean change in HbA1c was - 0.56% (95% CI - 0.76, - 0.36); for the 447 children and adolescents, mean change in HbA1c was - 0.54% (95% CI - 0.84, - 0.23). Based on regression analysis, the degree of change in HbA1c correlated with the initial HbA1c of the study population. A longitudinal analysis in adult subjects (n = 1276) shows that HbA1c fell within the first 2 months and changes were sustained up to 12 months. No significant differences were detected between T1D and T2D.The meta-analysis reported here confirms that starting the FreeStyle Libre system as part of  care results in a significant and sustained reduction in HbA1c for adults and children with T1D and for adults with T2D.Abbott  Care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672503>Adherence to guideline recommended medical therapies in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence to guideline recommended medical therapies in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CCLI).We retrospectively analyzed the data of 1315 admissions performed in our Department, focusing on diabetic foot patients (842 - 64%) of which 603 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients with CCLI (M/F(%): 73/27; age: 70.3±10.4 yrs;  duration: 17.3±13.7 yrs; BMI: 27.7±5.3 Kg/m; HbA1c 7.8±1.8%) referred to a third-level Center from 2011 to 2015. We focused on medical therapy of , dyslipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and smoke habits.In total, at admission, 66.6% of patients had HbA1c levels higher than recommended; 65.9% of patients were on statins; 81.4 % on anti-hypertensive treatment and 72.4% on antiplatelet drugs. Concerning smoke habits, 27% of patients were no-smokers; 41% former smokers and 32% active smokers. Among all patients, only 24% were prescribed all five guideline recommended therapies while 32% reached four out of five of these. As for patients treated with anti-hypertensive drugs, we observed higher levels of systolic pressure (138.0±29.5 vs 107.7±36.6 p<0.02) while no differences were observed in diastolic pressure levels.In conclusion, when it comes to diabetic patients with a severe limb and life threatening clinical condition, we noticed a lower-than-expected application of international guideline-recommended medical therapies. In fact, only one out of four patients was following all the recommended therapies. Nevertheless, these patients did not reach the standard targets requested to prevent cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2019.

Multislice CT (MSCT) is a non-invasive alternative to coronary angiography (CAG) suggested for patients with a low-to-intermediate risk of CAD. No established definition of such patients exists. Our purpose was to develop a simple score to identify as large a group as possible with a suitable pretest risk of CAD.Retrospective study of patients in Denmark undergoing CAG due to newly diagnosed HF from 2010 to 2014. All Danish patients were registered in two databases according to geographical location. We used data from one registry and multiple logistic regression with backwards elimination to find predictors of CAD and used the derived OR to develop a clinical risk score called the CT-HF score, which was subsequently validated in the other database.The main cohort consisted of 2171 patients and the validation cohort consisted of 2795 patients with 24% and 27% of patients having significant CAD, respectively. Among significant predictor, the strongest was extracardiac arteriopathy (OR 2.84). Other significant factors were male sex, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, , angina and age. A proposed cut-off of 9 points identified 61% of patients with a 15% risk of having CAD, resulting in an estimated savings of 15% of the cost and 21% of the radiation.A simple score based on clinical risk factors could identify HF patients with a low risk of CAD; these patients may have benefitted from MSCT as a gatekeeper for CAG.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Enhanced thromboxane (TX)-dependent platelet activation plays a pivotal role in atherothrombosis and characterizes type 2  (DM). Whether this also pertains to IGT is currently unknown. We investigated whether TXA -dependent platelet activation, as reflected by 11-dehydro-TXB (TXM) urinary excretion, is comparably abnormal in IGT as in DM; is persistent over long-term follow-up; changes as a function of metabolic disease progression; is influenced by food intake.We prospectively investigated subjects with IGT (n=48), and two control groups with DM diagnosed either <12 months (n=60) or ≥12 months (n=58).Baseline TXM excretion was comparable between subjects with IGT and DM, with no evidence of a circadian variation. During a 36-month follow-up, urinary TXM excretion was stable over time in the DM groups, while tended to increase in subjects with IGT. Increasing urinary TXM excretion over time was observed in the subjects who progressed to  vs. non-progressors.We conclude that TXA -dependent platelet activation was at least as high in IGT as in patients with DM and further increased over time, especially in those who progressed to overt .This article is protected by copyright.

We obtained data on person- and health-related characteristics at metformin initiation from these collections and calculated medication possession ratios from pharmacy dispensing data. Regression modelling was used to assess changes in adherence over time.We identified 85,066 people with T2DM who initiated metformin monotherapy. Lower adherence to metformin monotherapy was associated with time since initiating metformin, younger age and being of Māori or Pacific ethnicity. Higher adherence was associated with receiving more non-diabetic medications, a history of CVD and recent cancer registration.Our findings are consistent with international literature and highlight groups of people who experience poor adherence over time. Understanding the drivers of lower adherence in Māori and Pacific peoples is a particular priority given the high prevalence of T2DM in these populations.Copyright © 2019.

Polymer-free DES (PF-DES) have offered promising angiographic results, with earlier complete re-endothelization, potentially reducing the thrombotic risk and offering the option of a shorter antiplatelet therapy. However, contrasting prognostic data have been reported so far with PF-DES. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a comprehensive updated meta-analysis of randomized trials (RCT) comparing the impact of PF-DES vs polymer- coated DES (PC-DES) on clinical outcome.Literature and main scientific session abstracts were searched for RCTs comparing PF-DES vs PC-DES for the treatment of CAD. The primary efficacy endpoint was mortality, secondary endpoints were cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and stent thrombosis.We included 16 randomized clinical trials, with a total of 15,689 patients, including 50.6% randomized to PF-DES. At a median follow-up of 24 months, PF-DES were associated to a significant reduction in mortality as compared to PC-DES (0.82 [0.68, 0.99], p = .03, I2 = 0%; phet = 0.93). However, no significant benefit was observed in terms of cardiovascular death or major ischemic endpoints (respectively CV death: OR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.71, 1.18] p = .50, I2 = 0.50; phet = 0.84; MI: OR [95% CI] = 1.08 [0.90, 1.29], p = .42; I2 = 0%, phet = 0.98; TLR: OR [95% CI] = 1.02 [0.78, 1.32], p = .91; I2 = 0.63 phet = 0.0003; ST: OR [95% CI] = 0.98 [0.87, 1.10], p = .72; I2 = 0% phet = 0.64). By meta-regression analysis, the mortality benefits of PF-DES were not conditioned by the rate of  or acute coronary syndromes.Based on the current meta-analysis, PF-DES are associated to a significant reduction in mortality as compared to PC-DES, but not in the occurrence of major ischemic events. Future larger studies are certainly needed to further investigate and confirm our findings, especially in particular subsets of patients, such as those with high bleeding risk or acute myocardial infarction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since vision changes can be irreversible in diabetic retinopathy (DR), recognition of prognostic biomarkers in the peripheral retina may prove invaluable toward optimizing the management and reducing the societal burden of this blinding disease. Following a bibliographic review using Pubmed, OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, the current review systematically examined 13 studies that compared UWFI to conventional screening techniques such as seven standard field (7SF) Early Treatment In Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and non-mydriatic multifield fundus photography (NMFP), as well as their scientific level of evidence. Overall, UWFI had good agreement with 7SF ETDRS and NMFP, and moderate agreement with dilated fundus examination. Seven additional studies were examined that considered the significance of peripheral lesions found on UWFI. These studies demonstrated that UWFI captured additional DR pathology in the peripheral retina that may not be evident if evaluation is limited to the posterior pole and may be relevant to patient outcomes. Future directions include but are not limited to the potential of UWFI to track the progression of DR with treatment.

Data included demographics, risk factors, onset-to-door time, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, stroke subtype, ischemic stroke etiology, treatments, 3-month mortality, and modified Rankin Scale score. Time to treatment was also recorded for patients treated with thrombolysis.Five thousand four hundred one patients were registered; median age, 65 years; 46% women; 3915 (72.5%)
ischemic strokes; 686 (13.7%) hemorrhagic strokes; 213 (4.3%) subarachnoid hemorrhages; 414 (8.3%) transient ischemic attacks; and 31 (0.6%) cerebral vein thrombosis. The most prevalent risk factors were hypertension (71.3%), dyslipidemia (35.2%), and  (23.6%). Atrial fibrillation was present in 15.1%. Three hundred one ischemic strokes were treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT; 7.7%). Patients undergoing IVT were more severely affected (median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 11 versus 6). The rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages after IVT was 5.7%. At 3 months, 60.3% of IVT-treated patients and 59.1% of untreated patients were independent (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2).

We sought to 1) enhance the existing ACS NSQIP SRC with functionality to predict geriatric-specific outcomes and 2) assess the predictive value of geriatric-specific risk factors by comparing performance in outcome prediction using the traditional ACS NSQIP SRC versus models that also included geriatric risk factors.Data were collected from 21 ACS NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project (GSPP) hospitals between 2014-2017. Hierarchical regression models predicted four postoperative geriatric outcomes (i.e. pressure ulcer, delirium, new mobility aid use, and functional decline) using the traditional 21-variable ACS NSQIP SRC models and 27-variable models that included six geriatric risk factors (i.e. living situation, fall history, mobility aid use, cognitive impairment, surrogate-signed consent, and palliative care on admission).Data from 38,048 patients ages ≥ 65 undergoing 197 unique operations across 10 surgical subspecialties were used. Stable model discrimination and calibration between developmental and validation datasets confirmed predictive validity. Models with and without geriatric risk factors demonstrated excellent performance (c-statistics > 0.8) with inclusion of geriatric risk factors improving performance. Of the 21 ACS NSQIP variables, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), age, functional dependence, sex, disseminated cancer, , and sepsis were the strongest risk predictors, while impaired cognition, fall history, and mobility aid use were the strongest geriatric predictors.The ACS NSQIP SRC can predict four unique outcomes germane to geriatric surgical patients, with improvement of predictive capability after accounting for geriatric risk factors. Augmentation of ACS NSQIP SRC may enhance shared decision-making to improve the quality of surgical care in older adults.Copyright © 2019.

Androgen is suggested not only to regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis but also to affect metabolism. In this study, Glp1r mRNA was found widely expressed in normal male mice and its levels were positively correlated with the serum testosterone (T) concentrations. Using mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells, which highly express GLP-1R, we observed GLP-1R was upregulated both at transcriptional and protein levels induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and was downregulated by androgen receptor inhibitor ARN-509 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Glp1r mRNA. In normal C57BL/6 mice and db/db mice, Glp1r mRNA levels in the pancreases increased in the DHT treatment group and decreased in the ARN-509 treatment group. And the increased GLP-1R expression had insulinotropic function both in vitro and in vivo. Further analysis showed that the androgen receptor (Ar) located in the cytosol of MIN6 cells and translocated to the nucleus after DHT treatment. In addition, we found that there was an Ar motif in the promoter region of the Glp1r gene. Further studies revealed that the translocated DHT/Ar complex from the cytosol to the nucleus bound to the Ar motif of the Glp1r gene and upregulated gene transcription. Taken together, the widely expressed GLP-1R was positively regulated by androgen under physiological condition and in diabetic models at the transcriptional level.Copyright © 2019.

To facilitate the early diagnosis of SFN, biomarkers for SFN must be identified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of SFN in prediabetic patients and the relationship between pNF-H and SFN.44 IGT patients (inpatients and outpatients) were selected at random. 33 healthy subjects served as controls. Data on clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were collected. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), electromyography (EMG), and Sudoscan were performed, and pNF-H was measured by ELISA.24 of the 44 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were diagnosed with SFN according to the modified Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group consensus criteria. The thermal sensory thresholds of the IGT-SFN group were significantly different from those of the CTRL group (p < 0.05), except for the heat pain threshold. The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) of the sural nerve was 12.39 in the IGT-SFN group, which was significantly lower than those in the other groups. No significant difference in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was observed among the three groups. The electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) in the IGT-SFN group was 69.78 ± 14.03uS, which was significantly lower than that in the CTRL group. The pNF-H in the IGT-SFN group was 170.6 (140.0, 223.6) pg/ml, which was significantly higher than those in the CTRL and IGT-non-SFN groups (76.55 and 64.7 pg/ml, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that pNF-H and 2h plasma glucose were independently correlated with SFN; the ORs (95% CI) were 1.429 (1.315, 1.924) and 2.375 (1.157, 4.837), respectively.Serum pNF-H may be associated with SFN in IGT patients, and serum pNF-H could therefore serve as a sensitive biomarker for the detection of SFN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671800>The Usefulness of Anthropometric Indices to Identify the Risk of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Despite several papers having been published on the association between adiposity and the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), it is still difficult to determine unambiguously which of the indices of nutritional status is the best to identify MetS.

The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = 5.83), WHtR (OR = 5.70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = 5.65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27.2 kg/m. The weakest predictor of the syndrome was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR. The optimal cut-off points for WHtR equaled 0.56 in men and 0.54 in women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672448>Effects of newer antidiabetic drugs on nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis: think out of the box!</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western societies and a major cause of hepatic disease worldwide. Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type 2  (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that RCCs are being more commonly diagnosed in children with endocrine-related diseases and most of the RCCs show neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).After approval by the local ethics committee, the medical records and contrast-enhanced pituitary MRI of 833 children (boys/girls, 338/495; mean age±SD, 9.4±3.7 years) were retrospectively reviewed between January 2016 and January 2019. The size, location, signal intensities, and postcontrast enhancement pattern of RCCs were assessed by a pediatric radiologist. Same imaging features were also independently reviewed by another radiologist to determine the interobserver agreement by using the kappa statistics (κ) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).RCC was evident on MRI in 13.5% of the patients (boys/girls, 39/74; mean age±SD, 9.8±3.9 years). The mean size of RCCs was 5.5 mm (range, 3.1-8.5 mm). An RCC frequency higher than expected was found in patients with central precocious puberty, , and hypersecretion of prolactin (P = 0.007). The mean size of RCCs did not show significant differences among the clinical indications for MRI (P ≥ 0.461). All RCCs showed abnormal signal on T2-weighted image and most (89%) showed neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content (i.e., isointense on T1-weighted imaging and hypointense on T2-weighted imaging compared with the normal anterior pituitary gland). Eighty-four patients with RCCs (74%) had follow-up MRI and the mean follow-up was 1.5 years. In follow-ups, five RCCs disappeared; the mean size of 10 RCCs increased and that of 6 RCCs decreased. These size changes were not statistically significant (P = 0.376). No signal intensity changes of RCCs were seen during the follow-up, except for 4 RCCs, whose protein content increased over time and T1 signals increased on imaging. Interobserver agreements were almost perfect for the MRI findings of RCCs (κ and ICC range, 0.81-1, P < 0.001).RCCs were not uncommon in patients examined for endocrine-related diseases, and nearly 1 in 10 patients had an RCC. The size and signal intensities of RCCs may change over time and the evolution of RCCs is unpredictable. Most RCCs showed neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content on MRI, and all RCCs had an abnormal signal on T2-weighted imaging, thus eliminating the need to administer a contrast agent at follow-up imaging of the patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672299>Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas.</a></h1><p>Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The incidence of DTC has increased significantly over the past three decades. Surgical resection, radioactive iodine (RAI), and levothyroxine suppression therapy remain the primary modalities for DTC treatment. Active surveillance for low-risk thyroid cancer may be an alternative to immediate surgery for appropriately selected patients. Patient characteristics influence treatment selection and intensity. In the subset of patients with progressive distant metastatic disease, not amenable to treatment with surgery or RAI, novel agents, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy, should be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Daily glucose variability was evaluated by mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE], percentage coefficient of variation for glucose (%CV), and day-to-day glucose variability (mean of daily differences [MODD]) by using continuous glucose monitoring. Correlations of clinical factors, including insulin secretion ability by the GST with MAGE, %CV, and MODD, were analyzed.In 83 T2DM with insulin therapy, age and hemoglobin A (HbA) correlated with MAGE and %CV, fasting plasma glucose with MAGE and MODD, and increment of C-peptide immunoreactivity (ΔCPR) by GST correlated inversely with MAGE, %CV, and MODD. In 126 T2DM without insulin therapy, age, diastolic blood pressure, and triglycerides correlated with MODD, HbA with MAGE and MODD, and ΔCPR inversely correlated with %CV. Use of α-glucosidase inhibitors inversely correlated with %CV, whereas that of sulfonylurea was associated with MAGE and %CV.These results suggest that ΔCPR correlated with stability of glycemic control, whereas poorly controlled  is associated with increase in glucose variability. α-glucosidase inhibitors may be superior to sulfonylureas in reducing the glucose variability in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

Participants filled out questionnaires on psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 5 consecutive days. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance in SPSS.Educational level significantly influenced the association between perception of body weight and light PA (P = .01) and total PA (P = .03) on weekend days. Educational level did not influence the associations between other psychosocial and perceived environmental factors (ie, perceived social influence; environmental, time and attitudinal barriers, perceived self-efficacy; knowledge and fatalism) and PA.Educational level did not influence the relationship between most psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and PA in this sample of adults at type 2  risk. This suggests that addressing different psychosocial and perceived environmental correlates in lower and higher educated participants might not be necessary.

BMI-SDS velocity decreased from +0.17 ± 0.22 to -0.30 ± 0.20. Appetite and CEBQ subscale scores for "food responsiveness" and "enjoyment of food" decreased. We observed adverse effects with increase in self-reported frequency of disordered sleep, nervousness, hyperactivity, and tics.The observed decrease in BMI trajectories with MPH use for one year is clinically meaningful in this group of patients, since the natural course would have been associated with a pronounced increase in BMI, leading to comorbidities and complications over time.© 2019 The Authors.

And evaluating the association between CD26 expression and TGAb and TPOAb levels.We collected peripheral blood and thyroid tissues from healthy controls and HT patients. Then we measured circulating CD26 level via ELISA and membrane-bound CD26 on Th and Tc cells via flow cytometry. Immunochemistry is used to evaluate CD26 expression in thyroid tissue. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation between serum CD26 and autoantibodies and CD26 on T cells.Compared with healthy controls, CD26 expression in serum and thyroid tissues were obviously lower in HT patients with normal thyroid function. And serum CD26 level was negatively related with TGAb. While no correlation was seen between membrane-bound CD26 and autoantibodies. There was no relation between serum CD26 and CD26 expression on T cells.Taken together, our results show that the level of serum CD26 was associated with TGAb in HT patients with normal thyroid function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The ratio of human nonmercaptalbumin (HNA; oxidized form) to human mercaptalbumin (HMA; reduced form) has attracted attention as an indicator for systemic redox states. In this study, we measured the ratio in elderly patients with  and evaluated its association with diabetic complications and disability in activities of daily living (ADL disability).One hundred twenty-six elderly patients with , aged 70 years and older, under medical care at Yukuhashi Central Hospital from April 2018 to June 2018, were continuously recruited. HNA%, defined as HNA / (HNA + HMA) × 100, was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. First, multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate which variables were significant determinants for HNA%. Next, to evaluate the association of HNA% with ADL disability, logistic regression analysis in various models was performed. Then we plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the under area the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in each model.In elderly patients with , multiple regression analysis showed that serum bilirubin levels and albumin levels, both of which are major endogenous anti-oxidants, and chronic renal failure (or proliferative nephropathy) were significantly associated with HNA%, suggesting that HNA% may be a good biomarker for oxidative stress in those patients. We then evaluated the association of HNA% with ADL disability in various logistic regression models. Model using only HNA% showed that it was a significant determinant for ADL disability (OR 1.158, 95% CI 1.077-1.244, P < .001). Model using HNA% and age showed that both variables were significant determinants for ADL disability (OR 1.160, 95% CI 1.069-1.258, P < .001; OR 1.258, 95% CI 1.110-1.427, P < .001, respectively).

It includes 3 distinct scales: Perceived Behavior, Perceived Benefit, and Perceived Burden. In contrast with existing measures, the TAPQ was expected to have a clear factor structure; have good discrimination; and assess distinct types of perception, each of which has different patterns of association with interpersonal, personality, motivational, and emotional variables. Foundational work on the TAPQ (with 891 patients) included 5 quantitative scale development studies and 1 qualitative study. The present report focuses on results from a final validation study using 450 patients recruited via market research panels to complete online questionnaires. This study included a general medical sample and a sample of people with either  or hypertension. A confirmatory factor analysis specifying strict measurement invariance across these groups produced a good fit. Analysis with item-response theory suggested that the scales on the TAPQ provide good discrimination across a wide range of experience levels. The 3 scales on the TAPQ each had distinct patterns of association with criterion variables regarding conscientiousness, health behavior, motivation, affect, type of diagnosis, and interpersonal communication with health-care professionals. These effects could not be explained by another existing measure of adherence or by a measure of response bias.

We aimed to examine the prospective association of alcohol consumption with echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, in individuals with and without type 2  (T2DM).We included 778 participants from the Hoorn Study (aged 68.4 ± 7.2 years, 49% women), a population-based prospective cohort study, oversampled for people with impaired glucose metabolism or T2DM. Self-reported alcohol consumption was collected at baseline with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized into: none (0/week), light (>0-≤30 g/week), light-to-moderate (>30-≤70 g/week), moderate (>70-≤140 g/week), and heavy drinkers (>140 g/week). Echocardiography was performed at baseline (N = 778) and after 8 years follow-up (N = 404). Multiple linear regression was used to study the association between alcohol consumption and echocardiographic measures (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial volume index (LAVI) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI)), adjusted for confounders. Moderate and heavy alcohol consumption were associated with a decreased LVEF of -3.91% (CI: -7.13;-0.69) for moderate and -4.77% (-8.18;-1.36) for heavy drinkers compared to light drinkers. No associations were found between alcohol consumption, LVMI and LAVI. Modified Poisson regression showed a trend that higher alcohol consumption amounts were associated with a higher risk of incident systolic dysfunction (LVEF≤50%) (P-for-trend 0.058).The findings provide longitudinal evidence that moderate and heavy alcohol consumption are associated with decreased LVEF and trend towards a higher risk of incident LV systolic dysfunction, compared to light drinkers.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

The toe and flow model (TFM) describes the framework for multidisciplinary centers aiming to reduce this complication. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of the TFM to reduce -related major LLAs in comparison with the standard of care (SOC) in the Canadian health care system.We retrospectively reviewed the anonymized -related LLA reports in two similar metropolitan health zones in Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2017. Although both zones have the same provincial health care system and similar demographics, Calgary, our first zone operates on the basis of the TFM while the Edmonton zone operates in accordance with the provincial SOC. LLAs were divided into minor and major amputation cohorts. We used the chi-square test, linear regression, and Pearson correlation for analysis. The lower proportion of major LLAs was denoted as a positive sign for the efficacy of the TFM.Although the number of LLAs remained relatively comparable (Calgary zone: 2238 and Edmonton zone: 2410), the Calgary zone had both significantly lower major (45%) and higher minor (42%) amputation incidence rates compared to the Edmonton zone. The increasing trend in minor LLAs and decreasing trend in major LLAs in the Calgary zone were negatively and significantly correlated (r = -0.730, p = 0.011). No significant correlation was found in the Edmonton zone.A significant reduction in the incidence rate, decreasing trend of -related major LLAs and the significant negative correlation of minor and major LLAs rates in the Calgary zone (TFM) compared to its sister zone Edmonton (SOC), provides supporting evidence for the impact of the TFM. This investigation provides support for a modernization of the -related limb preservation practice in Canada through the implementation of TFMs across the country to combat major LLAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669312>Follow-up of infants born to mothers with autoinmune thyroid disease.

It is usually of an autoimmune origin, with Hashimotós thyroiditis and Graveś disease being the most common conditions. Although hormonal changes and transplacental antibody transfer may occur, specific neonatal screening has not been shown to be useful.A prospective study of newborns of women with autoimmune thyroid disease born at a level III university hospital (November 2013-December 2016). Neonates were selected during their stay at the maternity. Babies with perinatal asphyxia were excluded. Data were collected from the clinical histories of mothers and newborns.A total of 191 neonates were included. Ninety percent of mothers had been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Only 5.8% of newborns had some laboratory disorder, consisting of slightly increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, which returned to normal at the age of one month and did not correlate to thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. Transient hyperthyrotropinemia was diagnosed in one newborn and required thyroxin treatment during the first year of life. Among newborns from mothers with Graveś disease, 36.8% had some abnormal laboratory value during the first 7 days of life, but there were no cases of hyperthyroidism and only one of transient hyperthyrotropinemia.Experience at our hospital in screening of newborns from hypothyroid mothers reveals a high number of laboratory controls with a poor diagnostic yield. No relationship was found between thyroid peroxidase antibody levels and thyroid dysfunction. We support the recommendations to continue testing serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and FT4 levels at 48h of life in newborns of mothers with autoimmune hypothyroidism.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED.

Air pollution is a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate materials, that vary depending on their source and physicochemical features. Each material has detrimental effects on human health, but a number of experimental and clinical studies have shown a strong impact for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In particular, there is more and more evidence that PM2.5 exerts adverse effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, contributing substantially -- mainly through mechanisms of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and inflammation -- to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, but also to heart failure, hypertension,  and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we summarize knowledge on the mechanisms and magnitude of the cardiovascular adverse effects of short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly for the PM2.5 size fraction. We also emphasize that very recent data indicate that the global mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular disease associated with this air pollutant is dramatically greater than appreciated until now.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673002>Intestinal helminth infection enhances bacteria-induced recruitment of neutrophils to the airspace.</a></h1><p>Intestinal helminth infections elicit Th2-type immunity, which influences host immune responses to additional threats, such as allergens, metabolic disease, and other pathogens. Th2 immunity involves a shift of the CD4 T-cell population from type-0 to type-2 (Th2) with increased abundance of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. This study sought to investigate if existing gut-restricted intestinal helminth infections impact bacterial-induced acute airway neutrophil recruitment. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: uninfected; helminth-Heligmosomoides polygyrus infected; Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected; and coinfected. Mice infected with H. polygyrus were incubated for 2 weeks, followed by P. aeruginosa intranasal inoculation. Bronchial alveolar lavage, blood, and lung samples were analyzed. Interestingly, infection with gut-restricted helminths resulted in immunological and structural changes in the lung. These changes include increased lung CD4 T cells, increased Th2 cytokine expression, and airway goblet cell hyperplasia. Furthermore, coinfected mice exhibited significantly more airspace neutrophil infiltration at 6 hours following P. aeruginosa infection and exhibited an improved rate of survival compared with bacterial infected alone. These results suggest that chronic helminth infection of the intestines can influence and enhance acute airway neutrophil responses to P. aeruginosa infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669066>Validation of a protein biomarker test for predicting renal decline in type 2 : The Fremantle  Study Phase II.</a></h1><p>To validate the prognostic utility of a novel plasma biomarker panel, PromarkerD, for predicting renal decline in an independent cohort of people with type 2 .Models for predicting rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline defined as i) incident diabetic kidney disease (DKD), ii) eGFR decline ≥30% over four years, and iii) annual eGFR decline ≥5 mL/min/1.73 m were applied to 447 participants from the longitudinal observational Fremantle  Study Phase II.

At the optimal score cut-off, this model provided 86% sensitivity, 78% specificity, 30% positive predictive value and 98% negative predictive value for four-year risk of developing DKD.The combination of readily available clinical and laboratory features and the PromarkerD biomarkers (apoA4, CD5L, IGFBP3) proved an accurate prognostic test for future renal decline in an independent validation cohort of people with type 2 .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

Initially, CP is managed with endoscopic interventions, long-term analgesia for its associated chronic abdominal pain syndrome and pancreatic enzyme replacement for exocrine dysfunction. As the disease advances, pancreatic drainage procedures and partial resections are considered, but they leave diseased tissue behind and usually result in short-term relief only. Total pancreatectomy alone is widely viewed as a last resort treatment option because it causes brittle . However, total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) can prevent the development of  and cure the chronic pain syndrome. One serious, albeit rare, complication of TPIAT is (partial) portal vein thrombosis. Its incidence is probably about 5%. To prevent the occurrence of portal vein thrombosis, we propose herein, and have successfully performed, continuous real-time Doppler ultrasonography during the islet infusion to study portal vein and intrahepatic flow patterns, as well as changes in Doppler signals. Flow and signal changes may allow for timely adjustment of the infusion rate, before a marked increase in portal vein pressure is noted and decrease the risk of portal vein thrombosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 , in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte lipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019.

Our aim is to study the presence of abnormal receptors in subjects diagnosed with AICS with nodular adrenal hyperplasia in a 14-year period (2002-2016), as well as its clinical-biological and evolutive characteristics.A multicentre descriptive study of a 15-case series of AICS with nodular adrenal hyperplasia (study period: 2002-2016). In these cases, abnormal receptor screening was performed by means of stimulation tests, with a plasma cortisol increase of ≥ 25% from baseline being considered pathologic.Of the 15 cases, 13 were female, with a mean age at diagnosis of 56.8 years. In 12 of the 15 cases studied, positivity was detected with stimulation tests, and, of them, 25% were positive for the meal test, 58.3% for posture walking test, 33.3% for desmopressin; 25% for terlipressin; 33.3% for GnRH; 25% for LH and 50% for metoclopramide. Regarding treatment, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in 16.7% and unilateral adrenalectomy in 41.7%. The rest continue under observation with periodic follow-up (41.7%).In most of the cases studied with AICS and nodular adrenal hyperplasia (80%), an abnormal cortisol response is detected due to the presence of abnormal receptors.

We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 , insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum insulin were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.  Ferritin and insulin are significant predictors of NASH. Clinicians may use these to better assess cardiovascular risk and provide better management to hypertensive patients with NASH.

However, myocardial infarction in SMuRF-less individuals is not uncommon. This study uses 2 sequential large, multicenter registries to examine the proportion and outcomes of SMuRF-less ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Methods and Results We identified 3081 STEMI patients without a prior history of cardiovascular disease in the Australian GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and CONCORDANCE (Cooperative National Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome Care) registries, encompassing 42 hospitals, between 1999 and 2017. We examined the proportion that were SMuRF-less as well as outcomes. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or heart failure, during the index admission). Multivariate regression models were used to identify predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events. Of STEMI patients without a prior history of cardiovascular disease 19% also had no history of SMuRFs. This proportion increased from 14% to 23% during the study period (=0.0067). SMuRF-less individuals had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than individuals with 1 or more SMuRFs. There were no clinically significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 6 months between the 2 groups. Conclusions A substantial and increasing proportion of STEMI presentations occur independently of SMuRFs. Discovery of new markers and mechanisms of disease beyond standard risk factors may facilitate novel preventative strategies. Studies to assess longer-term outcomes of SMuRF-less STEMI patients are warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671589>Effects of Periodic Fasting on Fatty Liver Index-A Prospective Observational Study.</a></h1><p>This prospective observational trial investigated effects and safety of periodic fasting in subjects with and without type 2  (T2DM). The primary end point was set as the change of fatty liver index (FLI) as a surrogate parameter of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for fatty liver) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects). Body mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% body weight. After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001). Periodic fasting with concomitant weight reduction leads to significant rapid improvement of FLI in subjects with and without T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672719>Metformin decreases hyaluronan synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h1><p>Metformin is the first-line drug in the treatment of type 2  worldwide based on its effectiveness and cardiovascular safety. Currently metformin is increasingly used during pregnancy in women with gestational , even if the long-term effects of metformin on offspring are not exactly known. We have previously shown that high glucose concentration increases hyaluronan (HA) production of cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via stimulating the expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (). This offers a potential mechanism whereby hyperglycemia leads to vascular macroangiopathy. In this study, we examined whether gestational metformin use affects HA content in the aortic wall of mouse offspring in vivo. We also examined the effect of metformin on HA synthesis by cultured human VSMCs in vitro. We found that gestational metformin use significantly decreased HA content in the intima-media of mouse offspring aortas. In accordance with this, the synthesis of HA by VSMCs was also significantly decreased in response to treatment with metformin. This decrease in HA synthesis was shown to be due to the reduction of both the expression of  and the amount of HAS substrates, particularly UDP--acetylglucosamine. As shown here, gestational metformin use is capable to program reduced HA content in the vascular wall of the offspring strongly supporting the idea, that metformin possesses long-term vasculoprotective effects.© American Federation for Medical Research 2019.

FH is caused by mutations in genes that regulate LDL catabolism, mainly the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gain of function of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, the phenotype may be encountered in individuals not carrying the latter monogenic defects, in approximately 20% of these effects of polygenes predominate, and in many individuals no molecular defects are encountered at all. These so-called FH phenocopy individuals have an elevated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in comparison with normolipidemic individuals but this risk is lower than in those with monogenic disease. Individuals with FH are exposed to elevated LDL-C levels since birth and this explains the high cardiovascular, mainly coronary heart disease, burden of these subjects. However, recent studies show that this risk is heterogenous and depends not only on high LDL-C levels but also on presence of previous cardiovascular disease, a monogenic cause, male sex, smoking, hypertension, , low HDL-cholesterol, obesity and elevated lipoprotein(a). This heterogeneity in risk can be captured by risk equations like one from the SAFEHEART cohort and by detection of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. High dose high potency statins are the main stain for LDL-C lowering in FH, however, in most situations these medications are not powered enough to reduce cholesterol to adequate levels. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors should also be used in order to better treat LDL-C in FH patients.Copyright © 2019.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2  and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672443>FGF21 in NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of pathologies ranging from uncomplicated hepatic fat accumulation to a state of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from liver and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic fat content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic fat in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans. Finally, we review the therapeutic effects of FGF21 in the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019.

Onset generally occurs in young adulthood to middle adulthood (18 to 39 years of age). Females and blacks are more than twice as likely to be affected. Additional risk factors include family history, smoking, and obesity. Hidradenitis suppurativa is associated with several comorbidities, including  and Crohn disease. The clinical presentation of hidradenitis suppurativa ranges from rare, mild inflammatory nodules to widespread abscesses, sinus tracts, and scarring. Quality of life is often affected, and patients should be screened for depression. Treatment includes wearing loose-fitting clothes, losing weight if overweight, and smoking cessation. Topical clindamycin alone can be effective for patients with mild disease. Patients with moderate disease can be treated with oral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, in addition to topical clindamycin. Adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor, is effective for patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Surgical procedures are often necessary for definitive treatment and include local procedures, such as punch debridement and unroofing/deroofing.

DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC).The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not differentiate between nDPN and DPN.DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher RD.

LCA grouped participants into ACE classes. Respondents self-reported ACEs and lifetime depression,  and CVD. Complex survey weighted logistic regression models assessed the relationships between ACEs, , and CVD overall and in those with and without depression.Half of participants were female (48.6%) and 82.3% White, non-Hispanic. LCA identified a four-class solution characterized as 'low adversity', 'verbal/physical abuse', 'sexual abuse', and 'high adversity'. The odds ratios for each ACE class and  were similar in those with and without depression. An overall adjusted model showed that 'sexual abuse' versus 'low adversity' was significantly associated with  (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.05-1.61). Effect modification was present for CVD such that among those with depression, but not among those without, 'high adversity' had over two times the odds of CVD than 'low adversity' (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.06-2.93).'High adversity' in those with but not without depression is positively associated with CVD.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced insulin resistance is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type 2  (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving insulin sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum insulin (FINS) and insulin resistance index, in parallel with improved glucose and insulin tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced insulin resistance through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.5%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.5%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was 5.3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total body weight (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year weight loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both weight loss and weight maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers.

It also explores the role of "middlemen" in prescription drug pricing (broadly defined as any market participant other than the drug manufacturer and the provider / patient, including - but not limited to - insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers ("PBM") and health plans) and teases out the mechanisms by which PBMs in particular contribute to overall healthcare costs and the types of risks and returns they endure. Like any economic system, the healthcare system is a net zero-sum construct, whereby costs and benefits are traded off or exchanged between components of the value chain involuntarily (e.g. by regulatory or legal mandate) or voluntarily (e.g. by economic incentive). Ultimately, the question for policy makers as it relates to healthcare reform is to determine what mix of such exchanges leads to the best overall outcomes. This question of optimization, however, is undoubtedly challenging and complex, and can bring to bear economic, social, political and moral dimensions. In light of these considerations, the article concludes by touching upon some perspectives for the future and ideas for reform, including payer reform, delivery disintermediation by technology and consumer-driven healthcare.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675271>Impact of new-onset  on clinical outcomes after ST segment-elevated myocardial infarction.</a></h1><p> Patients with  have higher mortality rate than patients without  after ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). Prognosis of patients with new onset  (NOD) after STEMI remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis of patients with NOD compared to that of patients without NOD after STEMI.  This study was a retrospective observational study. We enrolled 901 STEMI patients. Patients were divided into diabetic and non-diabetic groups at index admission. Non-diabetic group was divided into NOD and non-NOD groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox's proportional hazard regression models were used to compare major adverse cardiac events (MACE) free survival rate and hazard ratio for MACE between NOD and non-NOD groups.  Mean follow-up period was 59 ± 28 months.  group had higher MACE than non- group ( = .038). However, MACE was not different between NOD and non-NOD groups ( = 1.000). After 1:2 propensity score matching, incidence of MACE was not different between the two groups. In Kaplan-Meier survival curves, MACE-free survival rates were not statistically different between NOD and non-NOD groups either ( = .244). Adjusted hazard ratios of NOD for MACE, all-cause of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization were 0.697 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.362-1.345,  .282), 0.625 (95% CI: 0.179-2.183,  = .461), 0.794 (95% CI: 0.223-2.835,  = .723), and 0.506 (95% CI: 0.196-1.303,  .158), respectively.

In the largest study of its kind, comprising genome-wide data from 6,400 individuals and whole-genome sequences from 1,978 individuals from rural Uganda, we find evidence of geographically correlated fine-scale population substructure. Historically, the ancestry of modern Ugandans was best represented by a mixture of ancient East African pastoralists. We demonstrate the value of the largest sequence panel from Africa to date as an imputation resource. Examining 34 cardiometabolic traits, we show systematic differences in trait heritability between European and African populations, probably reflecting the differential impact of genes and environment. In a multi-trait pan-African GWAS of up to 14,126 individuals, we identify novel loci associated with anthropometric, hematological, lipid, and glycemic traits. We find that several functionally important signals are driven by Africa-specific variants, highlighting the value of studying diverse populations across the region.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, current methods of assessment do not take into account the transduction of sympathetic nerve activity at the level of the vasculature, which is known to vary between individuals. In this study we tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between sympathetic BRS and vascular transduction. In 38 (18 males) healthy adults, continuous measurements of blood pressure, MSNA and superficial femoral artery diameter and blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) were recorded during 10 min of rest. Spontaneous sympathetic BRS was quantified as the relationship between diastolic pressure and MSNA burst incidence. Vascular transduction was quantified by plotting the changes in leg vascular conductance for 10 cardiac cycles following each burst of MSNA, and taking the nadir. In males, sympathetic BRS was inversely related to vascular transduction (r = -0.49; p = 0.04). However, this relationship was not present in females (r = -0.17; p = 0.47). To conclude, an interaction exists between sympathetic BRS and vascular transduction in healthy males, such that males with high sympathetic BRS have low vascular transduction, and vice versa. This may be to ensure that blood pressure is regulated effectively, although further research is needed to explore what mechanisms are involved and examine why this relationship was not apparent in females.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672720>Advanced glycation end products and glycosaminoglycans in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.</a></h1><p>In some patients diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) causes acute endothelial injury and multiorgan failure. Measurement of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) could provide information to help understand the biochemical events associated with poor outcomes in these patients. This study included 37 patients with DKA admitted to an intensive care unit. Blood was collected from these patients during the first day of hospitalization, 24 hours after the first sample, and 72 hours after the first sample when possible. ELISA-based assays were used to measure glucose, hemoglobin A1c, AGE, glycated albumin, and GAG levels in serum. Twenty healthy control subjects with no history of  donated 1 blood sample. Control subjects had a mean age of 36.3±12.1 years; patients with DKA had a mean age of 38.1±18.5 years. Admission laboratory tests in patients with DKA included glucose 546±296 mg/dL, bicarbonate 10.1±5.5 mEq/L, anion gap 31.8±7.8 mEq/L, and creatinine 1.1±1.0 mg/dL. Patients with DKA had significantly higher level glucose and free glycated hemoglobin. Control subjects had significantly higher levels of AGE and glycated albumin. There were no differences in soluble receptor for AGE levels or GAG levels between the control subjects and patients with DKA. Patients with DKA had lower circulating levels of AGE and glycated albumin than control subjects. These results may reflect absorption of these proteins to damaged capillary surfaces or loss of proteins into interstitial spaces secondary to increased endothelial permeability.© American Federation for Medical Research 2019.

However, the tissue-specific factors controlling this dialogue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal colonization are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin. Taking these data together, this work uncovers an unexpected role for MHC class II expression by keratinocytes in the control of homeostatic type 1 responses to the microbiota. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the tissue-specific rules governing the dialogue between a host and its microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675449>Mycobacterium chelonae infection mimicking demodex folliculitis.</a></h1><p>A 69-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a three month history of a diffuse eruption of painful crusted erythematous papulopustular lesions involving the face and neck.

Evaluation of this question led two scientific advisory committees to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAC), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations with the World Health Organization (FAO/WHO), Health Canada, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conclude through 2014 that seafood consumed by pregnant women is likely to benefit the neurocognitive development of their children. The evidence they reviewed included between four and ten studies of seafood consumption during pregnancy that reported beneficial associations. In contrast there are now 29 seafood consumption studies available describing over 100,000 mothers-child pairs and 15 studies describing over 25,000 children who ate seafood. A systematic review of these studies using Nutrition Evaluation Systematic Review methodology is warranted to determine whether recent research corroborates, builds on, or significantly alters the previous conclusions. Studies that evaluate the integrated effects of seafood as a complete food more directly and completely evaluate impacts on neurocognition as compared to studies that evaluate individual nutritients or toxicological constituents in isolation. Here we address how the findings could add to our understanding of whether seafood consumed during pregnancy and early childhood affects neurocognition, including whether such effects are clinically meaningful, lasting, related to amounts consumed, and affected by any neurotoxicants that may be present, particularly mercury, which is present at varying levels in essentially all seafood. We provide the history, context and rationale for reexamining these questions in light of currently available data.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670082>Human epidemiological evidence about the association between air pollution exposure and gestational : Systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that ambient air pollution exposure can increase the risk of type 2  (T2DM) significantly. In consideration of the common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, exposure to air pollution may also increase the risk of gestational  (GDM), but the current evidence was inconsistent and has not well been systematically reviewed. Our goal was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the association between air pollution exposure and GDM.An extensive literature search was conducted in selected electronic databases for related human epidemiological studies published in English language. Summary effect estimates were calculated using random-effect models for a) risk per unit increase in continuous air pollutant concentration and b) risk of high versus low exposure level in individual study if each exposure that had been examined in ≥2 studies. We evaluated the heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and quantified it by I statistic. Publication bias was also evaluated through the funnel plot when sufficient number of studies are available.A total of 11 studies evaluating the association between GDM and exposure to air pollution were identified finally. The summary odds ratio (OR) for incidence of GDM following a 10 μg/m increase in PM exposure during the second trimester was 1.04 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01, 1.09) and in NO during the first trimester was 1.03 (95%CI: 1.00, 1.07) per 10 ppb increase, while for high versus low SO exposure during the second trimester was 1.25 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.53). High heterogeneity among study-specific results in majority of the analyses were observed, and attributed to different exposure assessment methods, populations, study locations, and covariates adjustment. Publication bias cannot be excluded because of the inclusion of small number of studies.The present study supports the evidence that air pollution exposure increases the risk the GDM, albeit the existence of high heterogeneity. Further studies are necessary to elaborate the suggestive associations. These results are of public health significance since worsening air pollution in developing countries has been expected to increase the risk of GDM development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Under rare circumstances, it can transform into hormonally active disease presenting with severe Cushing syndrome. It might often produce diagnostic dilemma with difficult management issue if not thoroughly investigated and subtyped accordingly following surgery. Here, we present a 21-year-old male who initially underwent pituitary adenomectomy for presumed NFA with compressive symptoms. However, he developed recurrent and invasive macroadenoma with severe clinical as well as biochemical hypercortisolism during post-surgical follow-up. Repeat pituitary surgery was carried out urgently as there was significant optic chiasmal compression. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissue obtained on repeat surgery proved it to be an aggressive corticotroph adenoma. Though not cured, he showed marked clinical and biochemical improvement in the immediate postoperative period. Anticipating recurrence from the residual tumor, we referred him for cyber knife radio surgery.Pituitary NFA commonly present with compressive symptoms such as headache and blurred vision. Post-surgical development of Cushing syndrome in such a case could be either drug induced or endogenous. In the presence of recurrent pituitary tumor, ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome indicates CD. Rarely a SCA presenting initially as NFA can transform into an active corticotroph adenoma. Immunohistochemical marker for ACTH in the resected tumor confirms the diagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674018>Physiological assessment of high glucose neurotoxicity in mouse and rat retinal explants.</a></h1><p>One of the tissues of the central nervous system most affected by  is the retina. Despite a growing understanding of the biochemical processes involved in glucose toxicity, little is known about the physiological consequences of chronic high glucose on individual neurons and neuronal circuits. Electroretinogram recordings suggest that retinal bipolar cells, which filter and transmit photoreceptor output to the inner retina, are among the first cells affected by diabetic conditions, and may therefore serve as sensitive early biomarkers for incipient neuronal damage caused in . Here, we comparatively assessed retinal integrity, calcium responses and the electrophysiological profiles of specific bipolar cell types of mouse and rat organotypic retinal explants after one to three weeks in tissue culture, under moderate and high glucose conditions. While the retinal layers of both rodent species displayed a progressively reduced thickness in culture, bipolar cells retained their electrophysiological profiles and remained morphologically identifiable for up to two weeks. Responses to glutamate and endogenous inhibitory responses were routinely observed, indicating that the retinal circuitry remained intact during this period. Significant physiological differences between moderate and high glucose conditions were evident in calcium signals and in the time course of responses to glutamate, but the voltage-gated current profiles of bipolar cells displayed only minor variations. Overall, rat retina appeared slightly more sensitive to high glucose levels compared to mouse. In conclusion, electrophysiological analysis of neuronal function in rodent retinal explants is useful for the study of early damage due to high glucose neurotoxicity.

Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors (iDPP-4s) may exert cardioprotective effects through their pleiotropic actions via glucagon-like peptide 1-dependent mechanisms. In this study, the pharmacological profile of a new iDPP-4 (LASSBio-2124) was investigated in rats with cardiac and renal dysfunction induced by T2DM.T2DM was induced in rats by 2 weeks of a high-fat diet followed by intravenous injection of streptozotocin. Metabolic disturbance and cardiac, vascular, and renal dysfunction were analyzed in the experimental groups.Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 administration after T2DM induction reduced elevated glucose levels to 319.8 ± 13.2 and 279.7 ± 17.8 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2124 also lowered the cholesterol and triglyceride levels from 76.8 ± 8.0 to 42.7 ± 3.2 mg/dL and from 229.7 ± 25.4 to 100.7 ± 17.1 mg/dL, in diabetic rats. Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 reversed the reduction of the plasma insulin level. LASSBio-2124 recovered the increased urinary flow in diabetic animals and reduced 24-h proteinuria from 23.7 ± 1.5 to 13.3 ± 2.8 mg (p < 0.05). It also reduced systolic and diastolic left-ventricular dysfunction in hearts from diabetic rats.The effects of LASSBio-2124 were superior to those of sitagliptin in the cardiovascular systems of T2DM rats. This new prototype showed promise for the avoidance of comorbidities in a T2DM experimental model, and thus may constitute an innovative therapeutic agent for the treatment of these conditions in the clinical field in future.Copyright © 2019.

Participants-patients of an interprofessional primary care team-were over age 18 years, diagnosed with  and hypertension, and had Internet access and one of the following: uncontrolled HbA1c, recent  diagnosis, end-stage/secondary organ damage, or provider referral. The Health TAPESTRY-HC-DM intervention focused on patient health goals/needs, integrating community volunteers, eHealth technologies, interprofessional primary care teams, and system navigation. Pilot outcomes included process measures (recruitment, retention, program participation), perceived program feasibility, benefits and areas for improvement, and risks or safety issues. The primary trial outcome was self-efficacy for managing . There were a number of secondary trial outcomes.Of 425 eligible patients invited, 50 signed consent (11.8%) and 35 completed the program (15 intervention, 20 control). Volunteers ( = 20) met 28 clients in 234 client encounters (home visits, phone calls, electronic messages); 27 reports were sent to the interprofessional team. At 4 months, controlling for baseline, most outcomes were better in the intervention compared to control group; physical activity notably better. The most common goal domains set were physical activity, diet/nutrition, and social connection. Clients felt the biggest impact was motivation toward goal achievement. They struggled with some of the technologies. Several participants perceived that the program was not a good fit, mostly those that felt they were already well-managing their .Health TAPESTRY-HC-DM was feasible; a large-scale randomized controlled trial seems possible. However, further attention needs to be paid to improving recruitment and retention. The intervention was well received, though was a better fit for some participants than others.ClinicalTrials.gov, .

Aim of this study was to identify perioperative risk factors for anastomotic leak and for 60-day morbidity and mortality after ileocolic anastomoses (stapled vs handsewn).This is a STROBE-compliant study. Demographic and surgical data were gathered from patients with an ileocolic anastomosis performed between November 2010 and September 2016 at a tertiary hospital. Anastomoses were performed using standardised techniques. Independent risk factors for anastomotic leak, complications and mortality were assessed.We included 477 patients: 53.7% of the anastomoses were hand sewn and 46.3% stapled. Laterolateral anastomosis was the most common configuration (93.3%). Anastomotic leak was diagnosed in 8.8% of patients and 36 were classified as major anastomotic leak (7.5%). In the multivariate analysis, male sex ( = 0.014, odds ratio, OR, 2.9), arterial hypertension ( = 0.048, OR 2.29) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR 2.4 per litre) were independent risk factors for major anastomotic leak. The overall 60-day complication rate was 27.3%. Male sex (31.3% vs female 22.3%,  = 0.02, OR 1.7),  ( = 0.03 OR 2.0), smoking habit ( = 0.04, OR 1.8) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR 3.3 per litre) were independent risk factors for postoperative morbidity. The 60-day-mortality rate was 3.1% and no significant risk factors were identified.Anastomotic leak after ileocolic anastomosis is a relevant problem. Male sex, arterial hypertension and perioperative transfusions were associated with major anastomotic leak.

Quantitative data on glycaemic parameters was collected pre- and post-initiation of FGM in addition to patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The primary outcome was change in pre- and post-FGM levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C).There was a mean reduction in HbA of -7.29±10.76 mmol/mol (p<0.001, CI 4.94-9.64) sustained to the latest reading. There was also a mean reduction in the number of hypoglycaemic episodes per week of 3.20 (percentage reduction 51.86%, p<0.001, CI 1.64-4.77). A significant improvement in quality of life scores was noted in all five domains of the abbreviated DDS between before and after starting FGM (p<0.001). Key themes highlighted in inductive content analysis include 'life-changing', 'positive experience', and 'convenient'.Flash glucose monitoring is associated with significant improvement in HbA to a mean follow-up of 4.6 months.

Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath is non-invasive and appears as a promising tool. However, data on breath VOC profiles in pediatric patients are limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study and applied quantitative analysis of exhaled VOCs in children suffering from type 1  (T1DM) (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 60). Both groups were matched for sex and age. For breath gas analysis, a very sensitive direct mass spectrometric technique (PTR-TOF) was applied. The duration of disease, the mode of insulin application (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs. multiple daily insulin injection) and long-term metabolic control were considered as classifiers in patients. The concentration of exhaled VOCs differed between T1DM patients and healthy children. In particular, T1DM patients exhaled significantly higher amounts of ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylsulfid, isoprene and pentanal compared to healthy controls (171, 1223, 19.6, 112 and 13.5 ppbV vs. 82.4, 784, 11.3, 49.6, and 5.30 ppbV). The most remarkable differences in concentrations were found in patients with poor metabolic control, i.e. those with a mean HbA above 8%.

CRPC is characterized by alterations in the expression levels of steroidgenic enzymes that enable the tumour to derive potent androgens from circulating adrenal androgen precursors. Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis leads to the localized production of both canonical androgens such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as less well characterized 11-oxygenated androgens, which until recently have been overlooked in the context of CRPC. In this review we discuss the contribution of both canonical and 11-oxygenated androgen precursors to the intratumoral androgen pool in CRPC. We present evidence that CRPC remains androgen dependent and discuss the alterations in steroidogenic enzyme expression and how these affect the various pathways to intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. Finally we summarize the current treatment strategies for targeting adrenal derived androgen biosynthesis.Copyright © 2019.

Due to its pathological similarities to type 2  (T2DM), such as β-amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, inflammation, disordered glucose metabolism, impaired signaling pathways of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), we speculate that AD is another form of brain . Clarifying the relationship between T2DM and AD is important for us to better understand the exact pathological mechanisms of AD. Silibinin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts hepatoprotective, anti- diabetic and neuroprotective effects. Streptozotocin (STZ), which is used to disrupt the insulin signal transduction pathway, could well mimic the sporadic AD models by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Therefore, we selected ICV injection of STZ (ICV-STZ) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silibinin in rats and to make a foundation for further exploring the relationship between AD and T2DM. ICV-STZ obviously caused memory damage, sharply reduced the number of nissl bodies and destroyed morphological structure of hippocampal neuronal cells, while silibinin attenuated the damages. Moreover, silibinin significantly decreased STZ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation (ser404) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, markedly inhibited apoptosis of neurons induced by STZ, and up-regulated insulin signal transduction pathway. Silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect in STZ-treated rats, indicating the potential of silibinin for the treatment of AD patients with T2DM in future.Copyright © 2019.

The subgingival microbiome, a key player in periodontitis pathogenesis, is not well characterized in T2DM population. To better understand whether the subgingival microbiome is different between T2DM and systemically healthy, nondiabetic (ND) subjects, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the subgingival microbiome in T2DM patients (n = 15) compared with ND subjects (n = 16). Using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we investigated the microbiome in the healthy periodontal state, periodontitis state, and resolved state after treatment. We found that in the periodontitis state, the shift in the subgingival microbiome from the healthy state was less prominent in T2DM compared with ND subjects, yet the clinical signs of disease were similar for both. Furthermore, we revealed highly correlated presence of pathogenic species in relative abundance not only in the periodontitis state, but also in the healthy state in T2DM, suggesting an elevated risk of progression to periodontitis in this cohort. We further investigated the functional potentials of the subgingival microbiome and identified a set of microbial marker genes associated with the clinical states. These genes were significantly enriched in 21 pathways, some of which are associated with periodontitis and some potentially link T2DM and periodontitis. This study identified the longitudinal changes of the subgingival microbiome associated with periodontitis in T2DM and suggests that T2DM patients are more susceptible to shifts in the subgingival microbiome toward dysbiosis, potentially due to impaired host metabolic and immune regulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672553>Early intervention with breast milk mesenchymal stem cells attenuates the development of diabetic-induced testicular dysfunction via hypothalamic Kisspeptin/Kiss1r-GnRH/GnIH system in male rats.</a></h1><p>Diabetic male infertility and sub fertility are major complications that may implicate both central and peripheral pathways as well as mechanisms controlling reproduction. This study was an attempt to explore the potential effect of breast milk mesenchymal stem cells (Br-MSCs) as a therapeutic tool for diabetic induced reproductive dysfunction at molecular level. Forty-five adult male Sprague Dawely rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 15); control group, diabetic group, and Br-MSCs treated diabetic group. The homing ability of Br-MSCs in diabetic treated rat testicles was confirmed via semi-quantitative RT- PCR analysis of a human specific Gapdh mRNA expression level. Our result showed that type1 diabetic rats exerted an elevation in blood glucose level and a reduction in body weight, fasting serum insulin, FSH, LH, and total testosterone levels, relative and absolute testicular weights, sperm count, motility, and live ratio. In addition, downregulation in the hypothalamic kisspeptin-GnRH system, HPG axis and testicular steroidogenesis compared to control group was noticed. Moreover, upregulation of testicular proinflammatory and apoptotic markers relative mRNA expression compared to control group was observed. Furthermore, a decrease in testicular tissue antioxidant activity (CAT, SOD, GSH) and an increase in lipid peroxidation (MDA) compared to control group was shown. However, Br-MSCs administration restored or even exceeded the normal physiological tone in most of these parameters to the point where a potential therapeutic role for Br-MSCs in type1diabetic induced infertility can be suggested.Copyright © 2019.

If oral carbohydrate cannot be used, there is a hypothetical risk of severe hypoglycemia. The present article describes the effect on glucose of small doses of subcutaneous glucagon to revert hypoglycemia and prevent severe events in small children with type 1  using a continuous glucose monitoring.We analyzed 4 episodes of impending or mild hypoglycemia in 3 children with type 1  who refused to eat carbohydrates. Using a standard U-100 insulin syringe, children received one "unit" (10 μg) of glucagon subcutaneously for every year of age up to 15 units (150 μg). If the blood glucose did not increase within 30 min, the initial dosage was repeated at that time. Instructions were given by phone from the physician. At the following visit data from continuous glucose monitoring devices, insulin pump and glucometer were downloaded and reviewed retrospectively from the physician.Blood glucose from continuous glucose monitoring after one and 2 h was 127 ± 80 mg/dl and 165 ± 78 mg/dl, respectively. After a glucagon injection, there was a single recurrence of hypoglycemia, requiring another shot. The glucagon was well tolerated, except for nausea, present before the injection. None of the children were taken to our hospital because of concerns for hypoglycemia.Mini-doses of glucagon given subcutaneously were effective and safe in preventing frank or impending hypoglycemia in type 1  children refusing food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669167>Correction to Lancet  Endocrinol 2019; 7: 845-54.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669629>Clinical features, biochemistry and HLA-DRB1 status in children and adolescents with  in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</a></h1><p>Little information is published on  in young people in Bangladesh. We aimed to investigate the demographic, clinical, and biochemical features, and HLA-DRB1 alleles in new cases of  affecting Bangladeshi children and adolescents <22 years of age.The study was conducted at Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation of , Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM) in Dhaka. One hundred subjects aged <22 years at diagnosis were enrolled. Demographic characteristics, clinical information, biochemical parameters (blood glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, and autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) and islet antigen-2 (IA-2A) were measured. High-resolution DNA genotyping was performed for HLA-DRB1.Eighty-four subjects were clinically diagnosed as type 1  (T1D), seven as type 2  (T2D), and nine as fibrocalculous pancreatic disease (FCPD). Of the 84 with T1D, 37 (44%) were males and 47 (56%) females, with median age at diagnosis 13 years (range 1.6-21.7) and peak age at onset 12-15 years. 85% of subjects were assessed within one month of diagnosis and all within eleven months. For subjects diagnosed with T1D, mean C-peptide was 0.46±0.22 nmol/L (1.40±0.59 ng/mL), with 9 (10.7%) IA-2A positive, 22 (26%) GADA positive, and 5 (6%) positive for both autoantibodies. Analysis of HLA-DRB1 genotypes revealed locus-level T1D association (p=6.0E-05); DRB1*04:01 appeared predisposing (p<3.0E-06), and DRB1*14:01 appeared protective (p=1.7E-02).Atypical forms of T1D appear to be more common in young people in Bangladesh than in European populations.

To explain this heterogeneity, we sought to identify a composite signature predictive of insulin secretion, using a collaborative assay evaluation and analysis pipeline that incorporated multiple cellular and serum measures reflecting beta cell health and immune system activity. The ability to predict decline in insulin secretion would be useful for patient stratification for clinical trial enrollment or therapeutic selection. Analytes from 12 qualified assays were measured in shared samples from subjects newly diagnosed with T1D. We developed a computational tool to identify a composite panel associated with decline in insulin secretion over 2 years after diagnosis. The tool employs multiple filtering steps to reduce data dimensionality, incorporates error-estimation techniques including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, and is flexible to assay type, clinical outcome and disease setting. Using this novel analytical tool, we identified a panel of immune markers that, in combination, are highly associated with loss of insulin secretion. The methods used here represent a novel process for identifying combined immune signatures that predict outcomes relevant for complex and heterogeneous diseases like T1D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670807>Is sequential free flap safe in oral cancer reconstruction in the same patient? An outcome and complication analysis.</a></h1><p>Sequential free flap reconstruction in patient with head and neck cancer can provide reliable and effective wound coverage. Only a few studies have reported on the outcome and complications analysis but without consensus on the recipient vessels and flap chosen. Herein, we presented the outcome and analysed the risk factors for complications in sequential free flap reconstruction.Patients who had sequential free tissue transfers due to cancer recurrence, second primary cancer, or secondary correction of the soft tissue contractures and volume deficits were all included. Variables extracted included demographics, comorbidities, free flap characteristics, infection, dehiscence and flap necrosis rates.In total, 40 patients with 92 free flaps were analyzed; 42 initial and 50 sequential free flaps. The most common recipient vessels for sequential flap were contralateral superficial thyroid vessels (68%). The most common flap for both initial and sequential free flap was anterolateral thigh flap (64.3 and 62%). The success rate of sequential free flap was 92.0 compared to 92.9% for initial free flap, which showed no significant difference. Female was independently associated with delayed wound healing with an odds ratio of 90.91 (95% confidence interval 0.001-0.17, P = 0.001), as well as  with an odds ratio of 31.14 (95% confidence interval 2.60-373.19, P = 0.007). Sequential free flap was not a risk factor for any complication.Sequential free flap is a reliable method for head and neck surgery without more complication rate comparing to initial free flap reconstruction. More attentions should be paid on patients with preferential risk for certain complications.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Insulin, which is produced by β-pancreatic cells, is a chief orchestrator of glucose metabolism, regulating its consumption within cells, which leads to energy generation or storage as glycogen. Abnormally lower insulin secretion from β-cells, insulin insensitivity, and insulin tolerance lead to higher plasma glucose levels, resulting in metabolic complications.

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these surgeries via an ideal risk assessment model, and reduce risks via applying some findings (for instance, perioperative beta-blockers). There are some risk assessment systems, but these have generally not been verified for patients with gynecologic cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of surgery for gynecological oncologic patients and suggest an easy risk assessment model and risk reduction by applying our findings.We retrospectively analyzed 258 gynecologic patients with cancer. Age, diagnosis, staging, performance scale, metoprolol use, heart, renal , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease, , operation type and length, carcinoma antigen 125, ascites, albumin, surgical procedure, hospitalization length, and complications were recorded.Of the 258 patients, 173 patients (67.1%) had no complications, 43 patients (16.7%) had one and 42 patients (16.3%) had two or more complications. The most common complication was the acid-base imbalance (14%), followed by urinary tract infection (9.7%). Parameters associated with complications were performance status, ascites, operating length, metoprolol use, and upper abdominal surgery. In our proposed scoring model with a total score range 0-23, cut-off value points for both the presence and rate of complications was found as >5.In gynecological patients with cancer, the addition of metoprolol use and upper abdominal surgery within preoperative risk assessment evaluation parameters are significantly effective in predicting the rate and severity of complications. Moreover, we have suggested a simple, practical, and convenient scoring model for this evaluation.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670385>Risk factors for neonatal brachial plexus palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>To provide a comprehensive update on the most prevalent, significant risk factors for neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP).Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant publications up to March 2019.

We know that the size and distribution of the ossified lesions in patients with OPLL are different in each case. However, the characteristics of the patients with radiologically severe cervical OPLL remain unknown.The participants of our study were symptomatic patients with cervical OPLL who were diagnosed by standard radiographs of the cervical spine. Whole-spine CT data and demographic data such as age and sex were obtained from 20 institutions belonging to the Japanese Multicenter Research Organization for Ossification of the Spinal Ligament. According to the number of the levels involved by OPLL, we stratified the patients into two subgroups: severe group (S-group) and non-severe group (NS-group) to delineate the characteristics of radiologically severe patients with cervical OPLL. We also evaluated the most compressed level and the degree of occupying ratio of cervical spinal canal by OPLL at the most compressed level.A total of 234 patients with a mean age of 65 years were recruited. The S-group consisted of 48 patients (21%, 12 females and 36 males) and the NS-group consisted of 92 patients (79%, 22 females and 70 males). The mean age of males in the S-group (68 years old) was significantly higher than that of males in the NS-group (64 years old); however there was no significant difference in the mean age in females between the S-group (69 years old) and the NS-group (66 years old). No significant difference of body mass index, ossification of the nuchal ligament-positivity and presence of  were found between the S- and the NS-group.It is likely that the manner of extension of cervical OPLL is different between male and female patients.Copyright © 2019.

Cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals worldwide. The rate of cardiovascular events increases after 65 years in men and after 75 years in women. Myocardial infarction and stroke are the leading disorders caused by atherosclerosis, that lead to death or functional incapacity. Elderly people have a greater risk to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The incidence and prevalence of atherosclerosis increase with age and the number of cardiovascular events is higher in elderly patients. The most efficient treatment against atherosclerosis is the treatment with statins, that has been shown to decrease the risk both of stroke and coronary artery disease in all age groups. The advantages of the treatment become evident after at least one year of treatment. Primary prevention is the most important way of preventing cardiovascular disease in elderly individuals, by promoting a healthy lifestyle and reducing the risk factors. Secondary prevention after a stroke or myocardial infarction includes mandatory a statin, to diminish the risk of a recurrent cardiovascular event. The possible side effects of statin therapy are , myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity. The side effects of the treatment are more likely to occur in elderly patients, due to their multiple associated comorbidities and drugs that may interact with statins. In elderly people, the benefits and disadvantages of the treatment with statins should be put in balance, especially in those receiving high doses of statins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673511>Providing Dignified Palliative Care Services in Liberia.</a></h1><p>Liberia faces a critical shortage of palliative care services, particularly for persons with advanced-stage HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, , and cancers. Access to healthcare services is especially limited in rural areas, along with a lack of supportive social and economic resources. Home of Dignity (HoD) Health Center was established in 2013 in Yarbah's Town to fill a last-option palliative care gap. The mission emphasizes patient wellbeing and worth. HoD integrates health, agriculture, and education on-site for immediate medical needs, broader sustainable development, and reducing disease-associated stigma in local communities.We aimed to describe the Center's integrated approach and conduct a descriptive analysis of the HoD patient population.We reviewed patient characteristics (sex, age distribution, mobility status, and CD4 count on arrival) and outcomes (survival rate and community reintegration) for patients with HIV seeking care at the Center between 2013-2017.Of 182 patients (ages 3 months-50 years), over half arrived to the facility bedridden and over 82% had CD4 counts between <100-350. Of the 182 patients, 66% survived, 27% died, and 7% were lost to follow-up. Of surviving patients, 90% were successfully reintegrated into their communities. The clinic also served over 365 chronically ill patients that had been rejected by other health providers during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak.The Center is providing last-option palliative care services in the country. As a trusted healthcare center, patients also seek care for acute conditions, resulting in unanticipated resource demands. HoD's experience underscores the need for development of training programs for medical professionals, supply chains, community outreach, and resourcing channels to ensure adequate and sustainable service provision for hospice and palliative care services and reduce stigma in the country.

We have measured 25(OH)D concentration, markers of inflammation including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) by using standard methods.We stratified control and T2DM groups by 25(OH)D concentration and it indicates that in severe deficiency and sufficiency category IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL were significantly different while in moderate deficiency category only MDA was significantly different, among control and T2DM groups. In an insufficiency category, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MDA, and Ox-LDL were significantly different among control and T2DM groups. Correlation analysis indicates a negative correlation of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL among total subjects. Further, logistics regression analysis demonstrated a significant association of different categories of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL before and after adjustment to body mass index and waist to hip ratio.This study suggest that vitamin D may have significant implications in the prevention of inflammation and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut microbiota to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut microbiota and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced  risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

We evaluated how the clinical phenotype of patients initiating GLP-1RA changed from 2010 to 2018.This was a retrospective study conducted at six  outpatient clinics in Northeast Italy. We collected data of T2D patients who initiated new GLP-1RA between 2010 and 2018. We recorded baseline characteristics, including demographics, anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, lipid profile, liver enzymes, renal function and concomitant medications. We recorded updated HbA1c and body weight at follow-up.There were 83,116 T2D patients from a general population of ~ 1,380,000 inhabitants. Among 6167 cases of GLP-1RA initiation, 5408 were analyzed after excluding intra-class switchers. Prescription of GLP-1RA increased exponentially, and the change in the type of GLP-1RA reflected waves of their entering the market. From 2010 to 2018, there were significant increases in baseline age,  duration and prevalence of male sex, of cardiovascular disease and of insulin users. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels decreased concomitantly with increasing use of medications for the control of cardiovascular risk. Baseline average HbA1c (8.3% [67 mmol/mol]) and BMI (34 kg/m) and their improvement after GLP-1RA initiation did not change over time.Despite the early positioning of GLP-1RA in T2D treatment algorithms, GLP-1RA have been prescribed in patients with progressively more advanced disease stage and especially in the presence of cardiovascular disease.

Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has shown a promising anti-diabetic effect in WS treatment in both animal models and in human patients. Since previous research has tended to focus on investigation of the WS first symptom, , the aim of the present study was to examine liraglutide effect on WS-associated neurodegeneration. We took 9-month-old Wfs1 knock-out (KO) animals that already had developed glucose intolerance and treated them with liraglutide for 6 months. Our research results indicate that 6-month liraglutide treatment reduced neuroinflammation and ameliorated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the inferior olive of the aged WS rat model. Liraglutide treatment also protected retinal ganglion cells from cell death and optic nerve axons from degeneration. According to this, the results of the present study provide novel insight that GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has a neuroprotective effect in the WS rat model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672578>Amlexanox reversed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through IKKε inhibition of hepatic stellate cell.</a></h1><p>Amlexanox, an inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase epsilon (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1), was demonstrated to be effective in  and obesity. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs.

The second aim of our study was to assess the ability of WG, WC, prepregnancy, and gestational BMI with special reference to their cut-off points on predicting the risk of GDM in pregnant women in Turkey.A total of 261 women who underwent screening for GDM with the 75-g glucose tolerance test (GTT) between 24 and 28 gestational weeks were included. According to the 75-g oral GTT results, women were classified into two groups: the GDM group and non-GDM group. The data collected included age, parity, plasma glucose level for fasting, 1- and 2-h tests, WC, prepregnancy and gestational BMI, prepregnancy weight, WG during pregnancy, gestational age at birth, and birth weight.WC at 20-24 weeks of gestation, prepregnancy BMI, and gestational BMI had a predictive capacity for GDM. According to our results, optimal cut-off points for the best predictive value of GDM were WC of 100 cm with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 70%, prepregnancy BMI of 25 kg/m with a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 76%, and gestational BMI of 28.3 kg/m with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 77.4%.The measurement of prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC may be useful in predicting the risk of GDM. Pregnant women with increased prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC measurements may be susceptible to the development of GDM.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670357>A label-free fluorescent sensor based on silicon quantum dots-MnO nanosheets for the detection of α-glucosidase and its inhibitor.</a></h1><p>α-Glucosidase and its inhibitors play a key role in diagnosis and treatment of . In the present work, we established a facile, sensitive and selective fluorescence method based on silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) and MnO2 nanosheets for the determination of α-glucosidase and one of its inhibitors acarbose. The fluorescence of SiQDs was greatly quenched by MnO2 nanosheets due to the inner filter effect. α-Glucosidase could easily catalyze the hydrolysis of l-ascorbic acid-2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl (AAG) to produce ascorbic acid (AA), which could reduce MnO2 nanosheets to Mn2+, resulting in dramatic recovery of the fluorescence of SiQDs. The proposed sensing platform could provide a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of SiQDs and the concentration of α-glucosidase in the range of 0.02-2.5 U mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.007 U mL-1. In addition, the sensing platform could be used for α-glucosidase inhibition. Acarbose was one of the most common and typical inhibitors, and this sensing platform can be utilized to detect acarbose in the range of 1-1000 μM. The developed fluorescence method was successfully validated for the determination of α-glucosidase in human serum samples.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671667>Methods and Guidelines for Measurement of Glucagon in Plasma.</a></h1><p>Glucagon circulates in concentrations in the low picomolar range, which is demanding regarding the sensitivity of the methods for quantification applied. In addition, the differential and tissue specific proteolytic processing of the glucagon precursor and the presence in of several glucagon-like sequences, not only in the precursor of glucagon, but also in a number of other peptides of the glucagon-secretin family of peptides, put special demands on the specificity of the assays. Finally, experience has shown that unspecific interference of plasma components has presented additional problems. All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian metabolism, but its precise physiological role in glucose and lipid metabolism and in metabolic disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error.

The cell types and the precursor cells of PVAT appear to be different according to their location, with the component cell type including white, brown, and beige adipocytes. PVAT releases a panel of adipokines and cytokines that maintain vascular homeostasis, but it also has the ability of intervention in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic plaques development and in the vascular tone modulation. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT as a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of ischemic coronary disease, hypertension, obesity, and .

We therefore designed this study to firstly determine the association between hyperglycemia and short term and longer term outcomes in patients presenting with ACS and secondly evaluate the prognostic role of , body mass index (BMI) and the novel biomarker Cyr61 on outcomes.The prospective Special Program University Medicine-Acute Coronary Syndrome (SPUM-ACS) cohort enrolled 2168 patients with ACS between December 2009 and October 2012, of which 2034 underwent PCI (93.8%). Patients were followed up for 12 months. Events were independently adjudicated by three experienced cardiologists. Participants were recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Switzerland: Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and Bern. Participants presenting with acute coronary syndromes and who underwent coronary angiography were included in the analysis. Patients were grouped according to history of  (or HbA1c greater than 6%), baseline blood sugar level (BSL; < 6, 6-11.1 and > 11.1 mmol/L) and body mass index (BMI). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary endpoint, revascularisations, bleeding events (BARC classification) and cerebrovascular events (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke or TIA).Patients with hyperglycemia, i.e. BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, had higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine kinase (CK), higher heart rates and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. At 30 days and 12 months, those with BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L had more MACE and death compared to those with BSL < 6.0 mmol/L or 6.0-11.1 mmol/L (HR-ratio 4.78 and 6.6; p < 0.001). The novel biomarker Cyr61 strongly associated with high BSL and STEMI and was independently associated with 1 year outcomes (HR 2.22; 95% CI 1.33-3.72; Tertile 3 vs. Tertile 1).In this large, prospective, independently adjudicated cohort of in all comers ACS patients undergoing PCI, both a history of  and elevated entry glucose was associated with inflammation and increased risk of MACE both at short and long-term.

Mutations in at least 14 different genes are responsible for various MODY subtypes. Heterozygous mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha () gene are responsible for the MODY3 subtype, which is a common subtype of MODY in different studied populations. To date, more than 450 different variants of this gene have been reported as disease causing for MODY3. This study was carried out to evaluate  mutations in Iranian diabetic families fulfilling MODY criteria.Polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were performed. All the ten exons of the  gene were sequenced in ten families, followed by cosegregation analysis and  evaluation. Computational protein modeling was accomplished for the identified mutation.MODY3 was confirmed in two large families by detecting a mutation (p.G253E) in coding regions of . Compound heterozygous state for two common variants in  (p.I27 L and p.S487N) was detected in affected members of 5 families, and in one family, a rare benign variant in the coding sequence for Kozak sequence was detected.

Herein we synthesized benzoboroxole-containing multi-armed poly(ethylene glycol) amphiphilic dendrimers sensitive to both pH and glucose. The multi-branched structure of dendrimer facilitated its self-assembly into micelles in aqueous solution and exhibited good encapsulation of insulin just by simply mixing with insulin solution. The insulin loaded micelles were stable under strong acidic condition and showed glucose-responsive insulin release at physiological pH. The reversible binding between benzoboroxole and glucose can effectively regulate the disassembly of micelles and insulin release rate, which in turn stabilizes blood sugar fluctuations. Utilizing a mouse model of type 1 , it was demonstrated that these insulin loaded micelles could successfully control the blood glucose levels under a normoglycemic state and avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, this smart delivery system shows great potential to significantly improve the effect of oral protein therapy.Copyright © 2019.

We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty acid oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

We examined the association between CKD and survival after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-defibrillator tachyarrhythmia therapies.We compared overall survival after appropriate shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing in 439 CRT-defibrillator recipients with LVEF ≤35%, non-right bundle-branch block QRS pattern, and QRS duration > 130 ms according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at implant, including 31 patients with GFR ≤30, 164 patients with GFR 31-60, and 244 patients with GFR > 60. At least 1 shock occurred in 302 patients (24 with GFR ≤30, 102 with GFR 31-60, and 176 with GFR > 60). Serial echocardiograms were also compared.Patients were followed 64 months (IQR 29-94) after implant, including 32 months (IQR 12-61) after first therapy. Time to first therapy or shock was similar across GFR groups. However, survival after first therapy declined directly with declining GFR (p < 0.001), with median post-shock survival 90 days for GFR ≤30 (95% CI 0-233), 612 days (95% CI 365-859) for GFR 31-60, and 1672 days (95% CI 1396-1948) for GFR > 60. Declining GFR category, ischemic heart disease, , and increasing age were independently associated with increased post-shock mortality. Echocardiographic response was similar across GFR groups and was not associated with post-therapy survival.Survival after appropriate tachyarrhythmia therapies, particularly shocks, is attenuated in patients with GFR ≤30. This raises concern over potential lack of survival benefit conferred by CRT-defibrillators versus CRT-pacemakers in this population. This article is protected by copyright.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669388>Pharmacological potential of novel agonists for FFAR4 on islet and enteroendocrine cell function and glucose homeostasis.</a></h1><p>To investigate the metabolic effects of FFAR4-selective agonists on islet and enteroendocrine cell hormone release and the combined therapeutic effectiveness with DPP-IV inhibitors.Insulinotropic activity and specificity of FFAR4 agonists were determined in clonal pancreatic BRIN-BD11 cells. Expression of FFAR4 was assessed by qPCR and western blotting following agonist treatment in BRIN-BD11 cells and by immunohistochemistry in mouse islets. Acute in-vivo effects of agonists was investigated after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral administration in lean and HFF-obese diabetic mice.GSK137647 (10-10 M) and Compound-A (10-10 M) stimulated insulin secretion at 5.6mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) and 16.7mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) glucose in BRIN-BD11 cells, with no cytotoxicity effects as assessed by MTT. FFAR4 antagonist (AH-7614) abolished the insulintropic effect of GSK137647 (p<0.05-p<0.001), whilst FFAR1 antagonist (GW1100) had no effect. Incubation of BRIN-BD11 cells with GSK137647 and Compound-A increased FFAR4 (p<0.01) gene expression at 16.7 mM glucose, with a corresponding increase in FFAR4 (p<0.01) protein concentrations. FFAR4 upregulation was attenuated under normoglycaemic conditions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated co-localisation of FFAR4 and insulin in mouse islets. Orally administered GSK137647 or Compound-A (0.1µmol/kgBW) improved glucose tolerance (p<0.001), increased plasma insulin (p<0.001), GLP-1 (p<0.05), GIP (p<0.05) and induced satiety (p<0.001) in HFF mice, with glucose-lowering effects enhanced in combination with DPP-IV inhibitor (Sitagliptin) (p<0.05).Specific FFAR4 agonism improves glucose tolerance through insulin and incretin secretion, with enhanced DPP-IV inhibition in combination with Sitagliptin.These findings have for the first time demonstrated that selective FFAR4 activation regulates both islet and enteroendocrine hormone function with agonist combinational therapy, presenting a promising strategy for the treatment of type-2-.Copyright © 2019.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT.

Mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with βA1-40 (400 pmol/mouse) once, followed by treatment with fenofibrate (300 mg/kg), pioglitazone (30 mg/kg),or both. After 21 days of daily treatment, memory impairment and cognitive function were evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM), Y-maze and object recognition tests. On the 22nd day, mice were sacrificed, and their hippocampi were dissected to determine the levels of α- and β-secretase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα and β), Wnt and β-catenin. Significant memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction were observed in the mouse model group. This finding was associated with a significant increase in α- and β-secretase levels and a significant decrease in Wnt, β-catenin, and PPARα and β levels. Neuronal damage was also evident after histopathological examination. Treatment with fenofibrate, pioglitazone and their combination resulted in a significant improvement in the behavioural and neurochemical changes induced by βA injection. The present findings indicate that the combined administration of fenofibrate and pioglitazone was more effective than monotherapy in ameliorating the behavioural, neurochemical and histopathological changes in amyloidogenesis model mice and provide a promising therapeutic approach in the management of Alzheimer's disease complicated by  and hypercholesterolemia.Copyright © 2018.

In this study, we observed that the expression of IF1 was up-regulated in response to electrical pulse stimulation of skeletal muscle cells and in exercized mice and healthy men. IF1 stimulates glucose uptake  AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and primary cultured myoblasts. Reactive oxygen species and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) function in the upstream and downstream of AMPK, respectively, in IF1-mediated glucose uptake. In diabetic animal models, the administration of recombinant IF1 improved glucose tolerance and down-regulated blood glucose level. In addition, IF1 inhibits ATP hydrolysis by β-F1-ATPase in plasma membrane, thereby increasing extracellular ATP and activating the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, ultimately leading to glucose uptake. Thus, we suggest that IF1 is a novel myokine and propose a mechanism by which AMPK and Akt contribute independently to IF1-mediated improvement of glucose tolerance impairment. These results demonstrate the importance of IF1 as a potential antidiabetic agent.-Lee, H. J., Moon, J., Chung, I., Chung, J. H., Park, C., Lee, J. O., Han, J. A., Kang, M. J., Yoo, E.

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2  affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2  with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

After excluding individuals aged <64 years or with a history of , 272 non-diabetic older adults (116 men, 156 women) met the inclusion criteria. According to the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, the participants were divided into two groups; that is, the insulin resistance group (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ≥1.73) and non-insulin resistance group (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance <1.73). Muscle mass (lower limb, upper limb, appendicular and trunk) and muscle strength (grip strength and knee extension torque) were measured and divided by the weight, and then multiplied by 100 to calculate the weight ratio (%). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of each muscle index for risk of insulin resistance was calculated separately for both men and women.Lower limb muscle mass (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.92 in men; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.96 in women, respectively) and appendicular muscle mass (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.94 in men; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.95 in women, respectively), but not other muscle indexes, were associated with risk of insulin resistance, after adjusting for age, body mass index, highly sensitive C-reacting protein and smoking habits.Lower limb muscle mass of non-diabetic older adults is independently related to insulin resistance.

However, the molecular events linking the healthy food pattern to reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease are unknown. Our aim was to identify plasma metabolites associated with the HCFP and test if such metabolites predict cardiometabolic disease and mortality.Using liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry, 112 plasma metabolites were measured in 3236 participants without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and  from the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer study. Metabolites associated with the HCFP were identified using multivariable adjusted linear regressions followed by Bonferroni correction. The healthy dietary biomarkers were subsequently related to risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality during long-term follow-up with multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.During a median follow-up time of 21.4 years, 603 participants developed CVD, 362 developed  and 843 participants died. Five healthy dietary biomarkers were associated with the HCFP at baseline (p<0.0004) and four predicted at least one of the studied end points (p<0.05). Ergothioneine was the metabolite most strongly connected to the HCFP and was associated with a lower risk of coronary disease (HR per 1 SD increment of ergothioneine, HR=0.85, p=0.01), cardiovascular mortality (HR=0.79, p=0.002) and overall mortality (HR=0.86, p=4e-5).We identified that higher ergothioneine was an independent marker of lower risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality, which potentially can be induced by a specific healthy dietary intake.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.
