Overexpression of COX-2 has been found in a majority of breast carcinomas, and has also been associated with increased severity and the development of the metastasis. Our lab recently demonstrated that COX-2 can also metabolize dihomo-γ- (DGLA, a precursor of ω-6 arachidonic ) to produce an anti- byproduct, 8-hydroxyoctanoic  (8-HOA) that can inhibit growth and migration of  and pancreatic  cells. We thus tested whether our strategy of knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, the key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic ) in breast  cells overexpressing COX-2 can also be used to promote 8-HOA formation, thereby suppressing  growth, migration, and invasion.SiRNA and shRNA transfection were used to knock down D5D expression in MDA-MB 231 and 4 T1 cells (human and mouse breast  cell lines expressing high COX-2, respectively). Colony formation assay, FITC Annexin V/PI double staining, wound healing and transwell assay were used to assess the effect of our strategy on inhibition of  growth, migration, and invasion. GC/MS was used to measure endogenous 8-HOA, and western blotting was performed to evaluate the altered key protein expressions upon the treatments.We demonstrated that D5D knockdown licenses DGLA to inhibit growth of breast  cells via promoting formation of 8-HOA that can inhibit histone deacetylase and activate cell apoptotic proteins, such as procaspase 9 and PARP. Our strategy can also significantly inhibit  migration and invasion, associated with altered expression of MMP-2/- 9, E-cadherin, vimentin and snail. In addition, D5D knockdown and DGLA supplementation greatly enhanced the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil on breast  growth and migration.Consistent to our previous studies on  and pancreatic , here we demonstrate again that the high level of COX-2 in breast  cells can be capitalized on inhibiting  growth and migration. The outcome of this translational research could guide us to develop new anti- strategy and/or to improve current chemotherapy for breast  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450226>Human carbonyl reductase 1 participating in intestinal first-pass drug metabolism is inhibited by fatty acids and acyl-CoAs.</a></h2><p>Human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, reduces a variety of carbonyl compounds including endogenous isatin, prostaglandin E and 4-oxo-2-nonenal. It is also a major non-cytochrome P450 enzyme in the phase I metabolism of carbonyl-containing drugs, and is highly expressed in the intestine. In this study, we found that long-chain fatty acids and their CoA ester derivatives inhibit CBR1. Among saturated fatty acids, myristic, palmitic and stearic acids were inhibitory, and stearic  was the most potent (IC 9µM). Unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, elaidic, γ- and docosahexaenoic acids) and acyl-CoAs (palmitoyl-, stearoyl- and oleoyl-CoAs) were more potent inhibitors (IC 1.0-2.5µM), and showed high inhibitory selectivity to CBR1 over its isozyme CBR3 and other SDR superfamily enzymes (DCXR and DHRS4) with CBR activity. The inhibition by these fatty acids and acyl-CoAs was competitive with respect to the substrate, showing the K values of 0.49-1.2µM. Site-directed mutagenesis of the substrate-binding residues of CBR1 suggested that the interactions between the fatty acyl chain and the enzyme's Met141 and Trp229 are important for the inhibitory selectivity. We also examined CBR1 inhibition by oleic  in cellular levels: The fatty  effectively inhibited CBR1-mediated 4-oxo-2-nonenal metabolism in  DLD1 cells and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin in the drug-resistant gastric  MKN45 cells that highly express CBR1. The results suggest a possible new food-drug interaction through inhibition of CBR1-mediated intestinal first-pass drug metabolism by dietary fatty acids.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been reported to possess tumoricidal action, but the exact mechanism of their action is not clear.In the present study, we studied the effect of various n-6 and n-3 fatty acids on the survival of the colon cancer cells LoVo and RKO and evaluated the possible involvement of a mitochondrial pathway in their ability to induce apoptosis.It was observed that n-3 α-, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  (ALA, EPA and DHA respectively) and n-6 linoleic , gamma- and arachidonic  (LA, GLA and AA respectively) induced apoptosis of the colon cancer cells LoVo and RKO at concentrations above 120 μM (p < 0.01 compared to control). The semi-differentiated colon cancer cell line RKO was more sensitive to the cytotoxic action of PUFAs compared to the undifferentiated colon cancer cell line LoVo. PUFA-treated cells showed an increased number of lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. PUFA-induced apoptosis of LoVo and RKO cells is mediated through a mitochondria-mediated pathway as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of ROS, accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, decreased ATP level and increase in the Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio.PUFAs induced apoptosis of colon cancer cells through a mitochondrial dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584980>Specific delivery of delta-5-desaturase siRNA via RNA nanoparticles supplemented with dihomo-γ- for  suppression.</a></h2><p>We have previously demonstrated that DGLA treatment along with Delta-5-Desaturase (D5D) siRNA in various types of  cells enhances the formation of 8-HOA from COX-2-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation, which in turn inhibits  cell growth and migration. However, delivery of naked siRNA remains a formidable challenge due to its "off-target" effect. In this study, we employed RNA nanotechnology for specific delivery of D5D-siRNA to xenograft  tumors using 3WJ RNA nanoparticles. When a targeting module, i.e., the EpCAM aptamer, was incorporated, the 3WJ pRNA nanoparticles were able specifically deliver D5D siRNA to human  HCA-7 cells both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in significant downregulation of D5D expression. Co-treatment with DGLA in combination with 3WJ-EpCAM-siRNA induced a higher DGLA/AA ratio and enhanced formation of 8-HOA at a threshold level, and in HCA-7 tumor-bearing mice, induced significant tumor suppression. We further confirmed that 8-HOA formation, promoted by COX-2-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation, inhibited HDAC and consequently induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Therefore, the 3WJ RNA nanoparticle system holds great promise as a suitable therapeutic delivery platform for  therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the microsphere size, as well as the high hydrogel swelling degree at pH 7.4, and the omega-3 PUFA loading efficiency of both the materials suggested their suitability for colorectal delivery. Moreover, the antioxidant efficiency of the xanthan gum based materials suggests their ability to protect the omega-PUFA cargo. We demonstrated that α- (ALA 18:3ω-3) carried by the materials increased significantly its ability to reduce colorectal  cell growth in vitro. On the contrary, docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6ω-3) enclosed in the hydrogel formulation did not enhance its already high anti-neoplastic potential. The improved anti-neoplastic efficacy of ALA enclosed in both the xanthan gum-based formulations further supports the hypothesis of a potential use of this omega-3 PUFA as a suitable and more sustainable alternative to the fish-derived DHA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Among them conjugated fatty acids are of great interest. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), which exert a multidirectional health-benefiting influence, and conjugated  acids (CLnA, super CLA) are examples of this group of fatty acids. CLnA are a group of positional and geometric isomers of octadecatrienoic  (C18:3), which possess double bonds at positions 9, 11, 13 or 8, 10, 12 of their chain. Some vegetable oils are rich sources of CLnA, e.g. bitter melon oil (from Momordica charantia seeds) and pomegranate oil (from Punica granatum seeds). The aim of this paper was to present information concerning natural sources and health-promoting activities of conjugated  acids. The presented data reveal that conjugated  acids may be very useful in prevention and treatment of many diseases, especially diabetes, arteriosclerosis ,  and cancers (mammary, prostate and colon cancer). Among many potential mechanisms of their action, the fact that some CLnA are converted by oxidoreductases into CLA is very important. It seems to be very reasonable to conduct research concerning the possibility of CLnA use in prevention of many diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101738>Knockdown of delta-5-desaturase promotes the anti- activity of dihomo-γ- and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in  cells expressing COX-2.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase (COX), commonly overexpressed in  cells, is a major lipid peroxidizing enzyme that metabolizes polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3s and ω-6s). The COX-catalyzed free radical peroxidation of arachidonic  (ω-6) can produce deleterious metabolites (e.g. 2-series prostaglandins) that are implicated in  development. Thus, COX inhibition has been intensively investigated as a complementary therapeutic strategy for . However, our previous study has demonstrated that a free radical-derived byproduct (8-hydroxyoctanoic ) formed from COX-catalyzed peroxidation of dihomo-γ- (DGLA, the precursor of arachidonic ) can inhibit  cell growth. We thus hypothesize that the commonly overexpressed COX in  (~90% of  patients) can be taken advantage to suppress cell growth by knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, a key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic ). In addition, D5D knockdown along with DGLA supplement may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. After knocking down D5D in HCA-7 colony 29 cells and HT-29 cells (human  cell lines with high and low COX levels, respectively), the antitumor activity of DGLA was significantly enhanced along with the formation of a threshold range (~0.5-1.0μM) of 8-hydroxyoctanoic . In contrast, DGLA treatment did not inhibit cell growth when D5D was not knocked down and only limited amount of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  was formed. D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment also enhanced the cytotoxicities of various chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil, regorafenib, and irinotecan, potentially through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. p53 and caspase 9. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the overexpressed COX in  cells can be utilized in suppressing  cell growth. This finding may provide a new option besides COX inhibition to optimize  therapy. The outcome of this translational research will guide us to develop a novel ω-6-based diet-care strategy in combination with current chemotherapy for  prevention and treatment.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567534>Dihomo-γ- inhibits xenograft tumor growth in mice bearing shRNA-transfected HCA-7 cells targeting delta-5-desaturase.</a></h2><p>We previously demonstrated that knockdown of delta-5-desaturase via siRNA transfection together with dihomo-γ- supplementation inhibited  cell growth and migration, by promoting the production of the anti- byproduct 8-hydroxyoctanoic  from Cyclooxygenase-2-catalyzed dihomo-γ- peroxidation. Here, we extend our study to investigate the effects of delta-5-desaturase-knockdown and the resulting intensified dihomo-γ- peroxidation in xenograft tumor mice model.Four-week old nude mice bearing the human  cell HCA-7/C29 vs. its delta-5-desaturase knockdown analog (via shRNA transfection) were subject to 4-week treatments of: vehicle control, dihomo-γ- supplementation, 5-Fluorouracil, and combination of dihomo-γ- and 5-Fluorouracil. Tumor growth was monitored during the treatment. At the endpoint, the mice were euthanized and the tumor tissues were collected for further mechanism analysis.Delta-5-desaturase knockdown (shRNA) together with dihomo-γ- supplementation increased 8-hydroxyoctanoic  production to a threshold level in xenograft tumors, which consequently induced p53-dependent apoptosis and reduced tumors significantly. The promoted 8-hydroxyoctanoic  formation was also found to suppress the tumors' metastatic potential via regulating MMP-2 and E-cadherin expressions. In addition, our in vivo data showed that delta-5-desaturase knockdown along with dihomo-γ- supplementation resulted in anti-tumor effects comparable to those of 5-Fluorouracil.We have demonstrated that our paradigm-shifting strategy of knocking down delta-5-desaturase and taking advantage of overexpressed Cyclooxygenase-2 in tumor cells can be used for  suppression.

In vitro, LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production was significantly inhibited by MBF extracts via suppressing the expression of proinflammatory molecules, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-β) and IL-6. Particularly, a dose-dependent inhibition on LPS-induced inflammatory responses was observed following treatment with MBF dichloromethane extract (MBF-DE), in which linoleic  and ethyl linolenate were identified as two active compounds. Moreover, we elucidated that MBF-DE attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by blocking activation of both NF-κB/p65 and pERK/MAPK pathways. In vivo, DSS-induced acute  was significantly ameliorated in MBF-fed mice as gauged by weight loss, colon morphology and histological damage. In addition, MBF-fed MUC2(-/-) mice displayed significant decrease in intestinal tumor and inflammation incidence compared to control diet-fed group.

While their role in the development of coronary heart disease is broadly accepted, a potential impact of these fatty acids on  carcinogenesis is still under discussion. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by inhibiting the translation of target mRNAs. We investigated the effect of 16 different C 18 fatty  isomers on the expression of 84 -related miRNAs in the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 by using a qRT-PCR array. 66 of these 84 miRNAs were deregulated by at least one fatty , however, there was no trans-specific impact on miRNA expression as the corresponding cis isomer of a given fatty  generally had comparable effects on the miRNA expression profile. The most pronounced effects were observed for hsa-miR-146a-5p, which was upregulated by four of the 16 investigated fatty acids, and hsa-miR-32-5p, which was strongly downregulated by five fatty acids. As hsa-miR-32-5p was described to target genes being involved in the regulation of apoptosis, the effect of α-eleostearic  on the expression of the apoptosis-associated genes BCL2L11, BCL-2, and BCL-XL was examined. The qPCR results indicate that fatty -mediated downregulation of hsa-miR-32-5p is accompanied by a downregulation of BCL-2 and BCL2L11 mRNA whereas BCL-XL was shown to be simultaneously upregulated. In conclusion, our data indicate that several fatty acids are able to regulate miRNA expression of human  cells.

Here, this novel research finding is extended to pancreatic  growth, as COX-2 is also commonly overexpressed in pancreatic . The pancreatic  cell line, BxPC-3 (with high COX-2 expression and mutated p53), was used to assess not only the inhibitory effects of the enhanced formation of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  from cellular COX-2-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation but also its potential synergistic and/or additive effect on current chemotherapy drugs. This work demonstrated that, by inducing DNA damage through inhibition of histone deacetylase, a threshold level of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  achieved in DGLA-treated and D5D-knockdown BxPC-3 cells subsequently induce  cell apoptosis. Furthermore, it was shown that a combination of D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment could also significantly sensitize BxPC-3 cells to various chemotherapy drugs, likely via a p53-independent pathway through downregulating of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2) and activating pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., caspase 3, -9). This study reinforces the supposition that using commonly overexpressed COX-2 for molecular targeting, a strategy conceptually distinct from the prevailing COX-2 inhibition strategy used in  treatment, is an important as well as viable alternative to inhibit  cell growth.

Since histone deacetylase inhibitors have been well-known to suppress  cell migration and invasion, we thus tested whether knockdown of delta-5-desaturase and DGLA treatment could also be used to inhibit  migration and invasion of  and pancreatic  cells. Wound healing assay, transwell assay and western blot were used to assess cell migration and invasion as well as the associated molecular mechanisms. Formation of threshold level of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  was quantified from COX-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation in the  cells that overexpress COX-2 and their delta-5-desaturases were knocked down by shRNA transfection. Our results showed that knockdown of delta-5-desaturase along with DGLA supplement not only significantly inhibited cell migration, but also improved the efficacies of 5-flurouracil and gemcitabine, two frontline chemotherapy drugs currently used in the treatment of  and pancreatic , respectively. The molecular mechanism behind these observations is that 8-hydroxyoctanoic  inhibits histone deacetylase, resulting in downregulation of  metastasis promotors, e.g., MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as upregulation of  metastasis suppressor, e.g. E-cadherin.

An emerging concept suggests that microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may help explain the relationship between walnut consumption and decreased colorectal neoplasia risk. Seven days after HT-29  cell injection, mice were randomized to either control or walnut diets for 25 days of diet treatment. Thirty samples of tumor and of omental adipose were analyzed to determine changes in lipid composition in each dietary group. In the tumors of the walnut-containing diet, we found significant increases in α-, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic and total omega-3 acids, and a decrease in arachidonic , as compared to the control diet. Final tumor size measured at sacrifice was negatively associated with percentage of total omega-3 fatty  composition (r=-0.641, P=.001). MicroRNA expression analysis of colorectal tumor tissue revealed decreased expression of miRNAs 1903, 467c and 3068 (P<.05) and increased expression of miRNA 297a* (P=.0059) in the walnut-treated group as compared to control diet. Our results indicate that changes in the miRNA expression profiles likely affect target gene transcripts involved in pathways of anti-inflammation, antivascularization, antiproliferation and apoptosis. We also demonstrate the incorporation of protective fatty acids into  epithelium of walnut-fed mice, which may independently alter miRNA expression profiles itself.

In order to address the questions above, we conducted in vitro studies and evaluated whether ALA may down-regulate malignant potential in human (HT29 and HCT116) and mouse (MCA38) colon cancer cell lines. We observed that treatment with 1-5 mM of ALA inhibits cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion in both human and mouse colon cancer cell lines. Interestingly, we observed that ALA did not decrease total colony numbers when compared to control. By contrast, we found that size of colony was significantly changed by ALA treatment when compared to control in all colon cancer cell lines.

The aim of this study was to investigate BRB-caused metabolite changes using the Apc(Min/+) mouse as a model of human colorectal cancer. Wild-type (WT) mice were fed control diet, and Apc(Min/+) mice were fed either control diet or control diet supplemented with 5% BRBs for 8 weeks. Colonic and intestinal polyp size and number were measured. A non-targeted metabolomic analysis was conducted on colonic mucosa, liver and fecal specimens. Eight weeks of BRB treatment significantly decreased intestinal and colonic polyp number and size in Apc(Min/+) mice. The apc gene mutation significantly changed 52 metabolites in colonic mucosa associated with increased amino  and decreased lipid metabolites, as well as 39 liver and 8 fecal metabolites. BRBs significantly reversed 23 apc-regulated metabolites, including 13 colonic mucosa, 8 liver and 2 fecal metabolites that were involved in amino , glutathione, lipid and nucleotide metabolism. Of these, changes in eight metabolites were linearly correlated with decreased colonic polyp number and size in BRB-treated Apc(Min/+) mice. Elevated levels of putrescine and linolenate in Apc(Min/+) mice were significantly decreased by BRBs. Ornithine decarboxylase expression, the key enzyme in putrescine generation, was fully suppressed by BRBs. These results suggest that BRBs produced beneficial effects against colonic adenoma development in Apc(Min/+) mice and modulated multiple metabolic pathways. The metabolite changes produced by BRBs might potentially reflect the BRB-mediated chemopreventive effects in colorectal cancer patients.© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.
